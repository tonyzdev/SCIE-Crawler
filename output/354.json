The most likely reason is that intensive insecticide use in horticulture in the 1970s and 1980s selected an insecticide resistant strain or strains. These then established in glasshouses across North America and spread from there to Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. 4 The international spread of the western flower thrips occurred predominantly by the movement of horticultural material, such as cuttings, seedlings and potted plants. Within Europe, an outward spread from the original outbreak in the Netherlands is discernible. The speed of spread was 229 ± 20 km/year. 5 The spread has not been restricted to glasshouses. The western flower thrips has established outdoors in areas with milder winters; for example, across the southern U.S.A., southern Europe and Australia. It also overwinters in some regions with colder winters. 6 Polyphagous phytophagous thrips have many factors predisposing them to become worldwide crop pests, particularly in glasshouses. Some other species that might spread in a similar way to the western flower thrips are listed.",

The identification and quantification of the pollination service provided by different taxa within the pollinator guild is a prerequisite for the successful establishment of nature conservation and crop management regimes. Wild bees and hoverflies are considered to be valuable pollinators in agricultural and natural systems. Although some information on pollination efficiency of individual pollinator species is available, comparative studies of both taxa at different densities are rare. In the present study, the efficiency of the solitary mason bee Osmia rufa and two hoverfly species ( Eristalis tenax and Episyrphus balteatus ) as pollinators of oilseed rape Brassica napus was examined in a standardized caged plant breeding regime. Honeybee Apis mellifera colonies were used as a reference pollinator taxon. Yield parameters responded differently to pollinator density and identity. Fruit set and number of seeds per pod increased with increasing pollinator density, although these were stronger in the mason bee than the hoverfly treatment. Weight per 1000 seeds did not respond to any pollinator treatment, indicating that seed quality was not affected. Oilseed rape yield in the highest tested densities of both pollinator taxa resulted in yield values close to the efficiency of small honeybee colonies. Hoverflies required approximately five‐fold densities of the red mason bees to reach a similar fruit set and yield. Thus, mason bees are more efficient in plant breeding and managed pollination systems. Both natural pollinator taxa, however, are of potential value in open and closed crop production systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 When searching for suitable hosts in flight, especially in mixed forests, conifer‐inhabiting bark beetles will encounter not only suitable host trees and their odours, but also unsuitable hosts and nonhost trees. Rejection of these trees could be based on an imbalance of certain host characteristics and/or a negative response to some nonhost stimuli, such as nonhost volatiles (NHV). 2 Recent electrophysiological and behavioural studies clearly indicate that conifer‐inhabiting bark beetles are not only able to recognize, but also to avoid, nonhost habitats or trees by olfactory means. Green leaf volatiles (GLV), especially C 6 ‐alcohols, from the leaves (and partly from bark) of nonhost angiosperm trees, may represent nonhost odour signals at the habitat level. Specific bark volatiles such as trans ‐conophthorin, C 8 ‐alcohols, and some aromatic compounds, may indicate nonhosts at the tree species level. Flying bark beetles are also capable of determining whether a possible host is unsuitable by reacting to signals from conspecifics or sympatric heterospecifics that indicate old or colonized host tree individuals. 3 Combined NHV signals in blends showed both redundancy and synergism in their inhibitory effects. The coexistence of redundancy and synergism in negative NHV signals may indicate different functional levels (nonhost habitats, species, and unsuitable hosts) in the host selection process. Combinations of NHV and verbenone significantly reduced the number of mass attacked host trees or logs on several economically important species (e.g. Dendroctonus ponderosae , Ips typographus, and I. sexdentatus ). 4 We suggest a semiochemical‐diversity hypothesis, based on the inhibition by NHV of bark beetle host‐location, which might partly explain the lower outbreak rates of forest insects in mixed forests. This ‘semiochemical‐diversity hypothesis’ would provide new support to the general ‘stability‐diversity hypothesis’. 5 Natural selection appears to have caused conifer‐inhabiting bark beetles to evolve several olfactory mechanisms for finding their hosts and avoiding unsuitable hosts and nonhost species. NHV and unsuitable host signals have potential for use in protecting trees from attack. The use of these signals may be facilitated by the fact that their combination has an active inhibition radius of several metres in trap test, and by the observation of area effects for several trees near inhibitor soruces in tree protection experiments. Furthermore, incorporation of negative signals (such as NHV and verbenone) and pheromone‐based mass‐trapping in a ‘push–pull’ fashion may significantly increase the options for control against outbreaks of conifer‐inhabiting bark beetles, especially in high risk areas.",

These populations were subjected to concentration–mortality bioassays using insecticide‐impregnated filter papers. 3 We were unable to obtain a single population which provided a susceptibility standard for all insecticides tested. Therefore, the resistance levels were estimated in relation to the most susceptible population to each insecticide. Resistance to abamectin and cartap were observed in all populations when compared with the susceptible standard population, with resistance ratios ranging from 5.2‐ to 9.4‐fold and from 2.2‐ to 21.9‐fold for abamectin and cartap, respectively. Resistance to permethrin was observed in five populations with resistance ratios ranging from 1.9‐ to 6.6‐fold, whereas resistance to methamidophos was observed in four populations with resistance ratios ranging from 2.6‐ to 4.2‐fold. 4 The long period and high frequency of use of these insecticides against this insect pest suggest that the evolution of insecticide resistance on them has been relatively slow. Alternatively, the phenomenon might be widespread among Brazilian populations of T. absoluta making the finding of suitable standard susceptible populations difficult and leading to an underestimation of the insecticide resistance levels in this pest. 5 Higher levels of resistance to abamectin, cartap and permethrin are correlated with greater use of these compounds by growers. This finding suggests that local variation in insecticide use was an important cause of variation in susceptibility.",

Current pest management techniques rely heavily on pesticides but trichome‐based host‐plant resistance may reduce pesticide use. 2 A review of the literature is provided on trichomes of wild Lycopersicon species and the effects of trichome‐based host‐plant resistance on arthropods. Solvents have been used to remove glandular trichome exudates and the resulting dimminution of their effects quantified. Correlational approaches to assess the relationship between the different trichome types and effects on pests have also been used. 3 Most studies have focused on Lepidoptera and Hemiptera, although some work has included Coleoptera, Diptera and Acarina, and both antibiotic and antixenotic effects have been demonstrated. 4 Natural enemies are a cornerstone of international pest management and this review discusses how the compatibility of this approach with trichome‐based host‐plant resistance is uncertain because of the reported negative effects of trichomes on one dipteran, one hemipteran and several Hymenoptera. 5 For trichome‐based host‐plant resistance to be utilized as a pest management tool, trichomes of wild species need to be introgressed into the cultivated tomato. Hybrids between the cultivated tomato and the wild species Lycopersicon hirsutum f. glabratum , Lycopersicon pennellii and Lycopersicon cheesmanii f . minor have been produced and useful levels of resistance to Acarina, Diptera and Hemiptera pests have been exhibited, although these effects may be tempered by effects on natural enemies. 6 This review proposes that studies on genetic links between fruit quality and resistance, field studies to determine the compatibility of natural enemies and trichome‐based host‐plant resistance, and a strong focus on L. cheesmanii f. minor , are all priorities for further research that will help realize the potential of this natural defence mechanism in pest management.",

    "abstract": "My office doesn't have a window. If it did, and I could look across campus, my view would be a mosaic of buildings, grass, trees, parking areas, a couple of small streams, and even a lake. There are oak trees with diverse Cynipid assemblages, a myriad of arthropods in the litter beneath the ornamental plantings, and abundant pollinators on the Hypericum that lines the path from my office to the library. There are also diesel-belching buses and some insane planner's nightmare of one-way roads and dead-end footpaths. As a microcosm of the world at large, our campus is a study in fragmentation. Areas of natural, semi-natural, and grossly artificial vegetation are divided and subdivided into patches of various sizes in various degrees of isolation. Boundaries abound. A demented four-year-old with Lego® could not create a three-dimensional architecture this complex. Yet within this fragmented landscape, insects persist in some abundance and diversity. As insect ecologists, we're obligated to understand the processes that influence the abundance, richness and diversity of insects in fragmented landscapes. As pest managers, we need to know how the architecture of landscapes influences pest population dynamics and their interactions with natural enemies and agents of control. As conservation biologists, we must develop strategies to maintain focal insect species, faunal diversity and the trophic interactions that drive key ecosystem processes. Whatever our entomological interests, landscape structure and habitat fragmentation have an influence on the ecology of the insects that we study. If space is the final frontier of ecological theory (Kareiva, 1994), then fragmentation of space is the warp engine that drives research in spatial ecology. Critical issues such as local extinction of bird populations (Renjifo, 2001; Robinson et al., 2001; Sekercioglu et al., 2002), declining densities of small mammals and herpetofauna (Maisonneuve & Rioux, 2001), declines in pollinator bees due to deforestation (Brown & Albrecht, 2001; Cane, 2001) and the management of landscapes for insect biodiversity (Ehrlich & Murphy, 1987; Samways, 1992; Thomas, 1995; Di Giulio et al., 2001) catch the imaginations of scientists and the public alike. There is a growing sense of urgency and awareness that understanding the role of habitat fragmentation in ecological processes is a prerequisite for sound science, policy and management. Whether the goal is to predict the presence and abundance of species in fragmented landscapes (Cowley et al., 2000), or to conserve species interactions and trophic structure (Fisher, 1998), the behavioural and dynamical responses of insects to landscape structure are key. The features of landscapes that influence the population and community ecology of species, including insects, are well known. The ratio of habitat edge to interior (Chen et al., 1995; Radeloff et al., 2000), the isolation of habitat fragments (Collinge, 2000), patch area (Kruess & Tscharntke, 2000), patch quality (Hunter et al., 1996; Kuussaari et al., 2000; Hanski & Singer, 2001), patch diversity (Gathmann et al., 1994; Varchola & Dunn, 2001) and microclimate (Braman et al., 2000) all contribute to determining the abundance and richness of insects on landscapes. More recently, ecologists have incorporated temporal changes in landscape structure (Solbreck, 1995; Onstad et al., 2001), genetic change in insect populations (Singer & Thomas, 1996; Ronce & Kirkpatrick, 2001), and differential responses of predators and prey (Kruess & Tscharntke, 1994; With et al., 2002) into their understanding of the spatial ecology of insects. Even with a growing awareness of the features of landscapes that contribute to variation in insect populations and communities, there remain clear gaps in our understanding of the links between landscape change and insect dynamics. Below, I describe some of the recent work that has explored these links and suggest some approaches for future work. Much can be learned about the impacts of fragmentation on insect populations by studying the movement of predators and prey among patch types in complex landscapes (Holland & Luff, 2000; Martin et al., 2001; With et al., 2002). Simple models assume that rates of movement are independent of landscape structure, typically assume constant movement rates whatever the landscape mosaic in question (Goodwin & Fahrig, 2002), and generally assume that dispersal is random (Conradt et al., 2001). In reality, movement rates can vary markedly among features of the landscape such as edges and boundaries, and simple diffusion models are unlikely to capture the movement of insects in fragmented habitats. For example, movement rates of the specialized goldenrod beetle, Trirhabda borealis, depend in part upon the patch structure of the environment within and among goldenrod fields (Goodwin & Fahrig, 2002). Similarly, the movement of carabid beetles within and among barley fields is reduced by the presence of hedgerows (Mauremooto et al., 1995). Although it is well established that field boundaries can act as reservoirs of predator populations, particularly those of carabid and staphylinid beetles (Andersen, 1997), the opposing effects of hedgerows on increasing predator densities and decreasing rates of movement may have complex effects upon prey densities. The apparent permeability of some habitat boundaries (Duelli et al., 1990) may be increased when beetles are hungry (Mauremooto et al., 1995), suggesting that the physiological state of individuals will influence their movement among landscape features. Of course, landscape features themselves can influence the physiological condition of insects, including carabid beetles (Oestman et al., 2001). It may be some time before we are able to incorporate 'insect health' into our understanding of landscape processes, but it is clear that the physiological condition of insects is both a product of landscape structure and a factor that influences responses to fragmentation. We need more studies that link insect physiology, landscape structure and rates of movement. Of course, nothing is simple and not all boundaries are created equal in time or space (Varchola & Dunn, 1999). Particularly in agricultural systems, boundaries can vary from complex strips of woodland, through hedgerows, to roads and simple grassy edges. Varchola & Dunn (2001) report that the relative effects of woody and grassy boundaries around agricultural fields on predatory beetle richness and activity vary depending upon the time of year. Woody edges appear to be important for over-wintering beetle populations, whereas later in the growing season grassy and woody edges are about equally important. However, corridors and boundaries around agricultural fields can actually increase the densities of pest species and cause reductions in yield. In soybean agroecosystems, fields surrounded by uncultivated corridors have been shown to support higher pest densities, to suffer higher levels of defoliation and to produce lower yields (Kemp & Barrett, 1989). Similarly, the diversity of herbivorous insects within alfalfa fields is positively related to the length of woody border surrounding fields (Holland & Fahrig, 2000). In other words, measuring the activity and richness of predator populations in field boundaries may not provide an adequate prediction of their impacts upon herbivores and the subsequent crop losses that fields may suffer. Boundary effects upon insect herbivores may be variable at least in part because edges may actually be more suitable habitat for some herbivores. For example, forest tent caterpillars feeding within stands of sugar maple perform better in habitat edges than in habitat interior (Fortin & Mauffette, 2001). Trees on the edge of forests appear to produce foliage with higher concentrations of nitrogen and soluble sugars, both of which are positively correlated with insect performance. As forest fragmentation proceeds, and the ratio of edge to interior rises, it is likely that the performance of forest tent caterpillars will improve. If conservation, rather than pest management, is the focus of your research, then there seems little doubt that complex boundaries among habitat types can act to increase insect diversity. For example, riparian buffer strips at the side of lakes and streams seem to concentrate flying insects. In comparison to intact forest, Whitaker et al. (2000) reported higher densities of flying insects in riparian buffer strips, possibly because the strips collect airborne insects by acting as windbreaks. Higher concentrations of flying insects are associated with higher densities of insectivorous birds. The matrix of unsuitable habitat between suitable habitat patches may have a profound influence on insect movement. In their studies of flea beetles, Aphthona, on leafy spurge, Jonsen et al. (2001) report that the quality of matrix habitat (grass vs. shrub) influences the ability of A. nigriscutis to colonize patches of host plant. Given that leafy spurge is a weed pest, colonization by its biological control agents is of significant economic concern. Movement patterns varied between beetle sexes and between congeneric beetles, suggesting that there may be no simple relationship between matrix quality and the effectiveness of the biological control agents (Jonsen et al., 2001). Variation among species in their responses to landscape structure and management practices seems to be a common feature of such studies (Banks, 1998; Zabel & Tscharntke, 1998; Braman et al., 2000; Collinge, 2000; Di Giulio et al., 2001). Studying the movement of particular species among isolated patches is important, but a critical question remains; can fine-scale movement behaviours be used to predict broad scale patterns of distribution on heterogeneous landscapes? According to Jonsen & Taylor (2000), the answer may be yes. In their studies of damselflies in the genus Calopteryx, they have developed simulation models in which fine-scale movement behaviours were useful in predicting landscape-level distributions. It is true that the models required incorporating information on the architecture of the landscape, but it is nonetheless reassuring that measurements of specific behaviours can lead to accurate predictions of distribution patterns. Specifically, the probability of crossing patch boundaries and the rates of movement within given habitat patches were important determinants of damselfly distributions. Within the genus Calopteryx, movement rates are related to the realized connectivity of different landscape features but differ among species within the genus (Pither & Taylor, 1998), demonstrating that connectivity is as much a feature of the biology of species as it is the structure of landscapes. This last point has also been made by Haslett (2001) in a study of Dipteran diversity at landscape scales. From the 'fly point of view' borders that we perceive may be neutral to some Diptera, and border complexity may be a more relevant metric. Given the importance of movement to the spatial ecology of insects, it should be no surprise that the size and physical arrangement of habitat patches on landscapes plays a fundamental role in determining the abundance and diversity of insect faunas. As in classic island biogeography theory (MacArthur & Wilson, 1967), patch area and patch isolation have often been associated with the richness of insect faunas (Kruess & Tscharntke, 1994; Steffan-Dewenter & Tscharntke, 2002). For example, Kruess & Tscharntke (2000) report that the species richness of seed-feeding insects on bush vetch (Vicia sepium) increase with the area of meadows that contain the host plant, and decrease with isolation of the patch. The real contribution of Tscharntke's group, however, has been to highlight the different spatial scales at which insect herbivores and natural enemies respond to patch structure. On bush vetch, the parasitoids of the seed-feeders suffered more from habitat loss and isolation than did their hosts. This suggests that the maintenance of higher trophic structure requires less fragmentation and isolation than does the maintenance of simple plant–insect assemblages (Kruess & Tscharntke, 2000). Similarly, in a study of herbivores and predators in patches of nettle plants, herbivore populations were affected primarily by patch area, whereas predator populations were affected primarily by patch isolation (Zabel & Tscharntke, 1998). The authors argue that maintaining connectivity is important to the maintenance of predator–prey interactions (Kruess & Tscharntke, 1994). In their study of Eucalyptus remnants in grazed landscapes, Abensperg-Traun & Smith (1999) reported that predatory species of arthropod generally required larger habitat patches than did arthropods at lower trophic levels. Their data generally support the view of Tscharntke's research group that predators are more vulnerable to fragmentation than are their prey. Ultimately, habitat fragmentation may lead to the truncation of food chains and the degradation of trophic structure. In old-growth forests in eastern Finland, for example, fragmentation reduces the richness of insect species associated with bracket fungi. Specifically, older fragments have a median food-chain length of one (only the fungus present), whereas large areas of old growth typically support food chains with three trophic levels (Komonen et al., 2000). In my view, the realization that food-chain length and trophic structure are so vulnerable to fragmentation is the most important lesson that we have learned from studying insects on complex landscapes. It has profound implications for many fields of ecology, evolutionary biology and management. Differential responses of predators and prey to landscape structure appear to hold when studies scale up to much larger areas. In a large-scale study of landscape structure and predator richness, Elliot et al. (1999) investigated the effects of landscape characteristics on the abundance and richness of predators of aphids in wheat fields in South Dakota. Using aerial photographs, they were able to demonstrate that increases in uncultivated land and increases in patchiness surrounding wheat fields were both associated with increasing abundance and richness in the predator communities within fields. Fragmentation, by decreasing the effectiveness of natural enemies, may therefore be associated with increases in the probability of insect outbreak. For example, the duration of forest tent caterpillar, Malacosoma disstria, outbreaks in Canada increases in response to forest fragmentation (Roland, 1993). Effects of fragmentation on both parasitoids (Roland & Taylor, 1997) and disease (Roland & Kaupp, 1995) have been implicated in their dynamics under landscape change. Finally, the age of habitat fragments may also influence both the occurrence of herbivores and their probability of parasitism (Athen & Tscharntke, 1999). Such age effects call for the inclusion of temporal patch structure into our understanding of insect ecology in fragmented habitats. Because this is ecology, exceptions do exist to the general relationships between patch area, patch isolation and species richness. For example, populations of pollinating bees seem much more attuned to the quality of patches than to their area or isolation (Gathmann et al., 1994; Tscharntke et al., 1998). In fact, for pollinators, management regimes that focus upon floral diversity appear to have a greater effect than those related to the arrangement of patches on the landscape, and the mobility of insect pollinators may make them less susceptible to fragmentation than some other insect groups (Cane, 2001). Nonetheless, concerns remain that fragmentation may adversely affect particular species of native pollinators. In Argentinean subtropical dry forest, for example, fragmentation reduces visitation by native bees but increases visitation by exotic honey bees (Aizen & Feinsinger, 1994). The perceived severity of fragmentation effects therefore depend upon whether the focus is on conservation of native species or on the ecosystem service of pollination. Finally, small and dispersed habitat fragments are known to increase beta diversity across some landscapes. Tscharntke et al. (2002) emphasize the importance of small habitat fragments for certain insect species and point out that, at least for some butterfly groups, small fragments support more species than do equivalent areas in large patches. For conservation purposes, they recommend a combination of large patches with scattered small fragments to maximize beta diversity. Given the effects of habitat fragmentation and isolation on predator–prey interactions, we might expect that landscape structure should play a role in the effectiveness of biological control. However, most recent studies of interactions between landscape features and pest management have focused upon habitat heterogeneity rather than area or isolation per se. For example, rates of parasitism of armyworm larvae are higher in complex agricultural landscapes than in simple landscapes (Marino & Landis, 1996). Similarly, parasitism of rape pollen beetles declines significantly with distance from field margins (Tscharntke et al., 2002). Complex landscapes may provide a diversity of basal resources that supplement populations of predators. This appears to occur in Indonesian rice fields, where the availability of detritus acts to supplement the food web and maintain high populations of generalist predators that suppress rice pests (Settle et al., 1996). Similarly, mulching of agricultural fields in southern Sweden has been shown to increase the densities of staphyilinid beetles (Raemert et al., 2001). However, relationships between pest damage and landscape structure are not simple. In some cases, there appear to be few changes in species richness along gradients of agricultural intensification (Burel et al., 1998) and, in at least one case, the richness of the insect community in agricultural fields actually increased with patch isolation (Fahrig & Jonsen, 1998). Some generalist spiders appear to exhibit preferences for agricultural habitat over less-disturbed habitat (Downie et al., 2000) and the degree of polyphagy of both predators and pests is likely to influence their response to changes in landscape structure (Jonsen & Fahrig, 1997). The bottom line is that complex landscapes beget complex interactions and it will require some clever manipulative experiments to untangle the often confounding effects of boundary quantity, boundary quality, matrix habitat, patch area and patch isolation on the biological control of insect pests. It has become a textbook paradigm that habitat corridors that connect isolated habitat patches will increase the abundance and diversity of species within those patches through increases in rates of immigration. How depressing, then, that there exist so few experimental studies in which both patch isolation and the presence of corridors have been manipulated to dissect their relative effects upon insect communities. In one such study (Collinge, 2000), the presence of corridors had relatively weak effects upon species loss and colonization of isolated patches by insects in native grassland. Weak effects of corridors on species richness were detected in medium-sized patches, but there were no overall effects upon rates of colonization. Critically, recolonization of patches by rare species was unaffected by the presence or absence of corridors. Variation in corridor effects among species and among years suggests that there exist few consistent effects of habitat corridors in this grassland system. Variability in the value of corridors seems to be a feature of the few careful studies that have been conducted. For example, in his exploration of movement by the butterfly Junonia coenia, Haddad (2000) reported that corridors promoted colonization of patches when butterflies were released at long distances from suitable habitat. At shorter distances, however, corridors were not effective at promoting colonization. Nonetheless, movement of butterflies among patches was significantly enhanced by the presence of corridors (Haddad, 1999a) and population densities were higher in connected patches than in isolated patches of similar area (Haddad & Baum, 1999). Haddad's (1999b) simulation models suggest that the movement behaviour of butterflies at patch-edge boundaries can be used to predict the effects of corridors on movement among patches. To be honest, there are simply too few experimental studies of corridor effects on insects to draw many conclusions at present. The only conclusion that I can draw is that we need to do more. Because of its focus upon the dynamics of single species occupying discrete patches of habitat, the concept of metapopulation dynamics has much to offer in studies of habitat fragmentation. Species living in highly fragmented landscapes often occur as metapopulations, in which local populations turn over quite frequently, but the metapopulation (the population of populations) tends to persist (Levins, 1969; Ehrlich & Murphy, 1987; Hanski, 1999). The rate of population turnover is generally related to factors such as population size and connectivity. However, patch quality may also be an important determinant of patch colonization and persistence (Hanski & Singer, 2001). For example, the Glanville fritillary butterfly, Melitaea cinxia, in Finland occurs in discrete habitat patches that contain two potential host-plant species, Plantago lanceolata and Veronica spicata (Kuussaari et al., 2000). The probability of an empty patch being colonized depends in part upon the perceived quality of that patch by ovipositing female butterflies. Colonization rates increase when surrounding patches contain butterflies that have experienced similar host-plant composition, suggesting that the prior experience of local butterflies influences their perception of habitat quality and their probability of colonizing a new patch (Hanski & Singer, 2001). Patch quality can also influence emigration rates. For example, emigration of the frugivorous butterfly, Hamadryas februa, from islands in Venezuela has been linked to the availability of suitable host-plant species (Shahabuddin et al., 2000). The incorporation of patch quality and female preference into studies of metapopulations represents a significant advance in the field and adds a level of reality to dynamics that was missing in earlier metapopulation studies (Hunter et al., 1996, 2000). Of course, issues of patch quality are central to complementary theories of insect population dynamics in fragmented landscapes, such as theories of source–sink dynamics (Pulliam, 1988). Source–sink dynamics are based upon high quality patches (births exceed deaths, emigration exceeds immigration) supporting populations in low quality patches (deaths exceed births, immigration exceeds emigration), so extending the distribution of organisms in space. As Boughton (1999) has pointed out, changes in patch quality and in rates of movement can result in interesting reversals in the status of sources and sinks. In other words, by focusing upon the quality of patches and the net movement of organisms, source–sink theory is sufficiently robust to incorporate the temporal changes in landscape structure that characterize our changing world. Using metapopulation or source–sink concepts, pest managers may be able to manipulate patch structure in time and space to influence the dynamics of pest species (Ives & Settle, 1997). Given their current place in conservation biology, it is ironic that metapopulation models were developed originally for pest management rather than species conservation (Levins, 1969). Uses of metapopulation theory in the arrangement of crop patches and in the timing of crop rotations have yet to realize their potential in pest management, perhaps because of the necessity of region-wide cooperation in the placement and rotation of crops (Helenius, 1997). Moreover, there exists potential conflict between metapopulation strategies that aim to reduce pest populations and those that aim to increase predator populations (Ives & Settle, 1997). The form and value of habitat patches in complex landscapes can vary dramatically over time (Solbreck, 1995), yet we know relatively little about the effects of temporal changes in spatial structure on insect populations. Much of what we do know about temporal effects of landscape change comes from studies of insect pests and predators under crop rotation. Crop rotation has traditionally been effective in reducing the damage by insect pests to particular crops. However, Onstad et al. (2001) have shown that frequent rotation may select for behavioural changes that ameliorate the negative impacts of landscape change on insect dynamics. Depending upon the diversity of the landscape and the frequency of rotation, selection may act to change patterns of movement or feeding preferences that mitigate the effects of landscape change. There is little doubt that adaptation is a pervasive evolutionary response to changing landscape features (Singer & Thomas, 1996). As Ronce & Kirkpatrick (2001) point out, even small changes in connectivity between two habitats can result in a 'migrational meltdown', during which population sizes drop and specialization on a single habitat-type evolves. Their models of the evolution of habitat generalists and habitat specialists suggest that migration rates, and hence connectivity, are critical to evolutionary change in heterogeneous landscapes (Ronce & Kirkpatrick, 2001) and may explain some patterns of genetic variation among insect populations in space (Kuussaari et al., 2000; Wilcock et al., 2001). Lack of movement and increasing specialization in local habitat patches has been implicated as a cause of inbreeding depression in some butterfly metapopulations (Haikola et al., 2001). There is even evidence that fragmentation can select for variation in dispersal abilities within species. For example, wing lengths, wing widths and thoracic weights of the forest damselfly Calopteryx maculata vary between populations along forested streams and those along streams through pastures (Taylor & Merriam, 1995). Selection appears to have increased flight ability within populations in fragmented pasture habitats. In fact, selection for strong dispersal ability, whatever its cause, is likely to reduce the impact of fragmentation upon the dynamics of insect species. The dynamics of some grass-feeding insects, for example, are dominated by the ephemeral availability of new grass shoots, and their dispersal abilities reflect the necessity of finding resources that vary markedly in space and time. As a consequence, their populations appear to be less affected by habitat fragmentation that those of some other herbivores (Dubbert et al., 1998). I have already mentioned a few areas of research that would benefit from further work, including an accurate assessment of corridor effects on insects (Collinge, 2000; Haddad, 2000), and the development of links among insect physiology, rates of movement and landscape structure. There are many others. First, it would be worthwhile to develop some rigorous and standard descriptions of both the processes of landscape change and the structures that result. The development of landscape mosaics is actually more complicated than the simple processes of fragmentation or change in land use. Collinge & Forman (1998) suggest that there are at least four processes that contribute to the generation of landscape mosaics; shrinkage, bisection, fragmentation and perforation. By subdividing mosaic formation in this way, Collinge & Forman (1998) were able to show that, in grassland habitats, shrinkage results in a decline in insect species richness, whereas fragmentation actually increases species richness. Whatever 'taxonomy' of landscape structure that we develop, a common language and standard methods would go far in promoting synthesis among disparate studies (Duelli et al., 1999). Second, we need to strike a balance between correlative and mechanistic approaches. Manipulative experiments are ideal for studying patterns of movement and other critical population rates at local scales. They are invaluable for understanding the complexities of mosaic formation and dissecting out covariation among landscape traits (Banks, 1998; Collinge & Forman, 1998; Golden & Crist, 2000). However, we also need more emphasis on research at larger spatial scales (Steffan-Dewenter & Tscharntke, 2002), which will undoubtedly rely in part on correlations and modelling. By combining both experimental approaches at local scales and correlative approaches across larger scales, it may be possible to explain some of the inconsistencies that occur in the literature. For example, populations of jack pine budworm (Choristoneura pinus pinus) are positively correlated with the density of habitat edge during population increase, but negatively correlated with the same landscape feature during population decrease (Radeloff et al., 2000). This contradictory result will only be explained by studies of mechanism at the local level. Third, we need to make much more use of the historical data that are available to us. Both amateur and professional entomologists have generated a plethora of records on the distribution and abundance of species over many decades of collecting. In combination with historical records of land use change, such data should provide us with considerable insight into how past landscape change has influenced our current insect fauna and how future change may affect it further. Using insect fossils, we can delve back even further and explore the fascinating long-term changes in insect fauna recorded in the fossil record (Schwert, 1996). For example, in north-eastern Iowa, the beetle fauna prior to Euro-American settlement was characterized by a diverse assemblage of carabids (terrestrial) and elmids (aquatic). After settlement and intensive cultivation, the dominant fauna has been replaced by weed and crop weevils and by dung beetles, with degradation of the aquatic elmids. The changes in north-eastern Iowa parallel changes in British sites during the late Bronze age where, 2100 years ago, insect faunas were affected by the transformation of natural landscapes to agrarian use (Schwert, 1996). Finally, we need to explore in much greater detail the effects of landscape change and habitat fragmentation on ecological interactions. We have learned a considerable amount by studying landscape effects on the abundance of species and the richness of communities. However, the most profound effects of habitat fragmentation may result from changes in interactions among species. For example, the loss of keystone species in communities may result in cascading effects through trophic webs that ultimately influence ecosystem processes (Tscharntke, 1992; Didham et al., 1996; Fisher, 1998; Komonen et al., 2000; Gibbs & Stanton, 2001). We need to know the general effects that losses in insect biomass have on higher trophic levels such as insectivorous birds (Van Wilgenburg et al., 2001). We need to explore the interactive effects of multiple environmental changes such as global warming (Hill et al., 1999) or species invasions (Toft et al., 2001) along with habitat fragmentation. Invasion by the weed Tradescantia fluminensis into fragmented forests in New Zealand has caused a decline in fungus fly and beetle diversity in the forest understory (Toft et al., 2001), presumably because of replacement of the natural forest flora. This is a clear example of two interacting factors − fragmentation and the invasion of exotics − influencing trophic dynamics within forests. Insects dwell within complex ecosystems and interact with other taxonomic groups and the abiotic environment. The true effects of landscape change and fragmentation upon the ecology of insects will only be understood by embracing the ecological complexity that characterizes the world within which insects live. I thank the National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-9906366) for supporting our work on habitat gradients and the population dynamics of insect herbivores.",

We review the taxonomy, distribution, basic biology, behaviour, ecology and management of endemic and exotic Anoplophora glabripennis , including information that is available in the extensive Chinese literature. This species has caused massive mortality of Populus species in China and models have demonstrated that it could become established in many locations worldwide. Anoplophora glabripennis is polyphagous but prefers Acer , Salix and Populus , section Aigeiros . Although A. glabripennis adults do not disperse far when surrounded by host trees, they have the potential to fly more than 2000 m in a season. Volatile organic compounds from preferred host trees are attractive to A. glabripennis and this attraction is heightened by drought stress. Males and females orientate to a volatile released by female A. glabripennis and males attempt to copulate after contacting a sex pheromone on the female cuticle. At present, A. glabripennis is being (or has been) eradicated from areas where it has been introduced. After detection, extensive surveys are conducted and, if breeding populations are detected, at the very least, infested trees are removed and destroyed. Close attention is paid to imported solid wood packaging material to prevent new introductions. Standard practice to control A. glabripennis in China is to spray insecticides in tree canopies. In North America, largely as a preventative measure, systemic insecticides are injected into trees. Entomopathogenic fungi have been developed for the control of A. glabripennis , and entomopathogenic nematodes, coleopteran and hymenopteran parasitoids and predatory woodpeckers have been investigated as biocontrol agents. Ecological control of A. glabripennis in China involves planting mixtures of preferred and nonpreferred tree species, and this practice can successfully prevent outbreaks.",

Factors affecting the initiation and maintenance of wireworm populations in individual fields also require further study. The current use of insecticides could also be optimized by a better appreciation of the interactions between insecticide use, potato variety choice and harvest dates.",

Southern pine beetle Dendroctonus frontalis and mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae undergo regional outbreaks that result in large‐scale disturbances to pine forests in the south‐eastern and western United States, respectively. Our objective was to investigate potential range shifts under climate change of outbreak areas for both bark beetle species and the areas of occurrence of the forest types susceptible to them. To project range changes, we used discriminant function models that incorporated climatic variables. Models to project bark beetle ranges employed changed forest distributions as well as changes in climatic variables. Projected outbreak areas for southern pine beetle increased with higher temperatures and generally shifted northward, as did the distributions of the southern pine forests. Projected outbreak areas for mountain pine beetle decreased with increasing temperature and shifted toward higher elevation. That trend was mirrored in the projected distributions of pine forests in the region of the western U.S. encompassed by the study. Projected outbreak areas for the two bark beetle species and the area of occurrence of western pine forests increased with more precipitation and decreased with less precipitation, whereas the area of occurrence of southern pine forests decreased slightly with increasing precipitation. Predicted shifts of outbreak ranges for both bark beetle species followed general expectations for the effects of global climate change and reflected the underlying long‐term distributional shifts of their host forests.",

    "abstract": "Data from diverse ecosystems indicate that more than 50% of net primary production is commonly allocated to below-ground plant parts (Coleman, 1976), and values for particular plant species approach 90% (Andersen, 1987). Root biomass can typically vary from under 300 g/m2 to over 4000 g/m2 of soil surface (Rickleffs, 1973) and, however, you look at it, that's a lot of biomass. Although the nutritional value of root tissue is generally lower than that of foliar tissue, we shouldn't be surprised that many species of herbivore, including insects, exploit the roots of plants. What is surprising, however, is the extreme paucity of information on the distribution, abundance and effects of root-feeding insects on plants in natural and managed systems. If we as entomologists were to use our peer-reviewed literature as an indication of the relative allocation by plants to foliage and roots, we would get a shockingly biased picture. Over the last 5 years, for example, Ecological Entomology (5 years) and Agricultural and Forest Entomology (1 year) have published a combined four articles on root-feeding insects in comparison to 288 articles on insects that feed on above-ground plant parts. With this apparent bias in effort, it's little wonder that even basic information on the distribution and abundance of root-feeding insects is missing for most ecosystems (Morón-Ríos et al. 1997). Yet below-ground insect herbivores are known to influence the diversity of plant communities, the rate and direction of succession, competitive interactions among plants, their allocation to different functions, the susceptibility of plants to other herbivores and pathogens and, ultimately, the yield of agricultural and forest systems (below). This paper considers what we do know about the effects of root-feeding insects on plants, and where our major knowledge gaps remain. Its intent is to stimulate discussion and an increase in research efforts on the ecology and management of below-ground insect herbivores. For purposes of brevity, 'root-feeding' is used here as shorthand for consumption of all below-ground tissues, including roots, rhizomes and other storage organs. Removal of root tissue by insect herbivores can result in a diversity of responses in their host plants, varying from changes in root : shoot ratios, through changes in subsequent carbon and nitrogen allocation, to death of the plants. Of course, the effects of root herbivory on plants are not restricted to loss of root tissue. In mixed-grass prairie, for example, root-feeding can reduce annual net primary productivity by 16 times more than is actually consumed (Ingham & Detling, 1990). In both agricultural (Latin & Reed, 1985) and forest (Klepzig et al. 1996) systems, root-feeding insects can introduce plant pathogens that affect survival and yield. There is no clear consensus as to whether loss of biomass from root or shoot tissue has the greatest deleterious effects on plant performance but, in at least one study, removal of root tissue had a greater effect on plant performance than did removal of shoot tissue (Reichman & Smith, 1991). Root herbivores may cause losses in protein from the tap root, a reduction in non-structural carbohydrate root reserves and, subsequently, plant mortality (Godfrey et al. 1987; Dintenfass & Brown, 1988a,1b). However, plants infested by root-feeding insects may also exhibit increases in root nitrogen content and a concomitant reduction in foliar N content, reflecting a redirection of nitrogen to the stronger sink (Steinger & Müller-Schärer, 1992). It would seem important that future studies direct attention to whether differences in experimental results (i.e. increases or decreases in root nitrogen content) reflect differences in the plants under study, the identity of the root herbivores, or other ecological variables. This is the kind of basic information that is still lacking. It seems likely, however, that lumping all root-feeding insects together into a single functional group and expecting them to have similar effects on their host plants may be a considerable oversimplification. In the same way that plants respond differentially to attack by different species or guilds of insect herbivores above ground (Hunter, 2000a) so we should expect differential effects of below-ground herbivores on plant performance. This was aptly demonstrated by Steinger & Müller-Schärer, (1992), who found that root-feeding by the moth Agapeta zoegana on Centaurea maculosa seedlings had no effect on shoot or root mass. By contrast, feeding by the weevil Cyphocleomus achates on the same plant greatly reduced shoot biomass. At least some plants can tolerate significant levels of root herbivory, even under water stress (Dunn & Frommelt, 1998), with compensatory growth replacing root biomass (Schmid et al. 1990). In legumes, there can be compensation for nodule damage by insect herbivores (Quinn & Hall, 1992), although the compensatory mechanisms may be insufficient to prevent reductions in the nitrogen concentrations of tissue. In the legume Medicago sativa, compensatory responses are strong and denodulated plants recover nodule number and nodule biomass within 15 and 22 days, respectively (Quinn & Hall, 1996). Indeed, many plants appear to be adept at re-growing lost root tissue and, as a side note, this may lead us to underestimate the impacts of below-ground herbivores. However, compensation for root loss is not without cost and compensatory root growth in response to below-ground herbivory may often occur at the expense of above-ground net primary production (Andersen, 1987). Losses in above-ground biomass appear to be a common response to root damage by insects. For example, root herbivory on white clover by Sitona flavescens reduces foliar biomass, total nitrogen and carbon contents, and impairs nitrogen fixation (Murray et al. 1996). Likewise, feeding by Cerotoma arcuata larvae on bean roots and nodules reduces plant growth and subsequent yield (Teixeira et al. 1996). As Goldson et al. (1988) point out, compensation is associated with increased respiration rates and depleted carbohydrate reserves within the plant as assimilates from shoot reserves are diverted to satisfy the increased demands of the root system. Moreover, even when vegetative recovery seems to be high, compensation for root damage does not necessarily mean that subsequent reproductive output, competitive ability and nutrient or water uptake will be as high as those of undamaged plants (Detling et al. 1980). At least some of the deleterious effects on plants of root damage are likely to be expressed indirectly through interactions with other organisms and the environment (see below). Given that compensatory root growth may lead us to underestimate the densities and activities of root-feeding insects, we may be most likely to recognize their effects post mortem. For example, root-feeding insects are associated with pine seedling mortality in the south-eastern United States (Mitchell et al. 1991) and Eucalyptus seedling mortality in plantations in India (Nair & Varma, 1985). In a spectacular example, ghost moth caterpillars can cause up to 41% mortality in bush lupine stands in California (Strong et al. 1995) and appear to contribute to the long-term dynamics of lupine populations. However, entomopathogenic nematodes can greatly reduce populations of ghost moth caterpillars and the ultimate effect of root-feeding on bush lupine populations probably reflects complex interactions among many ecological players (Strong et al. 1996, 1999). Interestingly, the fecundity of bush lupines can take 3 years to respond to suppression of below-ground herbivory (Maron, 1998), suggesting that short-term experiments may again underestimate the impact of root-feeding insects on plant populations. Unless root-feeding insects cause substantial crop mortality, or directly attack plant parts that are harvested for economic gain, their impacts on financial yield can be difficult to assess. Nonetheless, some root-feeding insects have been shown to have dramatic effects upon production systems. During the 1990s, black pine weevil, Otiorhynchus sulcatus, progressively became the most serious pest in European ornamental nursery stock and soft fruit production (Labuschagne, 1999). Larvae feed on both roots and crown and the devastating nature of the pest means that the threshold for control may be very low. Its pest status is exacerbated by life-history traits that include a wide range of alternative hosts (weeds and non-crop plants) and a fecundity of between 500 and 1200 eggs per female per season. Like many root-feeding pests, O. sulcatus is difficult to detect during the early stages of outbreak and its densities are hard to monitor. They are also difficult to detect before or during the transportation of soil or nursery stock. Nodule-feeding insects that attack nitrogen-fixing legumes can also be serious pests. Although well-recognized as pests of pulse crops such as peas and beans (O'Keefe et al. 1984), they can also cause economic problems in other production systems. For example, low input grassland systems managed for grazing usually require nitrogen-fixing legumes such as clover (Murray & Clements, 1999) that are useful both as a nitrogen source for the soil and as forage for livestock. Many agricultural soils are also enriched by the planting of legumes as 'green manure' (P. F. Hendrix, personal communication). Weevils in the genus Sitona seem to be particularly important pests in such systems as a consequence of nodule feeding by young larvae and root-feeding by older larvae. In fact, Sitona lineatus, distributed throughout Europe and in the western United States, is responsible for serious losses in yield to both edible legumes and forage legumes (Jackson, 1920; Oschmann, 1984). Again, estimates of yield losses may often be underestimated because of the difficulties associated with measuring damage by larvae. In addition to such well-known pests as corn rootworm and cabbage root fly, root-feeding insects influence many other production systems. These include the turf grass industry, where both yield and aesthetic quality affect economic value (Crutchfield & Potter, 1995), and apple, orchards where root-feeding aphids can reduce tree growth and the number and weight of fruit per tree (Brown et al. 1995). Given the ability of some below-ground herbivores to depress plant growth and reproduction, it is not surprising that they are often evaluated as potential biological control agents of weed pests (Müller-Schärer, 1991; Blossey, 1993; Sheppard et al. 1995; Harris & Clapperton, 1997; Schwarzlaender, 1997). In a well-studied example, control of Senecio jacobaea in California has been maintained over the long-term by the combined activities of a defoliating moth and a root-feeding flea beetle (Pemberton & Turner, 1990). Control of root-feeding insects in production systems is hampered, in part, by the difficulties of detection and access. Simply put, it is difficult to know when intervention is required and even more difficult to target a substantial proportion of the pest population with the chosen method of control. Some measure of success against the black pine weevil has been achieved using glue-coated barriers and trap cropping with favoured plant species (Labuschagne, 1999). Biological control of this and other root pests using entomopathogenic nematodes may provide the most promise (Kakouli et al. 1997), given that they may be specific to the pest and can be applied through a variety of measures including irrigation systems. Entomopathogenic nematodes also appear to be important mortality agents in some natural systems (Strong et al. 1996, 1999), suggesting that their life-histories are well-suited for exploitation as agents of control. The jury is still out on the effectiveness of general predators as biological control agents of root-feeding insects. Carabid ground beetles would appear to have significant potential as control agents, but their reported impact on pests such as the cabbage root fly (Hughes, 1959; Coaker & Williams, 1963) may have been overestimated (Finch & Elliot, 1999). Recent studies have indicated that the efficacy of beetle predators is directly related to the relative size of beetle and prey (Finch, 1996), which may aid in the selection of potential control agents. As studies by Finch & Elliott, (1999) make clear, beetle predators are much more effective when the life stages of the pest are directly accessible on the soil surface, and even thin layers of soil covering the prey items can prevent the successful suppression of prey populations. Of course, selection of appropriate generalist predators for biological control is predicated upon knowing what they consume and in what proportion. Prey-specific monoclonal antibodies appear to have considerable potential as indicators of diet breadth in generalists such as carabids (Harwood et al. 1999; Symondson & Glen, 1999). Once again, however, we are limited by a basic lack of knowledge of both pest and predator ecology. Chemical control of root-feeding insects has been the most common intervention strategy. However, there are concerns with the safety of commonly used products such as Chlorpyrifos (Dursban), which provides only a few weeks of control in its standard formulation. The extended release formulation of Chlorpyrifos (suScon Green) lasts longer in the environment, but is more expensive and less likely to come into contact with individual root pests. Both formulations can kill natural enemies and other soil fauna. Given that Bt-transgenic corn can release biologically active Bt into the rhizosphere in root exudates (Saxena et al. 1999), there exists the potential to develop transgenic crops modified specifically to defend themselves against root-feeding insects. Of course, the continuing controversy surrounding the development and use of genetically modified crops (Hunter, 2000b) may limit the exploitation of transgenic plants for use against root-feeding insects. Such crops would, however, solve the problem of access by ensuring contact between pest populations and the mechanism of control. Cultural control methods also have potential to reduce economic losses imposed by below-ground insect herbivores (Potter et al. 1996). For example, seasonal draining of rice fields can reduce oviposition by rice water weevil (Hesler et al. 1992). Likewise, traditional plant breeding programmes may be able to select for crops that are either tolerant or resistant to damage by root-feeding insects. In one of the few studies to address the issue, Houle & Simard 1996) found that compensatory responses (tolerance) of willow plants to simulated root herbivory did not vary among willow genotypes. The apparent lack of genetic variation in tolerance to root herbivory requires further investigation, given that genetic variation for resistance has been observed in several other systems (Powell et al. 1983; Byers et al. 1996; Strong et al. 1996). Indeed, the entire issue of genetically based resistance and tolerance to below-ground herbivores requires much more exploration in combination with mechanistic studies of root defence. One of the most striking gaps in our understanding of below-ground herbivory is the degree to which below-ground structures (roots, rhizomes, etc.) gain protection from herbivory through chemical defence. There is little doubt that some below-ground plant organs contain high concentrations of toxins (e.g. the potent alkaloids in the rhizomes of bloodroot, Sanguinaria canadensis). However, the standard bioassays and measurements of insect performance, so prevalent in studies of above-ground insect herbivory, are generally lacking in below-ground systems. For example, although the presence of phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites in some plant roots is well established (Graham, 1991), their effects on insect herbivores have received little attention. Likewise, fine roots of forest trees often contain astringent phenolics and their concentrations generally increase as soil fertility declines (Muller et al. 1989). However, the degree to which astringent phenolics deter root-feeding insects is presently unclear. Studies of defence induction in roots are also in their infancy. Although both synthesis and concentrations of some plant defences are known to be high in roots (Baldwin, 1989; Tallamy & McCloud, 1991), comparatively little work has examined the effects of induced defences in roots on root-feeding insects. The few studies to date suggest that, as in above-ground tissues, defence induction in roots may be a common phenomenon. Grape (Vitis vinifera) roots can respond to attack by Phylloxera vastatrix aphids by producing a local necrotic zone around each aphid that isolates attackers from healthy tissue (Karban & Baldwin, 1997). Roots of wild parsnip, Pastinaca sativa, respond to damage by increases in their concentrations of furanocoumarins (Zangerl & Rutledge, 1996). In a compelling example, damage to spinach roots induces phytoecdysteroids (analogues of insect moulting hormones), whereas infection by fungal pathogens does not (Schmelz et al. 1998, 1999). Given that foliar concentrations of phytoecdysteroids are unaffected by root damage, this provides evidence of an evolved defence in spinach roots directed at below-ground insect herbivores. However, the effects of insect herbivores on the induction of defences in roots may be complex. For example, damage by turnip root fly, Delia floralis, causes a linear increase in only one of 14 glucosinolates in swede roots. An apparent balance between increases in aromatic glucosinolates and decreases in aliphatic glucosinolates results in overall glucosinolate concentration being unaffected by root damage (Hopkins et al. 1998). There are, of course, methodological difficulties associated with assessing putative chemical defences and their effects on insect herbivores below ground. In vitro root culture techniques may prove useful in future studies of root defence against herbivores (Wu et al. 1999). It would be naïve to expect that interactions between root-feeding insects and their host plants occur in isolation from other species in the community or are unaffected by interactions with the abiotic environment. Below-ground insect herbivores are members of complex food webs and participate in both community-level and ecosystem-level processes. Consequently, both biotic and abiotic forces interact with below-ground herbivory to dictate plant performance (Godfrey & Yeargan, 1985). For example, the effects of root-feeding on Vicia establishment vary with both soil fertility and levels of mycorrhizal infection (Ganade & Brown, 1997). Likewise, compensation by Centaurea maculosa for weevil herbivory on its roots is greatly compromised by nutrient deficiency (Steinger & Müller-Schärer (1992). In a fascinating multi-trophic interaction, fungal endophytes (Acremonium spp.) associated with fescue grasses increase the susceptibility of root-feeding Japanese beetle larvae to the entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Grewal et al. 1995). Competition among plants can overwhelm the effect of root herbivory in some systems (Müller-Schärer, 1991), but not in others (Noetzold et al. 1997). It seems likely then that interactions among root feeding and other ecological factors will prove to be complex and context-dependent in many systems. Studies by Val Brown and colleagues have been instrumental in highlighting the effects of below-ground herbivores on plant diversity. At the community level, insect herbivory below ground can reduce plant species richness and alter patterns of succession in European old fields (Brown & Gange, 1989). Specifically, root-feeding insects can accelerate succession by reducing forb persistence and colonization (Brown & Gange, 1992) with the application of soil insecticide increasing plant species richness, vegetative cover and plant size (Masters & Brown, 1997). In short-grass prairie, even infrequent outbreaks of insect herbivores below ground can have long-term effects on plant community dynamics and recovery from disturbance (Coffin et al. 1998). Of course, the effects of below-ground herbivory on plant biomass and species diversity can vary both seasonally and with the plant species under investigation (Wardle & Barker, 1997). At the ecosystem level, low levels of below-ground herbivory can increase nitrogen flux from plants to soil, increase soil microbial activity, and increase the rates of nitrogen recycling in grassland ecosystems (Bardgett et al. 1999). In tallgrass prairie, the emergence of annual cicadas can represent a significant flux of non-gaseous nitrogen from below-to above-ground (Callaham et al. 2000). Mycorrhizae, as a result of their intimate associations with root systems, may influence feeding by below-ground herbivores by changing the quality or the quantity of root resources (Gange, 1999). If studies of root–insect herbivore interactions are relatively rare, those that consider mycorrhizae are positively endangered! The data that do exist suggest that colonization of plant roots by arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) has a negative impact on root-feeding insects. For example, Gange et al. (1994) demonstrated that the survival and biomass of black pine weevil larvae feeding on the roots of Taraxacum officinale were halved by the presence of the mycorrhizal fungus Glomus mosseae. When Gange (1996) repeated the experiment using strawberry as a host-plant, root colonization by a single species of AM again reduced the performance of weevil larvae. However, when roots were colonized by two AM species simultaneously, the negative effects on the root-feeding insect disappeared. Extrapolating from a single study is dangerous, but it suggests that any resistance factor(s) conferred on roots by their association with mycorrhizae may be compromised if multiple infection takes place. Given that mycorrhizal colonization generally increases the biomass of roots (Smith & Read, 1997), their putative effects upon root resistance to herbivores is more likely to be mediated by changes in root quality than root quantity (Gange, 1999). As studies of below-ground herbivory become more common, complex interactions among community members both above- and below-ground are likely to emerge. For example, foliage removal by a leaf-chewing insects can result in reduced mycorrhizal colonization of plant roots (Gehring & Whitham, 1991; Gange & Bower, 1997). Given that mycorrhizal colonization can confer resistance to root feeders (Gange et al. 1994; Gange, 1996), above-ground defoliation has the potential to increase the susceptibility of roots to their herbivores. However, most studies seem to suggest that the opposite is true; stem- and leaf-feeding insects appear to reduce the performance of root-feeding insects. For example, Moran & Whitham, (1990) demonstrated that leaf galling by aphids on Chenopodium can lead to a large reduction in the populations of root-feeding aphids. Conversely, below-ground damage by insect herbivores is generally thought to increase the quality of plant tissues for above-ground herbivores (Gange & Brown, 1989; Masters et al. 1993). These complex interactions between below- and above-ground herbivores are potentially very important. When we observe high densities of insect herbivores feeding upon the leaves and shoots of our agricultural and timber crops, we rarely consider the possibility that the severity of their depredations may result, in part, from high densities of root-feeding insects. Likewise, yield increases following the successful control of above-ground insect pests may be compromised by subsequent increases in the densities of root-feeding herbivores. It may be early to speak of generalities when so few data are available, but the current consensus appears to be that the patterns described by Moran & Whitham, (1990) and Gange & Brown, (1989) may be common; above-ground herbivory has a negative effect on root-feeders, whereas below-ground herbivory has a positive effect on foliar feeders (Masters et al. 1993; Masters, 1999). The evidence for such contramensal interactions (Arthur & Mitchell, 1989) comes from both laboratory and field studies. For example, root-feeding aphid populations on Cardamine are significantly reduced in the presence of shoot-feeding aphids (Salt et al. 1996). Similarly, the growth rates of chafer larvae feeding upon the roots of Sonchus oleraceus are reduced when leaves are concurrently mined by Agromyzid larvae (Masters & Brown, 1992). By contrast, the pupal weights of leaf miners are higher in the presence of chafers. Other guilds of above-ground herbivores (leaf-chewers, phloem-feeders) also respond positively to chafer damage in this system (Masters, 1999) while simultaneously depressing chafer growth rates. Field experiments employing soil insecticides (Masters, 1995b; Masters & Brown, 1997) and artificial root damage (Foggo & Speight, 1993; Foggo et al. 1994) support the view that below-ground herbivores facilitate population growth of insect herbivores above ground. Interactions between above- and below-ground herbivores appear to be mediated primarily by increases in soluble nitrogen and sugar contents in above-ground tissues (root-feeders increase foliage quality) and decreases in root biomass below-ground (aerial herbivores depress root growth) (Holland & Detling, 1990; Masters, 1995a). More detailed investigations of mechanism are, however, desperately needed in such systems, including the potential induction or suppression of defences (Seastedt et al. 1988; Karban & Baldwin, 1997) and the signalling pathways responsible for both defensive and 'civilian' plant responses to damage (Hunter, 2000a). Such investigations may help to explain why some studies do not conform to established patterns. For example, above-ground grazing by vertebrates can increase the densities of root-feeding insects (Roberts & Morton, 1985; Seastedt et al. 1988), and artificial defoliation of bunchgrass, Muhlenbergia quadridentata, has no effect on root-feeding Phyllophaga larvae in Mexico (Morón-Ríos et al. 1997). Given the importance of damage-specific signal cascades to the defensive response of plants (Hunter, 2000a), we should not be surprised that vertebrate grazing, artificial damage and foliar-feeding insects generate different responses by plants and their below-ground herbivores. In terms of relative biomass and productivity, below-ground plant parts represent a substantial fraction of the resources available to terrestrial herbivores. In terms of relative effort by insect ecologists, root-feeding insects have been greatly understudied. There are several areas of endeavour that would appear to require considerable work. First, we need detailed mechanistic studies of root defences. How variable are the physical and chemical defences of roots? Do they have a significant impact upon the populations of root-feeding insects? What signalling pathways are expressed during the induction of root defences and how are they affected by environmental variables? Second, we need to explore genetic variation in the tolerance and resistance of plant roots to their insect herbivores. An understanding of that genetic variation, and the role of the environment in its expression, will allow us to better comprehend the evolution of root defences and the potential to select for resistant and tolerant crop varieties. Third, we should explore the potential of genetically modified crops with tissue-specific root defences against root-feeding insects. Problems of applying control measures below ground may make transgenic plants a suitable option for reducing the depredations of below-ground crop pests. Of course, a detailed understanding of rhizosphere ecology and impacts on non-target organisms will also be required. Fourth, increased exploitation of entomopathogenic nematodes as control agents of root-feeding insects should be explored. They appear to have dramatic impacts in both natural and managed systems and are of great potential benefit to biological control programmes. Finally, studies of root herbivore–mycorrhizal interactions are considerably improving our understanding of soil ecology and their number should be greatly increased. Insect ecologists are not generally reluctant to get their hands dirty, and the paucity of studies of below-ground herbivores may reflect methodological difficulties rather than lack of interest. It might be time for the funding agencies to develop financial incentives to encourage researchers to solve methodological limitations and to redress the imbalance that currently favours research on insects above ground. In any case, we have clearly had our heads in the sand on the issue of root-feeding insects. Unfortunately, most of us appear to have had our eyes shut at the time. I would like to thank the US Department of Agriculture (Grant 00-35101-9283) for supporting our work on root herbivores.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pollinating insects provide crucial and economically important ecosystem services to crops and wild plants, but pollinators, particularly bees, are globally declining as a result of various driving factors, including the prevalent use of pesticides for crop protection. Sublethal pesticide exposure negatively impacts numerous pollinator life‐history traits, but its influence on reproductive success remains largely unknown. Such information is pivotal, however, to our understanding of the long‐term effects on population dynamics. We investigated the influence of field‐realistic trace residues of the routinely used neonicotinoid insecticides thiamethoxam and clothianidin in nectar substitutes on the entire life‐time fitness performance of the r ed m ason bee Osmia bicornis . We show that chronic, dietary neonicotinoid exposure has severe detrimental effects on solitary bee reproductive output. Neonicotinoids did not affect adult bee mortality; however, monitoring of fully controlled experimental populations revealed that sublethal exposure resulted in almost 50% reduced total offspring production and a significantly male‐biased offspring sex ratio. Our data add to the accumulating evidence indicating that sublethal neonicotinoid effects on non‐ Apis pollinators are expressed most strongly in a rather complex, fitness‐related context. Consequently, to fully mitigate long‐term impacts on pollinator population dynamics, present pesticide risk assessments need to be expanded to include whole life‐cycle fitness estimates, as demonstrated in the present study using O. bicornis as a model.",

Experiments were conducted in Ohio, U.S.A. Stress volatile attractiveness was first assessed by positioning traps baited with acetaldehyde, acetone, ethanol and methanol in ornamental nurseries.

Methanol‐baited traps were slightly attractive to X. germanus , whereas traps baited with acetaldehyde and acetone were not attractive to any ambrosia beetle.

Its behaviour and nutritional ecology are important to rootworm management. The success of the most effective and environmentally benign rootworm management method, annual crop rotation, was based on an understanding of rootworm behaviour and host–plant relationships. Enthusiastic adoption of crop rotation, provided excellent rootworm management, but also selected for behavioural resistance to this cultural control. 2 Though well‐studied, significant gaps in WCR biology remain. Understanding the topics reviewed here (mating behaviour, nutritional ecology, larval and adult movement, oviposition, alternate host use, and chemical ecology) is a starting point for adapting integrated pest management and insect resistance management (IRM) to an expanding WCR threat. A presentation of significant questions and areas in need of further study follow each topic. 3 The expansion of WCR populations into Europe exposes this pest to new environmental and regulatory conditions that may influence its behaviour and ecology. Reviewing the state of current knowledge provides a starting point of reference for researchers and pest management decision‐makers in North America and Europe. 4 The trend toward increasing adoption of transgenic maize will place an increasing premium on understanding WCR behaviour. IRM plans designed to promote sustainable deployment of transgenic hybrids are grounded on assumptions about WCR movement, mating and ovipositional behaviour. Preserving the utility of new and old management options will continue to depend on a thorough understanding of WCR biology, even as the ecological circumstances and geography of WCR problems become more complex.",

Based on these differences, we suggest that there are at least three different species each with distinct phylogeography. Members of this cryptic species complex have invaded many areas outside their native range and cause substantial damage to both agriculture (avocado in particular) and other tree species. Three of these cryptic species have invaded the USA : two species in C alifornia and a third species in both F lorida and H awaii. Identification of their native range allows directed search for their natural enemies that may be used in biological control of these tree pests.",

Currently, the Neotropical brown stink bug Euschistus heros (Fabricius) is less susceptible to organophosphate insecticides than in the past. A slight reduction in E. heros susceptibility to pyrethroids and, to a lesser extent, to neonicotinoids has also been observed. In addition, the green‐belly stink bug [ Dichelops melacanthus (Dallas)] is more tolerant to the three classes of insecticides (neonicotinoids, organophosphates and pyrethroids) than E. heros . Metabolic detoxification is involved in organophosphate, neonicotinoid and pyrethroid differences in susceptibility. Restricted availability of insecticides with different modes of action could favour the selection of resistant phenotypes in stink bug populations.",

Nuts produced by the European chestnut (Castanea sativa Miller) are important in human food and culture, and as a component in food webs in forest ecosystems. Severe infestations are reported to reduce nut yield, although precise data are lacking because of large natural year-to-year variability in yield. The recent colonization of chestnut orchards in north-eastern Italy, where nut yield has been continuously and precisely recorded for several years, offered an opportunity to calculate the impact of gall wasp infestation level on yield. The nut yield of C. sativa chestnut trees was negatively related to the gall wasp infestation level, with losses as high as 80% being reported when the number of current-year galls was above six galls per 50-cm twig. Yield losses can be explained by direct and indirect factors related to gall formation, and a fuller understanding of the mechanisms involved could identify possible mitigation measures.",

To optimize crop pollination, it is necessary to investigate the pollination contribution of different pollinator species.

We assessed the pollination efficiency (fruit set of flowers receiving only one visit) and foraging behaviour (flower visitation rate, probability of tree change, probability of row change and contact with the stigma) of honey bees and different types of non‐ Apis bees. Single visit pollination efficiency on sweet cherry was higher for both mason bees and solitary bees compared with bumble bees and honey bees. The different measures of foraging behaviour were variable among non‐ Apis bees and honey bees. Adding to their high single visit efficiency, mason bees also visited significantly more flower per minute, and they had a high probability of tree change and a high probability to contact the stigma. The results of the present study highlight the higher pollination performance of solitary bees and especially mason bees compared with bumble bees and honey bees. Management to support species with high pollination efficiency and effective foraging behaviour will promote crop pollination.",

However, studies predicting stand susceptibility over large spatial extents are limited by technical constraints in obtaining detailed, spatially‐explicit data on infestation spot occurrence. Using a unique dataset of georeferenced bark beetle infestation data, we tested whether the spatial variation of local growing conditions of forest stands, topography, and landscape variables modified the local occurrence of Ips typographus infestations after a severe hot drought in Central Europe. Bark beetle infestation occurrence depended on soil‐related aridity intensity, elevation, slope, and soil conditions. We showed that elevation interacted with growing conditions and topography. At low elevations, spruce forests growing on flat areas and wetter soils were more sensitive to the infestations. On the contrary, forests on steep slopes and soils with low water availability were rarely attacked. At the landscape scale, bark beetle damage increased with host tree cover but decreased with compositional diversity. Our findings are generally consistent with the growth‐differentiation balance hypothesis that predicts that trees growing under chronic dry conditions tend to be more resistant against biotic disturbances. Spruce stands at low elevations located in homogeneous landscapes dominated by spruce were those more exposed to bark beetles in the initial phase of a drought‐induced outbreak.",

We used PCR amplification techniques to successfully establish a molecular identification key for economically important thrips species. A PCR amplified 433 bp long fragment of the mitochondrial COI coding gene was analysed by automated direct sequencing and RFLP. Sequencing of 264 individual thrips representing 10 named species detected 17 haplotypes. Variation within species was low, whereas among species variation was high resulting in an average sequence divergence of 18.6% and an average pairwise species differentiation (calculated as F ST ‐value) of 0.9896. Two restriction enzymes ( Alu I, Sau 3AI) produced patterns that allowed unambiguous identification of all thrips species. Statistical support for the quality of the key was given by (i) a highly significant permutation approach, assigning individual haplotypes to the correct species groups and (ii) a hierarchical NJ cluster analysis in which all conspecific individual sequences clustered together with maximal (100%) bootstrap support. This study has shown that the use of genetic markers represents a valuable alternative for situations, such as epidemiological research, in which correct identification with classical morphological methods is either very difficult and time consuming or virtually impossible.",

In five of the stands all wind‐thrown trees were left (unmanaged stands) and in 48 of the stands, which were situated at distances of 1.4–10.0 km from each focal unmanaged stand, the wind‐felled trees were removed directly after the storm (managed stands). In the winter preceding the fifth summer new storm‐fellings occurred in the study area. 3 In the 4‐year period between the first and second storm‐fellings, 50–322 standing trees were killed by I. typographus per unmanaged stand. There was a direct linear relationship between the number of storm‐felled spruces colonized by I. typographus and the number of trees subsequently killed in the unmanaged stands. 4 Tree mortality caused by I. typographus in the unmanaged stands was almost nil in the first year, peaked in the second or third year, and decreased markedly to a low level in the fourth and fifth years. 5 In the 4‐year period between the first and second storm‐fellings twice as many trees were killed per ha in the unmanaged stands than in the managed stands: the average difference being 6.2 killed trees per ha, equivalent to 19% of the number of spruce trees felled by the first storm in the unmanaged stands. 6 Much higher numbers of trees were killed per ha in the stand edges than in the interiors of both the unmanaged and the managed stands.",

Rates of parasitism of experimentally released larvae of the light‐brown apple moth, Epiphyas postvittana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), by Dolichogenidea tasmanica (Cameron) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) were significantly lower in phacelia and control treatments, and leafroller pupae were significantly more abundant in controls than in buckwheat and alyssum treatments.

Suction sampling of the understoreys gave D. tasmanica adult densities that were significantly more abundant in alyssum compared with other treatments. Numbers of Anacharis zealandica (Hymenoptera: Figitidae) (a parasitoid of larvae of the predatory brown lacewing) did not differ between treatments. In the laboratory, flowering buckwheat and alyssum enhanced D. tasmanica longevity by up to 78% compared with the control, and buckwheat also enhanced potential fecundity by 62%.

In the control, the yield was lower than the yield in treatments with pesticides due to losses from fungal diseases and viruses. IPM more efficiently controlled pests than the calendar‐system, reducing the number of parathion‐methyl and abamectin applications by 3.8‐ and 2.9‐fold, respectively.

Plant feeding was directly related to N. tenuis density and temperature and inversely related to whitefly density. The significance of prey availability and temperature was corroborated in laboratory assays. The intensification of plant feeding at low prey density indicates switching from zoophagy to phytophagy as prey become scarce. 3 Nesidiocoris tenuis showed a typical predator dynamic in relation to variance in prey density. Populations increased after whitefly outbreaks and decreased after whitefly had been depleted. The rapid decrease of N. tenuis populations after whitefly decreased, however, suggests that plants are a poorer nutrient source than whitefly for this species.",

    "abstract": "Xylosandrus germanus (Blandford) is a key pest of ornamental nursery trees. Ethanol is the most attractive semiochemical known for X. germanus , and its emission from trees represents a primary host‐selection cue. Ethanol production is induced by a variety of abiotic and biotic stressors, which could thereby predispose trees to attack by ethanol‐responsive ambrosia beetles. To better understand X. germanus host‐selection behaviour within ornamental nurseries, a series of experiments examined the influence of flood‐stress on the attractiveness and susceptibility of flowering dogwood Cornus florida L. Under field conditions, more X. germanus were attracted to experimentally flood‐stressed dogwoods than neighbouring nonflooded controls in 2009, 2010 and 2011. Flood‐stressed dogwoods were also preferentially attacked in 2009–2011, although no attacks occurred on any of the neighbouring nonflooded trees. Solid‐phase microextraction‐gas chromatography‐mass spectrometry detected ethanol in stem tissue from flooded dogwoods but not nonflooded trees. Acetaldehyde, acetic acid and ethanol were also emitted from the outer bark of flooded dogwoods but not nonflooded trees. These results demonstrate that X. germanus preferentially lands on and attacks physiologically‐stressed hosts, and further support the role of ethanol in mediating this interaction. Attacks by X. germanus have previously been suspected to occur on trees viewed as ‘apparently‐healthy’, although the possibility of such trees being in apparently‐stressed at the time of attack cannot be ruled out given the results obtained in the present study. Minimizing the impact of stressors known to induce the production of ethanol should be the primary foundation of a management plan for X. germanus and other ethanol‐responsive ambrosia beetles.",

In Spain, there is observational evidence that the moth Lobesia botrana Den. &amp; Schiff. (Lep.: Tortricidae), a key vine pest that is usually trivoltine in Mediterranean latitudes, tends to advance spring emergence, displaying a partial fourth additional flight, a fact that is potentially attributable to global warming. To verify this hypothesis, local temperatures were correlated with L. botrana phenology in six vine‐growing areas of southwestern Spain during the last two decades (1984–2006) by exploiting the database of flight curves obtained with sexual pheromone traps. The dates of second and third flight peaks of the moth were calculated for each area and year and then correlated with both time (years) and local temperatures. The results obtained demonstrated a noteworthy trend towards local warming (as a result of global warming) in the last two decades, with mean increases in annual and spring temperatures of 0.9 and 3.0°C, respectively. Therefore, L. botrana phenology has significantly advanced by more than 12 days. Moreover, the phenological advance contributed to increased moth voltinism in 2006 by promoting a complete fourth additional flight, a fact that has never been reported previously to our knowledge in the Iberian Peninsula. The potential impact of an earlier phenology and increased voltinism in L. botrana is discussed from an agro‐ecological perspective.",

Agricultural intensification, however, is one of the main drivers resulting in a serious decline of pollinator populations worldwide. In the present study, pollinator communities were examined in 12 apple orchards surrounded by either homogeneous or heterogeneous landscape in Hungary. Pollinators (honey bees, wild bees, hoverflies) were surveyed in the flowering period of apple trees. Landscape heterogeneity was characterized within a radius of 300, 500 and 1000 m around each orchard using Shannon's diversity and Shannon's evenness indices. We found that pollination success of apple was significantly related to the species richness of wild bees, regardless the dominance of honey bees. Diversity of the surrounding landscape matrix had a marginal positive effect on the species richness of hoverflies within a radius of 300 m and a positive effect on the species richness of wild bees within a radius of 500 m, whereas evenness of the surrounding landscape enhanced the abundance of wild bees within a radius of 500 m. Flower resources in the groundcover within the orchards supported honey bees. Therefore, the maintenance of semi-natural habitats within 500 m around apple orchards is highly recommended to enhance wild pollinator communities and apple production.",

By contrast to other frugivorous D rosophila species, D. suzukii lays eggs on ripening fruits, heavily reducing fruit production. Although cultivated host plants of D. suzukii are well documented, very little is known about wild hosts in the invaded areas. The A merican black cherry Prunus serotina E hrh., a tree species native to N orth A merica, became one of the main woody forest invaders in E urope. One cause of its invasion success is the huge amount of fruit produced by P. serotina trees. A field survey showed that P. serotina is a suitable reservoir for the development and persistence of D. suzukii populations in E uropean natural systems (on the forest area investigated, up to 70% of all the fruits of P. serotina were infested in one of the sampling sites). Laboratory tests demonstrated that D. suzukii prefers ripening cherries to ripe ones, therefore increasing the chance of the larvae to fully develop and reach maturity before the mesocarp of the fruit totally decays. Infestation of P. serotina cherries could reduce the life span of fruits, as well as their attractiveness to seed consumers and dispersers, yet P. serotina could represent a suitable plant reservoir promoting D. suzukii invasion in E urope and N orth A merica.",

Contemporary genetics-based technologies use insects that are homozygous for a repressible dominant lethal genetic construct rather than being sterilized by irradiation.Engineered strains of agricultural pest species, including moths such as the diamondback moth Plutella xylostella and fruit flies such as the Mediterranean fruit fly Ceratitis capitata, have been developed with lethality that only operates on females.Transgenic crops expressing insecticidal toxins are widely used; the economic benefits of these crops would be lost if toxin resistance spread through the pest population. The primary resistance management method is a high-dose/refuge strategy, requiring toxin-free crops as refuges near the insecticidal crops, as well as toxin doses sufficiently high to kill wild-type insects and insects heterozygous for a resistance allele.Mass-release of toxin-sensitive engineered males (carrying female-lethal genes), as well as suppressing populations, could substantially delay or reverse the spread of resistance. These transgenic insect technologies could form an effective resistance management strategy.We outline some policy considerations for taking genetic insect control systems through to field implementation.",

However, little is known about which habitat types in agricultural landscapes function as reproduction habitats for arthropod pests and predators during different times of the year. We studied the arthropod assemblage on six crops and on the seven most abundant native plant species in two landscapes over 1 year in Australia. Densities of immature and adult stages of pests and their predators were assessed using beat sheet sampling. The native plants supported a significantly different arthropod assemblage than crops. Native plants had higher predator densities than crops over the course of the year, whereas crops supported higher pest densities than the native plants in two out of four seasonal sampling periods. Crops had higher densities of immature stages of pests than native plants in three of four seasonal sampling periods, implying that crops are more strongly associated with pest reproduction than native plants. Densities of immature predators, excluding spiders, were not different between native plants and crops. Spiders were, however, generally abundant and densities were higher on native plants than on crops but, because some species disperse when immature, there is less certainty in identifying their reproduction habitat. Because the predator to pest ratio on native plant species showed little variation, and spatial variation in arthropod assemblages was limited, the predator support function of native vegetation may be a general phenomenon. Incentives that maintain and restore native remnant vegetation can increase the predator to pest ratio at the landscape scale, which could enhance pest suppression in crops.",

It was found in Napa County, California, in 2009, and it has subsequently been recorded in an additional nine counties, despite an ongoing eradication programme. The present study aimed to assess prospectively its potential geographical distribution and relative abundance in California and the continental U.S.A. A subsidiary goal was to provide explanation for timing control measures. Data from the European literature were used to formulate and parameterize a holistic physiologically‐based demographic model for L. botrana . This model was linked to an extant mechanistic model of grapevine phenology, growth and development that provides the bottom‐up effects of fruiting phenology, age and abundance on L. botrana dynamics. Fruit age affects larval developmental rates, and has carryover effects on pupal development and adult fecundity. Also included in the model were the effects of temperature on developmental, survival and fecundity rates. Observed daily weather data were used to simulate the potential distribution of the moth in California, and the continental U.S.A. The relative total number of pupae per vine per year was used as the metric of favourability at all locations. The simulation data were mapped using grass gis ( http://grass.osgeo.org/ ). The model predicts L. botrana can spread statewide with the highest populations expected in the hotter regions of southern California and the lower half of the Central Valley. In the U.S.A., areas of highest favourability include south Texas, and much of the southeast U.S.A. The effects of a warmer climate on pest abundance were explored by increasing observed mean temperatures 2° and 3 °C. L. botrana abundance is expected to increase in northern California and in the agriculturally rich Central Valley but to decrease in the hot deserts of southern California where summer temperatures would approach its upper thermal limit. Analysis of the timing of mating disruption pheromone for control of L. botrana suggests the greatest benefit would accrue by targeting adults emerging from winter diapause pupae and the flight of first summer adults.",

Several of these beetle species have become invasive pests around the world for attacking and infecting healthy trees with their phytopathogenic fungal symbionts. Diet and rearing protocols were developed for two members of the E . fornicatus species complex, polyphagous shot hole borer ( PSHB ) and tea shot hole borer ( TSHB ), using sawdust from host trees, allowing collection of data on beetle biology, phenology and sex ratios. Adults developed within 22 days at 24 ° C . Single PSHB or TSHB foundresses averaged 32.4 and 24.7 adult female offspring, respectively, and up to 57 and 68 female adults within 6–7 weeks. A strong predictor of the number of offspring in a colony was the number of entry holes. Average sex ratios (% male) for PSHB and TSHB , respectively, were 7.4% and 7.2%. Being haplodiploid, virgin PSHB foundresses were able to produce and mate with male offspring, then subsequently produce female offspring, confirming that they have arrhenotokous reproduction. A cold tolerance study found significant mortality rates among PSHB colonies exposed to −5° or −1 ° C but not colonies exposed to 0°, 1° or 5 ° C . Given H amilton's local mate competition ( LMC ) theory, a number of LMC predictions were violated. PSHB sex ratios were not affected by the number of foundresses; approximately 14% of broods did not contain males; males did not usually eclose before females but eclosed around the same time (22–23 days); and PSHB males were found walking outside of their natal galleries on the trunk of a heavily infested tree in the field. Alternatives to LMC are considered, such as early forms of sociality (maternal care, cooperative brood care), local resource enhancement and kin selection.",

The simulation and prediction of D. suzukii's population dynamics would be helpful for guiding pest management. Therefore, we reviewed and summarized the current knowledge on effects of air temperature and relative humidity on different life cycle parameters of D. suzukii . The literature summary presented shows that high oviposition rates can occur between 18 and 30 °C. Temperatures between 16 and 25 °C resulted in fast and high egg‐to‐adult development success of more than 80%. Oviposition and adult life span were positively affected by high relative humidity; however, the factor humidity is so far rarely investigated. We assume that this is one reason why relative humidity usually is not considered in modelling approaches, which are summarized herein. The high number of recently published research articles on D. suzukii 's life cycle suggests that there is already a lot of knowledge available on its biology. However, there are still considerable research gaps mentioned in the literature, which are also summarized herein. Nevertheless, we conclude that sufficient temperature data in the literature are suitable to understand and predict population dynamics of D. suzukii , in order to assist pest management in the field.",

Recently, two invasive fruit fly species, Drosophila suzukii and Chymomyza amoena , have become established in Europe and are expected to alter existing Drosophilidae communities. In this study, carried out between September 2021 and April 2022 in northern France, we aimed to disentangle the relative roles of microclimatic, landscape and local factors driving the diversity of the Drosophilidae community in decaying fruit across seasons. Minimum site temperature during the week preceding sampling and the proportion of rotten fruit tissue had the strongest positive influence on Drosophilidae abundance and species richness. Drosophilidae abundance also increased with urbanisation (portion of building cover) around the sampled trees. Decaying apples were important breeding sites for C. amoena across seasons, but provided a suboptimal substrate for D. suzukii , which was only present in late summer. This study sheds light on the important role of unharvested fallen crop fruit in maintaining the diversity of an insect family that is generally overlooked in field studies. It also emphasises the importance of considering multiple scales and factors when studying the interactions between invasive species, native species and their shared trophic resources. Finally, our data highlight the importance of the Drosophilidae community in recycling agricultural waste.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The measurement process has a well‐known structure and requires tools with proper characteristics, depending on the physical quantities and their magnitude. While most fields of research have reliable tools to support the experiments, this is not properly the case for measurements in the population dynamics of insects and animals, more in general. Monitoring insect species is a common practice in agriculture and forest environments, above all to develop pest control or biodiversity conservation strategies and to validate or feed decision support system tools. Besides the development of several monitoring techniques, an explicit connection between entomology and metrology (the science of measurements) is still missing. We may ask if the current tools involved in monitoring insect populations, as traps for instance, respect the standard features that measurement tools should have, and if they provide ‘proper measurements’ or just an ‘estimation’. This work analyses the pros and cons of insect trapping by connecting metrology and entomology and provides some perspectives on which the research communities should focus and interact to answer the questions still open.",

Extensive age‐specific life table data on two strains of the invasive Palearctic alfalfa weevil, Hypera postica (Gyllenhal) (i.e., Ebro Valley, Spain ( S ) and Hamadan, Iran ( I ) strains) having disparate vital rates, are used to develop weather‐driven physiologically based demographic models (PBDMs) of their biology. The PBDMs are used to explore prospectively their invasive potential across much of the Holarctic. Using N.E. Gilbert's theory that fecundity is selected to the level appropriate for the population in its environment, we explore the interacting effects of multiples of observed fecundity, temperature‐dependent mortality and density‐dependent population growth constraints on stabilizing adaptation in strains S and I to weather in their native area. Aestivating adults () bridge the critical winter period, and their annual production is used as a metric of adaptation. Maximization of in the native environments supports Gilbert's supposition. The S and I strains have wide invasive potential, and we posit stabilizing selection for maximizing would occur after successful invasion of novel environments. We propose that the evolving adaptation of an invasive strain to extant and climate change weather can be examined by periodic updates of the biodemographic biology in the weather‐driven PBDMs.",

A total of 27 749 individuals and 140 species were identified. Overall, abundance of Coleoptera was greatest on organically managed farms. 2 Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) and staphylinid beetles (Col. Staphylinidae) formed 79.7% and 16.7%, respectively, of the total catch. Pterostichus melanarius was the dominant carabid among the 45 species captured and significantly higher numbers were found in organic farms. Tachinus signatus was the most common of 44 staphylinid species, and was significantly more abundant on conventional farms. 3 For carabids, the log‐series α diversity index was higher on conventional farms but was not statistically different from that calculated for organic farms. The α index was identical for staphylinid species from organic and conventional farms. Diversity was significantly higher from conventional farms when data were combined for all of the recorded coleopteran species. 4 From this study, it appears that the main effect of farming practice is to influence the overall abundance and dominance of particular species, and the lower diversity of organic farms is a consequence of the large increase in dominance of a single species, namely P. melanarius.",

However, we know little about how varying concentrations of individual monoterpenes affect responses. 2 We tested a gradient of ratios of α‐pinene, the predominant monoterpene in host pines in the Great Lakes region of North America, to Ips pini 's pheromone, racemic ipsdienol plus lanierone. 3 Ips pini demonstrated a parabolic response, in which low concentrations of α‐pinene had no effect on attraction to its pheromone, intermediate concentrations were synergistic and high concentrations were inhibitory. These results suggest optimal release rates for population monitoring and suppression programmes. 4 Inhibition of bark beetle attraction to pheromones may be an important component of conifer defences. At terpene to pheromone ratios emulating emissions from trees actively responding to a first attack, arrival of flying beetles was low. This may constitute an additional defensive role of terpenes, which are also toxic to bark beetles at high concentrations. 5 Reduced attraction to a low ratio of α‐pinene to pheromone, as occurs when colonization densities become high and the tree's resin is largely depleted, might reflect a mechanism for preventing excessive crowding. 6 Thanasimus dubius , the predominant predator of I. pini , was also attracted to ipsdienol plus lanierone, but its response differed from that of its prey. Attraction increased across all concentrations of α‐pinene. This indicates that separate lures are needed to sample both predators and bark beetles effectively. It also provides an opportunity for maximizing pest removal while reducing adverse effects on beneficial species. This disparity further illustrates the complexity confronting natural enemies that track chemical signals to locate herbivores.",

Standard census techniques and sticky board trapping were used to assess numbers of syrphids, whilst weekly flower head counts were used to quantify the floral resources available in each of the patches. 2 The field margin supported a greater diversity and density of syrphids than the within‐crop wildflower patches, despite having a relatively lower flower head density. Presumably this was in response to other resources that field margins offer, namely additional aphid resources, shelter from predation, lekking sites and suitable flight‐paths. 3 The commonest species of syrphid, Episyrphus balteatus , demonstrated a very positive habitat association with the field margin and was rarely reported in the field patches. Therefore, it may be an unsuitable candidate for the biological control of aphids via augmentation of numbers using non‐host resources. 4 Patch size and shape had little effect on the spatial distributions of syrphids, probably because of the adult syrphids' high mobility. 5 Of greater influence was the number of flowers contained in each habitat patch. Typically, patches with higher numbers of flowers had significantly greater aggregations of hoverflies. Habitat manipulation by the provision of flowers in patches seems to increase the local density of hoverflies. Further work is necessary to establish the importance of flower density in enhancing the control of pest populations.",

All four new traps used a large collecting receptacle containing detergent‐laced water, and three presented a prominent visual silhouette above the receptacle. 2 In total, 27 336 large woodborers were captured from 10 June to 30 September in an experiment in the southern interior of British Columbia, and 4737 from 6 June to 27 July in an experiment in northern Alberta. The woodborers captured in the British Columbia experiment were mainly beetles in the families Cerambycidae (79%) and Buprestidae (15%), and woodwasps in the family Siricidae (6%). Most woodborers, e.g. three Monochamus spp. and Xylotrechus longitarsus (the predominant cerambycids), were captured throughout the summer, with peak captures in August. 3 Cross‐vane, pipe and stacked‐bottomless‐flower‐pot traps were generally superior to pan and multiple‐funnel traps for insects in nine taxa, but cross‐vane traps were the most effective overall, trapping 32% of all insects captured. 4 The large number of target insects captured in a relatively small number of traps in the two experiments suggests that employment of an efficacious trap with a large vertical silhouette and a wide, escape‐proof collecting receptacle could make mass trapping of large woodborers in timber processing areas operationally feasible. 5 Because the most effective traps were unstable in the wind, and the detergent‐laced water captured unacceptably high numbers of small mammals, design modifications are necessary. We are currently developing a wind‐firm trap, with a prominent vertical silhouette, a wide collecting surface, and an escape‐proof, but dry collecting receptacle.",

This study investigated: (1) the potential of applied silicon in enhancing plant resistance of sugarcane to E. saccharina , using calcium silicate as a carrier; (2) whether there was any interaction between cane variety (and stalk borer resistance) and silicon treatment. Six commercial varieties of sugarcane were treated in a pot‐plant trial with two levels (5000 and 10 000 kg/ha) of calcium silicate. After artificial infestation with E. saccharina , response to the treatments was assessed in terms of borer numbers and mass, and stalk damage. Calcium silicate significantly enhanced resistance at the higher rate compared with the control. Borer mass was reduced by 19.8% and stalk length bored by 24.4%. Lower treatment values were intermediate between those of the higher treatment and the control. The interaction between variety and Si treatment was not significant when varieties were examined individually in the analysis. However, the interaction was significant for borer mass when varieties were grouped according to their resistance characteristics. Susceptible varieties might benefit more from treatment with silicon than resistant ones, as resistant varieties showed no significant effect of silicon. All varieties had increased silicon content due to the treatments, but differed appreciably in stalk silicon content at the different treatment levels. Similarly, within varieties, stalk silicon content did not correspond consistently with borer response patterns and silicate application rates.",

Protein‐fed males also had shorter mating latencies and longer copulations than protein‐deprived males. 4 Females mated by protein‐fed males were more likely to store sperm, stored more sperm and were less likely to remate than were females mated by protein‐deprived males. Females were also less likely to remate if their first mate had been large. 5 Overall, providing male Q‐flies access to a protein source for a 24‐ or 48‐h window early on in their adult life was sufficient to greatly enhance all assessed measures of performance.

We suggest this to be a transition period, reflecting a drop in carrying capacity due to depletion of susceptible trees during the preceding outbreak period (1970s) and a drop in beetle number to below the density required to kill trees. 5 Windfelling ( W t − 1 ) appears to be an important predictor of the dynamics; however, it was difficult to evaluate the statistical significance of this factor due to only one large windfall event. 6 The weak influence of drought stress ( D t − 1 ) could be due to the absence of severe drought periods within the time series.",

A series of studies under field and controlled conditions was conducted to investigate the extent to which Cry1Ac protein from Bt transgenic cotton reaches the third trophic level and to measure the amount of protein that herbivores can acquire and expose to predators. 2. Levels of Cry1Ac in Bt cotton leaves decreased over the season. Among herbivores (four species), Cry1Ac was detected in lepidopteran larvae and the amount varied between species. Among predators (seven species), Cry1Ac was detected in Podisus maculiventris and Chrysoperla rufilabris . 3. In the greenhouse, only 14% of the Cry1Ac detected in the prey ( Spodoptera exigua larvae) was subsequently found in the predator P. maculiventris. Detection of Cry1Ac protein in Orius insidiosus , Geocoris punctipes and Nabis roseipennis was probably limited by the amount of prey consumed that had fed on Bt cotton. 4. Purified Cry1Ac was acquired by the small predatory bug G. punctipes but at much higher concentration than found in plants or in lepidopteran larvae. 5. Bt protein was shown to move through prey to the third trophic level. Predatory heteropterans acquired Cry1Ac from prey fed Bt cotton, but acquisition was dependent on the concentration of Cry1Ac conveyed by the prey and the amount of prey consumed. The type and availability of prey capable of acquiring the protein, coupled with the generalist feeding behaviour of the most common predators in the cotton ecosystem, probably constrain the flow of Cry1Ac through trophic levels.",

With increasing legislative pressure upon chemical pesticides such as organophosphates, interest in this sector is increasing steadily. Garlic Allium sativum L. juices and extracts form the basis of several commercially available pest control products, but the performance of these products is variable, possibly due to lack of quality control upon batches of materials in the manufacturing process. Some garlic products designed for use in the food industry are subjected to rigorous batch‐control to ensure organoleptic consistency. We studied the insecticidal efficacy of a commercially produced food grade garlic juice using two target dipteran pests, Delia radicum (L.) and Musca domestica L. Exposure of the two species to different concentrations of garlic juice revealed variability in insecticidal effect across life stages. LC 50 values recorded for D. radicum were: eggs (7‐day exposure) 0.8%; larvae (24‐h exposure) 26.4%; larvae (48‐h exposure) 6.8%; and adults (24‐h exposure) 0.4%. LC 50 values recorded for M. domestica were: eggs (7‐day exposure) 1.6%; larvae (24‐h exposure) 10.1%; larvae (24‐h exposure) 4.5%; and adults (24‐h exposure) 2.2%. Mortality rates caused by the garlic juice were comparable with those obtained with the organophosphate pesticide Birlane ® , indicating parity of effect at various concentrations depending on life stage. We conclude that this product may provide an effective, naturally‐derived insecticide for use in agricultural systems against dipteran pests.",

Two main mechanisms of host location, primary attraction and random landing, have been investigated for such insects. 2 Research has led to contradictory conclusions about those hypotheses, especially for wood‐feeding insects; however, recent studies suggest that both mechanisms may take place in a single taxon but at different scales. 3 We developed a field experiment to test the hypothesis that primary attraction occurs at larger scale and random landing at finer scale in wood‐feeding insects. Landing rates, measured using sticky traps, were compared first between patches and then between individual trees according to their distance to a baited central tree. 4 Polynomial functions describing landing rate to distance relationships were compared with a function produced by a null model describing what should occur under the random landing hypothesis. Scolytidae and Cerambycidae (Coleoptera) responded to volatiles at the patch scale, supporting the primary attraction hypothesis, but the landing patterns of some groups at finer scale matched closely the predictions of our null model, giving support to the random landing hypothesis. 5 Our results show that the primary attraction and random landing hypotheses are not mutually exclusive and that prelanding use of host‐produced volatile is scale‐dependant. Scale considerations should thus be included in the study of prelanding host‐selection of wood‐feeding insects.",

Ips typographus , which is an aggressive species capable of colonizing and killing healthy trees, showed an increased attraction to monoterpene : pheromone ratios, and this may be high enough to inhibit attraction of less aggressive beetle species typically colonizing dead, dying or stressed trees. 5 Attraction of associates of I. typographus was also modified by (–)‐α‐pinene.

Among the most important below‐ground organisms are mycorrhizal fungi, comprising ubiquitous and ancient plant mutualists that have significant effects on plant growth and fitness mediated by resource exchange with plants. In the present study, we focus on the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) on crop defence against insect pests. AMF alter the availability of resources used by crop plants to manufacture defences against pests and to compensate for pest damage. However, AMF also provide plants with nutrients that are known to increase insect performance. Through potentially opposing effects on plant nutritional quality and defence, mycorrhizal fungi can positively or negatively affect pest performance. Additionally, AMF may directly affect gene expression and plant defence signalling pathways involved in the construction and induction of plant defences, and these effects are apparently independent of those caused by nutrient availability. In this way, AMF may still influence plant defences in the fertilized and highly managed systems typical of agribusiness. Because AMF can affect plant tolerance to pest damage, they may have a significant impact on the shape of damage–yield relationships in crops. Potential mechanisms for this effect are suggested. We highlight the need for continuing research on the effects of AMF identity and the abundance on crop defences and tolerance to pest attack. Much work is needed on the potential effects of mycorrhizal colonization on plant signalling and the induction of direct and indirect defences that may protect against pest damage.",

We tested this hypothesis by investigating the distribution of pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Denis &amp; Schiffer‐Müller) (Lepidoptera) infestation at the edges of pure stands of Pinus pinaster (AÏton) at some distance from nonhost trees (Experiment 1) or bordered in part by a broadleaved hedgerow (Experiment 2). An ‘edge effect' was demonstrated, with trees at the edge of the stand being more heavily infested than those at the interior of the stand. The presence of a nonhost broadleaved hedgerow in front of the edge of the pine stand resulted in lower T. pityocampa infestation. There were significantly fewer T. pityocampa nests behind the hedgerow than on the exposed part of the edge. The presence of the hedgerow did not dilute or repel T. pityocampa infestation further into the pine stand, although it decreased the infestation of T. pityocampa throughout the pine stand. The decrease in T. pityocampa infestation behind the hedgerow was greater when the broadleaved hedgerow was taller than the pine trees. These results highlight the benefits of using nonhost tree species on the edge of monospecific forest stands to reduce insect damage.

The main objectives of the present study were an assessment of the impact of shade on the spatial distribution of mirid populations and thus the evaluation of shade management strategies. Mirid densities were measured and shade was characterized for three plots located in three different agroecological zones in the Centre region of Cameroon. Mirid densities generally followed a negative binomial law. Geostatistical procedures were used to characterize spatial distribution of mirid density. Light conditions were assessed using hemispherical photography. Populations of Sahlbergella singularis were highly aggregated in the plots. Semivariance analysis and kriging visualized the spatial dependence of mirid densities. Clearly distinguishable mirid pockets of 20–30 adjacent infested cocoa trees were identified in two of the three plots. The high diversity of shade tree species and the large variability in density and size of shade trees resulted in a considerable heterogeneity of plot light conditions. Percentage transmitted light varied in the range 9.4–80.1% in the most heterogeneous plot. For two of the three plots, mirid pockets were aggregated in those areas where light transmission was highest. In the third plot, relatively high mirid densities and the presence of an alternative host resulted in a more homogeneous distribution. The importance of these findings for improved mirid control is discussed.",

Most recorded outbreaks have occurred in mid elevation lodgepole pine ( Pinus contorta ). In warm years, tree mortality also occurs at higher elevations in mixed species stands. Mountain pine beetle's relative preference for and performance in Pinus species that either commonly or less frequently encounter this insect has received little direct testing. Further, knowledge of the relative proportions of secondary compounds, which can differ among Pinus species and play important roles in attack rates and outcomes, is important to understanding host suitability. We monitored mountain pine beetle attacks, adult emergence timing and reproductive capacity in lodgepole and whitebark ( Pinus albicaulis ) pines growing in mixed stands at relatively high elevation. Phloem monoterpene chemistry of trees prior to and during attack was compared within and between species. Although beetles attacked lodgepole pine more frequently, lodgepole pines also resisted attacks more frequently. Overall, there were equal numbers of lethal attacks between species. Brood production and adult emergence timing did not differ between tree species. The relative composition of secondary compounds differed by tree species, although both species contained compounds that affect mountain pine beetle attack and reproductive success.",

In the present study, we investigated the effect of soil management practices, with versus without soil cover crops, on the arthropod abundance, richness, diversity and species composition in Andalusia olive groves, South Spain. The results obtained show that these soil cover crops positively affect the diversity of arthropods, along with other variables such as the diversity of the plant community and Shannon index of the landscape. By contrast, the number of arthropods was higher in olive groves with bare ground as a result of the abundance of two families (Entomobryidae and Aeolothripidae), which comprised more than 50% of all the individuals collected. Rank abundance diagrams and multivariate analyses showed differences between the two types of soil management systems with respect to the composition of families. In conclusion, soil cover crops strongly improve the diversity of arthropods in olive orchards, which helps to maintain biodiversity in these intensive agroecosystems at the same time as improving other ecosystems services, such as soil fertility and the prevention of soil erosion.",

A total of 7745 flowers belonging to 63 plant species were recorded in the hedgerows from May to September 2012. Flower abundance and species richness decreased as the season progressed. Orchard differences were observed for plant species richness but not for the total number of flowers in the hedgerows, likely as a result of similar management among orchards. Hymenoptera pollinators (honey bees, bumblebees and wild bees) accounted for 37.8% of the total insects recorded visiting flowers, whereas predatory hoverflies (14.9%) were the dominant natural enemies. The attractiveness for insects was assessed for 21 of the flowering plant species identified in the hedgerows.

We sampled the pest at different heights and at different distances from the forest, from the the winter dormancy stage to the post‐harvest period. Drosophila suzukii activity‐density in the orchards declined strongly with increasing distance from the forest margin and with increasing height above the ground. The observed patterns varied over the crop phenological development stages, indicating that the pest used multiple habitats throughout the year. When the host plant was not suitable for reproduction, D. suzukii preferred to fly closer to the forest margin and at lower heights. When the host plant was suitable (i.e. ripe cherries), D. suzukii further colonized the orchards both horizontally and vertically, exploring the canopy volume more in depth.

Natural enemy abundance and diversity within a given crop, in turn, have frequently been shown to be positively related to the amount of semi-natural habitat in the landscape. However, other aspects of landscape structure may also influence natural enemy communities and may be more amenable to management. We simultaneously assessed the relationship among several metrics of landscape structure, as well as between these metrics and coccinellid activity in soybean fields. We used partial least squares regression to examine the coccinellid response to landscape structure. Coccinellid activity was lowest in landscapes dominated by annual crops grown in large fields and highest in landscapes dominated by semi-natural habitats such as grasslands and forests, with a higher diversity of crops grown in smaller fields. Landscape characteristics, including composition factors such as the type and amount of different land covers and configuration factors such as the interspersion of these land covers, are often correlated within a set of landscapes.

Despite this, few studies have tested the effectiveness of different coloured vane traps in attracting bees among different habitat types, and none exist in the southern hemisphere. The present study sampled 192 sites (108 in wooded habitats and 84 in open habitats) within an agricultural region of southern Australia. Pairs of coloured vane traps (one blue and one yellow) were placed at each site for a period of seven days. Combined, 16 348 individuals were collected from four families, comprising 13 genera (21 subgenera) and 55 species. Blue vane taps were most effective, sampling six times as many individuals as yellow vane traps and 96% of total species. Their effectiveness was consistent among open and wooded habitat types. The present study highlights the efficacy of vane traps as a passive sampling technique for wild bees. An added benefit of this technique is that vane traps do not require pheromones or lethal agents. A systematic sampling method best suited to the research question should be incorporated into studies of wild bees. For ecological census and population monitoring within multiple habitat types, the present study supports the use of blue vane taps as a major component of the sampling protocol.",

Information about the life cycle of the pest is needed for detection and survey efforts, development of control options and predicting the potential range in Europe.

The number of larval instars and the duration of development of A. planipennis in European Russia were determined.

Traditional entomological traps remain an important part of the biomonitoring toolbox, but sample processing is laborious and introduces latency, and accuracy can be variable. The integration of molecular techniques such as environmental DNA and DNA metabarcoding into insect biomonitoring has gained increasing attention, but the advantages of doing so, the kind of data this can generate, and how easily and effectively molecular analyses can be integrated with the diverse types of entomological traps currently used remains relatively unclear. In this review, we examine how combining DNA metabarcoding with a range of conventional and unconventional entomological sampling techniques can advance biomonitoring in a way that is useful to researchers and practitioners. We highlight some of the key challenges and how to mitigate them, using examples of its integration with different sampling methods from the literature (e.g., interception, pitfall and sticky traps) to demonstrate efficacy and suitability. We discuss how metabarcoding data can be used to infer ecological networks, emphasizing the importance of this as a framework for understanding species interactions and ecosystem functioning for more effective and descriptive biomonitoring. Finally, future advances in biomonitoring are highlighted, alongside recommendations of best practice for researchers both new to and experienced in invertebrate biomonitoring with metabarcoding.",

This advancement has enabled the development of decision support systems that support farmers with herbivorous pest identification and pest monitoring. In these systems, the AI supports farmers through the detection, classification and quantification of herbivorous pests. However, many of the systems under development fall short of meeting the demands of the end user, with these shortfalls acting as obstacles that impede the integration of these systems into integrated pest management (IPM) practices. There are four common obstacles that restrict the uptake of these AI‐driven decision support systems. Namely: AI technology effectiveness, functionality under field conditions, the level of computational expertise and power required to use and run the system and system mobility. We propose four criteria that AI‐driven systems need to meet in order to overcome these challenges: (i) The system should be based on effective and efficient AI; (ii) The system should be adaptable and capable of handling ‘real‐world’ image data collected from the field; (iii) Systems should be user‐friendly, device‐driven and low‐cost; (iv) Systems should be mobile and deployable under multiple weather and climate conditions. Systems that meet these criteria are likely to represent innovative and transformative systems that successfully integrate AI technology with IPM principles into tools that can support farmers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This review provides a synthesis of the available knowledge on Carmenta foraseminis , an emerging cocoa pest in northern South America. This moth was first described in 1995 in Panama, and its proliferation across the Amazon basin is currently threatening the production of cocoa in the region and may endanger the sector's sustainability. Hence, it is important to further draw the attention of researchers towards this emerging pest. The larvae of this lepidopteran burrow within the pod and feed on beans and their pulp, causing important losses. We present a critical synthesis of the knowledge on C. foraseminis (biology, geographic distribution, phylogenetic status, ecology), to identify the cause of its emergence and key points for its control. We also describe similarities to another lepidopteran, the Cocoa Pod Borer (CPB) Conopomorpha cramerella , which is the main pest of cocoa in Asia, especially on the way it is controlled and eventual lessons and recommendations that can be drawn from the situation in Asia to better understand and manage cocoa pod infestation in the Amazon basin. Additionally, we propose further research themes to be explored for Carmenta foraseminis that will help in the development of efficient management practices.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Leaf‐cutting ants (LCAs) are abundant and cause considerable damage to agricultural and forest crops in the Neotropical region and are commonly controlled using sulfluramid‐based ant baits. However, this active ingredient is a precursor of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), a persistent, human‐made pollutant that poses serious environmental and health risks. Several studies have highlighted more natural alternatives to conventional pesticides as a strategic approach for safer management. In this context, the aim of the present study was to conduct a review through scientific, technological and molecular mapping of the main plant species and their major compounds used in the alternative control of LCAs using plant essential oils (PEOs). Seven plant families used for the extraction of PEOs were identified: Aristolochiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Lamiaceae, Myrtaceae, Piperaceae, Verbenaceae and Winteraceae. Additionally, 28 patents related to the use of PEOs against pest insects, including LCAs, were identified. Although Brazil has the highest number of scientific publications on this topic, the number of registered patents does not follow the same trend. This review emphasizes the need to translate scientific knowledge into technological solutions to make alternative products available for the control of LCAs. This is essential to uphold the commitment made under the Stockholm Convention, which seeks to eliminate or restrict the use of Persistent Organic Pollutants.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Modern interventions, especially afforestation with Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris (Pinales: Pinaceae), L.), have accelerated habitat degradation in sandy lowland regions, reducing biodiversity and hindering the continuous succession of beetle populations. We conducted research from 2013 to 2021 in the Moravská Sahara–Bzenec district, South Moravia, following a 2012 wildfire. This study investigated whether wildfire and intensive site preparation—specifically, disc trenching for replanting—could support the long‐term restoration and persistence of psammophilous beetle populations. Beetle assemblages (Coleoptera: Carabidae) were compared across six vegetation stages: (i) uprooted pine stand, afforested; (ii) uprooted pine stand, left to decay; (iii) semi‐decayed mid‐aged stand; (iv) affected mature stand; (v) unaffected mature stand; and (vi) unaffected mid‐aged pine stand. We recorded 25,468 ground‐dwelling beetles from 113 species. The findings suggest that wildfire shapes beetle assemblages by creating diverse habitats that support various beetle species. Habitat changes were associated with fire severity, successional stage and site preparation intensity, resulting in distinct species clusters. These results indicate that wildfires can be a valuable conservation tool for enhancing the diversity of early‐successional beetle assemblages. In open areas subjected to intensive site preparation for reforestation, beetle species gradually declined with no replacement, reflecting the homogeneous habitat structure. To promote species continuity, we recommend implementing low‐intensity repeat fires near mature stands. Consequently, increased forest canopy closure should not be regarded solely as regeneration but as a potential threat to species richness and diversity in these sandy habitats.",

Radiation quarantine treatments are unique in that insects are not killed immediately but rendered sterile or incapable of completing development. 2 The most tolerant insect stage to radiation is that which is most developed. Female insects, but not always mites, are sterilized with equal or lower doses than males. 3 Insects irradiated with sterilizing doses usually have shorter longevities than non‐irradiated ones. Low oxygen conditions often increase tolerance to radiation. 4 Insects in diapause are not more tolerant of radiation than non‐diapausing ones. 5 Some pests of several groups, such as aphids, whiteflies, weevils, scarab beetles, and fruit flies, may be controlled with doses ≤ 100 Gy. Some lepidopterous pests and most mites require about 300 Gy. Stored product moths may require as much as 1 kGy to sterilize, and nematodes could need &gt; 4 kGy. 6 Even though application of irradiation to pallet‐loads of produce could mean that up to three times the minimum required dose is applied to the perimeter of the pallet, many fresh commodities tolerate doses required for quarantine security against many quarantined pests. Irradiation is arguably the most widely applicable quarantine treatment from the standpoint of commodity quality.",

Bioassays with the mosquito Aedes atropalpus L. assessed the relative toxicity of the whole extract of Piper tuberculatum and four of the piperamides, which were isolated and identified, then prepared synthetically. The results confirm that P. tuberculatum leaf extracts are as effective as black pepper seed extract and provide an alternative pepper insecticide from a more convenient source, the leaves. Experiments with piperamides showed that the tertiary and quaternary mixtures have greater‐than‐additive toxicity compared to single compounds or binary mixtures. One of the four amide compounds, 4,5‐dihydropiperlonguminine, was the most acutely toxic in mosquito larvae bioassays. A study of piperamide levels from different P. tuberculatum populations in Costa Rica determined that they were relatively homogeneous . Piper tuberculatum from only one of the five sites had higher levels of one piperamide, 4,5‐dihydropiperine, in both leaf and stem parts. One explanation for differences in the amide concentrations between populations is that one site is ecologically unique compared to the other four.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 The presence and abundance of arthropods were compared in three olive orchards under organic, integrated and conventional management regimes. In each olive orchard, trees were sampled in the canopy by beating branches and soil arthropods by placing pitfall traps. Contrary to expectations, the highest abundance of arthropods occurred in the integrated management orchard. The most abundant groups were Formicidae and the species Euphyllura olivinae (Homoptera: Psyllidae). 2 Canopies and the soil under the tree canopy (interior soil) were selected as the most informative sites for sampling. The months with the strongest differences were May, June and July, especially June. In the canopy, Araneae, Coleoptera, Diptera, Heteroptera, Hymenoptera, Homoptera, Lepidoptera, Neuroptera and Thysanoptera were the most abundant, and showed significant differences in abundance among orchards with different management regimes. Moreover, in the canopies, Coleoptera and Lepidoptera showed a seasonal pattern of abundance and consistent significant differences between the organic orchard vs. the integrated and conventional ones in both years of study. In the soil, 12 orders showed significant differences in abundance among management regimes at some point of the sampling season. 3 In a search for biological indicators that could help to distinguish between management regimes, a discriminant analysis applied to the data indicated that only the samples from the canopy were classified according to their management regime in a consistent way over time. The groups selected by the analysis to establish differences among management regimes were Coleoptera, Diptera, Heteroptera, Lepidoptera and Thysanoptera. The analysis applied to compare organic vs. non‐organic olive orchards, again identified Coleoptera and Lepidoptera as suitable groups. The results suggest that these two orders are potential bioindicators to distinguish, in a simple way, organic olive orchards from non‐organic ones.",

Volatiles tested included 20 compounds emitted by undamaged potato plants ( Solanum tuberosum ), plants that had been artificially damaged, or plants damaged by feeding by CPB larvae. 2 Coupled gas chromatography/electroantennogram detector (GC/EAD) recordings revealed five compounds for which reliable responses were recorded from CPB antennae: ( E )‐2‐hexen‐1‐ol, ( Z )‐3‐hexen‐1‐ol, ( ± )‐linalool, nonanal, methyl salicylate, and indole. Both Pm and Pb responded selectively to the same compounds as the CPB with exceptions: (1) ( Z )‐3‐hexenyl butyrate elicited reliable responses for both Pm and Pb, and (2) ( E )‐2‐hexen‐1‐ol and ( Z )‐3‐hexen‐1‐ol were inactive for Pm and Pb under these conditions. Dose–response curves showed that CPB was at least 100 times more sensitive to ( E )‐2‐hexen‐1‐ol than were the predators. Both predators were more sensitive to each of the other compounds than were CPB. Both CPB and Pm were attracted to a five component blend comprising ( E )‐2‐hexen‐1‐ol, ( Z )‐3‐hexen‐1‐ol, ( ± )‐linalool, nonanal and methyl salicylate. However, attraction of CPB to the blend occurred only with lower doses of ( E )‐2‐hexen‐1‐ol and ( Z )‐3‐hexen‐1‐ol. 3 These results show that the herbivore (CPB) has olfactory receptors which are more sensitive to constitutive host plant volatiles, e.g. green leaf volatiles, while both generalist ( Pm ) and specialist ( Pb ) predators are more sensitive to systemic volatiles produced in response to prey feeding.

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 In response to herbivore attack, maize plants ( Zea mays L.) emit a specific blend of induced volatiles. Artificial damage and subsequent treatment of the damaged site with caterpillar regurgitant induces the same response. The induced volatile chemicals are known to be highly attractive to several parasitoids of herbivores in laboratory bioassays, but very limited information is available on how the plant odours affect entomophagous insects in the field. 2 Experiments were conducted to determine if induced maize volatiles attract parasitic and predatory insects under field conditions and whether they affect their spatial distribution. 3 In a preliminary field experiment with blue sticky traps near treated (damaged and treated with caterpillar regurgitant) and healthy plants, more entomophagous insects (total number of parasitic Hymenoptera, Anthocoridae and Syrphidae) were trapped near treated plants than near healthy plants. 4 In a second experiment, attraction to the induced volatiles was monitored with sticky traps placed next to treated and healthy maize plants in a regular maize field. No significant differences between the two treatments were found, but significantly more insects (parasitic wasps, thrips and anthocorid bugs) were trapped near to the top of plants than on traps placed near the mid‐stem. Displacement of these insect groups within the field seemed to occur principally over the canopy, but under severe weather conditions they travelled lower in the canopy. 5 In a third experiment, the effect of induced maize odours on the spatial distribution of predators and parasitoids was investigated by placing sticky traps at different distances from healthy and treated plants. The higher catches of parasitoids near treated plants and the increased presence of these insects on the downwind side of treated plants support the notion that herbivore‐induced maize odours attract natural enemies of maize pests in the field.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 Native natural enemies have the potential to control fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith) in tropical maize grown in Mexico, where this insect pest causes severe economic losses to farmers. It has been proposed that enhancing herbivore‐induced volatile emissions in maize plants may help to increase the effectiveness of natural enemies, which use these volatiles to locate their prey. This will only be of immediate benefit to farmers if the activity of the natural enemies results in a direct reduction in herbivory. Here we report on field surveys for the most common natural enemies in a tropical maize‐growing region in Mexico and the potential effects of these enemies on herbivory by fall armyworm. 2 Caterpillars were collected in maize fields near Poza Rica in the state of Veracruz during January and February 1999, 2000 and 2001. Plants were either naturally infested by S. frugiperda , or artificially infested with laboratory‐reared larvae. Ten species of parasitoids emerged from the collected larvae and eight species of predators that are known to feed on larvae and eggs were observed on the plants. Campoletis sonorensis (Cameron) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) was the dominant parasitoid species, in 1999 and 2001. 3 Of the nine larval parasitoids collected, six (all solitary) are known to reduce herbivory, whereas one causes the host to eat more (for two species this is not known). This implies that enhancing the effectiveness of solitary endoparasitoids may benefit subsistence farmers in developing countries by immediately reducing herbivory. The overall benefit for the plant resulting from parasitoid activity also has important implications for the evolutionary role of parasitoids in contributing to selection pressures that shape indirect defences in plants.",

Several studies were conducted with the objective of determining the difference in termite damage to maize in various land use systems between monoculture maize, maize grown using traditional fallows and improved fallows. 2 In an experiment conducted at four sites on noncoppicing fallows, maize planted after Tephrosia candida 02971 fallows had lower termite damage compared with fully fertilized monoculture maize. However, the termite suppression was not low enough to warrant rotation of noncoppicing fallows for termite management.. 3 In four experiments comparing termite damage to maize grown in monoculture and in coppicing fallows, fully fertilized monoculture maize had a higher percentage of lodged plants compared with maize grown in pure Leucaena leucocephala , Gliricidia sepium and Acacia anguistissima fallows or in a mixture of A. anguistissima + Sesbania sesban or Tephrosia vogelii + S. sesban . 4 More than 50–75% of the variance in maize yield was explained by preseason inorganic nitrogen and termite damage. However, termite damage to maize was not influenced by inorganic nitrogen, which represents nitrogen readily available to maize. The decomposition rate of biomass (related to lignin + polyphenol to nitrogen ratio) and water retention under fallows also appeared to influence termite damage. 5 It is concluded that maize grown in L. leucocephala , G. sepium , A. anguistissima and S. sesban fallows suffers less termite damage and produces maize yields comparable with conventionally tilled and fully fertilized monoculture maize.",

An outbreak of these beetles has infested over 0.5 million hectares of pine forests. 2 Efforts are underway to suppress this outbreak using biological control measures. However, the wide distribution in the native range of D. valens suggests regional variation of the beetle's biology, predators, and parasitoids. Thus, knowledge of the origin of these beetles can help devise precise and effective control measures. 3 A portion of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene was sequenced for 218 individuals from 32 populations throughout the native range of D. valens and in China. 4 Haplotype diversity was high. A total of 131 haplotypes were found and Jukes–Cantor corrected nucleotide difference ranged from 0 to 16%. Haplotype diversity ranged from 0.53 to 0.98 and unique haplotypes were found in most populations. 5 Parsimony and statistical parsimony analyses of these haplotypes support the hypothesis that the introduction of D. valens to China was recent and originated from the Pacific North‐west of the U.S.A. 6 In addition, the high haplotype diversity also suggests a large or multiple introductions. However, based on the genetics of the beetle's reproductive behaviour, this diversity may also be explained by a limited number of individuals or introductions.",

In most situations, diseases, predators and parasitoids act contemporaneously on insect pest populations and the impact of individual natural enemies, or specific groups of natural enemies, is difficult to interpret. These problems are exacerbated in agro‐ecosystems that are frequently disrupted by the application of insecticides. 2 A combination of life‐table and natural enemy exclusion techniques was utilized to develop a method for the assessment of the impact of endemic natural enemies on Plutella xylostella populations on commercial Brassica farms. 3 At two of the experimental sites, natural enemies had no impact on P. xylostella survival, at two other sites, natural enemy impact was low but, at a fifth site, natural enemies drastically reduced the P. xylostella population. 4 The calculation of marginal death rates and associated k ‐values allowed the comparison of mortality factors between experimental sites, and indicated that larval disappearance was consistently the most important mortality factor, followed by egg disappearance, larval parasitism and pupal parasitism. The appropriateness of the methods and assumptions made to calculate the marginal death rates are discussed. 5 The technique represents a robust and easily repeatable method for the analysis of the activity of natural enemies of P. xylostella , which could be adapted for the study of other phytophagous pests.",

In total, 13 390 arthropods were collected from 181 m 3 of hedge (2% of the total volume). The taxonomic diversity of the total sample included 51 families in 13 orders, all within the phylum Arthropoda. Five orders accounted for 90% of all arthropods: Araneae, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera and Hymenoptera. The predators were the dominant functional group accounting for 40% of the total sample. 2 The linear distribution of hedgerow arthropod assemblages was investigated by sampling arthropods in 13 hedges at seven equidistant points along each hedge. Abundance of most arthropod taxa and the four functional groups (predators, parasitoids, herbivores and scavengers) consistently showed a clumped distribution along hedges, with high numbers at both ends and in the middle section. Hedge ends were defined either as a node, where the hedge intersected with another hedge, or as a gateway prior to an adjacent landscape feature such as a wood. Aggregation of arthropods at the nodes may reflect preferable microclimatic conditions at hedgerow junctions, whereas aggregation at a gap suggests the gap acted as a barrier to movement. The aggregation at the centre remains unexplained but may be a manifestation of the movement of individual arthropods along the hedgerow. 3 The great abundance and diversity of arthropods found in the present study emphasizes the status of hedges as one of the most important noncrop habitats on farmland. The arthropods that they contain may act as food for other farmland species, aid pest control and contribute to crop pollination.",

A combination of daytime nest temperatures and night air temperatures determines the number of hours larvae are able to feed (hours above realized feeding threshold, RFT). 2 We tested the RFT‐based model for survival across multiple areas of the insect’s range in the Italian Alps over a 2‐year period. In a series of translocation experiments using natural temperature gradients as spatial analogues for global warming, we transferred colonies of T. pityocampa larvae to sites within zones of historical distribution, recent distribution, and outside the present range. The sites included traditional ( Pinus nigra , Pinus sylvestris ) as well as novel ( Pinus mugo , Pinus uncinata , Pinus cembra ) hosts. 3 Survival during precold (August to November), cold (December to February) and postcold (March to May) periods were analysed against climatic variables (temperature and rainfall) and predictors developed by the model. 4 Host species did not significantly affect final survival, with the exception of slower larval development, and resulting lower cold tolerance, on P. cembra than on P. mugo at the same site. 5 Across all the sites and hosts, final survival of colonies depended on the number of feeding hours during the cold period (RFT), which explained 82% of the variance in a regression model. We recommend using RFT, or its surrogate daily mean minimum temperature when nest temperature is not available, in predictive models of range expansion of T. pityocampa under climate change scenarios.",

By contrast, there is a growing body of empirical data from the application of high resolution molecular (DNA) markers that aphid asexual lineages rapidly mutate and that, in some documented cases, this variation is selectable, either positively or negatively. 2 Although it is true that, in enclosed conditions (e.g. laboratory or field cage), a so‐called clone as defined as the asexual progeny of a single foundress may be traceable, this is rarely if ever possible in the field without the use of genetic markers, and even then, usually only at a relatively few loci (multilocus genotypes, ‘MLGs’). 3 The continued use of the term clone without qualification of its true nature and the reality of its interesting biology is likely to hamper a proper understanding of the ecology and evolution of these insects (which are interesting in their own right because of their complex life histories, but also because they are important as major pests globally, both by causing direct feeding damage and by transmitting pathogenic plant viruses and thereby leading to huge economic losses in the agricultural, horticultural and forestry industries). 4 In this short review, I provide evidence of what is now known about aphid clonality after the widespread use of molecular markers, comprising information mainly gained within the last 15 years or so. 5 The data demonstrate widespread adaptation and evolution, sometimes involving introgression and hybridization. Because of this new knowledge, our ideas of what constitutes a clone are in need of serious re‐evaluation.",

Cacopsylla melanoneura also uses conifers as overwintering host plants but prefers to reproduce on hawthorn, despite its ability to reproduce on apple. 3 Both psyllid species used chemical cues for the identification of their alternate host plants during migration. Remigrants of C. melanoneura preferred the odour of their main reproduction host plant hawthorn to apple but preferred the odour of apple when experienced by feeding and oviposition. Although emigrants of C. picta reportedly prefer the odour of apple trees infected by Ca. P. mali, the remigrants of both species did not distinguish between the odours of infected or uninfected apple plants. 4 Investigating the distribution of Ca. P. mali in plant species involved in psyllid life cycle revealed that the phytoplasma is specialized on apple. 5 Infection of apple by Ca.

To the artificial diet, an aliquot of host (catechin, taxifolin, or resveratrol) or nonhost ( E‐ conophthorin) compounds was added, singly tested at doses close to those of tree bark. Host acceptance and tunnelling was measured by the amount of diet removed by the insects. 3 All tested chemicals decreased the tunnelling activity of I. typographus , with an antifeedant effect stronger in males and increasing with dose. No mortality was recorded. The nonhost volatile spiroketal, E‐ conophthorin, had the highest antifeedant activity both in males and females. Among host compounds, effects and dose–response were weak in females. Both catechin and E‐ conophthorin gave a 50% reduction of tunnelling at a concentration of 0.1% for males, the pioneering (host selecting) sex in Ips . The threshold of activity for host compounds to males was at concentrations of 0.03–0.1%, which corresponds to, or is less than, the concentrations reported from spruce host bark. 4 The results allow us to support the hypothesis of a direct behavioural antifeedant mechanism for resistance from those phenols that are particularly active for the pioneering males during tree attack.",

Colony nutritional requirements and temperature probably shape their seasonal foraging patterns. The daily activity pattern of P. schmitzii was strictly diurnal, whereas L. grandis and P. pallidula were active during the entire day. 5 The ants' diet in the canopies consisted principally of hemipteran honeydew, whereas citrus nectar and predation/scavenging did not represent important food sources.

Considering that trap attractiveness depends on kairomone concentrations, we appraised whether the trap efficiency was influenced by trap environment (openness and local supply of fresh dead wood). 3 Saproxylic beetles were sampled using 48 cross‐vane window flight traps, arranged in paired designs (alcohol‐baited/unbaited), in eight ancient and eight recent gaps (open stands), and eight closed‐canopy control stands in an upland beech forest in the French Pyrenees. 4 Baited traps were more efficient than unbaited traps in terms of abundance and richness in our deciduous forests. The ethanol lure did not have any repellent effect on the individual response of saproxylic taxa. 5 The influence of local environmental conditions on trap attractiveness was observed. Openness had a significant moderate effect on species richness. Trap attractiveness was slightly reduced in the alcohol‐saturated environment of recent gaps probably due to a disruption by local fresh dead‐wood concentrations of the kairomonal response of saproxylic beetles to baited traps (‘alcohol disruption’). 6 Because the ethanol lure enhanced the probability of species detection, it may be useful in early‐warning surveillance, monitoring and control of wood borers, despite slight influences of local conditions on baited trap efficiency.",

This bee is, however, a poor pollinator of several crops compared with native insects. Indeed, honey bees can displace native pollinators and reduce their diversity. The present study evaluated the potential impacts of A. mellifera on the diversity of native pollinators of highland coffee (Coffea arabica) and its putative consequences for coffee production at the state of Veracruz, Mexico. 2 The abundance of A. mellifera and diversity of native pollinators were assessed during blooming at 12 shade coffee plantations and pollination experiments were conducted to determine the impacts of pollinators on coffee fruit production. Regression analyses were used to assess whether the abundance of honey bees was related to native pollinator diversity, and whether fruit production was influenced by both the diversity of pollinators and the abundance of A. mellifera. 3 Native pollinator diversity decreased as the number of honey bees increased. Furthermore, although coffee fruit production was positively related to the diversity of native pollinators, an increasing abundance of A. mellifera was correlated with a decrease in fruit production. 4 Highland shade coffee plantations are considered as reservoirs of the Mexican insect fauna. Thus, native pollinator diversity could be better preserved if beekeepers reduced the number of managed hives that they brought into plantations. This may also help to increase coffee yield by decreasing the putative negative effects of A. mellifera on native pollinators.",

Measurements included total, small and large bee species richness and abundance; stability of total species richness and abundance (coefficient of variation, CV); the nitrogen content of fertilizers; the number of insecticide applications; within-field location; species richness and abundance of insect-pollinated plants; and the percentage of semi-natural areas in a 500-m radius circle around the fields under study. 3 Increasing the amount of fertilizer decreased total and small bee abundance and increased the CV of total bee abundance.

    "abstract": "The oak processionary moth Thaumetopoea processionea (Notodontidae) is presently distributed in almost all European countries and in part of the Middle East. In the North, its range limit passes through the Netherlands and Germany, and the southern part of Poland and Ukraine. In the South, the species is present in all the countries located on the northern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, in Anatolia, and in the mountains surrounding the Dead Sea Transform. Using information from museum and personal collections, the available literature and other relevant datasets, we show that the species was already largely distributed throughout Europe before 1920. The available data do not provide any evidence of any long‐term latitudinal shift of the species betwen 1750 and 2010. In the northernmost part of its range, the population dynamics of the species is characterized by important fluctuations. We studied their pattern in Belgium, the Netherlands and part of Germany, after the apparent regional disappearance of the species during the first half of the 20th Century. The data suggest a continuous extent of the apparent distribution of the insect between 1970 and 2009, at a rate of approximately 7.5 km per year. To explain the present distribution of the species, we discuss possible improvements of environmental conditions that could have triggered local population increases and favoured dispersal to adjacent areas. In addition, human activity, including the commercial movements of infested nursery trees, was recently suspected to be another source of spread over geographical barriers.",

    "abstract": "The rice leaffolder Cnaphalocrocis medinalis (Guenée) (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is a serious rice pest in Asia. The conspicuous foliar damage caused by C. medinalis larvae leads to early‐season insecticide applications that disrupt the biological control of this and other pest species. Despite the often dramatic impact of C. medinalis , rice plants can tolerate severe defoliation with no impact on grain yield, although persuading farmers to withhold insecticide application has proven very difficult. The present review assesses the prevention of damage caused by C. medinalis via biological control using parasitoids. Information on the indigenous parasitoids of C. medinalis is drawn together for the first time from the non‐English literature published in Asia. This is integrated with the wider English language literature to provide a comprehensive analysis of the parasitoid fauna. Survey studies have been conducted in many Asian countries in recent decades, showing that parasitoids of rice pests can achieve high rates of parasitism but are far from consistent as a mortality factor. There is much less work available on the biology of leaffolder parasitoids in rice and there is an unexpected dearth of studies regarding increasing their performance by providing nectar sources, which is a widely explored approach for other crop systems. It is concluded that the recently reported work in which nectar plants are established on rice bunds to support planthopper parasitoids may have significant benefit for leaffolder parasitoids. The use of plant species, however, that are selective in not allowing adult moths to feed will be essential.",

    "abstract": "The pine weevil Hylobius abietis is widely distributed in the Palaearctic region where it is a major pest. Although predominantly semi‐voltine, with a 2‐year life cycle, the generation time across its range can vary from 1 to 4 years. The duration of the life cycle and the seasonal timing of weevil activity affect the economic impact and management of this pest, all of which are likely to change in a warming climate. To determine the effect of temperature and tree species on weevil growth and development, laboratory experiments were performed with eggs, larvae, prepupae, pupae and adults, using, as appropriate, the host species Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. and Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr. under constant or alternating temperatures. The development rate was linearly related to temperature, with developmental thresholds for eggs, larvae and pupae of 8, 4.5 and 7.3 °C, respectively. Day‐degrees were estimated for each life stage. Larval development was affected by tree species, being slower on Sitka spruce than on Scots pine, and was faster under alternating than constant temperatures. The development time for prepupae was highly variable, with an apparent facultative prepupal diapause initiated by temperature. The temperature range 20–17.5 °C marked the transition between median prepupal development times of approximately 25 and 90 days. The prepupal stage may serve to minimize the risk of overwintering mortality in the pupal stage and help to synchronize the life cycle. Larval and adult mass was positively related to developmental temperature, demonstrating an inverse temperature size rule, and weevils were heavier when developing on Scots pine than Sitka spruce. Development in alternating temperatures reduced weevil mass on Scots pine. The influence of temperature on weevil mass is likely to have a positive effect on fecundity and overwintering survival. The effects of climate change on development, voltinism and weevil mass are discussed.",

Among susceptible Lauraceae hosts are redbay Persea borbonia and avocado Persea americana. There is a crucial need for detection of this pest as it moves into new areas. Consequently, our goal was to create a better lure for the monitoring and control of redbay ambrosia beetle. We analyzed volatile emissions of R. lauricola, created a synthetic odour blend based on this analysis and tested this odour blend as a potential attractant in a redbay forest infested with X. glabratus. The synthetic Raffaelea odour blend was not attractive to the beetles by itself. However, it synergistically increased attraction to host-mimic volatiles. We tested four commercial release devices for dispensing Raffaelea odour at various release rates. Two prototypes with the highest release rate, when paired with commercial manuka oil lures, captured more beetles than manuka oil lures alone. These results indicate that a synthetic blend of volatiles based on the odour of the symbiotic fungus of X. glabratus may be useful for the development of more sensitive monitoring lures for this invasive pathogen vector.",

To increase knowledge about its seasonal flight patterns and about the thermal sums required for emergence, a study was conducted in southern S weden from 2006 to 2010. Seasonal flight patterns were recorded by pheromone traps and development was recorded by felling trees three times during each season. Flight began, on average, on 27 A pril [after 47 degree‐days (dd) &gt; 5 °C]. More than 50% of flight activity occurred after mid‐ J une, and this continued to mid‐ A ugust. Re‐emergence of parental beetles after they had produced the first brood started, on average, on 24 M ay (after 122 dd). Continued flight and oviposition demonstrated that sister broods were frequent. A higher proportion of parental beetles re‐emerged from trees colonized in M ay (95%) than in J uly (20%). Beetles that colonized trees late had to accumulate a higher thermal sum before re‐emerging (400 dd). Filial beetles began to emerge, on average, on 29 J une (after 437 dd) and started to fly in early J uly, giving rise to at least a partial second generation in each year. A higher proportion of filial beetles had emerged from trees colonized in M ay (75%) than in J uly (15%). Knowledge of these region‐specific flight patterns and the associated thermal sums required for emergence will facilitate efficient pest management by enabling timely removal of fallen and standing weakened host trees. The obtained data will also be useful for improving models that predict the population dynamics in a warmer climate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plant domestication can alter species interactions and influence novel associations among crops and insects. We performed a series of preference and performance experiments to test predator and herbivore attraction to domesticated and wild plants and to evaluate the efficacy of herbivore‐induced plant volatiles (HIPVs) across a domestication gradient in tomato, including wild relatives, landraces and domesticated commercial cultivars. We employed a tri‐trophic system consisting of the specialist lepidopteran herbivore Manduca sexta and two of its natural enemies: an egg predator, the stilt bug Jalysus wickhami , and a larval parasitoid, the wasp Cotesia congregata . In olfactometer trials, natural enemies consistently preferred HIPVs of wild tomatoes over domesticated cultivars, with landraces in between. Plant‐domestication effects were also apparent in terms of decision speed: predators were slower to orient towards damaged crops than to damaged wild relatives. By contrast, M. sexta moths were more likely to oviposit on domesticated than on wild or landrace tomatoes, indicating that insect responses to plant odours vary with trophic level. Field trials confirmed olfactory preference tests: caterpillars recovered from wild tomato relatives were more likely to be parasitized than those recovered from landraces or domesticated tomatoes. The results of the present study suggest that tomato domestication has reduced the efficacy of HIPVs in attracting predators compared with wild relatives and also that this decreased attraction leads to lower attack rates by enemies in the field. This outcome has implications for understanding the specificity of tri‐trophic plant defences and the compatibility of natural enemies for biocontrol in agro‐ecosystems.",

The flowers of Borago officinalis , Echium plantagineum , Phacelia tanacetifolia and Diplotaxis tenuifolia were attractive to bees, whereas Calendula arvensis , Coriandrum sativum , D. tenuifolia and Lobularia maritima were attractive to hoverflies. A floral mixture resulted in a lower attractiveness efficiency to pollinators than D. tenuifolia , but higher than when compared with most of the mono‐specific stands. On the other hand, although some of the most attractive plant species ( P. tanacetifolia and C. arvensis) showed potential weediness, their self‐seeding was reduced by tillage treatment. Diplotaxis tenuifolia was the only plant with a high attractiveness efficiency to pollinators and efficient self‐reproduction. Therefore, D. tenuifolia is highly recommended species for attracting bees and hoverflies in agro‐ecosystems of Central Spain.",

Analyses of recent records, MaxEnt models and regional population size estimates are used to discuss its peculiar range shifts and potential as a forest pest in Northern Europe. Ips amitinus was probably absent in northern glacial refugia for Norway spruce in the Russian plain and northward expansions from its glacial refugia in the Central European mountains may have been slowed down by: (i) ecological barriers of post‐glacial dry plains and bogs in Central Europe; (ii) heavy utilization of conifers; and (iii) Allee effects as a result of fragmented forests and an unfavourable climate for a cold‐adapted species in the continental lowlands. MaxEnt models predict that I. amitinus may become widespread in the Northern European forests, whereas its populations in the southernmost mountain ranges of Europe may decline in the future. The population levels of I. amitinus in recently invaded northern areas are still lower than those in core areas of Central Europe, although the population development in Central Europe indicates that future bark beetle outbreak periods may boost the I. amitinus populations in Northern Europe as well.",

The model includes the effects of temperature, day‐length and fruit stage on moth development rates, survival and fecundity. Daily weather data for 1980–2010 were used to simulate the dynamics of grapevine and L. botrana in 4506 lattice cells across the region. Average grape yield and pupae per vine were used as metrics of favourability. The results were mapped using the grass Geographic Information System ( http://grass.osgeo.org ). The model predicts a wide distribution for L. botrana with highest populations in warmer regions in a wide band along latitude 40° N . The effects of climate warming on grapevine and L. botrana were explored using regional climate model projections based on the A1B scenario of an average +1.8 °C warming during the period 2040–2050 compared with the base period (1960–1970). Under climate change, grape yields increase northwards and with a higher elevation but decrease in hotter areas. Similarly, L. botrana levels increase in northern areas but decrease in the hot areas where summer temperatures approach its upper thermal limit.",

In recent years, it has subsequently spread rapidly and population outbreaks have been observed in several European countries. In the present study, we summarize the steps of its expansion. To predict its potential host range, we checked 48 oak species in 20 sentinel gardens in seven countries between 2013 and 2018. In total, 27 oak species were recorded as suitable hosts; 13 of them are globally new ones, 23 out of the 29 in section Quercus (∼ white oaks, an intrageneric taxonomic unit within genus Quercus ), including Asian oaks, native to Japan, Korea and China, and four out of five in section Cerris (another intrageneric unit of the same genus), were accepted as hosts. None of the species in section Lobatae (red oaks) or in the Ilex group was accepted. Host records were also collected in forest stands of 10 countries. We found 11 oak species that were infested. Outbreak populations were most commonly found on Quercus robur , Quercus frainetto , Quercus petraea and Quercus cerris , comprising widespread and outstandingly important oaks species in Europe. Based on our findings, we conclude that suitable hosts for oak lace bug are present in most of Europe and Asia. This means that a lack of hosts will likely not restrict further range expansion.",

The results showed that the supercooling point of overwintering larvae decreased initially before increasing subsequently with seasonal changes in ambient temperature. Fresh mass and glycogen tended to decrease initially and then reached their minimum levels in J anuary. Total amounts of low molecular weight substances and free amino acids in the haemolymph increased gradually as the ambient temperature decreased.

The concentrations of serine, phenylalanine, valine, leucine, proline, glutamic acid and alanine all reached their highest level in the colder winter months.

We conducted a meta‐analysis to quantify the impacts of different non‐crop habitats around fruit farms on SWD populations, comparing abundance of SWD trapped in crop and non‐crop habitats. Overall, SWD abundance was greater in non‐crop habitats than in cropped areas and this difference was greatest in farms adjacent to woodland, or field margins containing known SWD host plants.

However, certain habitats support greater relative abundance of SWD than others and this is also affected by farm management. We discuss what these findings mean for effective control of SWD.",

Local movement between pepper flowers also was quantified to examine how population attributes of the predator allow suppression of rapidly moving populations of prey. 2 Randomized complete block experiments established in the autumn of 1998 and the spring of 1999 included treatments of biological and synthetic insecticides, which altered the population densities of predator and prey. Numbers of O. insidiosus in relation to prey were sufficient in 1998 to prevent build‐up of thrips populations. In 1999, populations of thrips were unable to recover from near extinction owing to persistence of the predator. The predator rapidly recolonized plots treated with insecticide. 3 Greenhouse plants of the same age as field plants were used to monitor movement by predators and prey. Movement by F. occidentalis was limited, whereas F. tritici and F. bispinosa moved rapidly to the greenhouse plants. The males of each thrips species moved more rapidly than the females. There was evidence that rapid movement assisted F. tritici and F. bispinosa in avoiding predation, but O. insidiosus also moved very rapidly to the greenhouse plants. This attribute explains the predator's ability to suppress thrips rapidly even when populations are rapidly colonizing and reproducing in the flowers.",

Feeding by L. oryzophilus larvae resulted in extensive damage to root systems. Pruning of root systems resulted in a decrease in tiller number and shoot biomass of rice plants in the vegetative stage of growth. 3 Yield losses were due to a combination of decreases in panicle densities, numbers of grains per panicle, and grain weights. Decreases in panicle densities were a direct result of the reductions in tiller numbers. Reductions in numbers of grains per panicle and grain weights probably resulted from decreases in shoot biomass. 4 Injury by rice water weevil larvae is chronic. The tillering stage of rice suffered the majority of weevil damage, but the growth effects were not manifested until later.",

A higher weed cover due to reduced herbicide applications probably benefited most species, except those having habitat associations with sparse vegetation such as the field‐inhabiting Bembidion and Synuchus .

One of the greatest challenges facing the successful management of the pest is the ability to accurately detect its presence in a tree. 2 Observations were made on A. planipennis larval feeding galleries found within 65 young, green‐ash trees cut from plantations in Essex County, Ontario, Canada. The within‐tree distributions of feeding galleries were described in relation to height‐above‐ground, stem diameter, bark thickness and stem aspect. 3 Galleries were not distributed randomly or evenly; minimum boundaries of stem diameter and bark thickness and a maximum boundary of height‐above‐ground were detected. Indications of maximum boundaries for stem diameter and bark thickness were also observed. Galleries were found most often on the south‐west side of the tree. 4 Using the technique of upper boundary regression, we were able to identify significant quadratic relationships between A. planipennis gallery density and stem diameter and bark thickness, as well as a significant negative linear relationship between gallery density and height‐above‐ground. 5 Agrilus planipennis gallery density in newly‐infested trees was lower than in previously‐infested trees, and was observed to peak at smaller stem diameters and bark thicknesses than in previously‐infested trees. 6 Survey teams would increase their probability of detecting new A. planipennis infestations by initiating searches for exit holes and feeding galleries in trunk sections and branches of approximately 7 cm in diameter.",

Sticky traps of different colours (yellow, red, blue, and white) were also compared. The behaviour of males and females was tested for all those conditions. 3 Abundance was greater in normal than in low plant density conditions, and a positive relationship was found between number of plants per square metre and presence of S. titanus . Leafhoppers did not appear capable of spreading significantly outside a vineyard. Few individuals were trapped above the canopy. Red sticky traps caught more individuals than white, yellow or blue, with the latter showing a poor attractiveness. Sex ratio was almost always male biased. 4 Scaphoideus titanus is monophagous and appears incapable of great dispersal away from its host plant, and females are less likely to fly than males.

Several indigenous parasitoids have colonized this new host, but parasitism remains low. One of the hypotheses suggested to explain the low parasitism is that candidate parasitoids emerge too early in spring to attack the first host generation and, thus, need early‐occurring leaf miners as alternate hosts. This hypothesis was tested by observing the synchronization between the phenology of the moth and that of its main parasitoids, and by comparing parasitism rates and parasitoid richness in different environments with various levels of biological diversity. In spring, the bulk of the parasitoids emerge at least 5 weeks before the occurrence of the first suitable larvae of C. ohridella whereas most parasitoid adults reared outdoors die within 5 weeks after emergence. Parasitism rates and parasitoid richness do not increase with biological diversity, suggesting that most parasitoids attacking the first generation of C. ohridella do not come from alternate hosts. Parasitism does not increase later in the year in the subsequent generations, when host‐parasitoid synchronization becomes less critical. We conclude that, although the spring emergence of parasitoids is not synchronized with the phenology of C. ohridella , the parasitoids attacking the first generation are probably old or late‐emerging adults of the overwintering generation. The lack of synchronization is probably not the only reason for the poor recruitment of native parasitoids by C. ohridella .",

We used, for the first time, a stable isotope approach to assess dispersal of adult Agriotes obscurus in arable land. 2 After a diet switch from a C3‐ to a C4‐plant, carbon isotope ratios of A. obscurus larvae significantly changed towards the isotopic signature of the new diet. Moreover, the larval δ 13 C signatures were transferred to the wing covers of the adult beetles with little distortion. 3 To assess the dispersal abilities under natural conditions, pheromone traps, lured for Agriotes sp., were installed at two study sites in Western Austria. Each site comprised a maize field (= C4‐plant) and adjacent C3‐grasslands with traps established along a transect of increasing distance to the maize. 4 δ 13 C signatures of wing covers revealed that adult male A. obscurus were able to migrate at least 80 m, which was the maximum distance that dispersal could be traced in the present study. The dispersal behaviour might have been influenced by site‐specific factors. 5 The results obtained demonstrate a higher potential of adult male Agriotes to disperse than previously assumed. Moreover, the combination of pheromone trapping and stable isotope analysis proved to be an effective approach to study insect movement and dispersal in arable systems harbouring C3‐ and C4‐crops.",

Leaf chemistry was also assessed in re‐flushed leaves and 2 years post‐outbreak. 3 Early in the season, differences in defoliation among clones were substantial but, by mid‐June, all clones were completely defoliated. Leaf nitrogen, condensed tannins, and phenolic glycosides varied among clones but did not relate to defoliation levels. Budbreak phenology differed by 3 weeks among clones and clones that broke bud early or late relative to forest tent caterpillar eclosion experienced reduced rates of defoliation. 4 Defoliation led to increased tannins and slight decreases in phenolic glycoside concentrations in damaged leaf remnants, but to moderately decreased tannins and a six‐fold increase in phenolic glycosides in reflushed leaves. This shift in chemical composition may significantly affect late season herbivores. 5 These results suggest that aspen chemical resistance mechanisms are ineffective during intense episodic eruptions of outbreak folivores such as the forest tent caterpillar. Variable budbreak phenology may lead to differential susceptibility during less intense outbreak years and, at peak forest tent caterpillar population densities, mechanisms affording tolerance are probably more important than chemical defences.",

Parts of North America are considered to be high risk for S. noctilio invasion. Effective detection tools, including trap trees, are needed to monitor and survey S. noctilio populations. The present study was conducted to determine the optimal time to chemically stress a tree when aiming to attract the most S. noctilio to the host substrate, as well as to determine which timing produced the most adult progeny. Both of these measures (host attraction and host suitability for development) support the main objectives of the study by offering improved methods for monitoring and management of S. noctilio . Red pine ( Pinus resinosa ) and Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) were treated with Dicamba at three time intervals. Multiple funnel lindgren traps were placed on these trees and, at the end of the flight season, the treatment trees were felled and brought into the laboratory. The number of S. noctilio caught in the traps (host attraction) and the number of S. noctilio emerged from the treated trees (host suitability) were determined. Optimal timing of the chemical girdle was dependent on host species. Significantly more female S. noctilio were captured on trap trees prepared 1 month before flight (red pine and Scots pine) or prepared at flight (Scots pine) compared with other treatments. There were also significantly more females reared from Scots pine trap trees prepared at flight and red pine trap trees prepared 1 month before and/or at flight. By the beginning of August, most (79%) of the S. noctilio for the flight season were caught in the traps at the trap trees. The sex ratio (males : females) was closer to 1 : 1 than previously reported in studies from other countries. The results obtained in the present study demonstrate that timing is important when creating a trap tree with herbicide in North America, whether for the purpose of detection or as part of a biological control effort.",

We studied the effects of instability of the cotton agroecosystem resulting from the temporary availability of the plant resource and the repeated use of insecticides on the genetic variability of the cotton aphids. 2 Samples of A. gossypii were collected in cotton plots, treated or not with insecticides and from vegetable crops (Malvaceae, Cucurbitaceae and Solanaceae) within the cotton growing area of northern Cameroon. The genetic structure of the samples was assessed using eight microsatellite markers. Insecticide resistance was estimated through the detection of two mutations in the ace ‐1 gene that are associated with insensitivity of acetylcholinesterase to carbamate and organophosphate insecticides. 3 The results obtained show that both host plants and insecticides act in genetic structuring of A. gossypii . Ninety‐three percent of aphids collected on cotton were characterized by the same microsatellite multilocus genotype, Burk1 , which also displays the insecticide resistant alleles. 4 During the dry season, the cotton crop season after, the genotype Burk1 was principally found on two other malvaceous cultivated plants, rosella and okra, acting as suitable reservoir plants. The ability of the cotton aphid to move among asynchronous suitable habitats in response to changes in resource availability enables the pest to exploit unstable cropping systems. An understanding of the cotton aphid life system may aid to improve strategies for integrated resistance management.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 The production of new insect pheromones for pest monitoring proceeds at a greater rate than their evaluation, with the consequential possibility of premature introduction. Fundamental to their successful deployment is the determination of a consistent relationship between adult male pheromone trap catches and pest damage. In the present study, adult pheromone traps and larval bait traps were used to examine spatial relationships between two species of Agriotes beetle and wireworms at the field scale. 2 The spatial distributions of adult male Agriotes lineatus and Agriotes obscurus in two fields were determined and compared with the distribution of their larvae. Data were assembled as spatially referenced trap counts, and analysed for evidence of aggregation and clustering using Spatial Analysis by Distance IndicEs (SADIE) methodology. Spatial stabilities of adult populations between sampling dates were tested using association tests. Spatial and quantitative linkages between adult and larval trap catches were also tested. Moreover, a new way of adapting SADIE methodologies is presented for situations where two datasets within an area do not share the same sampling points. 3 There was no significant difference in variance : mean relationships for the two species but there were differences in their spatial distributions, and this is a definitive example of the general argument stating that it is important to consider spatial as well as count data in ecological studies. The spatial distribution of A. lineatus varied between sampling occasions at both sites whereas A. obscurus had consistently significant SADIE indices over time at one site, and adult catches could also be linked to larval distributions and counts. It is proposed that observed differences between the two species can be explained by interference between traps and dissimilar movement rates. There was some evidence of an edge effect at the field boundaries. 4 The distance between pheromone traps is related to the time that elapses before adjacent traps interfere with trap captures and this limits the detection of statistically significant spatial patterns. It is shown that the current practice of adding trap counts for different Agriotes species and treating them as numerically equivalent is insufficiently robust to be recommended at this stage. 5 The implications for the use of sex pheromone traps in wireworm pest management are considered. It is concluded that pheromone traps, as currently used, will not reliably indicate where wireworms occur in a field, and that the complexity of interpreting adult male trap counts limits quantitative predictions of population size.",

This hypothesis was tested using mark–release–recapture methods to estimate the maximum sampling range and the effective sampling area of traps for three species. 2 Captured beetles of the species Agriotes lineatus , Agriotes obscurus and Agriotes sputator were marked to show the direction of release, the distance of the release point from the trap and the replicate. Analysis of variance showed that there were significant differences in recapture rates between species and release distances. There were no significant differences between release direction and replicates. 3 Calculated linear speeds suggested differences in movement rates in the order: A. lineatus &gt; A. obscurus &gt; A. sputator . There were also substantial differences between the species in the maximum sampling ranges and effective sampling areas of the traps. These placed the species in the same order. 4 The results are used to estimate the minimum cost of mass trapping programmes to prevent males from mating, giving values of €165/ha/year ( A. lineatus ), €247.5/ha/year ( A. obscurus ) and €2343/ha/year ( A. sputator ). 5 Implications for the use of pheromone traps in wireworm pest management are discussed. It is concluded that current U.K. recommendations based on the cumulative total catch of the three species over a sampling season can be improved by considering the spatial relationships between the adult trapping system and larval distribution.

The present study aimed to determine which gap and landscape characteristics are correlated with the probability of colonization of wind‐felled Norway spruce trees by I. typographus . The study included 36 storm gaps, varying in size from three to 1168 wind‐felled spruces, created by the storm Gudrun in southern Sweden in January 2005. In the first summer, on average, 5% of the wind‐felled spruces were colonized by I. typographus . The percentage of colonized wind‐felled trees per gap was negatively correlated with the total area of storm gaps within 2000 m in the surrounding forest landscape. In the second summer, the proportion of colonized trees increased to 50%. Both gap (mean diameter of wind‐felled trees and basal area of living spruce trees) and landscape variables (amount of spruce forest) were significantly correlated with colonization percentage and explained almost 50% of the variation between gaps. There was no relationship between gap area and colonization percentage. This implies that landscapes with many large storm gaps, where logging resources will be most effectively used, should be salvaged first.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 There is ample evidence that the life history and population dynamics of aphids are closely linked to plant phenology. Based on life table studies, it has been proposed that the growth of aphid populations could be modeled with an exponential growth model, with r decreasing linearly with time. This model has never been tested under field conditions. 2 The soybean aphid Aphis glycines is a new invasive pest to soybean production in the U.S.A. In the present study, we present five datasets on the growth of colonies of A. glycines , monitored during population growth and decline under predator‐free conditions in three soybean fields, from 2003 to 2006. 3 We demonstrate that an exponential growth model, with r decreasing linearly with time, gives a much better description of A. glycines dynamics for all datasets ( R 2 = 0.94–0.99) than the exponential ( R 2 = 0.42–0.98) or logistic growth models ( R 2 = 0.77–0.99). Furthermore, it is shown by cross‐validation that the exponential model with decreasing r can be used to make population predictions, as shown by the coefficient of prediction, ranging from 0.55 to 0.97. An improved fit of the model was obtained using both aphid ( ) and soybean ( ) degree‐days scales, indicating temperature effects on the phenological time scale for the decrease in r . 4 Our model suggests important bottom‐up control of A. glycines population growth, which may interact with other mortality factors. The generality and potential applications of these results are discussed.",

Less still is known about the impacts on pollination, comprising the ecosystem service that pollinators provide to wildflowers and crops. The present study measured flower visitation and pollination in an agricultural landscape, by placing potted flowering plants ( Petunia sp.) in vine fields sprayed with a highly toxic insecticide (fenitrothion). During two sampling rounds, insect visitors to the petunias were observed and measures of pollination were recorded by counting and weighing seeds. In the earlier sampling round, a lower species richness of insect visitors was observed in fields that had received an early application of insecticide. No negative impacts were found from later applications. The results obtained suggest a greater potential harm to insect pollinators and flower visitation as a result of insecticide application early in the season. No reduction in pollination was found in fields that received an early insecticide application. Pollination was greater with two insecticide applications between sampling rounds rather than one application. In the present study system, insecticide application had a negative effect on pollinators but a possible positive effect on pollination services. In some cases, it may be that actions for conserving biodiversity will not benefit pollination services to all plants.",

    "abstract": "Rising economic demands for boreal forest resources along with current and predicted increases in wildfire activity have increased salvage logging of burned forests. Currently, the ecological consequences of post‐fire salvage logging are insufficiently understood to develop effective management guidelines or to adequately inform policy decision‐makers. We used both field and laboratory studies to examine the effects of post‐fire salvage logging on populations of the white‐spotted sawyer Monochamus scutellatus scutellatus (Say) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) and its ecological function in boreal forest. Monochamus s. scutellatus adults were relatively abundant in both burned and clear‐cut logged sites but were absent from salvage logged sites. An in situ mesocosm experiment showed that the abundance of M. s. scutellatus larvae in burned white spruce bolts was linked to changes in total organic nitrogen and carbon in mineral soil. Organic nutrient inputs in the form of M. s. scutellatus frass increased mineral soil microbial respiration rates by more than three‐fold and altered the availability of nitrogen. Changes in nitrogen availability corresponded with decreased germination and growth of Epilobium angustifolium and Populus spp. but not Calamagrostis canadensis . Although the present study focused on local scale effects, the reported findings suggest that continued economic emphasis on post‐fire salvage logging may have implications beyond the local scale for biodiversity conservation, nutrient cycling and plant community composition in forest ecosystems recovering from wildfire.",

The present study investigated the survival at low temperature of larvae originating from a population with range expansion in an alpine valley in Northern Italy. 2 The supercooling point of individually analysed larvae averaged at −7 °C. This value insufficiently described the cold hardiness of the larvae; 39% of the tested larvae were alive when returned to room temperature immediately after freezing. When larval colonies inside their nest were exposed to −17 °C for 1 h after gradual temperature decrease, survival was 70.4%. 3 Rearing of larvae in the laboratory at different day/night temperatures indicated an effect of cumulative chill injury on larvae. A logistic regression explained the relationship between negative thermal sum (h°C below 0 °C) received in the laboratory experiment and larval survival. A similar relationship was demonstrated between negative thermal sum and survival of larval colonies in the field. 4 In the laboratory experiment, some tested larvae were able to survive for up to 8 weeks without feeding depending on rearing temperature. As expected, feeding occurred only when larvae were reared at temperatures of 9 °C day/0 °C night. 5 We classify the larvae of T. pityocampa as being moderate freezing tolerant.

The known natural enemies of Delia spp., Bembidion spp. and Aleochara bipustulata showed a strong response to a cultivation system with higher activity‐densities in the monoculture. The response, however, appeared to be caused primarily by habitat preferences and not by D. floralis egg densities. The reduction in the number of D. floralis pupae in the intercropping may be explained by a disruption in oviposition behaviour caused by the presence of clover because neither predation, nor parasitization rates differed between cultivation systems.",

Traps were regularly inspected over approximately 1 month. The percentage of recaptured beetles was calculated and analyzed using analysis of variance. Maximum sampling ranges and effective sampling areas were calculated. 3 Averaged over all five trials and distances, approximately 40% of the released beetles (A. lineatus and A. obscurus) were recaptured. The percentage recapture of male adults was significantly affected by release distance, whereas no differences were found for species and release direction. 4 Males were recaptured from all release points and the percentage recapture decreased (in part significantly) with increasing distance from 76% (2 m) to 35% (15 m) and 9% (60 m), respectively. Most of the beetles were recaptured within the first 3 days after release, independent of the distance, except 60 m. The effective sampling area for A. lineatus was 1089 m2 after 12 days and increased to 1735 m2 after 30 days. Corresponding values for A. obscurus were considerably higher: 1518 m2 for 12 days and 2633 m2 for 30 days. 5 We conclude that the range of attraction of the pheromone traps for A. lineatus and A. obscurus is comparatively low, providing high percentage recapture only for release distances up to 10 m. Accordingly, any approach targeted on preventing mating by male mass trapping would require a dense network of pheromone traps.",

    "abstract": "1 Aphids are the major group of insects that vector plant viruses, and they often display a preference for foliage showing disease symptoms. Although this behaviour will increase the numbers of vectors acquiring the pathogen, it will not in itself result in a greater spread of the disease. 2 The present study examined how infection of Vicia faba by the nonpersistently transmitted virus bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) affected colonization by pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum. We then examined how foraging by the hymenopterous parasitoid Aphidius ervi affected aphid settling/movement behaviour and the consequences for dissemination of the virus. 3 In Petri dish arenas, aphids colonized discs from BYMV-infected leaves more rapidly than discs from uninfected plants. Reflectance from infected foliage was approximately 20% higher than from uninfected leaves in the green–yellow wavelengths, indicating that aphids might be responding to visual cues from the brighter foliage. Settling was reduced by A. ervi, with the foraging wasps preventing the aphids reaching and/or remaining on the leaf tissue. 4 In multiple plant arenas, A. ervi caused a reduction in aphid numbers but also a nine-fold increase in BYMV infection. It is hypothesized that disturbance by the parasitoids resulted in more aphid movement as well as more cases of aphids probing on a BYMV-infected plant and then a new host within the critical time period for successful inoculation to occur. This effect of parasitoids on virus dispersal should be considered in epidemiological models of insect-vectored plant diseases, and also when evaluating the use of natural enemies in biocontrol strategies of insect herbivore/vector pests.",

We conducted a 2‐year field study investigating the effects of organic slow‐release and conventional fertilizers on cereal aphids, hymenopteran parasitoids and syrphid predators and considered how the effects of fertilizers on barley morphology and colour might influence these species. Barley yield was greater in conventionally fertilized pots. Barley morphology was also affected by treatment: vegetative growth was greater under conventional treatments. Barley receiving organic fertilizers or no fertilizer was visually more attractive to aphids compared with plants receiving conventional fertilizers. Aphids were more abundant in conventionally fertilized barley but the reason for this increased abundance was species specific. Metopolophium dirhodum was responding to fertilizer effects on plant morphology, whereas Rhopalosiphum padi was sensitive to the temporal availability of nutrients. Syrphid eggs were more numerous in conventionally fertilized pots, whereas the response of parasitoids appeared to be dependent on the abundance of aphids, although the number of parasitoid mummies was low in both years. This research shows that the fertilizer treatment used can affect numerous characteristics of plant growth and colour, which can then influence higher trophic levels.

Deriving hypothesis of contemporary and/or future potential distributions of insect pests and invasive species is becoming an important tool for predicting the spatial structure of potential threats. The western corn rootworm (WCR) Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte is a pest of maize in North America that has invaded Europe in recent years, resulting in economic costs in terms of maize yields in both continents. The present study aimed to estimate the dynamics of potential areas of invasion by the WCR under a climate change scenario in the Northern Hemisphere. The areas at risk under this scenario were assessed by comparing, using complementary approaches, the spatial projections of current and future areas of climatic favourability of the WCR. Spatial hypothesis were generated with respect to the presence records in the native range of the WCR and physiological thresholds from previous empirical studies. We used a previously developed protocol specifically designed to estimate the climatic favourability of the WCR. We selected the most biologically relevant climatic predictors and then used multidimensional envelope (MDE) and Mahalanobis distances (MD) approaches to derive potential distributions for current and future climatic conditions. The results obtained showed a northward advancement of the upper physiological limit as a result of climate change, which might increase the strength of outbreaks at higher latitudes. In addition, both MDE and MD outputs predict the stability of climatic favourability for the WCR in the core of the already invaded area in Europe, which suggests that this zone would continue to experience damage from this pest in Europe.",

Two basal resources with pronounced differences in carbon isotope signatures, wheat litter (C3 plant) and maize litter (C4 plant), were used to uncover differences in food web properties between the two farming systems (conventional versus organic). 2 Predators incorporated significantly higher proportions of carbon from wheat sources in organically managed fields, suggesting that they were more closely linked to wheat-consuming prey in this system. The δ15N values of three predaceous species were more than 2‰ greater in summer than in spring. 3 The results obtained suggest that generalist predators consumed higher proportions of herbivore prey in the organic system and that starvation and intraguild predation rates increased in some predator species with time. 4 Because the effects of farming system and sampling date on predators were species-specific, conserving a diverse natural enemy community including species with different phenologies and sensitivities to management practices may, in the long term, be a good strategy for maintaining high pest suppression throughout the growing season.",

The symptoms were similar to previous events reported throughout the 20th Century. One current hypothesis is that these phenomena were related to early frost events for which the trees were physiologically unprepared and which made them vulnerable to biotic attacks. In the present study, we aimed to test this hypothesis further, by retrospective meteorological analyses and also by an experimental approach. Our meteorological analyses highlighted the occurrence of cold waves a year before the beech declines were reported in 1929, 1942 and 1998. In our experimental approach, frost injuries were inflicted to mature trees in a beech stand using dry ice. The treated trees were more attractive to insects than untreated controls. Insect attacks were observed in the treated zones on the trees but colonization was not very successful. The galleries had aborted most of the time with only a few larval chambers. Very few insects were caught in emergence traps. The results of these two approaches support and strengthen the hypothesis that frost induced beech dieback. Frost injuries increased tree attraction to ambrosia beetles to the point of inducing attacks. However, the overall success of these attacks was much lower than that observed in the 2000s. These differences might reflect limitations in our experimental approach, where frost wounding was applied locally to the trees.",

A suite of variables at the local and the landscape scale was assessed for each trap, aiming to identify potential relevant habitat indicators. The effects of habitat characteristics were evaluated using partial least square regressions. It was found that M. aeneus can overwinter in all types of habitat but that particular habitat characteristics at the local and landscape scales may explain their abundance in overwintering sites more than the types of habitat: relative altitude, litter thickness, soil moisture and proximity to the previous year's oilseed rape fields appear to be positively correlated with abundance of adults over the 3 years. Hence, the abundance of emerged pollen beetles depends on both the landscape configuration of the previous year's oilseed rape fields around overwintering sites and local habitat characteristics. Landscape configuration may determine population flow towards overwintering sites in the late summer, and local habitat characteristics may influence survival rates during the winter. The findings of the present study provide valuable insight into the role of semi‐natural habitats as a source of pests, patterns of crop colonization in the spring, and the influence of landscape on pollen beetle abundance.",

    "abstract": "1 The emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) (EAB), an invasive wood-boring beetle, has recently caused significant losses of native ash (Fraxinus spp.) trees in North America. Movement of wood products has facilitated EAB spread, and heat sanitation of wooden materials according to International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures No. 15 (ISPM 15) is used to prevent this. 2 In the present study, we assessed the thermal conditions experienced during a typical heat-treatment at a facility using protocols for pallet wood treatment under policy PI-07, as implemented in Canada. The basal high temperature tolerance of EAB larvae and pupae was determined, and the observed heating rates were used to investigate whether the heat shock response and expression of heat shock proteins occurred in fourth-instar larvae. 3 The temperature regime during heat treatment greatly exceeded the ISPM 15 requirements of 56 °C for 30 min. Emerald ash borer larvae were highly tolerant of elevated temperatures, with some instars surviving exposure to 53 °C without any heat pre-treatments. High temperature survival was increased by either slow warming or pre-exposure to elevated temperatures and a recovery regime that was accompanied by up-regulated hsp70 expression under some of these conditions. 4 Because EAB is highly heat tolerant and exhibits a fully functional heat shock response, we conclude that greater survival than measured in vitro is possible under industry treatment conditions (with the larvae still embedded in the wood). We propose that the phenotypic plasticity of EAB may lead to high temperature tolerance very close to conditions experienced in an ISPM 15 standard treatment.",

The relationships between the abundance and damage by Bactrocera oleae (Rossi) and different landscape indices were analyzed using data gathered by a regional network during 2009, 2010 and 2011 in Jaén, Spain. Eleven indices of landscape composition and configuration calculated at six different spatial scales (radii of 500, 600, 750, 1000, 1500 and 2000 m) were used in correlation analyses. Significant correlations between abundance and some indices were observed primarily during Julian days 236–264 (24 August to 21 September) 2010. These correlations were negative with edge density, the Shannon landscape diversity index and the number of patches, and were positive with patch size standard deviation and mean patch size. Linear mixed-effects models were used to identify the indices most strongly related to the abundance of olive flies. These indices were mean patch size, edge density at 500–750 m and the Shannon landscape diversity index, as well as the number of patches at 1000–2000 m. These results suggest that greater landscape complexity may contribute to reduced numbers of B. oleae. More studies are needed to establish how to reduce olive fruit fly damage.",

It is also unknown whether conophthorin enhances the attraction of these Xylosandrus beetles to traps baited with ethanol. In the present study, we evaluated the extent to which conophthorin enhances the attraction of X. crassiusculus and X. germanus to ethanol‐baited traps. We also tested the capacity of verbenone, an anti‐aggregation pheromone component of several coniferophagous bark beetles, to deter both species. More X. crassiusculus were captured in traps baited with both conophthorin and ethanol than in those containing either compound alone, suggesting that conophthorin enhances the response of X. crassiusculus to ethanol. This combination was also attractive to the checkered beetles Madoniella dislocatus and Pyticeroides laticornis ( C oleoptera: C leridae). Verbenone deterred both X. germanus and X. crassiusculu s, suggesting that the use of conophthorin and ethanol as an attractant and verbenone as a deterrent can be incorporated into an effective integrated pest management programme.",

However, because many ant species are also hemipteran mutualists, their role in agriculture has generally been considered to be negative for plants. In the present study, we report an experiment in ant‐exclusion from tree canopies in an organic citrus grove with two main objectives: (i) to examine whether the absence of ants increased the abundance of some beneficial arthropods and reduced the attack of some pests such as aphids and (ii) to examine whether ant‐exclusion increased the fruit yield of citrus trees. The exclusion of ants from tree canopies had positive effects on the arthropod assemblage and on fruit yield. However, the 8‐year duration of the experiment can be divided into two periods with contrasting results. In the first period, the arthropod assemblage was only slightly affected, except for a greater density of aphids in ant‐excluded trees; in addition, fruit yield was higher in ant‐excluded trees than in the control ones. In the second period, ant‐exclusion increased the abundance of most arthropod groups, although the previous positive effect on fruit yield was no longer observed. There are two main conclusions of the present study. First, from an applied perspective, ant‐exclusion from tree canopies is not a sound management alternative in citrus plantations in the Mediterranean. Second, the 8‐year duration of the experiment highlighted the importance of long‐term experiments in community ecology and biological control because the effects observed in the first 4 years of the experiment were very different from what occurred subsequently.",

Insecticide is the primary method for controlling this pest, requiring a search for compounds with a low toxicity to nontarget organisms. We assessed the toxicity of eight insecticides to T. absoluta and its pirate bug predators Orius tristicolor, Amphiareus constrictus and Blaptostethus pallescens ( H emiptera: H eteroptera: A nthocoridae). We also assessed the effect of insecticide synergists on their toxicity to the predators, as well as their walking response to insecticide exposure. All insecticides, with the exception of methamidophos, exhibited the minimum efficacy threshold required by the B razilian legislation (80% efficacy) at concentrations lower than the registered label rates. Indoxacarb and chlorantraniliprole exhibited a lower toxicity to the pirate bug predators than to the tomato leaf miner. The results obtained with the synergized insecticides suggest the involvement of cytochrome P450 ‐dependent monooxygenases as the primary detoxification enzymes minimizing insecticide toxicity in the pirate bug predators. The insecticides led to a reduction in predator walking activity, especially abamectin and indoxacarb, which significantly minimized predator exposure. The results of the present study indicate that novel insecticides, especially chlorantraniliprole, are better suited to sustainable integrated management programmes of the tomato leaf miner.",

Species richness tended to be higher in SLAM and modified funnel traps than standard funnel and intercept panel traps. SLAM traps also captured the highest number of species, unique species, rare (species accounting for ≤ 1% of total cerambycids at a site) and singleton species at each site. Individual‐based rarefaction and sample‐based species accumulation curves suggested that SLAM traps are more effective for capturing cerambycid species. For many estimates, modified funnel and funnel traps were lower than SLAM traps but greater than intercept panel traps for describing cerambycid communities.

We recorded the spatial and temporal distribution of killed trees during the 5‐year period of an Ips acuminatus outbreak. Killed trees were always grouped in well‐defined patches (infestation spots). In years of high population density, infestation spots were large and aggregated, whereas, in years of low density, infestation spots were small and weakly aggregated or randomly distributed within the study area. Most trees were killed in the spring by beetles that had hibernated but, in some years, trees were also killed in the summer by new‐generation beetles originating from spring attacks. Spring‐killed trees always formed new infestation spots at new locations (i.e. spot proliferation). By contrast, summer‐killed trees always occurred at the edge of active spots established in the spring, thus resulting in spot growth. With regard to management strategies, the results obtained in the present study suggest that areas located in close proximity to infestations of the previous year should be prioritized for risk assessment. Because large spots account for most of the observed tree mortality, the cut‐and‐remove method should be focused on these spots as soon as crown discoloration appears in the summer. If applied timely, this strategy will remove the new‐generation beetles originating from the spring attacks before they emerge and also reduce the risk of spot growth.",

Flowering plants intercropped with maize attracted pollinators, helping to support pollinator communities. Similar intercropping techniques using a grass ground cover did not increase pollinator density, demonstrating that pollinator richness, density and diversity is intrinsically linked to the presence of flowering plants. A maize system with a diverse intercrop may make it possible for pollinators to thrive; however, these systems may only be sufficiently attractive to bring pollinators in temporarily from the surrounding areas. These results show that there can be significant improvements to pollinator diversity, density and community composition as a result of modifying maize cultivation practices; however, these benefits must be balanced with yield penalties of approximately 60% to farmers.",

In the U.K., the beetle is restricted to south and central England. The present study aimed to improve our understanding of the beetle's life history and thermal requirements, intending to explain its U.K. distribution, and to collect data for lifecycle modelling. Novel methods were developed to collect and culture the beetle in the laboratory, which enabled experiments to be carried out, providing data on the beetle's sex ratio, longevity and fecundity, and the development rates of eggs, larvae and pupae at constant temperatures. On average, females lived for 63 days and laid 82 eggs. Larvae developed through four instars. Sex ratio varied by site, with no overall trend apparent. The development rates of eggs, larvae and pupae (to adult emergence) had linear relationships with temperature, with lower developmental thresholds of 12.1, 11.9 and 15.1 °C, respectively. For each life stage, degree‐day values were calculated. Beetles appeared to have an obligatory prepupal diapause at all temperatures studied, up to and including 25 °C. The implications of the developmental findings for the beetle's current distribution, as well as the possible effects of climate change, are discussed. The beetle appears to be thermally limited in the U.K. and, if so, its distribution, and perhaps that of Acute Oak Decline, may alter under climate change.",

Logs represented six decay classes, ranging from freshly dead to well decayed. Beetle assemblages were indicated mainly by phloeophagous and predaceous species in early decay stages, although indicator species were mainly predaceous in later stages of decay. No indicator species were identified for intermediate decay stages. Larvae from rearings were disproportionately predaceous. Thus, movement of juveniles within and among coarse woody debris (CWD) substrates is likely an important aspect of the life history for these species. Beetle assemblages changed progressively with increasing stages of decomposition. Assemblages of adjacent decay classes were highly similar, although similarity decreased with increasing difference in decay classes. Therefore, the retention of all decay classes of white spruce downed CWD on post-harvest landscapes is necessary to conserve the associated saproxylic beetle fauna. Retention of CWD in advanced decay stages, which contains species not found in earlier decay classes, presents a particular challenge in forest management because of the long times required to develop CWD in the later stages of decomposition.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lure‐baited traps are an important tool for monitoring the spread and establishment of the Sirex woodwasp Sirex noctilio . The utility of these traps, however, is limited in areas with low wasp populations as a result of the reliance on a plant volatile (kairomone) lure in the absence of an identified pheromone. Knowledge of the optimal trap type and deployment strategy is also lacking. We tested the effectiveness of a putative pheromone in baited traps, by means of a series of field trials in South Africa, over a 3‐year period. We also examined the influence of lure type, trap type and trap height on capture success. The pheromone was found to be ineffective as an attractant under South African field conditions for both male and female wasps. Lure type, trap type and trap height were found to have little to no effect on female wasp catch. Given the moderately strong responses to the blend under wind tunnel and laboratory conditions, we suggest possible aspects of the biology and life history of S. noctilio that may influence lure effectiveness. The traditional black intercept panel traps with kairomone lure remains the best trap for S. noctilio , at least where populations are high.",

Soybean growers have indicated that the adoption of rye as a winter cover crop would increase, if it was shown to offer suppression of a key soybean pest, the soybean aphid Aphis glycines. We performed an on-farm evaluation of two cropping systems utilized in organic production and reduced-herbicide input production. One system includes a rye cover crop, whereas the other does not. At six and five location-years in Minnesota, A. glycines and predator populations, respectively, were measured and compared between the systems with and without rye. The system with the rye cover crop significantly suppressed A. glycines populations on soybean at five of six location-years. Predators appeared to respond more to prey abundance than to plant diversity. An exposure analysis examining biological control potential revealed no differences between soybean with and without rye at any location-year. Insect control can be added to the multiple benefits of rye winter cover crops.",

In the present study, we provide evidence for the presence of natural enemies correlating with a subsequent reduction in pest population growth. The abundance of cereal aphid pests and two key aphidophagous natural enemies, parasitoid wasps (Aphidiinae) and hoverfly larvae (Syrphinae), was assessed at field boundaries and interiors in southeast England. The highest rate of aphid population growth was associated with locations where no natural enemies were found. The presence of either Aphidiinae wasps or predatory Syrphinae larvae was associated with a reduction in the rate of aphid population growth, irrespective of location within the field, and overall aphid population growth was negatively correlated with increasing natural enemy abundance. The results of the present study indicate that natural enemies contribute significantly to pest control, and provide further evidence supporting the use of management strategies for promoting natural enemies in agro-ecosystems. Aphid predators and parasitoids make an important contribution to aphid pest control within cereal fields, and thresholds for insecticide application should account for this to avoid unnecessary treatments.",

Record temperatures and dryness might have impeded population growth during that year. To test this hypothesis, flies were exposed to a 4‐day simulation. We evaluated the effect of fluctuating temperature and humidity on mortality and reproduction of D . suzukii from three age classes (average age: class 1: 3 days; class 2: 11 days; class 3: 20 days). Maximum temperatures were 27, 33 and 39 °C. Relative humidity oscillated between 18% and 85%. Fly mortality through heat stress ranged from 50% to 80%. Higher rates died of oldest flies and females. Offspring per female did not differ between heat stressed and control groups. Flies of both sexes were not sterilized through heat and dryness. Prior acclimation reduced any negative effects. We concluded that heat waves and extreme dryness during 2015 were one cause of the low population densities of D . suzukii observed under field conditions.",

We explored the potential of waggle dance data to determine the spatial ecology of honey bees sited in a crop under commercial pollination. Over two springs, we video recorded and then decoded 834 waggle dances from colonies located in two apple and pear farms in Kent, U.K. We also obtained pollen samples from returning foragers and quantified the insects visiting apple and pear flowers. The vast majority (84%) of dances were for locations outside of the orchards in which our colonies were located. Accounting for the distance of orchards and oilseed rape fields from the study colonies, the amount of foraging per hectare in oilseed rape fields was greater than in orchards. The results of the present study indicate that maximizing the pollination services of managed honey bee colonies requires an landscape level approach that takes into account farm and foraging scale, as well as competing floral sources. The data also suggest that oilseed rape is a significant competitor to apple and pear flowers for honey bee visits.",

To address how H. halys select potential overwintering sites and to predict the risk of home invasion, citizen scientists, primarily from the Mid‐Atlantic region of the U.S.A., were recruited to count the number of H. halys present on the exterior of their homes during the autumn dispersal periods in 2013 and 2014. Volunteers provided daily count data on numbers present on each exterior aspect of the home during the peak dispersal, as well as their home's location, colour and structural material. Among volunteers, fewer adults were counted on white homes compared with brown and tan homes in 2013 and with grey homes in both years. Across all homes, greatest numbers were counted on the north and east walls in both years and on homes with wood, cement or stone exteriors. In addition, significantly more adults were counted on homes in rural landscapes compared with urban areas in both years. Halyomorpha halys were found in greater numbers on darker coloured homes made of natural materials, even though these were less common than other types in the landscape. Thus, homes located in rural landscapes with these features could be prone to larger nuisance infestations of overwintering H. halys .",

Thousands of exotic Bombus terrestris are imported from Europe to pollinate blueberries. However, no study has investigated the performance of the native Chilean fauna to pollinate blueberry or other crops. Therefore, we aimed to compare the performance of native Chilean floral visitors with managed visitors to pollinate highbush blueberry. Per‐visit pollination performance (stigmatic pollen deposition) and floral visitation were measured and the presence of sonication behaviour of flower visitors was evaluated for five cultivars in two blueberry orchards located in southern Chile. Floral visitors showed a preference for one or more blueberry cultivars, instead of visiting all cultivars equally. Floral visits with sonication deposited more conspecific pollen on stigmas than visits without sonication. Some native sonicating bees ( Cadeguala and Bombus ), especially Cadeguala occidentalis , were efficient pollen vectors of blueberry and better pollinators than honeybees (5.8 times more pollen transferred) similar to that of the managed bee B. terrestris . The results indicate that some Chilean native bee species, especially those with sonication behaviour, can provide pollination service to highbush blueberry crops.",

A bioeconomic model was used to simulate the insect's spread and economic impact based on additional urban and commercial tree management costs. Two scenarios were examined, one in which an eradication policy response was initiated, and one in which it was not. With no eradication response, results indicated that median costs would reach A$6.8 million per annum in 30 years, with 98% of these costs relating to management in urban forests. We conclude that the eradication funding currently proposed, involving an investment of A$45.0 million over 3 years, will not generate sufficient benefits to offset costs in the short‐term, but may produce net benefits in the longer term.",

We analysed bee‐habitat relationships in fire‐treated (1‐ and 3‐years post‐treatment) and non‐treated ponderosa pine stands in Colorado to test wild bee population responses. Observed bee richness and α‐diversity were highest in stands 1‐year post‐fire and had more Anthophora , Bombus , Osmia and Lasioglossum spp. in comparison to 3‐year post‐fire and non‐treated stands. Bee functional groups were responsive to treatments, with more below‐ground nesting taxa present in stands 3 years post‐fire. Floral richness was the highest mid‐growing season (June, July) and within 1‐year post‐fire stands. A model analysing the effects of foraging and nesting habitat variation on bee assemblages indicated positive association between floral richness and bee α‐diversity, but negative relationships with stand basal area. Nesting habitat was not associated with variation in bee assemblages. We conclude that managed fire has positive short‐term effects on bee biodiversity that are likely mediated by floral richness. However, these effects were not detectable by 3 years post‐treatment in the southern Rocky Mountain region.",

Slot traps baited with aggregation pheromones (‘pull’) and three repellent semiochemicals (‘push’) were used in both years. In 2020, 26 windthrown areas were classified into three levels of infestation risk, and each was randomly assigned to one of three experimental protocols: eight push‐and‐pull sites; nine trap‐only sites and nine control sites. In 2021, the trials were repeated in 22 clear‐cuts of infested spruce forests, applying two protocols: 16 push–pull and 6 control sites. Fifty traps and 1500 repellent dispensers were used in 2020, and 26 traps and 1500 repellent dispensers were used in 2021. The push‐and‐pull technique performed well in post‐windthrow conditions (2020 trials), especially at high infestation risk, with significantly lower damage to forest edges when compared with untreated sites. The use of pheromone‐baited traps alone was not enough to avoid colonization of forest edges, especially in high‐risk sites. When the push‐and‐pull protocol was applied in clear‐cut areas (2021 trials), the technique was less effective and did not significantly reduce the number of infested trees along the forest edge. Possible interactions with climate conditions are also discussed.",

Entomology has, however, been slow to adopt these practices compared to many adjacent fields despite ethical and practical imperatives to do so. The grand challenges facing entomology in the 21st century require the synthesis of evidence at global scales, necessitating open sharing of data and research at a pace and scale incompatible with the slow adoption of open research practices. Open science also plays a vital role in fostering trust in research and maximizing use of research outputs, which is ethically crucial for reducing harms to insects. We outline these imperatives and how open research practices can enhance entomological research across a range of contexts. We also highlight the holistic nature of open science across the full research lifecycle through several specific examples of open research practices, which can be adopted easily by individual entomologists. We do, however, argue that the responsibility of promoting, integrating and encouraging open research is most crucially held by publishers, including scholarly societies, which have leveraged widespread adoption in adjacent fields. Entomology must advance quickly to become a leading discipline in the open research transition.",

In Brazil, the species S. invicta and S. saevissima , known as fire ants, cause significant impacts, especially in agricultural areas in open environments with little vegetation. Soil cover and environmental variables can influence the dimensions and occurrence of nests of these species. Thus, this study assessed the effect of management (conventional or organic) and the dominant landscape (agricultural areas or native vegetation) on the occurrence and dimensions of S. invicta and S. saevissima nests on rural properties in the “Cinturão Verde Paulista” region, in southeastern Brazil. Our results indicate a higher abundance of S. invicta nests in agricultural areas with conventional management, while S. saevissima nests are more abundant in areas with organic management. The morphological study revealed that the tallest nests of S. saevissima are predominantly found in agricultural landscapes, whereas management practices and landscape type appear to have no significant influence on S. invicta nesting dimensions. These findings contribute to our understanding of the ecological dynamics of S. saevissima . They also provide insights into potential strategies for population control and highlight the importance of considering both management systems and landscape factors when studying invasive species, such as S. invicta .",

Temporal and spatial distribution can influence monitoring and treatment decisions, and understanding climatic influences on population size can help predict peak numbers. Drosophila suzukii (Matsumara, 1931) is an invasive fruit pest, and its seasonal dynamics vary across its range. We conducted a three‐year trapping study with various modelling approaches to determine the environmental variables influencing D. suzukii population dynamics across all seasons in Kentucky, a temperate state with overwintering D. suzukii . Male and female flies were active in all seasons, visiting traps located on the ground and at plant height. Most flies were caught in the wooded edge habitat in all seasons, and crops only had more catches than the forest during summer. Population size was best predicted by a general additive model that included the average temperature 8 weeks before sampling and relative humidity in the two weeks before sampling, which differs from other models that have extremely low temperature as the most predictive weather variable. Our results indicate that the factors influencing D. suzukii population dynamics in Kentucky differ from those at higher or lower latitudes. We recommend monitoring average temperature leading up to fruiting to predict pest pressure. Further, our results suggest that the optimal time to monitor is when average temperatures exceed 21°C. Broadly, our findings highlight the need to investigate these factors on an appropriate scale to develop region‐specific monitoring and management recommendations.",

The isolate IMI 330189 of Metarhizium anisopliae (flavoviride ) var. acridum has been registered, extensively field tested and its operating characteristics explored. It should form an powerful component technology in the integrated management of locust and grasshopper pests. The particular advantages of Metarhizium anisopliae were found to be efficacy and persistence, low vertebrate toxicity, little environmental impact, conservation of natural enemies and potential for recycling. Additional socio‐economic advantages include the possibility of local production, ease of disposal and versatility in use. The principal disadvantages relate to operating characteristics such as slower speed of kill and slightly greater lability in storage than chemical pesticides. Strategies are being developed to integrate biological control agents into locust and grasshopper management schemes; for Metarhizium the accent is placed on: (i) treating the pest before it invades crops and (ii) situations with a high premium on environmental issues. For some pest situations, fast‐acting chemical pesticides will still be necessary for crop protection. A cheaper biological agent, such as Nosema locustae , with the capacity to persist in the pest insect population would be useful. Research is recommended on the long‐term impact of Nosema in Africa. An evaluation of the utility of the manual destruction of egg pods leads to the conclusion that we should consider the possibility of importing egg parasitoids, such as Scelio parvicornis from Australia, into Africa. Further development work is needed to clarify the economics and politics of locust and grasshopper control; to improve the regulatory framework for biopesticides; to inform key decision makers of the availability and potential of Metarhizium ; and to implement the bio‐intensive IPM strategies described.",

In the other year, the stem wood production of medium‐defoliated stools did not differ significantly from stools exposed to low defoliation, i.e. there was full compensatory growth. 4 The main difference between the year with compensatory growth and the one without was that overall productivity was higher in the year with compensation. This finding forms the basis for a mechanistic model by which compensation could be accomplished.

Herbivore parameters varied for different plant types. 4 Percent crop cover and movement rates were varied, and ensuing herbivore densities on crop rows were recorded. 5 In trap cropping schemes, both percent crop cover and movement rates were critical in determining herbivore densities. Intercropping schemes were governed primarily by colonization rates. 6 These results suggest that trap cropping schemes merit more attention than intercropping systems in the design and analysis of mixed cropping systems.",

Tarsonemus ips , T. kranzti and T. fusarii (Acarina: Tarsonemidae) may interact within this community in ways that link the population dynamics of D. frontalis , the mites and three dominant species of fungi. We explored species associations by comparing the dietary suitability of different fungi for Tarsonemus spp. 2 All three mite species fed and reproduced at high rates when feeding on the bluestain fungus, Ophiostoma minus, which is an antagonist of D. frontalis larvae. 3 Mites also had positive population growth rates when feeding upon Ceratocystiopsis ranaculosus, one of the mycangial fungi, but could barely reproduce when feeding upon Entomocorticium sp. A, the mycangial fungus that is most suitable for D. frontalis . 4 During the time from colonization of a tree by D. frontalis adults until departure from the tree of their progeny (≈ 40 d at 30 °C), mite populations feeding upon O. minus can increase by factors of up to 209 ( T. fusarii ), 173 ( T. ips ) or 384 ( T. krantzi ). These high growth rates are allowed by rapid development (age of first reproduction = 8–9 d), high fecundity (≈ 1 egg/d) and high longevity (&gt; 28 d). 5 Precocious mating increases the chance that females are mated prior to colonizing a new tree and arrhenotokous parthenogenesis permits reproduction by unmated females. 6 Tarsonemus mites may introduce negative feedback into D. frontalis population dynamics by generating indirect interactions between D. frontalis and O. minus .",

    "abstract": "Summary 1 Gonipterus scutellatus is a weevil that has become a pest in most Eucalyptus plantations in Africa, America and Europe. The egg parasitoid Anaphes nitens has been introduced into many countries as a biological control agent. Even if control has been successful in most countries no detailed study of the interactions between both species has been published. 2 Gonipterus scutellatus was detected in 1991 in north‐west Spain and A. nitens was introduced in early 1994. Here we report on the results of a 2‐year study of parasitism in a field plot and a survey of 16 localities in North‐west Spain. In 1996, parasitism was so intense (80–100% of eggs) that G. scutellatus became locally extinct, and as a consequence A. nitens disappeared. In 1997, G. scutellatus recolonized the area and was followed by its parasitoid, but parasitism was low in spring, probably because the parasitoid population needed 3 weeks to achieve a similar size as in 1996. Consequently, damage to the trees was extreme in 1997. We interpret these results as population fluctuations due to parasitoid–host interactions and suggest that parasitoids should not to be so effective as to locally extinguish their host to be useful for biological control. 3 The analysis of parasitism level in 16 localities indicates that A. nitens is highly efficient in finding G. scutellatus egg‐masses. At a small spatial scale (single trees) positive density dependence was detected where parasitism was low and inverse density dependence where parasitism was high.",

Temporal occurrence of C. pomonella seems to be affected by climate (temperature) and insecticide treatment against the Apple fruit moth ( Argyresthia conjugella ) in the previous season. 4 Climate change scenarios (0.1 °C increase per degree in latitude in daily maximum and minimum temperatures) indicated an extension of the potential geographical range for C. pomonella , and 23 new locations were found favourable for its long‐term survival. The abundance and pest status of C. pomonella could increase dramatically in those locations where the species is already established. 5 Leptinotarsa decemlineata would only temporarily find suitable climate conditions in Norway and hence only be able to establish interim populations in a few regions under current climate conditions. Climate change scenarios for L. decemlineata indicated that the species would be able to establish as far north as 64°N, mainly in the inland of eastern Norway. 6 In general, the methods applied support the process of decreasing the uncertainty both in our knowledge about the pests themselves and about the environment, which are crucial elements in predicting whether a species is able to establish in a new area.",

The contributions of each site to the global index were identified by the use of a local indicator of spatial autocorrelation (LISA). A hierarchical cluster analysis was undertaken to highlight differences between groups of resulting correlograms. 3 Similarity between traps was shown to occur over large geographical distances, suggesting an impact of phenomena such as climatic gradients or land use types. 4 The presence of outliers and zones of similarity (hot‐spots) and of dissimilarity (cold‐spots) were identified indicating a strong impact of local effects. 5 Several groups of traps characterized by similarities in their local spatial structure (correlograms, value of Moran's I i ) also had similar values for land use variables (the area occupied by agricultural zones, forest and sea). 6 It is concluded that trap data can provide information about Myzus persicae that is representative of large geographical areas.

(Coleoptera, Curculionidae) is an economically important pest of conifer forest regeneration in Europe and Asia. 2 Soil scarification, which usually exposes mineral soil, is widely used to protect seedlings from weevil attack. However, the mechanism behind this protective effect is not yet fully understood. 3 Field experiments were conducted to determine the pine weevil's responses to visual and odour stimuli from seedlings when moving on mineral soil and on undisturbed humus surface. 4 One experiment measured the number of pine weevils approaching seedlings, with and without added host odour, on mineral soil and undisturbed humus. Seedlings with added host odour attracted more weevils on both soil types. Unexpectedly, somewhat more weevils approached seedlings surrounded by mineral soil. 5 In a similar experiment, feeding attacks on seedlings planted directly in the soil were recorded. Only half as many seedlings were attacked on mineral soil as on undisturbed humus. 6 In the first experiment, the weevils were trapped 2.5 cm from the bases of the seedlings' stems, whereas they could reach the seedlings in the experiment where seedlings were planted directly in the soil. We conclude that the pine weevils' decision on whether or not to feed on a seedling is strongly influenced by the surrounding soil type and that this decision is taken in the close vicinity of the seedling. The presence of pure mineral soil around the seedling strongly reduces the likelihood that an approaching pine weevil will feed on it.",

We evaluated the effects of these fumigants on aspen foliar quality and the performance of aspen blotch leafminer ( Phyllonorycter tremuloidiella Braun). 2 CO 2 and O 3 each affected foliar quality, with the major changes consisting of an 11% reduction in nitrogen under elevated CO 2 and a 20% reduction in tremulacin under elevated O 3 . In the CO 2 + O 3 treatment, nitrogen levels were reduced by 15% and CO 2 ameliorated the O 3 ‐mediated reduction in tremulacin levels. 3 Phyllonorycter tremuloidiella were allowed to colonize trees naturally. Elevated CO 2 and O 3 reduced colonization rates by 42 and 49% relative to ambient CO 2 and O 3 , respectively. The only effect of fumigation treatments on larval performance occurred under elevated O 3 , where male development time and larval consumption increased by 8 and 28%, respectively, over insects reared under ambient O 3 . 4 These data demonstrate that the individual and combined effects of CO 2 and O 3 can alter aspen foliar chemistry and that these alterations in foliar chemistry produce little to no change in larval performance. However, both CO 2 and O 3 greatly reduced oviposition. In order to ascertain the full effects of CO 2 and O 3 on insect performance, future studies should address both population‐ and individual‐level characteristics.",

Adult coccinellids that had previously foraged on nettle, knapweed, bean or bird's‐foot trefoil transfered conidia to A. pisum on bean and induced infections in 2–13% of aphids. 4 Conidia of P. neoaphidis dispersed passively in the airstream from sporulating M. carnosum cadavers on nettle plants and initiated infections in A. pisum colonies feeding on bean (4–33%) or M. dirhodum on barley (3%) located within 1.0 m of the nettle source. 5 The results suggest that M. carnosum and A. pisum may be more useful as reservoirs for P. neoaphidis in noncrop and crop areas than U. jaceae or M. dirhodum , and infection and dispersal between habitats could be enhanced in the presence of coccinellids.",

In the second season, black mustard Brassica nigra (L.) was sown at two sowing dates (14 days apart) and compared with a sweet corn control, to examine how the maturity of the trap crop affected numbers of GVB trapped. A field scale experiment was also conducted to determine the effectiveness of black mustard as a trap crop to protect larger areas of sweet corn from GVB.

In both small plot experiments, GVB were contained largely within the trap crop for 2 weeks until the sweet corn was harvested. The field scale experiment demonstrated the efficacy of the trap cropping technique to protect larger areas of crop from GVB. Percentages of damaged sweet corn cobs in the outside row of fields protected by a trap crop were 0% and 1%, respectively, compared with 11% and 22% in control fields.

The method consists of two components: an advanced weather forecast model, MM5, for weather simulation, and a migration model for trajectory calculation. The weather forecast model simulates wind fields in which trajectories are calculated by the migration model. 2 It is assumed that planthoppers, Sogatella furcifera and Nilaparvata lugens , are transported at wind speeds and in wind directions. The method is evaluated using a migration event observed at Chikugo in Japan on 25 June 1969, which was recorded in hourly catch data. 3 The results indicate that the takeoff responsible for the migration occurred at 21 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) on 23 June along the coastal region of Fujian province in China. This is the first time that the source region of this event has been accurately identified. Determinations of the migrating duration and height are also consistent with observations. 4 Although the landing process is not considered in the model, it is shown that the method is able to simulate the migration and accurately estimate various parameters.

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 Eucalypts are an important part of plantation forestry in Asia but, in south China, productivity is very low. This is due to infertile soils and lack of indigenous symbiotic mycorrhizal fungi. The genus Eucalyptus is unusual because it forms both arbuscular (AM) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) associations. 2 Eucalyptus urophylla saplings were grown with and without AM ( Glomus caledonium ) and ECM ( Laccaria laccata ) fungi in a factorial design. Two experiments were performed: one to simulate nursery conditions and the other to simulate the early stages of plantation establishment. Plant growth was measured over 18 weeks and levels of insect attack were recorded. 3 The AM fungus reduced tree growth in the early stages, but the effect appeared to be transient. No effects of ECM were detected on tree growth, but the ectomycorrhiza reduced colonization by the arbuscular mycorrhiza. AM fungi appear to be rapid invaders of the root system, gradually being replaced by ECM. 4 Both fungal types affected levels of damage by insect herbivores. Most importantly, herbivory by the pest insects Anomala cupripes (Coleoptera) and Strepsicrates spp. (Lepidoptera) was decreased by ECM. 5 It is suggested that mycorrhizal effects on eucalypt insects may be determined by carbon allocation within the plant. Future studies of eucalypt mycorrhizas need to take into account the effects of the fungi on foliar‐feeding insects and also the effects of insect herbivory on mycorrhizal establishment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 Integrated management of crop pests requires the identification of the appropriate spatial scale at which colonization processes occurs. We assessed, by coupling demographic and genetic methods, the relative contribution of local and transient migrants of the grain aphid Sitobion avenae to wheat field colonization in spring. 2 We examined, during two consecutive years, the daily colonization of wheat by aphid migrants and compared this with daily aphid flight monitored by a local 12.2‐m suction trap. The genetic profiles of aphids landing on crops were compared with those of both flying aphids caught by the suction trap and local populations from arable crops and hedgerows. 3 In the first year, we observed: (i) a strong correlation between aphids colonizing the crop and those moving within the crop and a close genetic similarity between aphids from these samples and (ii) a high level of genetic differentiation between these aphids and populations from local cereals and field margins. In the second year, the number of migrants recorded on the wheat was three‐fold higher than in the previous year, and less correlated with that recorded by the suction trap. This was associated with a lack of genetic differentiation between all samples. 4 This variation in the colonization processes resulted mainly in an abrupt increase in abundance of genotypes from local over‐wintering sites in 2004. This suggests that, despite the long range dispersal potential of the grain aphid, outbreak risks could be mainly determined at a local scale, encouraging the design of relatively small management units.",

Environmentally sustainable approaches to locust and grasshopper control may be possible through the use of biopesticides based on entomopathogenic fungi. Unfortunately, the performance of these biopesticides is highly variable with environmental temperature and host thermoregulatory behaviour critically determining the pattern and extent of mortality after applications. Here, we present a temperature‐dependent model that enables us to predict the field performance of Metarhizium anisopliae var. acridum , the key fungal pathogen used in locust biopesticides. 2 The model was constructed using mortality rate data generated across a range of temperatures in the laboratory and is driven by environmental temperature data linked through host body temperature models. 3 Model predictions were validated against empirical field data obtained for five species, Locustana pardalina , Oedaleus senegalensis , Zonocerus variegatus , Nomadacris septemfasciata and Chortoicetes terminifera. Mortality predictions were accurate to a 2‐day error in every 10 days. This level of resolution is satisfactory to guide operational use of the biopesticide. 4 The model was subsequently used for a prospective evaluation of the performance of M. anisopliae var. acridum against two additional pest species, Dociostaurus maroccanus and Calliptamus italicus in Spain. Results suggest that this pathogen would work reasonably well against these species as long as early instars are targeted. 5 The model could provide a useful tool to assist in interpreting effectiveness of control operations, develop improved application strategies to optimize the performance of the biopesticide and identify appropriate target species and environments.",

The olive orchard consists of separate subunits (trees) surrounded by a matrix of grasses or bare ground, and the role of ants in such a system is not fully understood. 2 None of the selected ant species was exclusive to the olive trees because they were also observed foraging on vegetation (mainly thistle) under the tree crowns. Hence, the relative contributions of these two sources of energy (olive trees versus herbs/grasses) were assessed by comparing the δ 13 C of ants with the signatures of plants and those of other arthropods collected on the trees and on nearby thistles. Next, the trophic level occupied by the ants and their ecological role within the olive food web were determined by examining the δ 15 N values and their relationship with indices of ecological performance measuring the potential pressure exerted by each species on the ecosystem. 3 The analysis of 13 C signatures revealed a different contribution of the two energy sources, olive trees versus herbs and grasses, with the former being more important for ants. The analysis of 15 N signatures suggested separate roles for different ant species: some ( Crematogaster scutellaris , Lasius lasioides ) occupied a higher trophic level, mostly involved in predation, whereas others ( Camponotus piceus , Camponotus lateralis ) occupied a lower level, probably involved more in homopteran tending. A fifth species ( Camponotus aethiops ) was in an intermediate position. Finally, the δ 15 N levels of the species were significantly correlated with indices of ecological performance.",

Ground beetles (Carabidae), rove beetles (Staphylinidae), ants (Formicidae) and spiders (Araneae) were sampled monthly with pitfall traps in the same apple orchard during 2003, 2004 and 2005. 3 A total of 4978 individuals were collected. Carabids (56.8% of the total catches) were the most abundant taxonomic group, followed by spiders (20.7%), ants (14.8%) and rove beetles (7.7%). Tree‐row management had a greater influence on predator catches than fertilizer treatment. Total predator catches were lower under the mulch. Mulching also reduced carabid abundance, but increased staphylinid catches. 4 Tree row management also had a significant effect on biodiversity parameters. Species richness did not significantly differ among treatments for ants, spiders or the total catches, but was higher on herbicide‐treated plots for carabids and on mulched plots for staphylinids. Shannon–Wiener’s diversity index was significantly greater in the mulched and herbicide treated plots for total predators and carabids. For staphylinids, this index was significantly greater on the mulched plots. Fertilizer application strategy only influenced the species richness of rove beetles, which was greater in the chemically‐treated plots. 5 The results showed that a change from conventional to organic fertilizer treatment of apple trees may be performed without differential effects on predator activity‐density or biodiversity. However, a change from herbicide treatment to mulching or mechanical weed control may be significant, depending on the taxonomic group.",

Acoustic detection of soil insects has been used in various managed systems, ranging from nursery containers to citrus groves. 4 Mathematical modelling plays a complementary role for investigating root‐feeding insects, illustrated by a number of published models. A model is presented for the movement of S. lepidus in the soil, which suggests that these insects undergo Lévy movements, similar to those recently demonstrated for above‐ground organisms. 5 The future directions and challenges for investigating root‐feeding insects are discussed in the context of the wider ecosystem, incorporating both above and below‐ground organisms.",

The present study investigated whether potato varieties showed variable susceptibility to wireworm herbivory, and also tested whether increased susceptibility was associated with lower concentrations of glycoalkaloids. Twelve varieties were originally screened across a range of experimental scales, including laboratory and tunnel experiments and a large‐scale field trial involving over 2000 tubers. 2 In laboratory no‐choice tests, Maris Peer, Marfona and Rooster varieties were significantly more susceptible to wireworm attack, with 63% of tubers showing damage, compared with just 15% of the less susceptible varieties of King Edward, Nadine and Maris Piper. There was also greater tissue consumption and weight gain when wireworms were reared on the most susceptible varieties. 3 In choice tests, wireworms showed a significant preference for those varieties previously identified as being the most susceptible to wireworm herbivory (4.2 holes per tuber) compared with the least susceptible (1.2 holes per tuber). Similar patterns of susceptibility were seen in the field trial, although there was generally more variation in susceptibility. 4 In a tunnel experiment, Marfona and Maris Peer were significantly more susceptibile to wireworm attack (47% of tubers showing damage) compared with Nadine, King Edward and Maris Piper (27% of tubers showing damage). Although Nadine, in particular, had the highest glycoalkaloid concentrations (309.33 mg/kg) and lowest amounts of wireworm herbivory, the relationship between susceptibility and glycoalkaloid concentrations was weak, suggesting that this is unlikely to be the sole mechanism underpinning varietal susceptibility.",

Colonies of D. plantaginea are commonly attended by ants, yet the effects of this relationship have received little attention. 2 An ant exclusion study was conducted in two distant orchards within the U.K. At both sites, ants were excluded from a subset of D. plantaginea infested trees at the beginning of the season and populations were monitored. The number of natural enemies observed on trees was also recorded and, before harvest, the percentage of apples damaged by D. plantaginea calculated. 3 Overall, the exclusion of ants reduced the growth and eventual size of D. plantaginea populations. On trees accessed by ants, greater numbers of natural enemies were recorded, presumably because aphid populations were often greater on such trees. However, this increased natural enemy presence was diluted by the larger aphid populations such that individual aphids on ant‐attended trees were subjected to a lower natural enemy pressure compared with those on ant‐excluded trees. 4 At harvest, apple trees that had been accessed by ants bore a greater proportion of apples damaged by D. plantaginea . There were also differences in cultivar susceptibility to D. plantaginea damage. 5 The present study highlights the importance of the ant– D. plantaginea relationship and it ia suggested that ant manipulation, whether physically or by semiochemicals that disrupt the relationship, should be considered as a more prominent component in the development of future integrated pest management strategies.",

In captivity, the mean number of eggs laid per female varied between 34 and 82 eggs, with a maximum of 184 eggs. Egg mortality was 18–75% and was mostly due to unknown factors. 3 The main mortality factors affecting larvae and pupae in the leaves were predation by birds and arthropods in all generation and leaf senescence in the autumn generation. Parasitoids killed less than 5% of the population. 4 Nearly 90% of overwintering pupae died in dead leaves, the majority of them being killed by earthworms and other leaf decomposers. As a result, the overwintering generations were the only ones showing a net rate of increase less than one. Non‐overwintering generations had net rates of increase between four and 11, allowing populations to build up from spring to autumn. 5 The persistence of high outbreak densities in Europe is explained by a combination of at least three factors: (i) high fecundity; (ii) multivoltinism; (iii) the unusually low impact of traditional natural enemies of leaf miners and particularly parasitoids. 6 Yearly variations in population densities could be at least partly explained by differences in larval mortality due to leaf senescence and intraspecific competition in the last generation in autumn.",

Long‐residual activity and application before feasible scouting probably lead to its overuse and overexposure. Recent investigations revealed a selective impact of imidacloprid (not trichlorfon or halofenozide) on certain nontarget turf arthropods, motivating the present study on the persistence of abundance effects over 6 years of annual applications. Arthropods were sampled monthly (July to October) in replicated plots using soil core heat extraction and pitfall traps to quantify soil‐ and surface‐active arthropods. Captures were identified to class, order or family. The most represented taxa were analysed to test for cumulative effects and their change over season and year. Imidacloprid had no impact on pitfall captures, although the abundance of Hemiptera, Thysanoptera, Coleoptera and Collembola was suppressed in soil core captures. Among beetles, impact was expressed in adults (not larvae), and in Carabidae and Staphylinidae (not Chrysomelidae or Curculionidae). Among springtails, impact was expressed in Entomobryomorpha (not Poduromorpha or Symphypleona). Impact did not diminish with year but there was variable recovery between applications. There may therefore be a diverging response of soil‐ and surface‐active fauna to the nontarget impacts of imidacloprid. The suppression of predaceous (not phytophagous) beetles indicates an indirect effect mediated through declines in prey populations. The magnitude of abundance effects confirms that the balance between target and nontarget impact should be explicitly examined. Implications are discussed with respect to functional relevance for nutrient cycling and the natural regulation of pests.",

Organisms living in those environments usually exhibit adaptive traits, such as a high ability to find and exploit new patches. Among them are phytophagous insects, such as crop pests living in agroecosystems. Understanding how phytophagous insects invade a new patch is of great agricultural importance. 2 Here, we investigated how aphids colonize a wheat field by studying the spatial and temporal dynamics of their populations at large (field) and fine (group of host plants) scales. 3 The sampling design consisted of counting and locating aphid colonies within 30 0.25 m 2 squares randomly spaced in a 1.5‐ha winter wheat field over 2 months. All colonies were precisely located within the squares and their composition in terms of morphs was determined. 4 We show that: (i) immigration of winged aphids was a major factor driving the aphid population dynamics during a large part of the season and (ii) within the field, populations established late in the growing season. Aggregated, populations of aphids became progressively homogeneously distributed at the field scale. At the scale of a 0.25 m 2 square, infested plants were clustered in randomly distributed small patches, and aphid colonies experienced high extinction rates, suggesting failure in population establishment. 5 Because immigration may considerably influence both population dynamics and spatial distribution, our study suggests that future predictive models should give a greater weight to spring immigrants.",

    "abstract": "Does anybody else miss the good old days of trophic levels? When predators, herbivores and plants knew their place and interacted in appropriate linear chains (Hairston et al., 1960; Oksanen, 1981)? We released biological control agents under the optimistic assumption that they would attack their designated prey, more or less, and at least leave organisms at other trophic levels well alone. We built management programmes and mathematical models based on this assumption (Berryman, 1992). We lived in simpler times. No longer. Omnivores, apparently, are everywhere, practicing their trophic promiscuity in complex and dynamic fashion (Rosenheim, 2007). Predators eat predators, herbivores and, incorrigibly, sometimes plants (Coll & Guershon, 2002). Food chains have become passé, replaced by reticulate webs that defy our simple notions of stability as well as all sense of propriety (Polis et al., 1989; Holt & Polis, 1997). We are face to face with the uncomfortable reality that our agents of control often eat more broadly than we would like them to. We live in the days of the omnivores. Ecologists who work in unmanaged systems have long been acquainted with the vexing issue of omnivory. Random food webs built on Lotka–Volterra predator–prey equations become less stable with omnivory (Pimm, 1982), unless the omnivorous compartments (or loops) within the webs are characterized by weak links (Neutel et al., 2007) or nonlinearities (McCann & Hastings, 1997). In other words, omnivory should be either rare or weak for systems to persist. Yet omnivory is apparently ubiquitous (Denno & Fagan, 2003; Arim & Marquet, 2004) and, judging by a casual glance at the ants alone, the links are hardly trivial (Davidson et al., 2003; Helms & Vinson, 2008; Ottonetti et al., 2008). For entomologists who work in managed systems, questions of omnivory are taking centre stage in research on agents of biological control. The compatibility of multiple control agents, interactions between native and introduced predators, damage to crops and the spread of crop pathogens are all influenced by the degree to which insects practice omnivory. We have always worried, to some degree, about nontarget effects of biological control agents, but concerns most often were for species at the same trophic level as the target of our control efforts (Simberloff & Stiling, 1996; Hawkins & Marino, 1997; Louda & Stiling, 2004; Stiling, 2004). More and more, we recognize that nontarget effects of biological control agents can emerge at multiple trophic levels (Rosenheim et al., 1995; Rosenheim, 1998) with the potential to compromise control efforts and influence associated ecosystems. High rates of omnivory may be responsible in part for the spread of exotic invasive predators and the decline of their native counterparts (Snyder et al., 2004b), with successful invaders being those species with adaptations to counter the ravages of omnivorous predators (Sato & Dixon, 2004). I have been thinking about this recently, in part because of the loss of our friend, colleague, and champion of omnivory research, Robert F. (Bob) Denno, who died last year. Others are more qualified to describe the profound and lasting influence that Bob had on the field of entomology. One of his interests in recent years was the study of omnivory, and his group helped to stimulate cutting-edge research on omnivores in natural and managed systems. This paper is not a tribute to Bob's research. Rather, his passing prompted me to think about the advances in omnivore research made during the last 5 years or so (I cheat with reference to a few important papers of finer vintage), and I present some highlights here with particular reference to managed systems. Omnivores are organisms that feed on more than one trophic level (Pimm & Lawton, 1978). Omnivores therefore include 'herbivores' that engage in cannibalism, 'predators' that suck plant juices or consume seeds or pollen and 'predators' that feed on other predators as well as herbivores (Coll & Guershon, 2002; Denno & Fagan, 2003). Most of us are familiar with ants as prototypical omnivores. Many ant species will consume animal tissue, plant exudates, phloem, seeds (or their elaiosomes) and honeydew produced by herbivorous insects (Carroll & Janzen, 1973). At least for some ant species, omnivory is not simply a response to low resource availability. For example, colonies of the invasive red imported fire ant Solenopsis invicta in the southern U.S.A. grow 50% larger in the presence of honeydew-producing insects than they do when provided with unlimited access to insect prey (Helms & Vinson, 2008). Given that honeydew is generally thought to be a lower-quality resource than animal tissue (Speight et al., 2008), there must be something about resource diversity that is important to fire ants. A subset of omnivores, known as intraguild predators (Polis et al., 1989), feed on prey items and the prey of their prey (Fig. 1). As a result, intraguild (IG) predators both eat IG prey and compete with them for resources. Intraguild predation (IGP) appears to be astonishingly common in nature, with 58–87% of species engaged in IGP interactions in the 113 food webs analysed by Arim and Marquet (2004). This is a staggering proportion of species, and a clear challenge to the notion of discrete trophic levels. According to a wide variety of models of intraguild predation (IGP), coexistence (stability) is possible only when the IG prey is a stronger competitor than the IG predator for the shared resource and only at intermediate levels of resource productivity (Holt & Polis, 1997; Borer et al., 2007). At low resource productivity, the IG predator is excluded, whereas, at high resource productivity, the IG prey is excluded. Given the apparent prevalence of IGP in nature over wide ranges of resource productivity, there must be additional coexistence mechanisms that act to stabilize IGP interactions. These might include cannibalism among predators (Rudolf, 2007), spatial or temporal refuges for the participants (Amarasekare, 2007; Janssen et al., 2007), additional density-dependent processes operating on species (Ives et al., 2005) or additional prey available to the consumers (Briggs & Borer, 2005; Holt & Huxel, 2007). A simple illustration of intraguild predation where the intraguild predator consumes the intraguild prey when competing with it for the crop pest. Pest suppression can be compromised, thus reducing crop yields. If all of the above sounds a bit abstract, consider an example. The harlequin bug Murgantia histrionica is a specialist herbivore on bladderpod Isomeris arborea in California. The eggs of the harlequin bug are parasitized by two specialist parasitoids, Trissolcus murgantiae and Ooencyrtus johnsonii (Amarasekare, 2000). Because they overlap in resource use (harlequin bug eggs) and because O. johnsonii consumes T. murgantiae (but not vice versa) when they co-occur, the system is an example of IGP; O. johnsonii is the IG predator and T. murgantiae is the IG prey. All species coexist over a broad range of resource productivity (i.e. new bug eggs per unit time) and, in this case, the interaction is apparently stabilized by a temporal refuge for the IG prey. Trissolcus murgantiae is active at cooler temperatures and has an early-season time window during which it is free from competition with, and predation by, O. johnsonii (Amarasekare, 2007). I mentioned earlier that omnivory is apparently much more common than we once thought. Why should omnivory be common in nature? Omnivores are an interesting form of dietary generalists, extending their dietary breadth beyond their own trophic level to encompass prey items at additional trophic levels. A generalist diet is considered by some to evolve in response to a trade-off between dietary quality and dietary quantity, and this same logic has been applied to the evolution of insect omnivores (Denno & Fagan, 2003). For example, if the highest-quality food source for an organism is also the most abundant, there should be no selection pressure (or ecological benefit) for a generalist diet and specialization should result (Krebs & Davies, 1993). As described in some ancient religious texts, there are no omnivores in a world awash in manna. However, as the highest-quality food source becomes increasingly diluted by more common, lower quality food, dietary breadth should increase. Denno and Fagan (2003) have suggested that omnivorous predators are supplementing their diet of low-nitrogen herbivores with higher-nitrogen predators. Omnivory, then, is seen as a strategy by which herbivore-eaters improve their lot. A complementary view might be that higher-order predators are required to incorporate lower quality herbivores into their diet because other predators are too rare as sources of food. In other words, the relative scarcity of prey with high concentrations of nitrogen in their body tissues (i.e. other arthropod predators) should result in the incorporation of herbivores (intermediate nitrogen concentrations) and plants (low nitrogen concentrations) into the diet of some predators. Omnivory is therefore favoured by the relative scarcity of food items that are good stoichiometric matches to the consumer. Of course, the evolution of omnivory is not just about stoichiometry (Matsumura et al., 2004). Diet mixing in general can dilute toxins in food, reduce the risk of predation or parasitism, and increase resistance to natural enemies (Singer & Bernays, 2003). There are evolutionary challenges to omnivory because omnivores must be able to catch, handle, digest and assimilate a broader range of prey types than their trophically-conservative relatives. We might therefore expect to see phylogenetic patterns in the evolution of omnivory and, indeed, we do. For example, within ancestrally herbivorous and ancestrally predaceous lineages of terrestrial heteropterans, seed and pollen feeding and broad host ranges are both correlated with the evolution of omnivory (Eubanks et al., 2003). In other words, existing morphological and physiological traits can pre-adapt certain groups to an omnivorous lifestyle (Coll & Guershon, 2002). Our efforts at biological control are often conceived under the assumption of simple food chains. They reflect our desire to manage trophic cascades (Paine, 1980; Carpenter et al., 1985), whereby the abundance of top predators (agents of control) determines the standing crop of primary producers (our crops of interest) (Hunter & Price, 1992; Hunter, 2001). Omnivory may dampen the effects of trophic cascades (Strong, 1992; McCann et al., 1998; Denno, 2007), reducing herbivore suppression by natural enemies and increasing plant damage (Finke & Denno, 2004, 2005). For those of us engaged in the control and management of insect pests, one question is obviously central: does the presence or introduction of multiple enemy species, including omnivores, increase or decrease pest suppression? In other words, how badly do intraguild predation and omnivory interfere with biological control? Quite often, the introduction of multiple agents of control results in the establishment of only a single dominant control agent (Denoth et al., 2002). However, when multiple control agents are naturally or artificially established, what are the consequences for pest suppression? First, consider simple models of IGP. We established above that IG predators and IG prey can sometimes coexist, through a variety of ecological mechanisms either intrinsic or extrinsic to their interactions. What does ecological theory tell us about the suppression of their shared prey: the pests of our production systems? As a reminder, we have to be careful to distinguish between pest 'production', which broadly describes the addition (birth, immigration) of new pest individuals per unit time, and the standing biomass of pests, which describes their average densities in the cropping system. Pest densities can be low, even if pest production is high, when rates of predation are also high. With that in mind, theory predicts that the IG predator should become relatively more abundant (and the IG prey relatively less abundant) as pest productivity increases (Holt & Polis, 1997). Moreover, pest density should also increase as the IG predator increases in dominance. This is exactly what occurs in the dynamics of the iconic California red scale, Aonidiella aurantii, which is parasitized by Aphytis melanus (IG predator) and Encarsia perniciosi (IG prey). As the productivity (i.e. fecundity) of red scale increases among sites, there is an increase in the relative density of the IG predator, A. melanus, and a corresponding increase in scale standing stock (density) (Borer et al., 2003). What that means for pest managers, of course, is a higher pest density as the IG predator comes to dominate the dynamics. Simply put, simple theory tells us that IGP should reduce the suppression of pests by biological control agents. However, empirical studies provide a greater range of outcomes than predicted by simple theory, and the literature includes examples of negative, neutral and positive interactions among predators that share prey resources. A recent meta-analysis has suggested that prey suppression is more often higher in diverse than in simple predator communities (Cardinale et al., 2006), although issues of omnivory were not examined directly. In a second meta-analysis focused more specifically on omnivory, mutual IGP (when predator species can consume each other) was shown to compromise pest suppression in multi-predator systems, whereas unidirectional IGP (or the absence of IGP) did not (Vance-Chalcraft et al., 2007). In other words, the strength and form of IGP in diverse predator communities appears to determine subsequent effects on pest suppression. As a gentle reminder, meta-analyses are usually aggregates of studies that report both significant positive and negative effects; the negative reports do not cease to be valid in their own right just because they are less common on average than the positive ones. Perhaps the more interesting question is why the effects of multi-predator species on pest suppression appear to be context dependent (Straub & Snyder, 2008). We are making major progress in answering this question, in part because theory on interactions among predator species is being linked to theory on relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem processes (Ives et al., 2005). We have learnt from these efforts that there exist at least four mechanisms by which predator diversity influences pest suppression. These are: (i) sampling (or lottery) effects (the presence or absence of dominant predators); (ii) resource partitioning among predators; (iii) indirect effects caused by intraguild predation; and (iv) non-additive effects among predators (Ives et al., 2005). This is a critical observation because it allows us to reconcile studies in which increasing predator diversity is associated with either higher or lower levels of pest suppression. The relative importance of the four mechanisms described above in a particular production system of interest will probably determine whether high predator diversity increases or decreases crop yield. For example, we might expect that multiple predators with strong additive or synergistic effects will increase pest suppression and increase crop yields, whereas multiple predators engaged in high levels of intraguild predation should decrease pest suppression and crop yield (Rosenheim, 1998; Sih et al., 1998; Snyder & Ives, 2003). The study by Ives et al. (2005) provides a roadmap for future research on the effects of multi-predator species on pest suppression because a series of predictions is made that should be testable in production systems. For example, their analyses suggest that the sampling effect will tend to cause a reduction in pest densities as predator diversity increases, so long as predators vary in their assimilation efficiencies or capture rates. Likewise, resource partitioning by predators among multiple species of prey will also tend to cause reductions in the average pest burden on plants as predator density increases. The latter effect of resource partitioning raises an important point: the predicted effects of predator–predator interactions on pest suppression depend upon the number of pest species within the production system. For example, if there is only one pest in the cropping system, or one that is dramatically more important to yield than all others, then IGP will probably lead to higher levels of crop damage. However, models also show that, in speciose pest communities, the total density of the entire herbivore community should still decline with increasing predator diversity when IGP is operating (Ives et al., 2005). This suggests that crops with diverse pest species may suffer less overall damage with diverse predator populations, even when those predators engage in IGP. In brief, the overall impact of IGP on pest suppression depends in part on the diversity of pests in the cropping system. It appears that any negative impacts of IGP on pest suppression may be weak in comparison to the positive effects of predator diversity in multipest systems. The apparent ubiquity of omnivory and intraguild predation (Arim & Marquet, 2004) has prompted much recent empirical work, aimed at untangling the effects of predator–predator interactions on herbivore suppression. In a series of clever experiments, Finke and Denno (2005) measured independently the effects of predator diversity and intraguild predation on herbivores and plants in a salt marsh ecosystem. They demonstrated that increasing predator diversity had little impact on herbivores and plants unless the predators engaged in intraguild predation. Under those circumstances, herbivore suppression declined and plant biomass was concomitantly reduced. Generalizing, multi-predator species appeared to be detrimental to plants when they engaged in intraguild predation. Yet some notorious IG predators can apparently participate in successful biological control. In experimental studies of pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum on alfalfa in the Midwestern U.S.A., suppression of pea aphids is higher (with corresponding higher alfalfa yields) with higher diversity of natural enemies (Cardinale et al., 2003). In this interesting case, the presence of generalist predators (Harmonia axyridis and Nabis sp.) causes declines in the associated cowpea aphid Aphis craccivora with the result that a key parasitoid, Aphidius ervi, focuses its prodigious powers of parasitism on pea aphids. The result is greater (non-additive) suppression of pea aphids than would be predicted from the sum of the effects of each enemy in isolation. Pest suppression occurs despite the fact that both Harmonia and Nabis are well-known omnivores, attacking other predators as well as herbivores (Snyder & Ives, 2003). What I particularly like about this study is that it includes measurements of crop yield, providing compelling evidence that growers should benefit from the presence of a diverse predator community. It also illustrates that positive indirect effects of high predator diversity can overcome simultaneous negative effects of IGP, as suggested by Ives et al. (2005). Similarly, a diverse predator assemblage can result in suppression of aphid pests, and higher crop yields, in collards Brassica oleracea (Snyder et al., 2006). In the U.S.A., collards are attacked by the green peach aphid Myzus persicae and the cabbage aphid Brevicoryne brassicae. In turn, these aphids are attacked by a diverse predator assemblage, including the predatory bugs Geocoris pallens and Nabis spp., the ladybird beetles Coccinella septempunctata and Hippodamia convergens, and the parasitoid wasp Diaeretiella rapae. All of these predators are actually omnivores, engaging in IGP. As a result, IGP has the potential to interfere with pest suppression and increase levels of crop damage. Nonetheless, any negative effects of IGP on pest suppression are swamped by positive effects of predator complementarity, which keep aphid numbers low and increase collard production (Snyder et al., 2006). Similar results were recently reported for potato (Straub & Snyder, 2008). Glasshouse production systems may also benefit from multi-predator introductions, even in the presence of IGP. In the U.S.A., the aphid Macrosiphum euphorbiae is a significant pest of greenhouse-grown roses. It is attacked by the parasitoid Aphelinus asychis, which can also establish in greenhouses. It appears that simultaneous introduction of the parasitoid and the coccinellid beetle H. axyridis has no deleterious impact on aphid suppression by the parasitoid (Snyder et al., 2004a). Rather, control is complementary, despite the fact that the beetle consumes mummified aphids that contain parasitoid pupae (intraguild predation). Biological control is improved in the presence of the beetle because it prefers to consume unparasitized, rather than parasitized, aphids. What actions can pest managers take to reduce the probability that IGP will interfere with pest suppression under multi-predator biological control? One possibility might be to increase the heterogeneity of the cropping system. Evidence is accumulating that high habitat heterogeneity can ameliorate the negative effects of IGP on prey suppression. Structured habitats appear to provide refuges for IG prey from their IG predators, favouring the coexistence of multiple predator species (Finke & Denno, 2006; Janssen et al., 2007). For example, in salt marsh ecosystems, spiders and mirid bugs combine to attack populations of Prokelisia planthoppers on Spartina. In the presence of abundant leaf litter (thatch), predators have refuges from IGP, with the result that plant hopper populations decline and plant biomass increases (Finke & Denno, 2006). In the absence of thatch, IGP prevents the trophic cascade from operating, and planthoppers cause declines in plant biomass. In the same system, habitat heterogeneity can also act to reduce rates of cannibalism among predators, a particularly unpleasant yet widespread form of intraguild predation (Langellotto & Denno, 2006). Although habitat heterogeneity does not always result in short-term pest suppression, (Langellotto & Denno, 2004; Janssen et al., 2007)), long-term persistence of a diverse enemy pool may facilitate long-term suppression of pest populations as environments vary over time. A tentative conclusion from the discussion above might be that omnivorous predators can still promote pest suppression and higher crop yields, at least in systems with multiple pest species and high habitat heterogeneity. However, what if those predators also eat plants? Is there a place for crop-eating predators in biological control? Of course, there is a long evolutionary history of mutualism between plants and predators by which plants provide food or shelter for predators in return for predation services (Speight et al., 2008). We might therefore expect that the benefits to plants of supporting plant-feeding predators should often outweigh the costs. It turns out that many predators and parasitoids will consume plant material and still contribute to pest suppression. Zoophytophagy, the habit of consuming plant and animal tissue, is common in agroecosystems among the Heteroptera, Neuroptera, Thysanoptera, Phytoseiidae (Acarina) and Coccinellidae (Coleoptera) (Robinson et al., 2008). Zoophytophagy can be beneficial to biological control, despite plant damage, if it maintains predator populations during periods of low prey abundance (Coll & Guershon, 2002). However, if the crop plants are chemically treated or genetically transformed, plant-feeding has the potential to reduce predator populations (Moser et al., 2008). Zoophytophagous bugs in the family Heteroptera are notorious omnivores, feeding on both plant tissue and insect prey. Indeed, the availability of suitable plant species for oviposition and feeding may increase Heteropteran performance and their subsequent efficacy as agents of control (Lundgren et al., 2008). Typically, however, plants are assumed to be low-quality resources for zoophytophages, exploited largely when animal prey is at low abundance. For example, Nesidiocoris tenuis (Heteroptera: Miridae) is a zoophytophage on whitefly and tomatoes in greenhouse production systems. The occurrence of plant feeding by N. tenuis increases as its own density increases and decreases as whitefly prey become more abundant (Sanchez, 2008). Rapid decreases in N. tenuis populations after whitefly declines demonstrate that plants are poorer nutrient sources for predators than are whitefly prey. The benefits to omnivorous predators of plant-feeding may vary from simple water uptake in some systems to significant nutrient and energy gain in others (Robinson et al., 2008; Sanchez, 2008). For example, the coccinellid beetle Coleomegilla maculata is an important biological control agent of corn pests in the U.S.A. It feeds on corn pollen during larval and adult stages, with adult pollen consumption exceeding a prodigious 13 mg per beetle (Lundgren et al., 2005). Given such high potential consumption of plant resources by omnivores (Wackers et al., 2008), it should be no surprise that there are commercially available 'nutrient supplements' for use with biological control agents. However, it is important to note that their value in pest suppression is not well established (Wade et al., 2008). Whether there is a net positive or negative effect of zoophytophagy on pest suppression may depend upon environmental conditions, including pest density and the period over which pest dynamics are measured. For example, adult lacewings consume floral resources (nectar, pollen) as well as aphid prey on buckwheat in New Zealand (Robinson et al., 2008). In the presence of buckwheat flowers, lacewings consume fewer aphids each day, with an apparently negative effect of omnivory on pest suppression. However, at lower aphid densities, a propensity for flower-feeding reduces the pre-oviposition period of lacewing adults, increasing their oviposition rates (i.e. a long-term positive effect on pest suppression at the population level). This is a key point: short-term experiments tend to illustrate potential negative impacts of omnivory and IGP on pest suppression that may be more than compensated for by long-term benefits under field conditions (Ives et al., 2005; Robinson et al., 2008). As a final thought on zoophytophagy, plants engineered to express toxins might be expected to have negative impacts upon omnivorous predators, and such effects have been documented over the years subsequent to the deployment of transgenic plants. However, most effects appear to be weak. For example, the coccinellid C. maculata, and the invasive coccinellid Harmonia axyridis will feed on corn leaf tissue, even when aphid prey and water are in abundant supply (Moser et al., 2008). Given that most corn in the U.S.A. is now transformed to express Bt toxins, coccinellids might suffer from feeding on transgenic corn. Rates of larval development in C. maculata appear to decline slightly when fed on Bt corn seedlings, but the effect is not particularly strong (Moser et al., 2008). With some exceptions, then, omnivores still appear to be our friends. They add diversity to the predator pool that is available to suppress the pests of our production systems. Their pathways of consumption may be reticulate and their interactions indirect, but they can often contribute to biological control in important ways. To maximize the benefits and minimize the risks associated with using omnivores in biological control, there are several lines of future work that would be beneficial. I have already mentioned the important predictions provided by the theoretical work of Ives et al. (2005) that need to be tested. Additionally, stable isotope analyses are providing more detailed descriptions of the relative consumption by omnivores of different food sources. For example, in Tuscan olive orchards, 13C signatures demonstrate that ants gain energy from both olive-based and herb-based food webs. In the same system, different ant species vary in their use of plant-based and animal-based resources, as illustrated by their 15N signatures (Ottonetti et al., 2008). Such studies provide vital information on the energy pathways used by omnivores in production systems and appear to support the important role of habitat heterogeneity in mediating the positive impacts of omnivores in pest suppression. Moreover, as Bob Denno would have pointed out, we need to consider in much more detail how the behaviours and life histories of predators and prey influence the strength and direction of interactions in omnivorous food webs (Denno et al., 2003; Rosenheim & Corbett, 2003; Singer & Bernays, 2003). We should also continue to explore effects of omnivory on pest suppression that appear influenced by ecological contingency, particularly variation caused by seasonality, habitat structure and nutrient availability (Gratton & Denno, 2003; Denno et al., 2005). Omnivores may complicate our traditional naïve views of pest management, but there is no denying that they make life more interesting.",

In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Rhabditida: Heterorhabditidae) at reducing maize root damage caused by the larvae of the western corn rootworm Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). The study consisted of 21 field‐scale experiments in Hungary conducted between 2004 and 2007. Key factors behind successful control, such as application techniques, nematode dosage, soil environment and rainfall, were analyzed. Five of the six tested techniques for applying the nematodes using readily available farming machinery resulted in a reduction of root damage, as well as subsequent plant lodging. According to damage rating with the Iowa 1–6 scale, damage was reduced by 3–18%. According to the 0.00–3.00 node injury scale, damage was reduced by 14–54%. Approximately 7–62 % of plant lodging, and thus direct yield losses as a result of in‐harvestability, was prevented. An increase in nematode dosage and/or an increased rainfall during the period of applications increased the efficacy of H. bacteriophora at reducing root damage. Except for the obvious effect of moisture, the soil environment had little measurable influence on nematode efficacy. The present study demonstrates the potential for field‐scale nematode application to significantly reduce damage caused by D. v. virgifera larvae. It is recommended that the method of agent application should be selected on a case‐by‐case basis considering the efficacy data presented here, the available application machinery and its associated costs.",

To better understand the dynamics of aphid species that occur as pests in cereals, we investigated the relative influence of top‐down control by a predator and weather (temperature and precipitation) on population fluctuations of three cereal aphid species. 2 From 1987 to 2005, populations of Metopolophium dirhodum , Sitobion avenae and Rhopalosiphum padi in insecticide‐free stands of winter wheat were monitored in the Praha‐Ruzyné region of the Czech Republic. Densities of an aphidophagous predator, the ladybeetle Coccinella septempunctata , were recorded from an overwintering site in the landscape. Weather was quantified using historical records. 3 A significant bottom‐up effect of densities of aphids on those of C. septempunctata was found, but evidence of direct top‐down regulation of aphids by C. septempunctata was only significant in the case of R. padi . There was no significant periodicity in the dynamics of the aphid or C. septempunctata , suggesting that there was no clear predator‐prey cycle. Combinations of C. septempunctata and weather variables could be used to explain M. dirhodum and R. padi per capita rate of change. There were also indications that weather directly affected peak density of M. dirhodum . 4 We conclude that regional estimates of C. septempunctata densities are not sufficient to determine whether aphid population dynamics are driven by predator–prey interactions. Feasibility of time series analysis as an investigative tool in aphid population dynamics studies is discussed.",

In the present study, saproxylic beetles were sampled from loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda L.) logs aged between 1 month and 9 years old using both emergence traps attached to logs in the field and rearing bags in the laboratory. Species richness peaked within the first year as a result of a diverse assemblage of bark beetles, wood‐borers and predators associated with young logs. After the phloem phase, there were no significant differences in species richness among decay classes. Beetle communities differed significantly among decay classes, with 25 and seven species being significantly associated with young and old logs, respectively.",

These crops are increasingly recognized as rich sources of vitamin C and anthocyanins, with production rising by 24% in Europe subsequent to 1998. To date, research into insect pests of Ribes has been fragmented, with little appreciation of how changes in climate and agronomic practices affect biology. 2 We review 12 key pests of currant and gooseberry crops in Northern Europe, with specific emphasis on their biology and current management options. These are blackcurrant leaf curling midge Dasineura tetensi, blackcurrant sawfly Nematus olfaciens, common gooseberry sawfly Nematus ribesii, European permanent currant aphid Aphis schneideri, redcurrant blister aphid Cryptomyzus ribis, currant–sowthistle aphid Hyperomyzus lactucae, European gooseberry aphid Aphis grossulariae, woolly vine scale Pulvinaria vitis, common green capsid Lygocoris pabulinus, winter moth Operophtera brumata, clear wing moth Synanthedon tipuliformis and blackcurrant gall mite Cecidophyopsis ribis. 3 It is anticipated that global climate change could lead to increases in the incidence of some aphids through increased overwintering survival and longer seasonal activity. Moreover, changes in management practices such as increased cropping densities (from 5400 ha−1 to 8700 ha−1) and machine harvesting could lead to pest outbreaks through optimal microhabitats and increased susceptibility to pest colonization. 4 Future management options are considered, focusing on integrated pest management approaches, including behaviour-manipulating semiochemicals, predictive models, biocontrol and improved plant resistance through breeding.",

The depth of edge influence (i.e. the distance from the boundary at which the presence of the boundary has no more significant influence) on the species assemblage of ground beetles in each woodlot and in each agricultural habitat was determined with nonlinear canonical analysis of principal coordinates, an ordination method that is followed by nonlinear regression of the principal coordinates on distance from the boundary. 4 The depth of edge influence on the species assemblages of ground beetles was asymmetrical relative to the boundary: it was generally higher and had higher variability in open habitats (14.4 ± 12.3 m) than in woodlots (4.9 ± 2.3 m). Species assemblages of ground beetles in edges were a mix between both adjacent species assemblages. Edge effects in woodlots were deeper in the woodlots exhibiting a deeper penetration of open habitat species. Symmetrically, edge effects in open habitat were deeper in the open habitats with a deeper diffusion of forest species into the open habitat. 5 Forest ground beetles were not threatened by edge effects. Rather, edge effects are likely to benefit agriculture, mostly through the dispersal of predatory forest species into agricultural fields.",

These bottom‐up effects may involve important ecological processes that affect pest control. For example, population densities of natural enemies may increase when alternative preys are favoured by a new resource. Ants, particularly Solenopsis geminata Forel (Myrmicinae), are recognized as effective predators of herbivores eggs. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the addition of a primary resource in a banana agroecosystem will increase pest control of the banana weevil Cosmopolites sordidus Germar (Coleoptera, Curculionidae) by ants. Using stable isotope analyses, we showed that S. geminata used the new resource pathway provided by the addition of a cover crop. This change was revealed by increased δ 13 C values ( 13 C/ 12 C) in a cover crop treatment (C4 plant) compared with a banana (C3 plant) in bare soil treatment. We also showed that the abundance of S. geminata , as measured with pitfall traps, was 4.8–5.4‐fold higher in the cover crop treatment than in the bare soil treatment. Estimation of egg predation rates was in the range 7.8–70.3%, which occurred in plots with the lowest and highest S. geminata numbers, respectively. The addition of a new primary resource in this system changed the origin of the carbon consumed by predators and increased their densities. The increased ant abundance resulted in increased predation of weevil eggs, which was consistent with our hypothesis. These results will be useful for the design of cropping systems that enhance the biological regulation of pests.",

The peach potato aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer) has a global distribution, although it is not known whether populations display regional adaptations to distinct climatic zones along its distribution and vary in their ability to withstand and acclimate to temperature extremes. In the present study, lethal temperatures were measured in nine anholocyclic clones of M . persicae collected along a latitudinal cline of its European distribution from Sweden to Spain. The effects of collection origin and intra‐ and intergenerational acclimation on cold and heat tolerance, as determined by upper and lower lethal temperatures (ULT 50 and LLT 50 , respectively), were investigated. Lethal temperatures of M. persicae were shown to be plastic and could be altered after acclimation over just one generation. Lower lethal temperatures were significantly depressed in eight of nine clones after acclimation for one generation at 10°C (range: −13.3 to −16.2°C) and raised after acclimation at 25°C (range: −10.7 to −11.6°C) compared with constant 20°C (range: −11.9 to −12.9°C). Upper lethal temperatures were less plastic, although significantly increased after one generation at 25°C (range: 41.8–42.4°C) and in five of nine clones after acclimation at 10°C. There was no evidence of intergenerational acclimation over three generations. Thermal tolerance ranges were expanded after acclimation at 10 and 25°C compared with constant 20°C, resulting in aphids reared at 10°C surviving over a temperature range that was approximately 2–6°C greater than those reared at 25°C. There was no clear relationship between lethal temperatures and latitude. Large scale mixing of clones may occur across Europe, thus limiting local adaption in thermal tolerance. Clonal type, as identified by microsatellite analysis, did show a relationship with thermal tolerance, notably with Type O clones being the most thermal tolerant. Clonal types may respond independently to climate change, affecting the relative proportions of clones within populations, with consequent implications for biodiversity and agriculture.",

Climate is a major driver of invertebrate species distributions and climate change is expected to shift pest assemblages and pest prevalence across Australia. At this stage, little is known of how individual species will respond to climate change. We have mapped the current distribution for each of the three pest Penthaleus spp. in Australia and built ecological niche models for each species using the correlative modelling software, maxent . Predictor variables useful for describing the climate space of each species were determined and the models were projected into a range of future climate change scenarios to assess how climate change may alter species‐specific distribution patterns in Australia. The distributions of the three cryptic Penthaleus spp. are best described with different sets of climatic variables. Suitable climate space for all species decreases under the climate change scenarios investigated in the present study. The models also indicate that the assemblage of Penthaleus spp. is likely to change across Australia, particularly in Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria. These results show the distributions of the three Penthaleus spp. are correlated with different climatic variables, and that regional control of mite pests is likely to change in the future. A further understanding of ecological and physiological processes that may influence the distribution and pest status of mites is required.",

Different modifications of conventional multiple funnel and slot traps with the objective of reducing natural enemy entrance into trap containers were bioassayed in field experiments conducted over four seasons. Based on the larger sizes of predators, different designs using welded wire‐mesh screens improved performance to different extents. Providing escape windows just above the screen on multiple funnel traps gave the most promising results, including when effect sizes among all tested designs were compared. Thus, a simple modification of the lowest funnel of the multiple funnel traps would reduce the bycatch of T. formicarius and T. caerulea , hence improving the efficiency of trapping programmes by lowering the likely impact on natural populations of these predators.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Lucerne or alfalfa Medicago sativa is the most important temperate forage legume worldwide. Only one or two varieties of lucerne were grown in the U.S.A. and Australia (the two leading exporters of lucerne) before the late 1950s and late 1970s, respectively. These dates coincided with the arrival of aphid species, which devastated lucerne stands and prompted the development of aphid resistant cultivars. Lucerne-feeding aphids, including bluegreen aphids Acyrthosiphon kondoi , pea aphids Acyrthosiphon pisum , spotted alfalfa aphids Therioaphis trifolii maculata and cowpea aphids Aphis craccivora , however, still present significant risks for the lucerne industry worldwide and account for 25% of global production losses. Moreover, increased production costs, negative environmental effects and emerging aphid resistance to insecticide applications have led to a narrowing of management options against lucerne aphids. Understanding lucerne aphid biology and trophic ecology will be needed to develop future management practices, including biological control. We review and synthesize research on the four lucerne aphid species, focussing on cultivar resistance and their interactions with other organisms, including predators, parasitoids, entomopathogens and bacterial symbionts. The effects of global climate change are considered, with a particular emphasis on the potential for compromised aphid resistance in lucerne cultivars under future climates. We conclude by identifying future research questions and perspectives for the sustainable management of lucerne aphids. These include the characterization of plant secondary metabolites associated with natural enemy recruitment, an understanding of the role of endosymbionts in cultivar resistance and a better comprehension of multi-trophic interactions of lucerne aphids, both with other herbivores and higher trophic groups.",

We measured the dispersal abilities of three forest insects associated with red pine decline: the eastern five spined pine engraver Ips grandicollis (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), its main predator Thanasimus dubius (Coleoptera: Cleridae) and the basal stem and root colonizer Dendroctonus valens (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). We also examined the edge behaviours of these species and the predator Platysoma spp (Coleoptera: Histeridae) between red pine stands (habitat) and clearings (nonhabitat). Thanasimus dubius dispersed 12 times farther than its prey I. grandicollis , with 50% of predators dispersing farther than 1.54 km. This profound difference in dispersal behaviour between prey and predator may contribute to the clumped distribution of I. grandicollis . Most T. dubius and D. valens were confined in the pine forest, thus showing strong edge behaviour. This differed from I. grandicollis and Platysoma spp., which were commonly found in open areas adjacent to red pine plantations. The bark beetle I. grandicollis and one of its main predators, T. dubius , exhibited different patterns of movement within a fragmented landscape. Despite a greater dispersal ability of T. dubius within forests, the spatial distribution of this predator may be restricted by fragmentation of its habitat, and provide an opportunity for partial escape of its prey. The present study contributes to our knowledge of top‐down forces within red pine stands undergoing decline. Differences of dispersal patterns and edge behaviour could contribute to the initiation of new pockets of decline, as well as the connectedness among existing ones.",

The model was checked for accuracy by comparing the first field observation dates of various life stages with predicted values using temperature data from the nearest weather station. In addition, variation in development time was assessed using field data. 4 The model was able to make predictions on a global scale. Although single- and double-brood populations differ in phenology, the predictions of first appearance dates were similar. Variation in development time showed that single-brood populations were more synchronized. 5 Our phenological model provides an accurate tool for predicting and simulating earwig population dynamics, as well as for enhancing the biocontrol of pests in pipfruit orchards.",

Predation rates were compared on the well established codling moth Cydia pomonella and the emerging oriental fruit moth Grapholita molesta , which has recently switched hosts to apples. The present study hypothesized that the ground‐active predators consumed the two tortricid pests in significant numbers without preference, and attacked the pests at different developmental stages. Using diagnostic polymerase chain reaction on the gut contents of field‐caught ground‐active predators, no difference in predation rates was found on these two pests. Spiders were the most efficient predators of emergent adult moths in spring, whereas the carabid beetles, feeding on diapausing larvae, were important in the autumn. The temporal complementarity between spiders and carabid beetles, attacking different stages of the pests at different times of year, highlights the need for diverse predator assemblages to optimize biological control.",

We implemented mark–release–recapture experiments (MRR) with both male and female codling moths of two laboratory and one wild population using a sex pheromone and pear ester as attractants in delta traps. The experiments were conducted in apple orchards in central Greece over two consecutive years (2007–2008). In addition, kinship assignment tests were applied on 303 genotyped individuals (11 microsatellite loci) from two contiguous apple orchards in central Greece aiming to estimate the dispersal of fertilized females. Both MRR and kinship analysis revealed that most male and female adults dispersed within 80 m, whereas some individuals moved at longer distances (maximum distance of approximately 200 m). A Bayesian analysis on microsatellite data revealed that exchange rates of codling moths between neighbouring orchards ranged among generations from 17.6 to 32.7%. The exchange rate between these orchards estimated by kinship analysis was 25.6% over all generations. The collected data confirm the view of the sedentary nature of coding moth and indicate that genotypes able to migrate at long distances are not present in the studied area. The availability of food resources within orchards during the growing season is one possible factor that could favour this sedentary behaviour.",

Thus, semiochemicals hypothesized to enhance (i.e. conophthorin), reduce (i.e. terpinolene, verbenone) or have a negligible (i.e. lineatin, sulcatol, retusol) effect on the attraction of X. germanus to ethanol were selected for comparative purposes. Ethanol plus conophthorin elicited larger EAG amplitudes than binary (1 : 1) mixtures of ethanol plus the remaining semiochemicals at dilutions of 0.001%, 0.01% and 1% per compound. Conophthorin also enhanced the attraction of X. germanus, Euwallacea validus (Eichhoff) and Cyclorhipidion pelliculosum (Eichhoff) to ethanol under field conditions. By contrast, terpinolene and verbenone reduced the attraction of X. germanus and other ambrosia beetles to ethanol.

Initially, this involved describing the field biology and ecology of a newly reported Cardiaspina species on grey box (Eucalyptus moluccana Roxb.). Within 1 year, the psyllid completed four generations. Its biology and parasitoid complex were similar to other Cardiaspina species during outbreaks. Minimum winter temperature was a key driver of psyllid development and density. Natural enemies did not prevent or control this outbreak. The outbreak resulted in area-wide and chronic defoliation of host trees. Resource depletion and summer heat waves impacting critical developmental stages of psyllids were the major factors responsible for the significant reduction of psyllid populations in early 2013. However, ongoing regeneration of trees in the highly fragmented woodlands may allow recolonization of new foliage and chronic infestations to continue.",

Traps placed 3 m apart in 15 × 2 arrays captured significantly more AL than AO , although the trap catch varied with location for both species and was inversely related to the number of nearby competing traps. Models of beetle movement indicated that a considerable proportion of males ( AL : 18.4–71.8%; AO : 35.0–58.3%) collected in the arrays had moved in from elsewhere and that AL beetles are more active than AO beetles . AL beetles frequently entered AO traps unless both trap types were present in the array, whereas AO rarely entered AL traps. Concurrent catches in pitfall traps placed inside and outside pheromone trapping zones indicated the trap arrays significantly reduced male (but not female) AO and AL beetles inside their respective arrays, that AO traps reduced AL beetles in AO arrays, and that both AL and AO traps could potentially reduce the number of mating pairs in these arrays. The implications of these results in determining the efficacy of this approach as a click beetle management approach are discussed.",

The present study assessed the capability of freeze stress to induce attacks by ambrosia beetles. Freeze stress predisposed Cercis canadensis L., Cornus florida L., Malus pumila Mill. and Styrax japonicus Sieb. to attack under field conditions, although no attacks occurred on untreated trees. More attacks occurred on freeze‐stressed versus flood‐stressed M. pumila in Virginia but not for S. japonicus in Ohio. Attacks on flooded trees were skewed towards the base of the trunk, whereas attacks on freeze‐stressed trees mainly occurred around the upper regions of the trunk and into the branches. The predominant species recovered were Anisandrus maiche Stark and Xylosandrus germanus (Blandford) in Ohio, and Xylosandrus crassiusculus (Motschulsky) in Virginia. Ethanol emissions from trunks of S. japonicus were detected by solid phase microextraction‐gas chromatography–mass spectrometry at 1 day after imposing freeze stress, peaking 4 days after injury. Trees with an intolerance of freeze stress are predicted to be vulnerable to attack, especially when subjected to mild winter temperatures followed by late‐spring freezes. Freeze stress could thereby facilitate the destructiveness of exotic ambrosia beetles.",

The vector's populations would be expected to respond to environmental conditions. Temperature plays a key role in the life history of insects, limiting its geographical range. We focus on the effect of different constant temperatures on the development and fitness of Dalbulus maidis (DeLong) (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) to estimate its thermal constant and threshold temperature, which may represent useful information for studies aiming to predict its potential distribution. Temperature had a significant influence on egg-laying and hatchability, as well as development and pre-imaginal survival of the vector, whereas the offspring sex ratio was not influenced. Dalbulus maidis required 648.26 degree-days above a threshold of 4.9 °C to complete a life cycle; it had a wide oviposition range (15–40 °C), although its fitness occurred in a narrower range (17.5–35 °C). Apparently, the distribution range of D. maidis could be restricted by host plant availability more than by temperature. The vector is unlikely to develop permanent populations in temperate areas of the American continent because there is no availability of host plants for extended periods, with mean temperatures below 17 °C.",

It is phoretic in woodborer beetles of the genus Monochamus (Megerle) (Coleoptera, Cerambycidae) and has been able to exploit novel indigenous species of Monochamus (but only Monochamus) in newly-invaded areas. North America (NA) is the continent of origin for the B. xylophilus/Monochamus spp. phoretic system. NA also contains the largest number of Monochamus species known to act as vectors for B. xylophilus. Understanding this phoretic system in its native geographical area helps to explain the evolutionary ecology of pine wilt disease. In the present study, we measured the flight phenology, size, sex ratios and species identity of Monochamus species in five geographically distant forests in NA. We also measured phoresy by B. xylophilus. We found the nematode to be abundant across eastern NA but rare or absent in western NA. In eastern forests, nematode phoresy was highest on the Monochamus species that flew earliest in the year. However, in the southeast, where Monochamus is most likely multivoltine with a long flight season, we found vectors with high nematode loads throughout the season, indicating that B. xylophilus can be transmitted to new hosts during most part of the year. The frequency distribution of nematode dauers on Monochamus was highly aggregated. Bursaphelenchus xylophilus in NA appears to be able to use all available Monochamus species as vectors. In native NA pine forests, the pinewood nematode appears to have an ecology that is sufficiently flexible to exploit different species (and both genders) of Monochamus, and disperse at different times of the year. This flexibility may contribute to its recent success in invading Eurasian pine forests.",

However, forest conversion into oil palm monocultures has a major impact on tropical biodiversity. In existing oil palm production landscapes, little is known about how different oil palm agricultural practices affect farmland biodiversity, particularly insect biota. We quantified fruit‐feeding butterfly species richness and community composition in oil palm areas subject to polyculture and monoculture farming in Peninsular Malaysia. Polyculture smallholdings were predicted to support greater butterfly diversity than monoculture smallholdings because of the greater structural complexity and floristic diversity associated with crop diversity in polyculture smallholdings. We also identified local‐scale habitat attributes important for maintaining fruit‐feeding butterfly species richness. We found no significant differences in butterfly species richness, abundance and the composition of butterfly assemblages between polyculture and monoculture smallholdings. Local‐scale habitat quality explained 32.1% of the variation in fruit‐feeding butterfly richness in oil palm smallholdings. We found that polyculture farming failed to increase fruit‐feeding butterfly diversity as a result of a limited number of crop species in oil palm smallholdings. To improve current agricultural practices and maintain high levels of butterfly diversity, commercial growers should increase the number of crop species planted in oil palm smallholdings.",

We examined the effects of local and landscape factors on the richness and abundance of bees in farms around B angkok, T hailand. Bee communities in 24 mango ( M angifera indica L .) orchards in heavily modified landscapes (61–99% anthropogenic land cover) were compared. We predicted that bees would be more species rich in orchards with higher flower diversity, whereas small‐sized bees with non‐eusocial and/or below‐ground nesting habits would be more sensitive to human disturbance, and hence rare. Twenty‐eight species were caught and individuals of genus A pis comprised &gt;92% of 3842 bees sampled and dominated all 24 sites. Habitat effects on bee richness and abundance were stronger at the farm scale than at the landscape scale. At the farm scale, total bee richness and abundance, as well as small, non‐eusocial and below‐ground nesting bee richness and abundance, were negatively associated with field size and positively associated with flowering plant diversity. The percentage of urban land cover within a 1‐km radius was weakly but positively related to total bee richness and small‐sized bee richness; total bee abundance was positively associated with wetland cover. A greater diversity of flowering plants retained in smaller fields maintained higher bee richness and abundances, particularly small‐sized bees. Farmers can enhance bee populations by maintaining small patches of flowers in their fields.",

Honeysuckle was a particularly abundant early season reproductive host. Consequently, six blueberry farms with honeysuckle at the margin were evaluated further. At each farm, nonhost plants and honeysuckle were monitored for larval and adult D. suzukii . The season‐long abundance of D. suzukii adults and early‐season infestation was highest near and within honeysuckle. In 2017, we tracked the movement of D. suzukii between honeysuckle and blueberries in early and late season using a protein immunomarking technique. Of the 1881 flies captured in our study, 7.1% were marked and their distribution pattern was even throughout the farm. Moreover, early season flies were less likely to remain in the marked host compared with late season flies. The findings of the present study highlight the importance of wild hosts on local pest pressure from D. suzukii and suggest that wild host management should be considered as part of integrated strategies for reducing the economic impacts of this pest.",

We evaluated the effects of agricultural landscape composition and heterogeneity at two different spatial scales (radii of 250 and 1000 m), on the diversity and abundance of native and exotic coccinellids, associated with alfalfa fields located in two regions of Central Chile. Data were analyzed using partial least square regressions, considering the whole coccinellid assemblage and the three most abundant species. In both regions, coccinellid diversity and the abundance and proportion of native coccinellids in alfalfa responded differentially from total abundance and the abundance of exotic coccinellids. The diversity and abundance of coccinellids in alfalfa increased with the compositional and configurational heterogeneity of the landscape. The abundance of both native and exotic coccinellids in alfalfa fields decreased as the area covered by cultivated lands, such as annual crops and orchards, increased. Nevertheless, the responses of native and exotic coccinellids were not consistent among regions, which may be explained by responses of the dominant species in each region. The results of the present study suggest that variables related to a higher intensification of agricultural landscapes (lower compositional and configurational heterogeneity, as well as more annual crops) reduce coccinellid diversity and abundance in alfalfa fields. To maintain a higher abundance and diversity of these natural enemies in alfalfa, more heterogeneous landscapes with less annual crops should be promoted.",

Harpalus affinis (Schrank, 1781) was collected from organically or conventionally managed winter‐wheat fields with high or low surrounding shares of organic fields, aiming to test the impact of agricultural management on its activity density, body size and nutritional condition. Body size and nutritional condition were then related to the arable weed seed predation of this granivorous carabid beetle. Activity density of H. affinis was 3.5‐fold higher in organically compared with conventionally managed fields, if these were primarily surrounded by conventional fields. Body size was larger in fields surrounded by large proportions of organically managed land, independent of local management. The nutritional condition of beetles was unaffected by local or landscape scale farming. Per capita seed predation significantly increased with body size, whereas nutritional condition had no effect. The results of the present study suggest that organic farming at local and landscape scales enhances the potential of species to control arable weeds by increasing activity densities and intraspecific body size. Seed predation therefore not only depends on local and landscape effects on the community composition of local guilds of granivores, but also on the contribution of individual species to this important ecosystem service.",

Consequently, via bottom‐up processes, they also can have an impact on the performance of herbivorous insects. However, the extent to which the modification of plant growth is responsible for such an impact remains unclear. We conducted a factorial experiment quantifying Myzus persicae aphid abundance and the vegetative growth of Prunus persica peach tree shoots under contrasting levels of nitrogen and water supplies. We used a hierarchical analysis of multiple regression models to determine whether the consequences of the availability of nitrogen and water on aphid abundance could be the result of a modification of plant growth. Maximum aphid abundance was achieved under nitrogen and water comfort conditions. The best model explaining variance in aphid abundance took into account vegetative growth and water supply, as well as their interaction. The results of the present study suggest that a higher nitrogen supply increases aphid abundance by fostering plant growth. Additionally, the positive response of aphid abundance to vegetative growth is lower in the case of water restriction because, under such conditions, aphids cannot take full advantage of tree vigour. Such a result provides new insights into aphid control in agriculture, as well as on the possible effects of climate change.",

The invasive spotted stemborer ( C hilo partellus S winhoe), which is native to A sia, is one of the most damaging cereal stemborers in A frica. The impact of C . partellus on indigenous stemborer species remains unclear, although recent work demonstrates its increasing ecological influence and numerical advantage over S esamia calamistis and B usseola fusca in A frican landscapes. In the present study, we discuss C . partellus dominance under A frica's changing climates and highlight the ecological and thermal physiological factors that may contribute to its dominance over indigenous stemborer species. C hilo partellus is an efficient colonizer and competitor and may have an advantage under limited resources typical under climate change. Its invasion potential may also probably stem from its short generation time, overwintering physiology, temperature and relative humidity resilience, wide host preferences, and asynchrony with its biocontrol agents. Using laboratory experiments, we show that C . partellus has a high basal temperature tolerance and related plasticity compared with S . calamistis and B . fusca. These results indicate that ecophysiology may determine invasion success and thus may explain the relative invasion advantage of C . partellus in A frican landscapes. We recommend that future climate change work be directed towards more comprehensive stemborer total ecology research, stemborer thermal biology and implications on the efficacy of biocontrol. Specifically, knowledge of stemborer‐natural enemy evolutionary potential is vital for understanding how climate change and variability may shape host‐natural enemy interactions, with implications for pest forecasts, prediction models and pest management.",

We hypothesized that altered aphid performance under elevated CO 2 is linked to phloem nitrogen chemistry. Rhopalosiphum padi performance on endophyte‐infected or uninfected tall fescue was examined under three levels of CO 2 (ambient, 800 and 1000 p.p.m.) and high and low nitrogen fertilization. Ethylenediaminetetracetic acid‐facilitated exudation was used to sample phloem sap, followed by quantification of relative amino acid concentrations using reverse‐phase high‐performance liquid chromatography. Aphid abundance was reduced at 800 p.p.m. relative to ambient CO 2 but returned to baseline at 1000 p.p.m. The density of aphids was reduced in both the elevated CO 2 treatments. Aphids were unsuccessful at colonizing endophyte‐infected plants, possibly as a result of the presence of loline alkaloids. Multivariate analysis showed that certain groups of phloem amino acids were altered by nitrogen fertilization and CO 2 . We found that four amino acids (valine, arginine, glutamine and aspartate) were correlated with aphid performance. These findings partially explained the effect of plant nitrogen fertilization and elevated CO 2 on aphids. The present study represents a first step toward providing a mechanistic explanation of the aphid performance changes that may result from rising atmospheric CO 2 .",

The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of intercropping rosemary, lavender or basil on the performance of Myzus persicae populations on sweet pepper plants (Capsicum annum) under greenhouse conditions. In a first set of experiments, sweet pepper plants were neighboured by either one or two CPs. In another set of experiments, rosemary was tested at three distances (0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 m) from the host plant. The first set of experiments showed similar patterns of aphid performance (i.e. number of females and nymphs) when a sweet pepper plant was surrounded by one or two companion plants. However, aphid performance was affected more when sweet pepper plants were intercropped with rosemary compared with lavender or basil. The effect of the companion plant decreased significantly with distance. Rosemary was most effective at 0.5 m, although its effectiveness decreased at 1.5 m, becoming insignificant at 2.5 m. The results suggest that a CP may be effective under greenhouse conditions provided that it is located near the target plant.",

Its invasion has been overlooked and was only finally appreciated in 2008. Subsequently, the scale and area of damage to the forests has increased catastrophically. Thus, extensive monitoring and population control are required to localize and stop any further spread of the invasion. We used mitochondrial DNA markers to analyze the genetic diversity and population structure of invasive and aboriginal populations of P . proximus , aiming to establish the main sources and corridors of its spread and to infer the history of colonization. Eighteen haplotypes clustered in five groups were identified. The aboriginal populations had the highest degree of haplotype variability, including almost all haplotypes found in the areas of invasion. The S iberian introduced populations had a sufficient reduction of genetic variation, and a strong geographical partitioning. The E uropean populations mostly had the same haplotypes as the invasive S iberian populations. The results of the present study support the scenario of P . proximus spreading from the F ar E ast of R ussia westward via timber transport along the major R ussian railway network.",

For secondary forest pests, such as the pine bark beetle I ps sexdentatus , the resulting increase in population level could trigger more frequent outbreaks. However, this positive effect could be outweighed by a temperature‐dependent decrease in offspring quality. To test these hypotheses, we carried out a laboratory rearing experiment with maritime pine logs at six temperature regimes reproducing hourly fluctuations and averaging 12–25.5 ° C . We estimated the thermal requirements for a complete development of the beetle and the number of offspring per female. The offspring quality was estimated using three traits: dry body weight, elytra length and lipid content. The minimum and maximum developmental threshold were estimated at 10.9 and 36 ° C , respectively, and the thermal requirements for complete development were estimated at 517 degree‐days. We predicted a mean of two generations per year in southwestern F rance, although an additional generation could occur during warmer years. The number of offspring increased exponentially with temperature, although we observed a curvilinear response of offspring traits to temperature, with optima at 15–18 ° C . This suggests that there are trade‐offs between productivity and quality of offspring. Global warming is therefore likely to result in higher number of generations of I . sexdentatus per year, with larger broods but of reduced fitness at high temperatures.",

We collected canopy arthropods, once each in dry season and rainy season, via canopy fogging in four land‐use systems in Jambi, Sumatra, Indonesia: Rainforest, jungle rubber (extensive rubber cultivation) and plantations of rubber and oil palm. The combined abundance and richness of six parasitoid wasp families, and Braconidae individually, was twice as high in rainforest as in rubber and oil palm plantations, and intermediary in jungle rubber. There was a significant positive correlation between combined abundance of six parasitoid wasp families, and abundances of potential hosts from the orders Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera and Lepidoptera. Braconid biomass tended to be highest in rainforest and lowest in oil palm plantations, and Braconid communities in oil palm differed from those in the other land uses. Both patterns were influenced by season.

To mitigate against yield losses, insecticides are routinely used to manage aphid populations. Aphids can form relationships with endosymbionts that confer fitness benefits or consequences to the aphid. Recent artificial inoculation experiments indicate that endosymbionts could increase aphid susceptibility to insecticides, but this has not been explored using aphid populations naturally infected with endosymbionts. Here, we sampled aphids from an important cereal production region in Lower Saxony, Germany. We characterized the endosymbiont profile of these aphid populations and conducted pyrethroid dose–response assays to test the hypothesis that facultative endosymbionts increase aphid susceptibility to insecticides. We find that the level of insecticide susceptibility is highly variable in S. avenae and we identify populations that are sensitive and tolerant to pyrethroids, including populations collected from the same field. For R. padi , we find evidence for decreased sensitivity to pyrethroids, representing the first report of reduced sensitivity to pyrethroids in R. padi sampled from Central Europe. We detected high endosymbiont infection frequencies in the aphid populations. 84% of aphids carry one facultative endosymbiont and 9% of aphids carry two facultative endosymbionts. We detected associations with Regiella insecticola , Fukatsia symbiotica , and Hamiltonella defensa . However, we do not identify a link between endosymbiont infection and insecticide susceptibility, indicating that other factors may govern the development of insecticide resistance and the need for alternative management strategies.",

We evaluated the extent to which (S)‐(−)‐verbenone, (E)‐(±)‐conophthorin and ethanol influence trap capture of A . maiche using two trap types and heights. We also investigated the effect of ethanol release rate on trap capture. Traps baited with ethanol alone captured the most beetles, while traps baited with (S)‐(−)‐verbenone or (E)‐(±)‐conophthorin alone captured few A . maiche , and each compound decreased capture when paired with ethanol lures. There was no difference in mean capture of A . maiche between trap types across treatments, and the height of ethanol‐baited traps did not influence the capture rate suggesting this species is widely distributed throughout the canopy.

We collected four times more bees and twice as many genera of bees in vane traps than bee bowls. Vane traps captured more individuals of abundant genera than bee bowls. Bombus species abundance did not vary between vane traps and target netting; however, richness was higher in vane traps. Bee bowls captured few Bombus species. Overall, we recommend using vane traps to sample most bees, and a combination of vane traps and target netting to collect bumble bees. We evaluated how three sampling techniques perform when surveying for wild bees, which will aid in identifying declining species as well as monitoring species of conservation concern.",

Production and selection by breeding require pollination, yet little is known of the pollination requirements and breeding system of this palm. 2 This study was carried out from 1999 to 2001 in coconut plantations represented by five coconut ecotypes commonly found in Mexico. It is the first study in the Neotropics on pollination and the breeding system of this palm. 3 Hymenoptera were the most numerous and diverse visitors to coconut flowers. The greatest period of insect abundance occurred during the rainy season (July to October). Insect abundance on the flowers correlated highly and positively with precipitation. 4 The abundance of visitors to pistillate flowers did not vary with season but there were significant differences between palm ecotypes; the most insect‐visited flowers were of the Atlantic Tall ecotype. 5 The introduced honeybee ( Apis mellifera ) had the most appropriate foraging behaviour, visiting both pistillate and staminate flowers. These insects were probably the most efficient pollinators as they carry pollen on their ventral surface. Ants were present on flowers day and night but had no effect on pollination. 6 Pollination experiments indicated a mixed mating strategy: self‐pollination by geitenogamy produced almost 19% of the fruit set, but cross‐pollination (xenogamy) was the most important contribution ( c . 30%). Anemophilous cross‐pollination only accounted for 10% of fruit set, whereas entomophily became the most important pollination mechanism under Yucatan conditions. 7 As coconut palm grows naturally on the oceanic strand in a wide variety of seasonal conditions of wind and rain, we suggest that they may have evolved pollination, breeding and mating systems that ensure fruit production under a wide variety of conditions, while maximizing the probability of cross‐pollination.",

This is the area from which all insects originate if the trap is 100% effective within the area but captures nothing outside of it. The effective sampling area reveals nothing about the origin of the insects caught. We defined the Cumulative Proportional Catch (CPC) that gives the proportion of the trap catch that originates from an area within a distance r from the trap. At r = r s CPC = 1, and in our study 50% of the captured insects originated up to 450 m from the trap. Thus, for the trap used in this study, a relatively large proportion of the catch originates some distance from the trap. 5 We also defined the Catch Concentration (CC), which is the ratio of the radius of the effective sampling area ( r α ) to r s . For our data, CC = 0.12, which is intermediate to high compared to the few other studies that we have extracted information from. If r α is considerably lower than r s , then only a small proportion of the insects caught originate from close proximity to the trap. When r α is close to r s , the catch adequately mirrors the population within most of its sampling range. 6 By using these two new concepts, we will better understand why monitoring traps mirror the local population in some cases but not in others. This will help in designing more reliable monitoring programmes.",

Systemically, however, the willow's susceptibility towards rust infection was increased by herbivore feeding, as indicated by a higher number of rust sori on leaves adjacent to feeding‐damaged leaves. The herbivore's performance was detrimentally affected by rust infection: increase of mortality (systemically), decrease of larval weight (locally and systemically) and prolonging of developmental time (locally and systemically). 3 Previous rust infection enhanced systemically the willow's susceptibility towards subsequent fungal infection. Previous herbivore feeding on the willow had no effects on the herbivore's developmental time and mortality.

Ingroup taxa belong to Otiorhynchus scaber and O. nodosus and outgroup comparison was made with O. singularis . All three species are minor forest pests. 2 Otiorhynchus scaber specimens are either diploid sexuals or diploid, triploid and tetraploid clones, from two different populations (Slovenia and Austria) that belong to two different evolutionary lineages. Otiorhynchus nodosus specimens are tetraploid clones. Both species show geographical parthenogenesis, as do many other Otiorhynchus species. 3 Mitochondrial data indicate that O. nodosus clones are more closely related to Slovenian sexuals of O. scaber than these are to sexuals from Austria. It also shows that almost all clones of O. scaber collected in one of the two regions where sexuals are found are more closely related to sexuals from the other region. 4 Three different hypotheses that may explain the distribution of O. scaber , mechanisms important for the evolution of the clones and implications of the presence of Wolbachia are discussed. 5 We conclude that parthenogenesis is likely to be linked to hybridization in O. scaber and that hybridization events between ancestors of O. nodosus and O. scaber are the probable cause of the presence of O. nodosus in the ingroup. We also find that polyploid clones are superior colonizers compared to sexuals and diploid clones, in O. scaber . 6 The results suggest that systems where both sexuals and clones exist are more complex than previously suggested. The mapping of genetic variation in clonal complexes and the tracing of clonal origins may be useful in pest management.",

Compared with the control (0 mL/plant), mean reductions due to neem in numbers of egg batch and eggs laid were 70 and 88% for S. calamistis and 50 and 49% for E. saccharina , respectively, but no differences were found among neem concentrations. 3 For both species, larval and pupal development time was shortest in the control and longest with the highest oil concentration. Immature survival, larval weight and fecundity were highest in the control and similar in the neem treatments. 4 No differences were found in sex ratios. Egg viability was highest in the control (approximately 87%) and lowest (72%) with the highest oil concentration. As a result of lower fecundity and longer developmental time, on average, the intrinsic rates of increase in the neem treatments were 30% lower than in the control. 5 In view of the low oviposition rates, immature survival, fecundity and egg viability in the neem treatments, and the relatively high persistence of neem oil, it can be expected that the reduction in densities of the two borers species in the field will be considerable.",

However, several peculiarities in the leafminer's biology and ecology, such as its inefficient control through natural enemies, indicate that it may be of exotic origin. 2 In this study, the parasitism of C. ohridella was examined in natural and artificial horse‐chestnut stands in South‐eastern Europe. The size and composition of the parasitoid complex of natural stands was comparable with that known from artificial stands. No specialist parasitoid species were detected in any of the samples. The only parasitoid species found exclusively in natural stands during this investigation were the braconid Colastes braconius and the eulophid Chrysocharis phryne . Both are known to be polyphagous on many leafminers in Europe and C. braconius has been often recorded from C. ohridella in artificial stands in previous studies. Parasitism levels varied within the same range (3.6–21.0%) throughout the entire region, in both types of habitats. 3 These results suggest that the parasitoid complex of C. ohridella in natural and planted horse‐chestnut stands in Europe is typically that of an exotic, recently introduced leafminer. Consequently, C. ohridella is probably not indigenous in the Balkans, but has been introduced to the area of its discovery from another continent.",

We studied the effects of delayed mating on several aspects of the oviposition behaviour and biology of the oriental beetle using females mated in the laboratory at 4–13 days posteclosion. 2 Females exhibited a gradual decline in fecundity with increased age at mating that was largely a function of a decline in duration of the oviposition period, as well as lower female fertility: females mated at 11 days were less likely to lay any fertile eggs. However, egg fertility did not vary with female age at mating. 3 Because mating delay did not affect longevity, females mated at older ages experienced decreased oviposition periods; however, females laid more eggs per day with increased age at mating, which partially offset shorter oviposition periods. 4 A mating delay of ≥ 6 days relative to females mated within the first day of reaching sexual maturity resulted in an approximately 35–50% lower mean fecundity. 5 These results suggest that, for mating disruption to be a successful management tool for the oriental beetle, mating must be prevented rather than delayed. We compare the findings of the present study with the published research on delayed mating in moths and discuss the importance of these results in relation to management of the oriental beetle using female sex pheromones.",

Roots of broadleaved trees were almost never consumed. No clear preferences for roots of a specific level of vitality were observed. 4 No consistent difference between the shelterwood and clearcut was found, either in the amount of root bark area available or in the extent of root feeding by pine weevil. 5 A weak negative correlation between debarked areas on roots and seedlings was found, indicating that root feeding may have reduced damage to seedlings. 6 It is concluded that conifer roots in the humus layer constitute a major food source for the pine weevil and can be utilized for a considerable period in both clearcuts and shelterwoods.",

This review synthesizes existing knowledge on its biology and interactions with other organisms, including its host plant and the viral pathogens it vectors. 2 Information about trophic interactions with other insect herbivores and natural enemies is reviewed. Vine weevils Otiorhynchus sulcatus compromise aphid resistance in some raspberry cultivars, increasing A. idaei abundance by 80%. Parasitoids show mixed success in parasitizing A. idaei , although Aphidius ervi attack rates more than doubled when A. idaei fed on a partially susceptible raspberry cultivar, compared with a resistant variety. These findings are discussed in the context of potential biological control as part of an integrated pest and disease management framework. 3 Amphorophora idaei transmits four known viruses: Black raspberry necrosis virus, Raspberry leaf mottle virus, Raspberry leaf spot virus and Rubus yellow net virus , with A. idaei taking as little as 2 min to transmit some viruses. 4 Existing control strategies, including resistant cultivars, insecticides and eradication of disease from parent plants, are described. In particular, strong selection pressures have resulted in A . idaei overcoming genetic resistance in many raspberry cultivars and most insecticides are now ineffective. 5 Future directions for the sustained control of A. idaei are suggested, taking into consideration the possible effects of climate change and also changes in agronomic practices in U.K. agriculture.",

High rates of direct mortality, however, point to potential uses in augmentative biological control. Whether or not F. arisanus is released in California, its biology as a parasitoid of B. oleae has been little studied to date and the results herein may be applied in other regions worldwide where B. oleae is a problem.",

By contrast, Enoclerus lecontei was mostly attracted to I. pini pheromones. The host compound myrcene synergized attraction of both D. ponderosae and E. sphegeus to the pheromone of D. ponderosae . However, it inhibited attraction of both I. pini and E. lecontei to I. pini ’s pheromone. 3 Dendroctonus ponderosae were more attracted to trees than logs treated with its pheromones, whereas I. pini were more attracted to logs than trees treated with its pheromones. Some 78% of T. chlorodia were captured at hosts baited with D. ponderosae pheromones, whereas 83% of E. lecontei were captured at hosts baited with I. pini pheromones. We characterized the sequence of arrival to live trees baited with pheromones of D. ponderosae as: D. ponderosae , T. chlorodia , E. sphegeus , I. pini , E. lecontei . 4 Various combinations of I. pini and predators were added to logs colonized by D. ponderosae in the above sequence of arrival observed in live trees baited with D. ponderosae aggregation pheromones. Ips pini reduced D. ponderosae adult brood production. However, the combination of I. pini and E. lecontei did not raise D. ponderosae brood production above that observed with only I. pini present.

Furthermore, we studied how changes in agroforestry management affect population stage structure of each coffee pest. 3 Our results show that agroforestry management affected seasonal patterns of coffee pests in that higher densities of red spider mites were observed from August to December, coffee leaf miners from December to February, and coffee berry borers from May to July. Moreover, specific developmental stages of red spider mites, coffee leaf miners, and coffee berry borers differed in their responses to agroforestry management. During all stages, red spider mite reached higher densities in simple‐shade agroforests compared with complex‐shade and abandoned agroforests. Meanwhile, coffee leaf miner densities decreased from simple‐shade to complex‐shade and abandoned agroforests, but only for larvae, not pupae. Similarly, only coffee berry borer adults (but not eggs, larvae and pupae) demonstrated a response to agroforestry management. Environmental variables characterizing each agroforestry type proved to be important drivers of pest population densities in the field. 4 We emphasize the importance of considering seasonal differences and population structure while investigating arthropod responses to different habitat types because responses change with time and developmental stages.",

The main objective of the present study was to provide an overview of the relationship between C. ohridella and A. pseudoplatanus and to determine whether C. ohridella has the potential to shift to this native tree. In the field, females oviposit on different deciduous tree species. Although less frequently attacked than A. hippocastanum , A. pseudoplatanus was clearly preferred for oviposition over 12 other woody species investigated. Surveys in Europe demonstrated that the majority of A. pseudoplatanus trees found beside infested A. hippocastanum had mines of C. ohridella , even though more than 70% of the larvae died within the first two instars. Attack rates and development success greatly varied from site to site. Attack levels on A. pseudoplatanus were not always correlated with those on A. hippocastanum , and mines on A. pseudoplatanus were sometimes observed beside weakly‐infested A. hippocastanum. Field observations, experimental exposure of A. pseudoplatanus saplings and rearing trials in a common garden study showed that individual trees may vary in their susceptibility to C. ohridella , whereas there was no evidence that C. ohridella populations vary in their performance on A. pseudoplatanus . To date, there is little evidence that C. ohridella represents a major risk for A. pseudoplatanus .",

However, little information is available on the biology and ecology of such species. This is the case for Pentastiridius leporinus (Linnaeus), a cixiid planthopper reported to live on common reed across Countries of Central and Northern Europe. However, in the east of France, the same planthopper species appears to complete its life cycle in the sugar beet‐wheat cropping system and has been repeatedly shown to transmit prokaryotic plant pathogens that are associated with an emerging disease of sugar beet called syndrome ‘basses richesses'. To gather evidence on the biology of the planthopper in the cropping rotation, we analysed the flight activity of adults. We used transparent sticky traps for sampling migrating adults and quantified nymphs as well as emerging adults on the roots of wheat plants. Results showed a significant correlation between disappearance of nymphs and emerging adults from wheat roots and the occurrence of migrant adults in nearby sugar beet fields. Planthoppers migrated more abundantly and colonized sugar beet for longer periods than any other crop available. Flight activity was very pronounced during the migratory phase that was extended from the middle of June to the middle of July. A geographic information system and geostatical analysis revealed that planthoppers flew and colonized the centre of the sugar beet field rather than the borders. Overall, results obtained in the present study suggest that the ecology and biology of the planthopper vector in the cropping rotation is a primary factor that leads to the emergence of the syndrome ‘basses richesses' disease of sugar beet.",

    "abstract": "An integrated pest management (IPM) system incorporating the introduction and field release of Diadegma semiclausum (Hellén), a parasitoid of diamondback moth (DBM) Plutella xylostella (L.), comprising the worst insect pest of the cabbage family, has been developed in Kenya to replace the pesticides‐only approach. Mathematical modelling using differential equations has been used in theoretical studies of host–parasitoid systems. Although, this method helps in gaining an understanding of the system's dynamics, it is generally less accurate when used for prediction. The artificial neural network (ANN) approach was therefore chosen to aid prediction. The ANN methodology was applied to predict the population density of the DBM and D. semiclausum, its larval parasitoid. Two data sets, each from different release areas in the Kenya highlands, and both collected during a 3‐year period after the release of the parasitoid, were used in the present study. Two ANN models were developed using these data. The ANN approach gave satisfactory results for DBM and for D. semiclausum . Sensitivity analysis suggested that pest populations may be naturally controlled by rainfall. The ANN provides a powerful tool for predicting host–parasitoid population densities and made few assumptions on the field data. The approach allowed the use of data collected at any appropriate scale of the system, bypassing the assumptions and uncertainties that could have occurred when parameters are imported from other systems. The methodology can be explored with respect to the development of tools for monitoring and forecasting the population densities of a pest and its natural enemies. In addition, the model can be used to evaluate the relative effectiveness of the natural enemies and to investigate augmentative biological control strategies.",

This was undertaken in 24 wheat fields in ‘coarse‐grain’ and ‘fine‐grain’ landscapes in western France. A greater percentage of the latter landscape was covered by hedgerows and grassland and the total area covered by fields and the average size of the fields were smaller. The effects on aphid abundance of the distance from field margins, the presence of grassy strips and carabid abundance were determined in both landscapes. Both aphid species were more abundant in the ‘fine‐grain’ landscape, which may have been a result of the higher density of semi‐natural elements. In both types of landscape, the total numbers of aphids were negatively correlated with the distance from the field margin. This may have been because aphids were dispersing from overwintering sites in field margins. The abundance of M. dirhodum was strongly negatively correlated with the presence of grassy strips in the ‘coarse‐grain’ landscape, although there were no such significant correlations for either of the aphid species in the ‘fine‐grain’ landscape. Aphid and carabid abundances were negatively correlated in the ‘fine‐grain’ and positively in ‘coarse‐grain’ landscape. The results obtained in the present study emphasize the importance of semi‐natural areas in agricultural landscapes in shaping the spatial distribution of aphids and carabid beetles, their natural enemies, at different spatial scales.",

Gall size may depend on various factors, including wasp population density. In the present study area, small galls (with one or two cells) were the most numerous in 2008, whereas larger galls (with more than three cells) prevailed in 2009. Dryocosmus kuriphilus oviposition occurrence was influenced by both bud size and bud position. Buds with eggs tended to be larger in size compared with bud without eggs, suggesting that D. kuriphilus females prefer to lay eggs in larger buds (approximately 6 mm 3 ) compared with smaller buds (approximately 3 mm 3 ). The mean number of eggs per bud tended to decrease from the apical bud toward the basal bud. Three C. sativa cultivars, Carpinese, Fusca and Cesurone, were examined. Fusca grafts had significantly more galls compared with Carpinese and Cesurone, whereas Cesurone grafts had more larvae per bud compared with Carpinese and Fusca.

    "abstract": "Ants that protect food resources on plants may prey on (or deter) herbivores and thereby reduce damage. Red wood ants (of the Formica rufa group) are dominant ants in boreal forests of Eurasia and affect the local abundance of several herbivorous species. The pine weevil Hylobius abietis (L.) is a herbivore that causes severe damage by feeding on the bark of coniferous seedlings within areas of forest regeneration. We investigated whether ants can protect conifer seedlings from pine weevil feeding. In a manipulative experiment, ants were attracted to sugar baits attached to spruce seedlings and the damage caused by pine weevils was compared with control seedlings without ant‐baits. The feeding‐scar area was approximately one‐third lower on the seedlings with ant‐baits compared with the controls. Besides red wood ants, Myrmica ants were also attracted in high numbers to the ant baits and the relative effects of these species are discussed. The results obtained in the present study support the trophic cascade hypothesis (i.e. damage to herbivores is suppressed in the presence of predators). The decreased pine weevil feeding on the baited seedlings was probably a result of nonconsumptive interactions [i.e. the presence of (or harassment by) ants distracting pine weevils from feeding]. Understanding the role of ants may have important implications for future strategies aiming to control pine weevil damage. For example, maintaining suitable conditions for ants after harvesting stands may be an environmentally friendly but currently unexploited method of for decreasing weevil damage.",

Climatic effects might be less important and/or involve different drivers and processes near the centre of distributions. 2 We evaluated the effects of interannual variation in temperatures, radiation and precipitation on populations of pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa in Central–South Portugal, a low altitude area with a relatively mild Mediterranean climate near the centre of the north–south range of the species. 3 We tested for effects of climate on mortality of young larvae, growth rates, final larval mass and fecundity. 4 Results indicated high mortality of early instars associated with low minimum and maximum daily temperatures and low precipitation. Low minimum temperatures were further associated with high parasitism by the larval parasitoid Phryxe caudata (Rondani) (Diptera, Tachinidae). Furthermore, larval growth rates were higher with high solar radiation during December and January, which was itself negatively related to precipitation and air temperature. Slow larval growth rates led to lower final mass at pupation in the spring, and smaller egg masses and smaller initial colony sizes during the next autumn. 5 Thus climatic factors, and temperature in particular, apparently contributed to population dynamics of T. pityocampa in the core of its distribution, as well as at its northern limits. The most specific climatic parameters of importance, however, and the connections between climate, physiology and insect demographics in the core area were clearly different from northern areas.",

Species sensitive to small temperature variations are known to experience rapid distribution shifts as a result of current global warming, sometimes leading to new threats to agriculture and forests. Tomicus piniperda and Tomicus destruens (Coleoptera, Curculionidae, Scolytinae) cause economic damage to pines in Europe and around the Mediterranean Basin. However, their respective potential distributions have not yet been studied at a large scale. The present study aimed to investigate the influence of climatic and host factors on the geographical distributions of both Tomicus species in Europe and around the Mediterranean Sea, and to establish maps of suitable areas. Using 114 published localities where the presence or absence of both species was unambiguously recorded, we gathered WorldClim meteorological records to correlate the occurrence of insects with bioclimatic variables and to build potential distribution maps. The two studied Tomicus species presented parapatric distributions and opposite climate demands, with T. destruens occurring in locations with warmer temperatures, whereas T. piniperda occurs under a colder climate. Amongst the investigated climate variables, temperature appeared to be most correlated with both species distributions. The potential ranges of both species were further restricted by the availability of pine hosts. It appeared that setting new pine plantations in regions where T. destruens or T. piniperda are still absent could favour a rapid expansion of their distributions. Our data will be useful when aiming to apply management strategies adapted to each species, and to forecast their potential range expansions/contractions as a result of climate warming.",

There have been few attempts to use time-series models to determine meteorological variables affecting forager activity at hourly time periods over several months. Time-series models require large datasets to be reliable. We describe the use of infrared detectors at nest entrances to record forager exits/returns from 36 captive colonies of Bombus terrestris audax on a mixed farm in northern England, recording over a 78-day period. Over 1.73 million individual records of forager activity were obtained. These were aggregated into 1872 hourly blocks and analyzed with autoregressive time-series models that used nine meteorological factors as explanatory variables. Forager activity was positively linked to air temperature and solar elevation, and negatively associated with rainfall, humidity and wind-speed. The effects of increased variability in meteorological conditions are considered in the context of these results. The time-series models that we describe will be useful in future analyses of the large datasets of foraging behaviour that are becoming available through new technologies such as radio-frequency identification and video tracking.",

The thermal tolerance limits of both age groups changed significantly with acclimation and were correlated with rearing temperature. Across the 48 separate measurements of thermal tolerance ( CT min , CCT , CT max , HCT , LLT 50 and ULT 50 of nymphs and adult males and females), the temperature differential across the three indices of cold tolerance after acclimation at 15 °C compared with a population maintained at 23 °C were between 0.5–2.8 and 2.9–5.0 °C for nymphs and adults, respectively. By comparison, acclimation at 30 °C increased heat tolerance in terms of changes in the CT max , HCT and ULT 50 , and the temperature differentials compared with the 23 °C population were between 1.1–3.3 °C for nymphs and 0.3–1.6 °C for adults.

Outbreaks of eastern larch beetles are typically localized, of short duration, and collapse when the supply of stressed hosts is exhausted. Although rare, landscape‐level outbreaks of eastern larch beetles can occur if large areas of tamarack become stressed. From 2000 onward, an ongoing outbreak of eastern larch beetles in the Great Lakes Region of North America has resulted in extensive mortality to more than 75 000 ha of tamarack forest in Minnesota, U.S.A . This outbreak has no known biotic predisposing factor, such as extensive defoliation. Trends of recent climate warming, however, are suspected to be a contributing factor. Current efforts to model the effects of climate on eastern larch beetle population dynamics are hampered by an absence of data relating beetle developmental biology to temperature. In a laboratory study, we studied eastern larch beetle reproductive success, larval development and offspring fitness at temperatures in the range 9.9–29.4 °C. Offspring production was similar across temperatures. Successful brood development occurred at 9.9 °C, whereas the minimum and optimal developmental temperatures were calculated to be 7.5 and 27.9 °C, respectively. Offspring size and lipid content were maximized between 20 and 22 °C. Our results indicate a potential trade‐off between temperatures that maximizes eastern larch beetle offspring fitness versus developmental rate. The implications of such a trade‐off are discussed with respect to beetle population dynamics.",

In particular, in ‘warmer’ areas, the developmental time is shorter than in ‘cooler’ areas and it is associated with an earlier and more economically important third generation. Because the differences in temperature are not sufficient to explain the two patterns, research was carried out aiming to investigate whether the differences in larval development time are the result of a different number of instars and whether the photoperiod is a factor. In the field, second‐generation larvae develop through five instars in a ‘warmer’ area and through six instars in a ‘cooler’ area. Laboratory and field data showed that decreasing photoperiod, which induces diapause, is also an important cue for inducing larvae to develop six instars. In the light of climate warming and subsequent changes in L. botrana phenology over the last 30 years, the two different development patterns are interpreted as a means to ensure the best fit of the moth to environmental conditions. In ‘cooler’ areas, third‐generation larvae might not complete development before frost or harvest, and hence second‐generation larvae develop through six instars before producing overwintering pupae.",

Four beetle species, the pine engraver Ips pini , the six‐spined pine engraver Ips calligraphus sub. ponderosae , the southern pine beetle Dendroctonus frontalis , and the western pine beetle Dendroctonus brevicomis , cohabitate pines in Arizona. A pheromone trapping study in ponderosa forests of Arizona determined the attraction of beetles to conspecific and heterospecific pheromone components in the presence and absence of host volatiles, and tested whether predators differ in their attraction to combinations of pheromone components and tree monoterpenes. All four bark beetle species differed in their responses to heterospecific lures and monoterpenes. Ips calligraphus was the only species that increased in trap catches when heterospecific lures were added. Heterospecific lures did not inhibit the attraction of either Dendroctonus or Ips species. The replacement of myrcene with α ‐pinene increased the attraction of Dendroctonus , whereas the addition of α ‐pinene had mixed results for Ips . The prominent predators Temnochila chlorodia and Enoclerus lecontei were more attracted to the I. pini lure than the D. brevicomis lure, and the combination of the two lures with α ‐pinene was most attractive to both predator species. Cross attraction and limited inhibition of bark beetles to heterospecific pheromones suggest that some of these species might use heterospecific compounds to increase successful location and colonization of trees. Predator responses to treatments suggest that tree volatiles are used to locate potential prey and predators are more responsive to Ips than to Dendroctonus pheromone components in Arizona.",

The presence of the H. halys pheromone was the primary factor in increasing the retention capacity of tagged, released adults to host plants, although plant volatile mixtures added a small increase in retention. Plant species helped to modulate the effectiveness of both the pheromone and additional plant volatiles in retaining individuals. Plant volatiles did not increase attraction of adults to baited pyramid traps and may have inhibited the attraction of nymphs.

    "abstract": "Abstract Farmland biodiversity has declined over the past few decades. European Common Agricultural Policy encourages farmers to set up agri‐environment schemes (AES) that support biodiversity and associated ecosystem services such as pollination. Although few AES are specifically devoted to pollinating insects, many AES could provide resources for pollinators. In Belgium, AES designed to provide seed resources for wild birds (bird‐strip AES) contain mixed‐plant communities that may benefit insects, although their ability to support pollinators has not yet been evaluated. The present study aimed to assess the ability of bird‐strip AES to support pollinating insects. We identified and quantified floral resources, flower‐visiting insects and insect–flower interaction networks over 2 years on four bird strips located in intensive agro‐ecosystems in Belgium. The bird strips contained plant species that were either purposely sown or established spontaneously. The spontaneous Cirsium species, with its high nectar production, offered floral resources that complemented those of the sown species Raphanus sativus and Phacelia tanacetifolia . Most of the flower‐visiting insects considered as pollinators belonged to the orders Hymenoptera and Diptera. In conclusion, bird‐strip AES provided floral resources to pollinators, even in the absence of annual sowing.",

Sound pine seeds were offered to bugs under laboratory conditions. Seed content was analyzed via a multitechnique approach using a stereomicroscope, X ‐rays and microcomputed tomography, which was expected to better characterize the damage caused by this bug. Adults of L . occidentalis were capable of feeding on mature seeds by piercing the hard and thick coat. However, the consumption was low and demonstrated a slow start, presumably as a result of the time and effort taken to drill a feeding hole. A collaborative feeding process was suggested because all bugs in the same box appeared to have fed through the same hole in most cases. Consumption was estimated to be approximately one‐fifth of a seed kernel per bug per month. Consumed kernels appeared skunked and wrinkled.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pheromone traps are widely used for monitoring or managing insect pest populations. However, it is important to know their range of attraction to optimize the setting of pheromone trap networks. We propose an easy method based on the use of pairs of adjacent traps located at decreasing distance from each other. The range of attraction is deduced from the observation of reduced trap capture when the attraction range of two adjacent traps starts overlapping. The relationship between the relative trap capture and the distance between paired traps is fitted with a logistic curve. To empirically test these predictions, we conducted trapping experiments with the beetle Monochamus galloprovincialis , the insect vector of the pine wood nematode. Fifteen pairs of traps separated by 25 to 300 m, in France, and 18 pairs of traps distant from 25 to 400 m, in Portugal, were installed in maritime pine plantation landscapes. In both countries, the relative percentage of capture per trap per week was best fitted by a logistic model with two parameters. The estimated attraction ranges were 92 m (confidence interval = 62–211 m) in France and 123 m (confidence interval = 64–491 m) in Portugal. The interference between paired traps thus provides a simple and robust method for estimating the attraction range of pheromone traps.",

Wild bees share floral resources with managed honey bees and may be exposed to emerging infectious diseases. Although studies have explored the prevalence of pathogens in solitary wild bee species, data regarding the impact of pathogens on solitary bee health are lacking. We carried out experiments examining whether the solitary bee species O. bicornis is susceptible to infection with the emerging pathogen Nosema ceranae and recorded the impact of exposure on survival. The results obtained indicate that N. ceranae may be able to infect O. bicornis but its impact on host fitness is negligible: survival rates did not differ between control and inoculated bees, although male survival was marginally lower after infection. To explore the possible field‐relevance of our findings, we collected wild bees near an infected and a non‐infected hive and showed that N. ceranae was shared between managed and wild bees, although only the in presence of infected honey bees. The findings of the present study show that O. bicornis is susceptible to pathogen spillover and could act as a potential reservoir host for N. ceranae in pollinator networks. Additional studies on this species incorporating sublethal effects, multiple infections and other interacting stressors are warranted.",

In the present study, we investigated which vegetation variables of shelterbelts are associated with increased hymenopteran family abundance by screening 60 shelterbelts adjacent to vineyards or pasture near Melbourne, Australia. Associations between vegetation characteristics and parasitoid abundance, sampled five times at monthly intervals using canopy sticky traps, were investigated. The presence of vineyard or pasture adjacent to the shelterbelt had no impact on hymenopteran family abundance within the shelterbelt. The availability of floral resources influenced a single family; the abundance of the Trichogrammatidae was doubled by the presence of canopy floral resources. By contrast, an increased abundance of some large Hymenoptera families was associated with a decreasing leaf litter depth and the proportion of introduced ground cover, an increased grass height and the amount of ground with vegetated cover. These findings suggest that specific manipulations of shelterbelts could increase populations of beneficials to some degree, with potential effects on pests.",

In the present study, we used a substitutive approach to examine how two major components of global change, warming and predator diversity, affect the top‐down control of two phytophagous insect pests. Predator assemblages were created using a substitutive design to give three single‐species treatments (low diversity) and one three‐species treatment (high diversity) under two temperature treatments (current seasonal temperature and an increase of +3° C over current temperatures). The results obtained indicate a shift from substitutive to complementarity effects among predatory species with experimental warming. Experimental warming revealed complementarity between the predatory species in diverse assemblages because higher predation rates on both prey species were found in the high diversity treatment compared with what was expected based on low diversity treatments at the same temperature. Our analyses of prey selectivity provided evidence that resource‐niche partitioning is involved in the emergence of functional complementarity under warming. The present study highlights the importance of maintaining diverse predator assemblages if we want to increase natural pest control services in agroecosystems and reduce dependence on agrochemicals in a climate change context.",

We considered the effects of landscape context and local characteristics (epiphyte cover, herbicide use and local microclimate) on arthropod communities and litter decomposition in oil palm leaf axils. We surveyed arthropods and measured decomposition rates at two different heights on 80 oil palms located at the centre and edge of eight plantations. We found that oil palms at the edge of plantations hosted a higher abundance and more arthropod taxa than oil palms in the centre of plantations. Moreover, organic matter mass and height of the leaf axil were important for arthropod communities, and the decomposition rate was negatively related to ant abundance. However, epiphyte cover did not influence arthropod communities. The results of the present study show that leaf axils with more organic matter and at a higher location on the oil palm promote arthropod biodiversity. Furthermore, oil palm plantations adjacent to different land‐use systems have enhanced biodiversity.",

A study of time lags between the detection and reporting of new establishments showed that approximately 50% of new plant pests were reported after 2 years and 95% after 10 years. Therefore, the number of very recent establishments (and hence establishment rates) is underestimated. Correcting for the reporting lag, the annual rate of establishment was stable until the late 1980s, at approximately four species per year. Afterwards, the mean annual rate approached nine species per year. Approximately 50% of established species occurred only on hosts in the ornamental sector, approximately 25% in both wild and ornamental situations, and 25% only in the wild.

Accordingly, we collected bees from three different landscape types for three consecutive years in northern New England. Annual, seasonal and landscape factor affects were examined. We found that season and landscape type significantly influenced the bee community. Bee abundance and species richness were highest during the warmer seasons. At the landscape scale, overall bee abundance and species richness were greatest in the organic farm landscapes and lowest in the meadow landscapes. We also examined the bee community across multiple taxonomic levels: guild, family and species. Wild bee abundance varied significantly depending on the taxonomic level analyzed. Within genera, certain species had significantly higher abundances in meadow type landscapes, whereas other species had higher abundances in the organic or the conventional farm type landscapes.

Crop and trap type significantly affected pooled carabid abundance with an interaction of the two, the highest numbers of carabids were caught in subterranean traps in barley under sown with grass. Trap type accounted for the most variance observed in carabid community composition, followed by crop.

ALB has possible hosts in 37 genera, and their known distributions were incorporated into the model to assess their effect on pest distribution. Suitable regions for ALB are predicted to be widely distributed under both historical and future climate conditions, and across all continents except Antarctica. With climate change, climate suitability would increase in the regions north of 30°N and decline in most regions south of 30°N. The area of most climate‐suitable regions would be covered by potential hosts, and optimum hosts would dominate. The possibility of ALB outbreaks in the Northern Hemisphere is much higher than in the Southern Hemisphere, owing to the richer abundance of hosts.

The host ranges of fruit flies in the Comoros were studied by conducting a seven‐year survey on the three islands of the archipelago with a substantial sampling effort comprising 91 plant species from 37 families. The results showed that 45 fruit species in 16 families were infested by tephritid species. Eight fruit fly species were detected in the sampled fruits, but 78% of the individuals were identified as B. dorsalis , confirming its dominance and polyphagous status. More than ten years after its invasion, B. dorsalis has replaced Ceratitis capitata as the dominant fruit fly species on several species such as mango and citrus. The coexistence between B. dorsalis and C. capitata seems possible due to the capacity of the latter to exploit different niches, i.e. higher altitudinal ranges and a few host fruit species (among which, chillies and coffee berries) constituting a refuge niche. Information about coexistence between B. dorsalis and other tephritids is useful for the management and better estimates of invasion risks and associated biosecurity measures.",

In field experiments, trap lures containing both geranyl butanoate and geranyl hexanoate afforded large captures of A. mancus males, which were—on average—approximately 30‐fold higher than captures in traps baited with a single ester. Traps baited with geranyl butanoate as a single‐component lure captured a significant number of Palearctic A. sputator , indicating the establishment of A. sputator in its invaded Nearctic range .

Silvopastoral practices that integrate trees into livestock production could help address both local economic and wider environmental challenges.We aimed to assess the effects of silvopastoral practices on invertebrate communities on smallholder farms in Caquetá, Colombia. Using sweep nets and malaise trapping, invertebrate communities were compared between traditional pasture, silvopasture and forest edge habitats.Invertebrate communities collected using sweep nets were contrasting among habitat types, communities were significantly different between traditional pasture and forest edge habitats and diversity and evenness were greatest in forest edges compared to traditional pastures. It appears that silvopasture areas, by supporting similar invertebrate assemblages to both traditional pasture and forest edges, may be acting as an intermediate habitat.When individual invertebrate orders were compared, Lepidoptera and Coleoptera were found in greater abundance in the forest edge habitats, while Hemiptera were more abundant in traditional pasture. Hemipterans are often pests of forage plants in pasture systems and these differences in abundance may have implications for ecosystem services and disservices.Silvopastoral approaches cannot replace the unique biodiversity supported by native forests but could deliver benefits for invertebrate conservation and ecosystem services if integrated into landscapes.",

Fewer applications of synthetic, broad‐spectrum insecticides are made in MD orchards than in orchards under conventional (C) management. Spider abundance and diversity in MD, C and certified organic (O) orchards were compared. Spiders inhabiting the trees (arboreal), the understory vegetation, and the ground surface were studied. 2 Total arboreal spider density and total understory spider density were significantly higher in O orchards than in MD and C orchards. Many species occurred in both the trees and the understory. 3 Arboreal, visually orientated, hunting spiders and arboreal ambushers/runners were significantly more abundant in O orchards compared to C and MD orchards. Visual hunters were significantly more abundant in MD compared to C orchards. Numbers of spiders in two other guilds (web‐makers and nocturnal hunters) showed no statistical differences with respect to orchard management type. 4 The highest density of ground surface‐dwelling spiders occurred in one of the O orchards. Two C orchards had higher densities than any MD orchard. Ground surface species were distinct from those in the understory and the trees. 5 With one exception, an orchard's arboreal fauna was most similar to that of another orchard under the same type of pest management. Three exceptions were noted among comparisons of the understory faunas. The ground surface‐dwelling fauna of one O orchard was distinctive, whereas that in the second O orchard was similar to the C and MD orchards. 6 Reduced use of synthetic, broad‐spectrum insecticides in MD orchards did not result in arboreal spider densities comparable to those found in O orchards. A contributing factor may be that all species were univoltine. Spider populations may thus be severely reduced by even a small number of synthetic, broad‐spectrum insecticide applications and the time required for recovery may be lengthy.",

In New Zealand, viable eggs of AGM have been continuously intercepted on cargo from Asia, and therefore there is a high probability of accidental introductions of AGM to Australasia. 2 We predicted potential distribution ranges of AGM based on climatic conditions. Asian gypsy moth is predicted to be able to persist in N and SE New Zealand and SE and SW Australia. 3 Using three populations of AGM and 59 species (seven families) of plant (55 from Australasia and four from elsewhere), we also conducted laboratory trials to examine the ability of AGM larvae to complete development on native plants from Australasia. Asian gypsy moth was able to complete development on 26 out of the 55 native species tested. Furthermore, larval performance on at least five species of Australian native plant was as good as on AGM's preferred host species ( Quercus pubescens and Q. robur ). 4 Larval performance of AGM was poor on all but one species of New Zealand native tree species ( Nothofagus solandri ), and therefore the risk of establishment in the indigenous forests of New Zealand is considered to be low. 5 Given the suitability of some Australian plants and the climatic suitability for the establishment of AGM, this insect should be treated as a serious quarantine threat and managed accordingly, particularly in Australia.",

Although more spiders were collected on the forest floor, spider diversity was higher in traps located on wood surfaces than on the forest floor, and 11 species were collected more frequently on wood surfaces. 3 Spiders utilized DWM at different stages in their development.

Additionally, the proportion of immature spiders was higher on the wood surface than on the forest floor. 4 Spiders collected on logs with and without bark were compared to assemblages collected on telephone poles to assess what features of DWM habitat may be important. Web‐building species were seldom collected on telephone poles, suggesting that they depend on the greater habitat complexity provided by DWM. In contrast, hunting spiders did not distinguish between telephone poles and logs. 5 Fewer spiders and a less diverse fauna utilized elevated compared to ground‐level wood.

None had any disruptive effect singly, as a group or in all possible blends based on functional groups, despite the fact that the two aldehydes were antennally active. These compounds may have, in some instances, actually masked the disruptive effect of other compounds. The PE thus differs in its response from other Scolytidae, including other Ips spp. 3 Eight non‐host volatiles that were antennally active to other bark beetles, but not to PEs, had no disruptive effect, validating the use of coupled gas chromatographic‐electroantennographic detection analyses to detect compounds with potential behavioural activity. 4 The bicyclic spiroacetal conophthorin, ( E )‐7‐methyl‐1,6‐dioxaspiro[4.5]decane, was disruptive when tested alone. When blends of two aldehydes [salicylaldehyde and nonanal] plus an alcohol and a phenol [benzyl alcohol and guaiacol] were combined with conophthorin, an enhanced disruptive effect was revealed. No single compound, other than conophthorin, disrupted the pheromone‐positive response and no blend that did not contain conophthorin was consistently disruptive to both sexes. Conophthorin seems to be a critical component in the non‐host angiosperm message for I. pini during its host selection phase. 5 Combination of the repellent synomones, verbenone and ipsenol, with the five disruptive non‐host volatiles may provide a potent treatment to protect trees, logs or stands from attack by the PE.",

This can be explained by the fact that bole attacks are caused by beetles coming from the crown of the same tree. 5 A critical threshold of bole attack density (around 80 attacks/m 2 ) above which trees die was observed. However, because attacks continue after this threshold is reached, the density of failed attacks on the killed trees was used as an estimator of the threshold density. It decreased when shoot damage increased. 6 The existence of a critical threshold of shoot damage (60% damaged shoots) was also demonstrated. Above this threshold, stem attack density was always sufficiently high to kill trees. 7 The results emphasize that concentration of shoot attacks is the main reason for the extensive tree damage observed in China. 8 A model of relationships between shoot and stem attacks is proposed, suggesting that management to reduce shoot attacks would protect trees from dying by both decreasing the number of bole attacks and raising the threshold for successful attack density on the bole to levels that could not be attained.",

Individual compounds and two‐component blends were inactive. No significant difference was noted between larval responses to the attractive synthetic blend vs. MD potato foliage.

We conducted our experiments in Massachusetts (U.S.A.) with overwintering sistens adelgids, and applied standard densities of infested foliage to uninfested branches in a planned multiple‐comparison design. 2 Settlement rates of progrediens crawlers produced by the overwintering sistens were highest when adelgid‐infested foliage was loosely attached to uninfested foliage and both branches were then enclosed in a mesh sleeve. 3 Early‐emerging crawlers settled at a higher rate than did late‐emerging crawlers. 4 Increasing the density of infested branches did not affect settlement rates. 5 We also tested whether less severe winter conditions improved settlement, and found that overwintering infested foliage in a refrigerator decreased settlement rate relative to foliage overwintered outdoors. 6 Our results suggest a protocol for adelgid inoculations that could substantially increase the success rate of experimental manipulations and encourage additional research on the population dynamics of this pest.",

Currently, the model is limited to predicting rate of mortality after a spray application at site‐specific locations. The aim of the present study is to enhance the utility of this model by linking it with meteorological station data in a geographic information system (GIS) framework to investigate the spatial variation in the performance of the biopesticide. 2 The model provides maps that define spatial variation in pathogen virulence (measured as LT 90 for a treated population) across different regions. The model was used to explore the variation in biopesticide performance against four economically important pest species: Moroccan locust Dociostaurus maroccanus in Spain; brown locust Locustana pardalina in South Africa; red locust Nomadacris septemfasciata in Zambia and; Senegalese grasshopper Oedaleus senegalensis in Niger. 3 Model outputs for the different species were partially validated against data from field trials. The models provided good estimates of time to 90% mortality for five out of six independent comparisons. There was also good agreement between the spatial model and equivalent output from the site‐specific model. 4 Simulations of virulence against N. septemfasciata in Zambia indicated very uniform, rapid mortality with LT 90 throughout the country generally less than 11 days. Pathogen‐induced mortality of O. senegalensis in Niger was predicted to be slightly slower and more variable with mortality fastest in the southern regions (&lt; 15 days) and slowing to the north of the country (16–20 days). For both L. pardalina in South Africa and D. maroccanus in Spain, the model revealed highly variable patterns of mortality with LT 90 ranging from &lt; 15 days in some areas to &gt; 30 days in others. 5 The implications of these different patterns of variability for the development of optimum use strategies for the various species and the basic understanding of the ecology and evolution of insect–pathogen interactions are discussed.",

Using flight mills, we recorded a total of 46 flight trials over 23 h, obtained from infected and control (uninfected) females. 3 Although all wasps lost weight during flight, parasitized females were significantly smaller and suffered larger weight losses than uninfected females. In addition, total flight distance and velocity were lower in parasitized females. 4 Because nematode infection transmission relies on healthy wasps attacking trees previously visited by nematode‐bearing females, differential dispersal capacity could limit biological control success.",

It presents particular control difficulties because it has developed resistance to several insecticide classes. 2 For almost 20 years, M. persicae collected in the U.K. suction trap network have been analysed for insecticide resistance and the data disseminated to growers via a resistance bulletin. These data are generated by the biochemical analysis of individuals for two major resistance phenotypes: (i) elevated carboxylesterase and (ii) modified acetylcholinesterase (MACE). 3 The development of new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)‐based technologies using fluorescently labelled probes has allowed other resistance mechanisms, such as knockdown resistance to pyrethroids (kdr/super‐kdr), to be detected and has greatly increased the speed and accuracy of resistance monitoring. Unfortunately, these newer PCR‐based assays are incompatible with the older biochemical assays. 4 The present study describes the development and testing of new compatible methods for detecting elevated carboxylesterases and MACE for use on M. persicae caught in the field or suction traps. 5 These new tests have significant advantages over present methodologies by allowing individual aphids to be tested for three resistance mechanisms quickly and accurately on a single platform.",

Honeydew can be an important source of carbohydrates, thus potentially exposing a broad range of honeydew‐feeding insects to transgene products. 2 Snowdrop lectin ( Galanthus nivalis agglutinin; GNA) dissolved in a 2 m sucrose solution had no antifeedant effect on female aphid parasitoids ( Aphidius ervi ) but had a direct negative effect on their longevity. 3 When feeding on honeydew from Rhopalosiphum padi feeding on a GNA‐containing artificial diet, Aphidius ervi suffered a longevity reduction that was more pronounced than was to be expected based on the detected GNA concentration in the honeydew. 4 Analysis of carbohydrate and amino acid composition revealed that a change in honeydew composition caused by a GNA‐effect on the aphids could be a possible explanation for the additional reduction in parasitoid longevity. 5 When comparing the effect of honeydew from Sitobion avenae and R. padi feeding on GNA‐expressing or nontransformed wheat plants on A. ervi longevity, aphid species was found to have a significant effect, whereas the wheat variety had no effect. The latter result was probably due to low GNA expression levels in the plants. Differences in nutritional suitability between honeydew from R. padi and S. avenae could be explained by differences in carbohydrate and amino acid composition. 6 This is the first study to demonstrate that GNA ingested by aphids and transported into the honeydew can negatively affect the parasitoids consuming this honeydew. 7 We recommend that honeydew should be considered as a route of exposure to transgene products in future risk assessment studies.",

Adult preference and larval performance parameters among two native ( Pinus sylvestris L. and Picea abies ) and three exotic north American [ Pinus contorta Dougl., Picea sitchensis (Bong.)

Picea abies was both the preferred and the most suitable host species for larval development. The closest relative, P. sitchensis , was the second best choice in terms of preference and performance. Pseudotsuga menziesii occupied an intermediate position for both beetle preference and performance, and Pinus spp. were the least suitable hosts for beetle development. Adult preference and larval performance ranking among hosts provides little support to the plant taxonomic relatedness hypothesis. Taxonomic relatedness could play a role on the diet breadth, although only at a limited scale, within the genus Picea .

More recently, the type of fertilizer supplied has been shown to influence the abundance of some herbivore species. The diamondback moth Plutella xylostella is a global pest of Brassica crops. Although it has been the subject of numerous studies on host‐plant resistance and pest control, few studies have addressed the effect of abiotic factors, such as nutrient supply, on its performance and behaviour. 2 We assessed oviposition preference, larval feeding preference and larval performance of P. xylostella on two cultivars of Brassica oleracea . Plants were grown using two fertilizer types, John Innes fertilizer and an organic animal manure, at high and low concentrations. 3 Plutella xylostella laid more eggs on cultivar Derby Day than Drago. Derby Day was also the cultivar on which larval performance was maximized. However, differences in larval performance between cultivars were only found when plants were grown in compost with John Innes fertilizer, and not when fertilized with animal manure. 4 Foliar nitrogen concentration was greater in plants grown in high fertilizer treatments but did not differ between cultivars. The concentrations of three glucosinolate compounds (glucoiberin, sinigrin and glucobrassicin) were greater in the high fertilizer treatments. Glucosinolate concentrations were higher in the Drago than the Derby Day cultivar. 5 These results are discussed in relation to the preference‐performance hypothesis, and the assessment of plant resistance differences between cultivars using different types of fertilizer.",

Although its young larvae usually overwinter in diapause from early autumn to the beginning of spring, winter larval feeding has been reported when this species feeds on the evergreen woody shrub strawberry tree Arbutus unedo. The present study investigated life‐history traits of four populations of E. chrysorrhoea feeding on A. unedo , including phenology of the different life stages, larval feeding activity and diapause incidence. By modelling the relationship between larval size and host plant leaf persistence, elevation and mean annual temperature, we also studied larval development in ten populations of this species sampled from a range of geographical locations in Spain, from both A. unedo and deciduous hosts. The results obtained revealed that on A. unedo , E. chrysorrhoea phenology has shifted: from October to March, A. unedo larvae doubled their size, whereas, on deciduous Ulmus minor and Quercus faginea , larval size did not change. General linear models demonstrated that such differences were not related to environmental variables. We also found that on A. unedo larval feeding was arrested for 2 months, with this period representing a true diapause. The results obtained in the present study suggest that E. chrysorrhoea populations are phenologically adapted to their local host plants, and that the presence of foliage is a key element in the phenological shift reported on A. unedo . These results may have implications with respect to the formation of E. chrysorrhoea host races.",

    "abstract": "The present study evaluated the population dynamics of the heteroecious soybean aphid Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae) during an 8‐year period in Indiana, shortly after its detection in North America. Sampling conducted at multiple locations revealed that A. glycines exhibited a 2‐year oscillation cycle that repeated itself four times between 2001 and 2008: years of low aphid abundance were consistently followed by years of high aphid abundance. Similar patterns of abundance of A. glycines and coccinellids (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) in soybean fields, both within and between‐years, suggest that late season predation by coccinellids plays a role in the oscillatory cycle of aphids. Insidious flower bugs Orius insidiosus (Say) (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) were numerically more abundant than coccinellids, although the lack of synchrony between aphids and predatory bugs suggests that O. insidiosus has a limited influence on between‐year variations in aphid density. The inverse relationship between aphid densities before and after the start of the autumn migratory period changes direction in alternate years. High aphid density on soybean in the summer is associated with a reduced number of alate migrants produced in the autumn. Conversely, years with low density aphids on soybean in the summer are characterized by high numbers of alates that migrate to the primary host in the autumn. From a pest management perspective, the 2‐year oscillation cycle of A. glycines is a desirable attribute with respect to population dynamics because it implies that aphids cause significant economic damage only in alternate years (as opposed to every year). Cultural practices enhancing the conservation biological control of Coccinellidae may help to preserve the periodicity of aphid infestation and restrict the pest status of A. glycines.",

Tannins were extracted from balsam fir foliage of thinned and unthinned stands to reproduce stand thinning related variations in tannins. A mixture of synthetic monoterpenes was utilized to simulate the concentration found in young and old balsam fir trees. 2 Longer development time and lower pupal weight were observed for insects fed on diets with a lower nitrogen concentration and a higher tannin concentration (unthinned treatment). Tannins induced higher insect mortality at a low nitrogen concentration compared with the diet with a higher nitrogen concentration. 3 Approximate digestibility was higher for larvae fed on diets with high concentrations of nitrogen at both low and high concentrations of tannins. Efficiency of conversion of digested food (ECD) decreased with an increase in tannin concentration. Tannins reduced both the relative consumption and growth rate (RCR and RGR). 4 Monoterpenes increased spruce budworm mortality and this mortality reached almost 50% under concentrations of monoterpene typical of the young trees compared with 20% under monoterpene concentrations found in old trees. 5 A higher digestibility was observed for larvae fed on diet with a higher concentration of monoterpenes, whereas efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI), ECD, RCR, and RGR decreased with an increase in monoterpenes in the diet. 6 The results obtained in the present study are consistent with the defensive role of secondary compounds such as tannins and monoterpenes in the spruce budworm–balsam fir system.",

    "abstract": "1 High productivity in plantations of exotic tree species is achieved by management for fast growth in the absence of the full complex of co-evolved insect herbivores. In the case of Eucalyptus, silvicultural selection for desirable wood traits is concomitant with a trade-off against defence and a reduction of chemical and genetic diversity. These factors, combined with accidental introductions, rapid insect evolution and the emergence of new pests, increase the likelihood that future plantations will need insect pest management to maintain productivity. 2 Forestry researchers have suggested that selecting for resistant genotypes may be beneficial in insect control. There are, however, significant differences between long-lived trees and annual crops that make this approach unlikely to be successful. This is illustrated using several examples of research into resistance to insect herbivores in trees. 3 Selection for resistance to insects in trees requires an assessment of trial plantations for heritable variation in insect damage and then a determination of the effect of variation in resistance on insect population parameters. Identifying rare resistant genotypes using markers is difficult because many factors interact to produce a resistant phenotype, and phytophagous insects have less intimate relationships with their host than pathogens, resulting in weak associations with genetic loci. 4 If resistant genotypes are identified, their widespread deployment in plantations might not provide satisfactory management of insect pests when the use of extensive monocultures is continued. In this paper, experiments are suggested that would explore the effectiveness of polycultures or chemotype mixtures with respect to ameliorating the damage of insects on plantation productivity. In addition, mitigating the effects of some insects on plantation productivity by maintaining vigour of fast-growing eucalypts should be considered.",

For GCM‐modelled climate change, we used the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis GCM (CGCM2) and the Hadley Centre climate model (HadCM3), each in combination with two scenarios from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (A2 and B2). The BEM results using the simple scenarios were more similar to each other than to the results obtained using GCM projections. The results were also qualitatively different (i.e. spatially different and divergent) depending on which GCM‐scenario combination was used. This modelling exercise illustrates that: (i) results using first approximation simple climate change scenarios can give predictions very different from those that use GCM‐modelled climate projections (comprising a result that has worrying implications for empirical impact research) and that (ii) different GCM‐models using the same scenario can give very different results (implying strong model dependency in projected biological impacts).",

Although the frass contains various forms of nitrogen that may differently influence nitrogen dynamics in the decomposition process, how the nitrogen form in the insect frass is influenced by host plant quality remains poorly understood. 2 The present study examined the effects of application of fertilizer on leaf quality of Brassica rapa L. var. perviridis Bailey (Brassicaceae), and on the consumption, frass excretion and frass quality of its insect pest Mamestra brassicae (L.) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), with a particular focus on the dynamics of inorganic nitrogen. 3 Brassica rapa increased total nitrogen concentration, and accumulated inorganic nitrogen [i.e. leaf nitrate-nitrogen (NO3−-N) and ammonium-nitrogen (NH4+-N)] in the leaves in response to the application of fertilizer. 4 Although leaf consumption and frass excreted by M. brassicae was not affected by fertilizer treatment, frass quality was influenced by host plant quality as altered by fertilizer applications. Frass contained high concentrations of total nitrogen, NO3−-N, and NH4+-N under high fertilizer treatment. In particular, the larvae excreted much more NH4+-N than ingested. The relationship between host plant quality and insect frass quality, as well as the potential implications for decomposition and nutrient dynamics, are discussed.",

The maximum entropy model based on associations between unique occurrence localities and a set of environmental variables was used. Obtained models of potentially suitable habitats, based only on climatic variables, suggest that favourable conditions for each species may be present on every continent. However, S.

All of the other traits evaluated remained similar. With respect to developmental characteristics, the larval viability and weight of adult male R0.25 progeny were statistically lower compared with the R0 and S0 progenies. Prey scarcity between days 3 and 13 of adulthood did not affect R0 and R0.25 survival, although egg production was significantly lower for R0 females, followed by R0.25 females, compared with S0 females. The mean consumption of cotton aphids Aphis gossypii Glover over 5 consecutive days was significantly higher for S0, followed by R0 and R0.25, up to day 3 of observation. However, after day 4, prey consumption was similar among the three populations. The results obtained in the present study show that resistant females have a lower reproductive output than susceptible females and that this is not related to the knockdown effect; however, the costs of recovering from knockdown interfere with the survival of offspring and also slightly with prey consumption. Thus, we conclude that the lambda‐cyhalothrin‐resistant E. connexa population exhibits an egg production disadvantage relative to the susceptible population and that this is increased when the population is subjected to prey scarcity.",

At two locations, five plots of equivalent size and stand structure served as untreated controls. All plots had early‐ to mid‐outbreak beetle populations (i.e. 7.1–29.2 attacked trees/ha). Verbenone was applied at 370 g/ha in both studies. Intercept traps baited with MPB aggregation pheromone were placed near the corners of each plot after the treatment in order to monitor beetle flight within the plots. Trap catches were collected at 7‐ to 14‐day intervals, and assessments were made at the end of the season of stand structure, stand composition and MPB attack rate for the current and previous years. Applications of verbenone flakes significantly reduced the numbers of beetles trapped in treated plots compared with controls at both sites by approximately 50% at the first collection date. The applications also significantly reduced the proportion of trees attacked in both Wyoming and Washington using the proportion of trees attacked the previous year as a covariate in the model for analysis of current year attack rates; in both sites, the reduction was ≥ 50%.

We exposed adult female mountain pine beetles Dendroctonus ponderosae (Hopkins) to monoterpene vapours and assessed their subsequent oviposition in lodgepole pine Pinus contorta . Exposure to 31.25 and 125 p.p.m. of α‐pinene and limonene for 24 h did not affect the survival or establishment of oviposition galleries compared with controls. Females had fewer, smaller eggs and therefore lower cumulative reproduction after exposure to 125 p.p.m. compared with the other treatments. Limonene negatively affected oviposition more than did α‐pinene. Female body condition, a measure of energetic state, influenced the responses (i.e. significant interactions between condition and monoterpene concentration). With exposure to 31.25 p.p.m., females in better condition tended to have fewer, larger eggs, whereas females in poorer condition tended to have more, smaller eggs, compared with controls. Overall, reproductive investment declined with body condition when exposed to monoterpenes. Egg size and number increased with female body size. The findings of the present study may indicate the toxic effects of monoterpenes or may be a result of females choosing not to invest in adverse environments depending on body condition. In either case, reduced reproduction when exposed to high plant defences may be increasingly important as climate change affects plant defences.",

We evaluated three trap types: unbaited traps, traps baited with a three‐component pheromone lure and traps baited with a commercial Sirex kairomone lure and ultraviolet light. When no lure was present, the black intercept trap caught more females than the clear jar trap. The increase in pheromone concentration from 0.1 to 1 mg increased the capture of females, and not males, in the black intercept panel trap. Both of these findings suggest that the visual cues provided by the black intercept trap play an important role in attraction for females. Capture rates between unbaited clear versus black intercept traps did not differ but the addition of a ultraviolet light increased trap efficacy. Intercept traps baited with light were more attractive than the commercial kairomone lure. Both olfactory and visual cues were found to play important roles in the response of S. noctilio to traps. A black trap may enhance the capture of females, whereas the addition of ultraviolet light could enhance capture for both sexes. Integrating these different components may help in developing an improved species‐specific trap for S. noctilio .",

Nonetheless, clip‐cages are usually heavy and may damage the leaves, which renders them less useful for numerous research studies. We propose a very simple clip‐cage, which is cheap, extremely light, and easy to make and handle, and which has less of the negative, damaging nature of traditional clip‐cages. Each clip‐cage was prepared using two discs of foam‐floating tubes: one for support and one for confining the insects. On the upper surface of the latter, a rectangle of microperforated plastic flower sleeve (8 cm 2 ) was glued using a nontoxic glue stick. To bind the two parts to the leaf, four staples (23/13) were used. We tested the clip‐cages by confining Myzus persicae to Brassica oleracea and Brassica rapa leaves and then compared the results obtained with those acquired using classic clip‐cages. Each foam clip‐cage was assembled in less than 2 min. Our experiments confirmed the M. persicae escape rate of 6%, which compared favourably with the escape rate of 40% for the classic clip‐cage. Furthermore, the clip‐cages did not interfere with the growth rate of the aphids. The foam clip‐cages are up to 200% cheaper than the classic clip‐cages. They are light, durable, easily put together and transported, and have the potential to be easily used in field experiments.",

We evaluated the long-term impacts of forest defoliation by gypsy moths, and the suppression of their outbreaks with Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Btk), on native moths. Three years after a gypsy moth outbreak, moth diversity and abundance were compared among sites that were defoliated but not sprayed with Btk (defoliated sites), defoliated and sprayed (Btk sites) or neither (undisturbed sites). We conducted separate evaluations of the effects of disturbance history on the overall moth community, taxonomic subgroups (families) and moths differing in their dietary overlap with gypsy moths. Analyses of the full moth community revealed no effects of disturbance history on local (α) moth diversity or diversity of moths among sites (β-diversity). The α- or β-diversities of moths classified by their dietary overlap with gypsy moths (overlapping, partially overlapping, not overlapping) were also not affected by disturbance history. However, taxonomic affiliation was important. Geometridae α-diversity in late summer was significantly lower in defoliated sites than in Btk or undisturbed sites. No effects of disturbance history on moth abundances were found. We conclude gypsy moth defoliation had negative effects on a major moth family (Geometridae), although Btk application may have protected Geometridae from the adverse effects of gypsy moth defoliation. The results of the present study help to clarify the relative, and sometimes countervailing, effects of defoliators and microbial pesticides on forest communities.",

Trophic interactions among parasitoids of T. absoluta and other gelechiids feeding on crop and spontaneous wild solanaceous were investigated in north‐eastern Buenos Aires (Argentina), with the aim of assisting in the design of conservation biological control strategies. A quantitative parasitoid trophic web was constructed that included five gelechiid leafminers, five solanaceous species and a complex of 18 parasitoid species. The relative abundance of T. absoluta was highest in the Solanum melongena crop, followed by the wild plants Nicotiana glauca , Solanum americanum , Solanum sisymbriifolium and Salpichroa origanifolia . Greater parasitoid species richness associated with T. absoluta was found in the wild plants N. glauca and S. americanum. Pseudapanteles dignus was the main parasitoid of T. absoluta and co‐occurred with this pest in four plant species. Parasitism of T. absoluta by P. dignus was observed throughout the year in S. melongena , reaching values up to 33%, whereas it was sporadic and exhibited lower parasitism rates in the noncrop S. sisymbriifolium , N. glauca and S. americanum . The presence of some wild solanaceous plants should be promoted to maintain the T. absoluta– P. dignus interaction in horticultural farms.",

In the present study, we investigated which of five clones of rosemary may reveal a repellent effect on M. persicae and aimed to determine the possible VOCs involved. Analyses of the mixtures of VOCs released by the different clones revealed the presence of 15 main components. However, each clone was characterized by a specific volatile profile showing the existence of marked chemical variability. By testing the identified VOCs individually, using a dual‐choice olfactometer, we observed that five volatiles had a significant repulsive effect on M. persicae : bornyl acetate, camphor, α‐terpineol, terpinene‐4‐ol and geranyl acetone. In addition, only one clone of rosemary elicited a significant repulsive action. Nevertheless, all of the tested clones released compounds that are repellent to the aphid when tested individually. Therefore, the emission of individual volatiles by a rosemary plant is not sufficient to elicit a repellent effect. The concentration, proportion and even the association/synergy of VOCs in the released olfactory bouquets can probably explain these contrasting results and are worthy of additional exploration in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An increasing production of annual bioenergy crops such as maize has led to regional land‐use changes, causing further shortages of already scarce floral resources for pollinators. Diversification of energy crop production with flowering crops is discussed as a mitigation strategy. The perennial S ilphium perfoliatum , characterized by a flowering period between J uly and S eptember, represents a promising candidate crop. The present study aimed to investigate the management and landscape conditions under which a cultivation of S. perfoliatum could be an effective measure for pollinator conservation. In this context, hoverflies served as suitable indicators as a result of the different feeding behaviours of adults (floral resources) and larvae (mostly zoophagous or microphagous). We compared abundance and species richness of adult hoverflies in 15 flowering S. perfoliatum fields in G ermany with that in neighbouring habitats (maize fields, ditches/brooks and forest edges) and tested whether the landscape composition influenced local abundance and species richness in S. perfoliatum fields depending on larval feeding type. Only microphagous hoverflies were more abundant in S. perfoliatum fields than in neighbouring habitats, primarily in mid‐ S eptember. This might be explained by the different activity periods and adaptations to flower traits of the two hoverfly groups. Although the abundance of zoophagous hoverflies was positively influenced by a higher crop diversity, the abundance and species richness of microphagous hoverflies responded positively to higher proportions of semi‐natural habitats in the surroundings. Silphium perfoliatum can support certain hoverfly groups when it is harvested late to ensure a flower supply through to S eptember and when semi‐natural habitats are maintained in agricultural landscapes.",

    "abstract": "The giant willow aphid Tuberolachnus salignus was discovered in New Zealand in late 2013. Despite being a recent addition to the New Zealand fauna, the aphid is already widespread and abundant throughout the country. The giant willow aphid is expected to have negative impacts on host trees, primarily willows (Salix spp.), as has been observed elsewhere. All willows are exotic to New Zealand and a few have formal weed status, however many species are valued for multiple purposes, including flood protection, land stabilization, shelterbelts, and as early season pollen and nectar resources for honey bees. Tuberolachnus salignus presents a unique problem for New Zealand's thriving honey and honey products industries. Bees readily forage on the vast quantities of honeydew secreted by the aphid, however the honeydew contains melezitose sugar. The low solubility of this sugar results in honey crystallizing in the comb, making it difficult to extract and thereby reducing yield. It is also considered to be poor food for bees, and has been linked to bee dysentery and low overwintering survival. We elaborate on the potential complications for New Zealand as a result of the arrival of this new species and present options for its control and management.",

Causes and consequences of cyclic LBM outbreaks are poorly understood and little is known about populations near the margin of the host's distribution range. In the present study, we quantify historical LBM outbreaks and associated growth reductions in host trees ( E uropean larch). Tree‐ring data collected from 18 sites between approximately 500 and 1700 m a.s.l. in the N orthern pre‐ A lps are compared with data from the W estern A lps and T atra M ountains, as well as with nonhost N orway spruce. Highly synchronized host and nonhost growth in the N orthern pre‐ A lps shows that periodic LBM outbreaks are largely absent near the distributional limit of larch. By contrast, growth patterns in the W estern A lps LBM core region are indicative of LBM events. Although climatic conditions in the N orthern pre‐ A lps and T atra M ountains would allow LBM outbreaks, low host plant abundance is likely the key driver for the absence of cyclic outbreaks in these regions. The results obtained in the present study suggest that, in addition to the climatic conditions, host‐species abundance is critically important for the occurrence of periodic LBM outbreaks and the determination of the respective outbreak range.",

Arthropods' were assessed using pitfall traps located inside the vineyards at three distances from adjacent vegetation (5, 50 and 100 m). Activity densities and diversity increased from spring to summer for all the studied trophic groups (omnivores, detritivores, predators, phytophages), thus showing them to be affected by season. The activity densities of phytophages were always higher at a distance of 5 m from the adjacent vegetation, which suggests that, although they could originate from these habitats, they do not move too far into the vineyard. Predators reported higher activity densities at 5 m during spring. Meanwhile, in summer, no significant differences were found with the increasing distance from the edge. This result suggests that these habitats could serve both as a refuge and a hibernation habitat, from which predators could colonize the vineyard.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The expansion of agricultural fields is the main cause of landscape simplification and changes in the composition and configuration of landscapes. These landscape changes influence pests and their natural enemies, and may influence their interaction and the biological control services to which they contribute. However, the effects of landscape composition can vary between region and insect species. The present study was conducted on cucumber plants in 16 different sites of varying landscape composition in Bogor and its surrounding area, West Java, Indonesia. Sampling of insects was performed on lepidopteran pests and their parasitoids. The results obtained showed that landscape composition (i.e. patch number of cropland) had a positive impact on the abundance of parasitoids and their host (lepidopteran pests). Yet the proportion of natural habitat did not influence parasitoid abundance and their host–parasitoid interaction. The presence of Apanteles taragamae (i.e. the most abundant parasitoid) in the agricultural landscape was affected by the abundance of its hyperparasitoid and its host ( Diaphania indica ) and not by landscape composition. The findings of the present study suggest that the higher proportion of patchy cropland in tropical agricultural landscapes, as well as agricultural practices, can maintain parasitoid abundance and functional diversity and, finally, an enhanced parasitism rate.",

In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed county‐level infestations of emerald ash borer in the state of Iowa, U.S.A., subsequent to the initial detection of EAB in 2010. Visual data analysis had suggested that new infestations were not in accordance with the expected patterns of establishment along roads, near campgrounds or by large population centres. We found a positive correlation between the establishment and detection of EAB in Iowa counties and the length of railroads in each county.

However, relatively poor information exists about the effects of landscape heterogeneity on lacewings, which are a major group of predators. Furthermore, temporal changes of landscape effects on natural enemy dynamics remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated how landscape composition and configuration affect lacewings and their biological control potential on leafhoppers. Lacewings and leafhoppers were sampled from April to July in 10 vineyards located in southwestern France. The vineyards were selected along a gradient of a proportion of semi‐natural habitats in the landscape. The proportion of semi‐natural habitats positively affected the abundance of adults and eggs, as well as species richness, of lacewings, alone or in interaction with the sampling month. Landscape configuration was never found to enhance abundance or species richness of lacewings. Finally, the predator–prey ratio increased through time but did not respond to landscape composition or configuration. Our study highlights that the proportion of semi‐natural habitats increases both abundance and diversity of lacewings in vineyard landscapes but that this effect varies over time. This result indicates the need to assess the variability of landscape effects over time to maximize biological pest control services in agricultural landscapes.",

The difference in ETSs was analysed with linear regression using daily temperature data from the 30 meteorological stations. Historical data regarding the location of I. typographus outbreaks were examined and changes in their distribution during the entire study period were analysed. There was a substantial increase in ETSs, especially in the latter half of the study period. Increased ETSs coincided with more favourable conditions for swarming of I. typographus . Areas with favourable ETSs for the complete development of bivoltine populations of I. typographus (&gt;1500 DD) shifted northwards on average 450 km during the entire study period. The northward shift of ETSs may enhance the transition from univoltine to bivoltine life cycles of I. typographus in the south and middle taiga and from bivoltine to trivoltine life cycles in conifer‐broadleaf forests.",

Thus, study aimed to detect insecticide resistance and determine the levels of resistance to commercial formulations of the insecticides chlorantraniliprole, chlorpyrifos and thiamethoxam in populations of L. coffeella from Arabica coffee fields in western and the highlands of the state Bahia (Brazil). Furthermore, as the expression of insecticide toxicity varies with the length of exposure and the compound concentration, what is frequently neglected, these two variables were considered while determining the levels of resistance in nine populations. Moderate levels of resistance were detected to chlorantranilprole in two populations, whereas the others exhibited low levels of resistance. All populations were resistant to thiamethoxam ranging from low to moderate levels. Low levels of resistance to chlorpyrifos were detected in all populations from western, but none from highlands region. The western presents a more concerning scenario of insecticide resistance the L. coffeella , but the phenomenon requires attention in both regions.",

To investigate the effect of temperature on oviposition, egg‐to‐adult development success and duration, as well as immature heat survival and adult cold survival for a German D. suzukii population several experiments were conducted under different constant temperatures in the laboratory. The resulting life cycle data were described mathematically as functions of temperature and compared with experimental results of other researchers in a summary table. Curve fittings used herein revealed that minimum, optimum and maximum temperatures are: 13.2, 26.7 and 33.6 °C for oviposition, 14.1, 22.6 and 30.0 °C for egg‐to‐adult development success, and 9.6, 27.3 and 35.7 °C for egg‐to‐adult development duration. Eggs and larvae of D. suzukii showed a reduced heat survival within the tested temperature range of 29 to 41 °C and exposure durations from 1 to 8 h. A cold survival rate of 50% was measured at e.g. −6 °C for 4 h in summer morph adults and at e.g. −6 °C for 45 h in winter morph adults confirming that the latter are more cold tolerant. Results obtained in this study for a German population of D. suzukii are similar to those obtained for populations of other origins such as Canada, Japan, Spain and USA. Thus, presumably, present data based on a German D. suzukii population can be used for a new or fine‐tune of already existing population dynamics models of D. suzukii in order to support an effective pest management strategy.",

To improve predictions of bark beetle phenology in a warmer climate, correct thermal sums representing the development time of the new generation are needed. A standardized method for classifying adults into five different colours was used for describing the seasonal change in colour of beetles in breeding substrate and in weekly trap catches from regions located in southern, central and northern Sweden in 2015–2020. Repeated sampling of I. typographus from breeding substrate demonstrated that the adults get gradually darker, from light brown when newly moulted to dark brown or black in the following summer. In spring, four to five colours co‐occurred among trapped beetles. Over time, the proportions of darker individuals increased until the two lightest colours were absent except for 2 cases out of 21 trapping locations/years. Thereafter, the individuals of the two lightest colours started to occur again, indicating that they belonged to the new generation. The average thermal sum from start of flight of parental generation in spring until onset of new‐generation flight in summer was higher for southern Sweden [lower developmental threshold (LDT) 5°C = 744 degree‐days (dd); LDT 8.3°C = 467 dd] than for northern Sweden (LDT 5°C = 668 dd; LDT 8.3°C = 418 dd).

In this study, we aimed to confirm the effectiveness of ant pollination by conducting ant‐exclusion experiments in the field. In addition, as evidence that ants can transfer pollen, we also counted the number of pollen grains attached to the body surface of two abundant flower‐visiting ant species, Formica japonica and Camponotus japonicus . Under the ant‐exclusion treatment, the buckwheat plants showed a significant reduction (30% on average) in seed set compared with control plants, and this effect was consistent across both flower morphs (pin and thrum) and two seasons (summer and autumn). Moreover, pollen grains of each flower morph were found on both ant species visiting both types of flower, suggesting a potential contribution to seed set in buckwheat. The results of this study suggest that ants may be an underappreciated pollinator of common buckwheat.",

EPNs occurrence was related to the time of beetle invasion at each sampling site and there was evidence of a density‐dependent response of the EPNs community to P. japonica density. The invasion of P. japonica apparently did not significantly affect the occurrence of native grubs, although a tendency to a decline was observed and should be further investigated.",

The species constitutes a serious pest for Ficus spp. and Morus spp. The aim of this work is to update the distribution area of the species in Italy, investigating its expansion over 16 years. Data were acquired through the authors' direct field records and community science, by data mining on national and international web platforms and social networks. Reports were analysed and GPS points plotted in ArcMap 10.8.1 to obtain distribution maps. Of the records collected, 34% were acquired during field surveys, 22% via e‐mail and 44% through on‐line forums and social networks. Adults of P. h. hilaris showed a long period of activity, from April to the beginning of December, with a peak of presence from June to September. The presence of the pest has been ascertained over six provinces in Lombardy covering an area estimated at more than 1750 km 2 in 2021. New detections occurred within 2 km of a known infestation from the previous year in 41.6% of cases, and between 2 and 4 km away in 37.7% of cases. The mean rate of range expansion estimated from reported records was 3.17 ± 0.33 km/year from 2010 to 2021. After an initial phase of settlement, the insect is now spreading southward. Given the relevant phytosanitary interest that the species may have for fig plants in Italy and in the Mediterranean Basin, it is fundamental to deepen the knowledge about its flight biology, dynamics and active dispersal capabilities in order to estimate the future range expansion.",

Farmers can choose among hundreds of commercially available red clover cultivars to plant, but the value of different cultivars for pollinators is not currently assessed or used as a recommendation criterion for farmers. Here, we compared the numbers of pollinators on 20 red clover accessions (12 cultivars and 8 breeding lines) grown under management typical for silage production in the UK in 2022 and 2023. Other potentially pollinator‐friendly traits (inflorescence density, florets per inflorescence, floret length and nectar sugar production) were also measured to help determine which would be desirable to integrate into red clover breeding programmes. Accessions varied greatly, 50‐fold, in numbers of pollinators attracted per plot and varied significantly in all other traits examined. Only inflorescence density was significantly positively related to insect abundance and species richness. These results suggest that breeding and using red clover cultivars that produce more inflorescences can increase the value of red clover to pollinators. We note that data on insect visitation can be gathered easily and could be provided to farmers to help improve the value of red clover fields to pollinators.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Infestations of ambrosia beetles in the tribe Xyleborini (Coleoptera: Scolytinae) are associated with economic losses to horticultural trees due to branch die‐back and tree death. Ethanol is a key attractant used for monitoring flight activity. Trapping experiments were conducted in woodlots in Ohio, USA, and Veneto, Italy, to characterize the effect of ethanol release rate on captures of Anisandrus maiche , Xyleborinus saxesenii , Xylosandrus crassiusculus and Xylosandrus germanus . In Ohio (2019, 2020 and 2021) and Italy (2021), traps were baited with centrifuge tubes that were modified to achieve ethanol release rates of 0.1–13.2 g/day. In Ohio (2022), traps were baited with varying quantities of manufactured lures to achieve release rates of 0.02–1.4 g/day. There was no consistent relationship between ethanol release rate and trap captures for the modified centrifuge tubes. In nine of sixteen analyses, traps baited with the centrifuge tubes releasing ethanol at 1.1 g/day or higher collected more A. maiche , X. saxesenii , X. crassiusculus and X. germanus than traps baited with centrifuge tubes releasing 0.1 g/day. In contrast, the manufactured lures releasing 0.1–1.4 g/day attracted more A. maiche , X. saxesenii , X. crassiusculus and X. germanus than lures releasing 0.02–0.05 g/day. This comprehensive study provides important insights into monitoring tactics for ambrosia beetles along with implications for optimizing ethanol‐baited traps as part of a ‘push‐pull’ strategy whereby repellents are used to ‘push’ beetles away from vulnerable trees and attractants are used to ‘pull’ them into annihilative traps.",

Encouraging biological control may help to reduce molluscicide use, but the efficiency of potential natural enemies needs to be investigated. 2 Serological tests have shown that certain carabid species consume slugs. These techniques, however, do not distinguish between scavenging and true predation, nor do they provide information on the size or other characteristics of the prey consumed. The study reported here was undertaken to establish whether scavenging of dead slugs might be an important factor contributing to positive serological test results. 3 Both Pterostichus madidus (Fabricius) and Nebria brevicollis (Fabricius) consumed Deroceras reticulatum (Müller) under laboratory conditions. Dead slugs were scavenged in preference to injured or healthy slugs. 4 Only small, live slugs (&lt; 0.11 g) were killed by both beetle species, which may, therefore, be incapable of killing larger slugs. 5 These generalist beetle species appeared unable to overcome the defence mucus produced by slugs. The data suggest that positive serological results from field collected beetles may reflect scavenging rather than predation on live or injured slugs.",

The feeding was then correlated to light interception, soil temperature and distance to the nearest forest edge. 2 Feeding was at least twice as intense on seedlings in the central part of the clear‐cutting compared to those at the edges. The decline began approximatety 15 m from the edge and was of similar proportions on both the sun‐exposed and shaded sides. 3 Measures of global radiation and soil temperature correlated well with consumption on the shaded side. However, on the sun‐exposed side, there were no apparent correlations with global radiation or soil temperature that could explain the decline in consumed bark area. 4 We conclude that the decline in feeding towards the forest edges was mainly due to factors other than the microclimate variables we monitored. We suggest that the presence of roots of living trees along the forest edge may reduce damage to seedlings, since they provide an alternative source of food for the weevils. This alternative‐food hypothesis may also explain why seedlings in shelterwoods usually suffer less damage from pine weevils than seedlings in clear‐cuttings.",

Based on field observations, the moth is thought to be leaf‐type specific for juvenile as opposed to adult eucalypt foliage. Laboratory binary choice assays of the oviposition preference of host novice M. privata confirmed that eggs were more likely to be laid upon juvenile rather than adult foliage of Eucalyptus dunnii and two subspecies of E. globulus . This oviposition preference was not influenced by differences in leaf size or adherence to leaves by ovipositing moths. The high specific leaf weights common to adult leaves were associated with reduced oviposition. Although neonates fed on both juvenile and adult leaves of most of the trees studied, performance was greater on juvenile as opposed to adult foliage. Juvenile leaves typically had lower specific leaf weights and were nutritionally superior to their adult counterparts. Specific leaf weights above 0.236 mg/mm 2 (associated with low water, i.e. = 56.5%, and nitrogen, i.e. = 1.23%, contents) were associated with reduced larval performance. Younger adult leaves, those with lower specific leaf weights, allowed slightly greater larval consumption. When ovipositing, this eucalypt‐specific moth discriminates between leaf types of its heterophyllous hosts in favour of types with the lowest specific leaf weight. Less tough leaf types, which are also higher in nitrogen, enable neonates to attain larger body weights.",

Chrysophtharta bimaculata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) is a primary pest of Tasmanian eucalypt forests and can cause severe defoliation. Previous work suggests that females show discrimination when selecting oviposition sites. Our aim was to test the degree of oviposition discrimination exhibited by C. bimaculata with regards to leaf toughness, a character that is critical to neonate survival. 2 We conducted an experiment examining the leaf toughness critical for neonate survival and found that significant larval mortality occurs above a toughness of 46.9 g. We also determined that the maximum toughness of leaves upon which larvae established in the field was 48.2 g, supporting the laboratory result. 3 Field surveys showed that although the majority of eggs were laid on leaves suitable for larval establishment, many eggs were laid on unsuitable, tougher leaves. However, all eggs were normally placed within 20 cm of suitable leaves and glasshouse trials demonstrated the neonates could move this distance without mortality occurring. 4 We conclude that egg batch distribution and larval performance of C. bimaculata will influence the population dynamics of C. bimaculata in two ways. Firstly, the availability of expanding/newly expanding leaves of eucalypt hosts will determine larval carrying capacity. Secondly, at a more localized level, the deposition of large numbers of egg batches on both suitable and unsuitable leaves followed by successful neonate migration increases the risk of resource depletion and poor larval development.",

Laboratory‐reared females previously mated with either laboratory‐reared normal males or laboratory‐reared irradiated (sterile) males showed little interest in remating with males and instead, were much more likely to be found arrested on artificial and real fruit and ovipositing. Oviposition on artificial fruit was five times greater by females that had mated with either normal or irradiated males than by virgin females. Wild females showed similar qualitative changes in the mating‐induced behavioural switch; however, oviposition activity was significantly less than for laboratory‐reared females. 3 These results confirm that mating has a profound effect on the behaviour of female Mediterranean fruit flies and that irradiated males are functionally equal with normal males (lab‐reared or wild) in their ability to alter female behaviour. These results are discussed in the context of the sterile insect technique for control of Mediterranean fruit flies in the field.",

However, after the same time, survival on genotypes of Eucalyptus melliodora and Eucalyptus sideroxylon was less than 60%, or even 0%, even though the toughness of some leaves was as low as 0.11 mg/mm 2 . An unmeasured allelochemical, rather than toughness, may reduce survival on these species. 3 Dry weights of first‐instar larvae were negatively correlated with leaf toughness for 13 of the species studied.

Neonates skeletonize leaves (avoid leaf veins and oil glands) and post‐third‐instar larvae ingest whole leaf fragments (consume small leaf veins and oil glands). These findings suggest that neonates are sensitive to high leaf toughness and non‐oil plant secondary metabolites whereas older larvae are less sensitive to high leaf toughness and are likely to become larger adults on hosts with lower oil contents.",

We also examined how environmental parameters (wind) and human activities (felling) could influence the beetles' flight. 3 The recapture percentage was higher in experiment 1 than in experiment 2: respectively, 7.0% (with 64 traps) and 2.3% (with 100 traps) of the beetles that took off were caught in the traps. 4 With the higher release rate (experiment 1), trap catches decreased with increased distance, whereas with the lower release rate (experiment 2), trap catches rose between 50 and 100 m then decreased with increasing distance. 5 Flight was little orientated by prevailing wind directions, a feature probably explained by the low wind speeds (0–1.2 m/s) observed throughout the study. 6 High trap catches of unmarked beetles close to areas undergoing thinning activities suggest that the presence of freshly cut spruce and larch material could have an influence on dispersal, attracting the beetles into the felling area.

The successful reproduction on very distantly related plant taxa suggests that the original weevil‐ and plant‐habitat has mediated the current host‐plant range of the vine weevil. 3 Contact‐preference tests with equally suitable hosts, such as Aronia , Fragaria , Euonymus and Taxus , and one less suitable host, Humulus , indicate a mismatch between contact preference and performance and, as far as olfactory preferences are known, these match neither the contact preferences nor the performance. This mismatch may arise because (i) host plant species offered do not occur in weevil habitat in Europe (e.g. Aronia and the cultivated Fragaria come from North America) and (ii) predation (or disease) risks differ among host plants, thereby altering effective reproductive performance. 4 With respect to performance on novel hosts ( Thuja , Prunus ) and bad hosts ( Rhododendron ), some between‐individual variation is found within a single population, suggesting that local populations harbour (possibly genetic) variation for adaptation to new hosts. How this variation is maintained in the face of strong selection pressures on local populations of flightless and thelytokous weevils, is an important question for understanding the broad host plant range in the vine weevil.",

The food source consisted of a stem section of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. extending both above and below ground. 3 The majority of feeding on the half buried stem sections occurred below ground; only 2.7% of the total bark area consumed was situated above ground. The variation over time in bark area consumed was not significantly associated with any of the tested weather factors. 4 The amount of feeding was 10‐fold higher on food sources placed in fine‐grained humus than those in areas of flat sand. 5 Less pine bark was consumed on mounds of sand than flat sand surfaces, and there was more feeding in sandy pits than on flat sand. These effects on feeding are explained by the observation that the weevils had difficulties climbing the sandy slopes (27° gradient). 6 We conclude that pine weevil damage to conifer seedlings can be considerably reduced by planting on mounds of pure mineral soil and that planting deeply in the soil increases the risk of damage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 One proposed approach to improving biological control of bark beetles (Coleoptera: Scolytidae; alt. Curculionidae: Scolytinae) is to manipulate predator movement using semiochemicals. However, selective manipulation is impeded by attraction of both predators and pests to bark beetle pheromones. 2 The primary bark beetle affecting pine plantations in Wisconsin, U.S.A., is the pine engraver, Ips pini (Say). Other herbivores include Ips grandicollis (Eichhoff) and Dryophthorus americanus Bedel (Curculionidae). The predominant predators are the beetles Thanasimus dubius (Cleridae) and Platysoma cylindrica (Histeridae). 3 We conducted field assays using two enantiomeric ratios of ipsdienol, and frontalin plus α‐pinene. Ipsdienol is the principal pheromone component of I. pini , and frontalin is produced by a number of Dendroctonus species. α‐Pinene is a host monoterpene commonly incorporated into commercial frontalin lures. 4 Thanasimus dubius was attracted to frontalin plus α‐pinene, and also to racemic ipsdienol. By contrast, I. pini was attracted to racemic ipsdienol, but showed no attraction to frontalin plus α‐pinene. Platysoma cylindrica was attracted to 97%‐(–)‐ipsdienol and, to a lesser extent, racemic ipsdienol, but not to frontalin plus α‐pinene. Ips grandicollis was attracted to frontalin plus α‐pinene but not to ipsdienol. Dryophthorus americanus was attracted to both ipsdienol and frontalin plus α‐pinene. 5 This ability to selectively attract the predator T. dubius without attracting the principal bark beetle in the system, I. pini , provides new opportunities for research into augmentative biological control and basic population dynamics. Moreover, the attraction of T. dubius , but not P. cylindrica , to frontalin plus α‐pinene creates opportunities for selective manipulation of just one predator. 6 Patterns of attraction by predators and bark beetles to these compounds appear to reflect various degrees of geographical and host tree overlap with several pheromone‐producing species.",

Catch of overwintered‐generation M. aeneus was negatively correlated with trap wind volume, indicating that flight was upwind.

Half of the trees in each group were sprayed with the insecticide permethrin [cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, 3‐(2,2‐dichloroethenyl)‐2,2‐dimethyl‐(3‐phenoxyphenyl) methyl ester] to prevent ambrosia and bark beetle attacks, and then were sprayed twice per year thereafter. After each treatment, sticky traps were placed on only the permethrin‐treated trees. Beetles were collected periodically in 2003. 3 Inoculated trees accounted for 95% of all beetles trapped. The ambrosia beetles Monarthrum scutellare and Xyleborinus saxeseni and the western oak bark beetle Pseudopityophthorus pubipennis were the most abundant of the seven species trapped. 4 Permethrin treatment delayed initiation of beetle attacks and significantly reduced the mean number of attacks per tree. Beetles did not attack any wounded or noncankered inoculated trees. 5 Trees with larger cankers trapped more beetles early in the disease. Once permethrin lost effectiveness, the number of beetle entrance tunnels was a more reliable predictor of subsequent trap catch than was canker size. 6 Beetles were initially attracted to P. ramorum cankers in response to kairomones generated in the host‐pathogen interaction. After beetles attacked the permethrin‐treated trees, aggregation pheromones most probably were the principal factor in beetle colonization behaviour.",

However, data on geographical distribution, thermal niche breadth and foraging strategy suggest that S. carpocapsae may be a poor choice for this application. 2 We undertook laboratory and field experiments that compared S. carpocapsae with Steinernema kraussei for efficacy towards H. abietis. Steinernema kraussei is indigenous to Northern Britain, active at low temperatures and is thought to adopt a ‘cruise’ foraging strategy particularly suitable for finding subterranean sedentary insects such as H. abietis. Conversely, S. carpocapsae has not been recorded in Northern Britain, prefers warmer temperatures and is thought to remain at the soil surface adopting an ambush foraging strategy. 3 There were no differences in the ability of the two nematodes to infect and kill larvae of H. abietis in laboratory experiments and, in two field experiments, both species were equally effective both in terms of parasitizing larvae within the stumps and reducing emergence of adult H. abietis. In one experiment, we monitored persistence of nematodes for 1 year after application and found S. kraussei persistence was much greater than that of S. carpocapsae. 4 The greater persistence of S. kraussei suggests that this nematode is better adapted to conditions in Northern Britain, but this may potentially represent a greater threat to nontarget insects. 5 Our data suggest that there would be little benefit associated with substituting S. kraussei for S. carpocapsae in integrated pest management systems for H. abietis.",

Ants appear to be the most abundant potential predators in the Ozarks and have been shown to play a role in regulating populations of other forest insects. 3 The main objective of the present study was to determine whether ants are predators of early E. rufulus life stages by direct observation of E. rufulus eggs artificially placed on tree trunks and by development of molecular tools to detect E. rufulus DNA within ant gut contents. 4 Three hundred and eighty E. rufulus eggs were applied to ten northern red oaks. Ants ate or carried away 72% of the eggs within 1 h. Camponotus pennsylvanicus (De Geer) and Aphaenogaster tennesseensis (Mayr) were identified as the two primary ant species observed in the study. 5 A portion of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene of E. rufulus was sequenced and polymerase chain reaction primers were developed to detect E. rufulus DNA in the guts of C. pennsylvanicus . Enaphalodes rufulus DNA persisted in ant gut contents for at least 24 h after ingestion under laboratory conditions, and E. rufulus DNA was detected in field‐collected ant populations, suggesting the natural occurrence of ant predation on this insect.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 In tropical dry seasons, survival of small arthropods such as predatory mites is often negatively affected by low relative humidity (RH). For species that do not diapause or migrate to refuges, the ability of the habitat to mitigate climatic conditions becomes crucial. 2 The relative effect of macro‐habitat (dry grassland hill, humid multiple cropping area, humid riparian forest) and microhabitat (host‐plant genotypes with hairy, semi‐hairy and glabrous apices) on the seasonal dynamics of the phytoseiid mite Typhlodromalus aripo , a predator of Mononychellus tanajoa on cassava, was examined in a field experiment during a dry season. The effect of RH and plant genotype on T. aripo egg survival was determined in an environment control chamber. 3 Predator abundance was higher in humid multiple cropping areas and on hairy cassava compared with the other habitat types and cassava genotypes. 4 Discriminant and regression analyses showed that the predator’s dry season persistence was related to high RH, high plant vigour and hairy apices, but not to prey abundance. 5 In the controlled climate experiment, the effect of host‐plant morphology was evident only at the intermediate RH level of 55%. An effect of apex hairiness was not found. 6 It is concluded that the effect of genotype on T. aripo persistence diminishes under low RH conditions, and that supportive effects of apex hairs become effective only in the field, probably through protection from wind and/or intraguild predation. Humid multiple cropping areas planted with hairy and vigorous cassava genotypes are suitable dry season reservoirs for T. aripo .",

Field trials were carried out under different growing conditions in Ireland and Norway to evaluate the efficacy of two commercially available nematode species on the market for control of the black vine weevil Heterorhabditis megidis and Steinernema kraussei. Heterorhabditis megidis was evaluated not only at temperatures ideal for this species (soil temperatures above 10 °C), but also in the low temperature trials with S. kraussei as a ‘positive control’. Steinernema kraussei is sold as a cold active product and was therefore evaluated at low soil temperatures (below 10 °C). The overall results indicated that H. megidis was effective as long as temperatures were optimum (not dropping below 10 °C). For S. kraussei , the results obtained were rather disappointing, where control barely reached 50% in the trial with the coldest temperature. Temperature and soil type appeared to be a major limiting factor for the efficacy of both nematode species. On the basis of the results and experience obtained in these trials, the future implications for biological control of O. sulcatus with entomopathogenic nematodes in commercial field‐grown strawberry production are discussed.",

During a period of 2 years, we assessed the efficacy of a pheromone mass‐trapping control strategy of C. sordidus in field conditions in Guadeloupe at different cropping stages, both in sanitation fallows and in different ratoon banana crops. In the fallows, catches peaked 3 months after beginning trapping and then decreased to zero after 9 months. By contrast, for the new plantations, the catches of C. sordidus increased after the 11th month and, in the older banana fields, there was no decrease in C. sordidus catches. The C. sordidus catches increased in the neighbouring banana plots, whereas they decreased in the fallows, and these catches decreased with the distance from fallow. In conclusion, mass trapping with synergized pheromone traps within fallows should allow better sanitation of banana plantations. Yet, within the farms, fallows must not be located next to new plantations to avoid massive damage to the young plants. More generally, the present study emphasizes that the control of this insect should be managed at the farm scale and not at the field scale, with special attention being paid to the location of fallows.",

However, ants can also increase hemipteran densities while reducing natural enemy numbers. In vineyard ecosystem, the effects of native ants and their interactions with other arthropods are poorly understood. An ant‐exclusion experiment was designed to test the impact of native ants on both canopy and ground arthropods concurrently. The potential influence of ants on predation and parasitism of light brown apple moth (LBAM) eggs, a grape pest, was also examined. Adult grapevine scale insects and earwigs under bark were counted after a season of ant‐exclusion. Among 23 ground ant species collected, six were found to forage in the canopy, with two Iridomyrmex species being the most commonly encountered. There was no difference in the abundance of most arthropod orders and feeding groups between ant‐excluded and control vines, although ground spiders were more abundant under ant‐excluded vines, despite increased ground ant foraging pressure. LBAM egg parasitism and predation were low and probably affected by weather and other arthropods. Ant exclusion did not reduce survival of scale insects, although the distribution and abundance of scale insects were negatively associated with earwigs. In conclusion, native ants did not consistently suppress arthropod assemblages, including natural enemies, and they did not promote the survival of scale insects. Interactions among native ant species within a vineyard might minimize their effects on other arthropods, although this needs further study.",

We conducted field experiments and questionnaire‐based surveys aiming to assess the effect of sown‐seed predation on four crop species ( Cucumis sativus , Daucus carota , Capsicum frutescens and Solanum melongena ) in 15 vegetable gardens and the resulting impact on the net income of Indonesian farmers. Furthermore, we tested a commonly applied insecticide and herbicide for seed, seedling and plant protection aiming to understand their effect on ant seed predation. We found that the mean percentage of seeds removed per garden was 42.0%, 49.4%, 48.0% and 50.6% for C. sativus , D. carota , C. frutescens and S. melongena , respectively, halving the farmers' income after considering initial and operational costs. Insecticide and herbicide treatments did not affect seed predation success or overall ant abundance, although they had positive and negative effects on ant species‐specific abundance. High overall ant abundance caused high seed predation rate in all gardens as a result of a functional redundancy of ant species, which compensated for pesticide‐related species loss. Environmentally‐friendly and more sustainable practices such as overseeding or seedling production in nurseries could substitute for these inefficient approaches of chemical pest control, although this requires further research.",

    "abstract": "The influence of trapping site (i.e. fresh clear‐cuts) characteristics and habitat amount (i.e. area of stands that may hold breeding material) in the surrounding landscape on catches of the bark beetles Ips typographus (L.) and Pityogenes chalcographus (L.) in pheromone‐baited flight‐barrier monitoring traps was studied. For the two species, the study investigated: (i) the extent of the variation in catches among trapping sites; (ii) the extent of this variation that can be explained by models including trapping site characteristics (clear‐cut size, percentage of spruce in the cut stand, altitude) and habitat amounts in the surrounding landscape; and (iii) the spatial scale at which beetles respond to the habitat amount in the landscape. The variation in catches among trap sites was 15‐fold larger for I. typographus than for P. chalcographus . There was a positive relationship between the catches of I. typographus and (i) the percentage of the surrounding landscape covered by mature spruce forest at radii 500–4000 m and (ii) the percentage of spruce in stands cut when the clear‐cuts used as trapping sites were created. For P. chalcographus , only the second relationship could be demonstrated. Thus, for monitoring of I. typographus : (i) several trapping sites per landscape are required; (ii) the amount of mature spruce forest around trapping sites needs to be considered when choosing trapping sites; and (iii) the trapping sites need to be standardized with respect to the percentage of spruce in the cut stand when fresh clear‐cuts are used. For P. chalcographus , fewer trapping sites per landscape are required and only the percentage of spruce in the cut stand needs to be considered.",

However, there is little information available on the spatial and temporal aspects of plant-pollinator mutualist diversity relative to farm management. Information on these aspects will provide a better understanding of agri-environment schemes in a conservation context. In the present study, we use additive partitioning (sum of within and among community diversity) to determine local (alpha) diversity and spatial and temporal (beta) diversity of bees and flowering plants in differently managed vineyards and adjacent natural vegetation in the Cape Floristic Region biodiversity hotspot. Alpha, spatial beta and temporal beta diversities accounted for 18–61%, 19–72% and 7–36% of total bee diversity, respectively. Local diversity and spatial turnover of flowering plant diversity were significantly higher in the natural vegetation compared with organic and conventional vineyards. Spatial turnover of bees varied significantly with longitudinal coordinates of study sites. We show that wildlife-friendly management practices ensure species-rich plant communities that promote pollinator diversity. We demonstrate the necessity to conserve mosaics of natural and semi-natural habitats in agricultural landscapes to conserve plant and bees. Our findings demonstrate the need to include spatial factors of habitats for effective conservation in this region.",

Horizontal distributions of L. nigrinus within the forest surrounding central release areas were observed in two separate studies, which included (i) release and monitor to capture parent and F 1 movement by sampling the immature life stages of the offspring, and (ii) assessment of F 3 to F 6 generations where beetles were previously determined to be established. Laricobius nigrinus , released on lower crown branches, oviposited within the upper crown stratum and were slow to disperse from release trees. Monitoring L. nigrinus only from the lower crown would likely underestimate its presence because 86% of the F 2 generation were detected above 15 m. By the fifth generation, the frequency distributions of larvae increased at increasing distance from release areas; larvae were recovered at a maximum distance of approximately 400 m and the spread rate was approximately 39 m/year. Slow dispersal of L. nigrinus and uninterrupted recovery of six generations in the presence of fluctuating prey density support its continued release as part of the A. tsugae biological control programme. These data contribute toward improved release strategies and monitoring for this biological control agent.",

Two types of traps (Delta and funnel; Oecos, U.K.) containing one of three different commercially available pheromone lures for OPM were placed out in the lower (3–5 m), mid (5–10 m) and upper (10–15 m) canopy of 72 individual oak trees in Richmond Park, in London, U.K. The traps were placed out for 8 weeks covering the main flight period of OPM , and significantly more male moths were captured in traps positioned in the upper canopy (76.6%) compared with either mid‐canopy (18.6%) or lower canopy (4.8%) positions. Funnel traps caught significantly more male OPM than Delta traps, catching almost six times as many moths over the trapping period. Traps containing one of the commercially available pheromone lures did not catch any moths, whereas traps with the other two lures caught similar numbers of moths. Chemical analysis revealed considerable differences between the three pheromone lures used in the trial in terms of the initial starting concentration of the primary component ( Z , Z )‐11,13‐hexadecadienyl acetate and its dissipation over a 28‐day period. The results obtained in the present study indicate some of the main factors that need to be taken into account when using pheromone traps to monitor OPM populations and also contribute to the establishment of a standardized monitoring system for this recently established insect pest.",

They play an important role in tree decomposition, often reducing the value of salvageable timber, and represent an important avian food source. 2 Three forest areas that experienced wildfires 1–3 years previously were surveyed during the summer of 2004. Ponderosa pine trees with green, scorched and consumed needles were examined for wood borer occurrence. Within each of the three needle damage categories, the mean wood borer incidence was similar between different age fires. Trees with scorched or consumed needles had significantly more wood borers than trees with green needles. 3 Larvae collected from under tree bark were identified to family; when possible, cerambycids were identified further to Acanthocinus spp., Monochamus sp., Rhagium inquisitor (L.) and Stictoleptura canadensis (LeConte), and buprestids were identified to Chalcophora spp. and Chrysobothris sp. 4 Classification tree models showed that the estimated probability of tree infestation by wood borers varied among needle damage categories. For trees with green needles, tree injury variables of high bole char height and phloem discolouration were important predictive variables. In trees where needles were consumed, tree size variables of diameter at breast height and tree height were important predictive variables. 5 More than half the dead trees examined were infested with wood borers, indicating that infestation of fire-killed ponderosa pine may represent an important food source for species such as woodpeckers and a potential problem for the utilization of infested trees.",

Weaver ants (Oecophylla spp.) may control pests in this crop as they eat and deter pests. In Benin, cashew pest damages, nut quality and yield were compared among: (i) trees with weaver ant (Oecophylla longinoda Latreille), (ii) trees where weaver ants were fed sugar, (iii) IPM trees with weaver ants combined with GF-120 (a natural insecticide), and (iv) control trees receiving no control measures. RESULTS: Thrips damages on nuts were higher than other damage symptoms and significantly lower on control trees compared to other treatments. Percentage of first quality nuts was higher in the control compared to ants treatments, but not different from the IPM-treatment. However, compared to the control treatment, ants, ant fed sugar and the IPM-treatment produced 50, 80 and 115% higher nut yields, respectively. Application of GF-120 did not affect ant densities. CONCLUSION: Weaver ants are efficient biocontrol agents in Benin cashew, but do not provide protection against thrips. Thrips, however, are controlled by GF-120 which can be combined with ant biocontrol and in this way increase yields.",

To examine the role of weather in its eradication, a physiologically‐based demographic model was developed and used to characterize its range of year‐round persistence. Published data on developmental times, fecundity and mortality rates on temperature were used to parameterize the model. The lower and upper thermal thresholds for development are 14.5 and 43.5 °C, and the optimal temperature for survival is 27.2 °C. An index of favourability based on annual rainfall was used as an approximate estimate of the limiting effects of moisture in arid areas. The open source geographical information system software grass was used to map the simulation results, as well as county level myiasis incidence data for Texas for the 1962–1983 SIT eradication programme. Winter temperature and rainfall are shown to have a strong influence on screwworm outbreaks and in facilitating eradication in North America and Libya. Prospective analysis for the Mediterranean Basin suggests that eastern areas are most favourable for screwworm establishment (e.g. the Nile River area of Egypt). The SIT eradication programme and its possible extension into South America are discussed. Expected +2 °C climate warming is predicted to increase the potential year‐round range of screwworm in the southeast U.S.A .",

Resistance of its coevolved hosts, including M anchurian ash ( Fraxinus mandshurica R upr.), is considered to limit EAB outbreaks and ash mortality in its native A sia, although an understanding of resistance mechanisms is still developing. Such knowledge may facilitate breeding for resistance and management of EAB in its invaded ranges. In the present study, controlled egg inoculations were used to investigate resistance mechanisms impacting larval performance, as well as to characterize the effects of water and nutrient availability on inter‐ and intra‐specific variation in resistance phenotypes based on larval outcomes. Larval survival and growth rates were lower on coevolved M anchurian ash than on evolutionarily naïve white ash ( Fraxinus americana L .). Water stress decreased tree growth and resistance of M anchurian ash to EAB , although it had little effect on resistance of the already highly susceptible white ash. High nutrient availability increased tree growth but had no effect on larval performance. These results show that the higher resistance of M anchurian ash to EAB is conferred by phloem traits that decrease larval performance, in addition to lower oviposition preference.",

We also measured marketable fruit yields on netted (preventing access to vertebrates) and open branches on each focal tree. We focused on relationships with local (ground cover attributes) and landscape (proximity to natural woodland) factors. Importantly, we found that local flower richness in orchard understoreys may buffer the negative effects that isolation from natural woodland has on wild bee and natural enemy communities and the ecosystem services they provide. The results of the present study suggest that floral diversity may be more effective in supporting beneficial insects in crop interiors, rather than at edges near natural vegetation.

Beetle interactions with tree species originating outside the natural range of the beetle are largely unknown and may be unpredictable because trees without a co‐evolutionary history with the beetle may lack effective defences. The terpenoid composition and breeding suitability for I. typographus of the historic host Norway spruce Picea abies were compared with two evolutionary naïve spruces of North American origin that are extensively planted in North‐West Europe: Sitka spruce Picea sitchensis and Lutz spruce Picea glauca x lutzii . The bark of all three species had a similar chemical composition and similar levels of total constitutive terpenoids, although Norway spruce had higher total induced terpenoid levels. Beetles tunnelling in the three spruce species produced similar amounts of aggregation pheromone. Controlled breeding experiments showed that I. typographus could produce offspring in all three species, with a similar offspring length and weight across species. However, total offspring production was much lower in Sitka and Lutz spruce. Overall, the results of the present study suggest that I. typographus will be able to colonize Sitka and Lutz spruce in European plantations and in native spruce forests in North America if introduced there.",

The form, intensity and scale of spatial patterning can be used to test hypotheses regarding the relative importance of candidate processes to population dynamics. Using 84 plots across eastern North America, we studied populations of two associated plant parasites, the invasive felted beech scale Cryptococcus fagisuga Lind. and the native Neonectria fungi, which together cause beech bark disease (BBD). We evaluated spatial patterns at the scales of trees within stands, stands within the forest and forests within the landscape to examine four hypothetically important factors in the ecology of the disease: (i) local contagion within stands; (ii) regional contagion, or among patch infection–reinfection dynamics; (iii) variation in host susceptibility linked to genetic and/or environmental heterogeneity; and (iv) climate effects on population growth of BBD organisms. Analyses revealed an unexpected lack of spatial aggregation in BBD populations among trees, stands and forests. This implies that propagule pressure is generally sufficiently high throughout the infested region of North America such that neither trees nor stands are spared from the disease by dispersal limitations of the disease agents. Furthermore, variation in tree and stand level susceptibility has minimal impact on BBD dynamics and climate is not a conspicuous driver of abundance within the core range of BBD.",

Tree ring analysis of infested stems and branches showed that the first A . glabripennis adult emerged in 2003 and that the beetle had been present for approximately 10 years before it was discovered. However, the population had increased relatively slowly and, even though it could be shown that some beetles travelled 96–203 m to lay eggs in new trees, the population as a whole had not spread further than 234 m. Survival rates of larvae were similar to rates observed in other A . glabripennis populations, although failure at the egg‐laying stage and adult mortality at or before emergence were higher than recorded elsewhere. A combination of factors appears to have allowed A . glabripennis to establish at P addock W ood: the presence of a highly susceptible host (sycamore), multiple introductions of adult beetles over several years, and a run of warmer than average summers at the time of the initial colonization.",

The pine processionary moth pupates buried in the soil and can spend up to 9 years in an extra-long diapause. We considered the impact that different habitats, as well as the manipulation of soil water conditions in the preferred habitat (i.e. in bare ground with null or sparse herbaceous vegetation), can exert on pupation. Less than half of the buried larvae successfully pupated, even in the most favourable habitats and soil water conditions, whereas, on average, 2.5% underwent extra-long pupae diapause (2 years after pupation). Although habitat influenced mainly pupation success and pupal survival, changing moisture conditions in the preferred habitat affected primarily the phenology of emergence, whereas pupal survival remained unaffected. The results of the present study reveal the importance of both habitat and soil moisture on the pupal stage, providing valuable information with respect to adequately forecasting the effects of changes in climate or land use on the population dynamic of this important forest pest.",

We predict that both species richness and functional diversity decrease with an increasing intensification of olive grove soil management. We used pitfall traps to sample ants in 24 olive groves subject to different soil management regimes in southern Spain, and then compared ant species richness and functional diversity (FD). Nonploughed organic farms showed higher species richness. Ploughing was observed to be the soil management practice with the greatest negative effect on ant species richness. Three functional traits significantly responded to soil management intensity, with tibia length and head width showing a higher FD in organic farms and diet showing a lower FD in ploughed farms. The results of the present study highlight the negative effects of olive grove ploughing on ant biodiversity and provide novel evidence of the nonploughing organic farming role with respect to maintaining higher levels of ant functional diversity.",

These pests are currently monitored with lures containing quercivorol; α‐copaene was also recently discovered to be an effective attractant. We investigated dispersal behaviour of female E . nr . fornicatus in two Florida avocado groves using mark–release–recapture experiments and laboratory flight mills. Additionally, we estimated the sampling range of quercivorol and α‐copaene lures deployed alone and in tandem. The two‐component lure recaptured 31.2% of marked beetles, which was significantly more than quercivorol (11.2%) or α‐copaene (8.8%) alone. Contour analysis indicated that wind speed and direction can influence the number of females that disperse, as well as the direction and distance of their flight. Two methods were used to estimate sampling range and both of them indicated comparable effective ranges for the three lure treatments, with 80% of marked beetles being recaptured within 30–35 m of the release point. Average total flight distance in laboratory tests was 81.0 m in 24 h, with a maximum distance recorded at 400 m. The combination of quercivorol and α‐copaene lures provides the best detection of pest E . nr. fornicatus in Florida, with a recommended trap spacing of approximately 30 m in surveillance programmes for this pest in avocado groves.",

Research on the role of spiders as natural enemies within agroecosystems needs to address the distribution of their communities across different spatial scales, as well as the dominant species. We studied the spatial distribution of the community of spiders of the olive agroecosystem in Northeastern Portugal and investigated potential species that could be used as bioindicators of agricultural management in the olive grove. We found nine functional groups (ambushers, foliage runner hunters, ground hunters, orb‐web builders, sheet web builders, sensing web‐builders, space web builders, stalkers and wandering sheet/tangle weavers) encompassing a community that changed significantly across the horizontal and vertical gradient. We propose Thanatus vulgaris Simon, 1870 as potential bioindicator for the ground of the olive grove central area and Ozyptila pauxilla (Simon, 1870) for the ground of the olive grove peripheral area. Adjacent shrubland areas could play an important role in biological control of pests, allowing the exchange of species and individuals with the olive crop. The role of agrobiont species as indicators of agricultural managements deserves further investigation towards the enhancement of the effectiveness of spiders within low‐impact crop management in arable landscapes.",

This aphid species is expected to respond to a predicted increase in the incidence of spring–summer drought events, with serious implications for growth of infested spruce plants and control of the pest. Growth rate, adult weight and nymph weight of E. abietinum were assessed under controlled laboratory conditions, using five levels of spring–summer drought of differing intensities and frequencies. Trials were time‐staggered to investigate changes through season. Growth rate, adult weight and nymph weight were consistently increased under low amplitude intermittent drought stress, suggesting improved host nutritional quality through the year and increased fecundity. A complex response under severe and low amplitude intermittent drought stress was also observed, mediated by season. Although an overall reduction in host quality was typically observed, continuous severe stress improved host quality during the autumn. Despite this, the onset of dormancy was unaffected. The findings of the present study have implications for E. abietinum population development, Sitka spruce growth and biological control of the species under climate change and increased drought frequency.",

The present study investigated spatial and temporal patterns in wild pollinator (fly, wasp and non-Apis bee) distribution across an edge between natural mallee woodland and monoculture almond plantations in southern Australia, during the critical almond flowering period. This is the first study of variation in pollinator community distribution on both sides of an edge between natural vegetation and flowering tree crop plantations. Species richness, diversity and evenness (SHE) analysis was also used to identify changes in pollinator community structure relative to the edge. It is shown that the spatial distribution and structure of pollinator communities can vary across a habitat edge with an abrupt temporal changes in resources. Our results suggest that the plantation edge did not prevent wild pollinators spilling over from woodlands, although vegetation homogeneity and phenological changes in resources most likely influenced the dispersal of pollinators into plantation interiors. The findings of the present study contribute to our knowledge of edge responses by insects in managed landscapes and could motivate growers to adopt ecological management practices in commercial plantations. Future studies of insects near farmland edges should include samples on both sides of the edge and should also consider the landscape context.",

We followed the temporal dynamics by combined light/pheromone trapping over a 10‐year period (2002–2011) in a 240‐ha olive farm in Northern Egypt. The ZP had an annual cycle with one or two peak flights, from late April until October. Time series analysis showed a 2‐year cycle of trap catch. This cycle is likely related to the ‘on/off’ bearing pattern of the olive, where years of high and low yield are observed to alternate. Larval damage in both ‘on’ and ‘off’ years in the infested trees gave fruit yield losses of 37–42%. The loss was estimated to 2.1–4.8 t/ha among susceptible varieties. The relative losses were the same during on and off years. Infestation of four susceptible and five resistant olive cultivars in different cropping systems varied within and between adjacent plots. The results suggest less infestation by intercropping of resistant varieties, which could assist in ZP management. Both temporal and spatial dynamics strongly influence population dynamics and the dynamics are related to variation in the moth host plant.",

Different longhorned beetle species have biological trait combinations (diet breadth, host tree condition and adult feeding) that predispose them to different degrees of potential invasiveness if introduced outside their native range. Relevant biological information is often not available for newly introduced species; however, the approach described in the present study could rapidly allow risk to be assigned to such discoveries. To test this approach, we used a molecular phylogeny for 56 species of C erambycidae from five subfamilies to measure phylogenetic signal associated with invasive traits. The biological traits were used to cluster species into seven hypothesized risk groups. Mapping these risk designations back onto the phylogeny allowed us to examine the risk within clades at different taxonomic levels and the stability of the risk designation. We used additional species known to be non‐native invasive problems to test our framework. Our method would have correctly predicted the risk of A noplophora glabripennis ( M otschulsky) but not C allidiellum rufipenne ( M otschulsky). There was significant phylogenetic signal in both the biological traits and the risk category membership. Our approach can be modified for other groups of concern.",

Populations from four latitudes in Sweden of the tree-killing bark beetle Ips typographus (L.) and its predator Thanasimus formicarius (L.)

The frequency of reproductive diapause among new generation I. typographus adults was negatively correlated with day length and positively correlated with latitude of population origin. The two northernmost populations included a considerable proportion of individuals that entered reproductive diapause even at the longest day lengths. By contrast, diapause entry in the predator T. formicarius was generally independent of photoperiod and geographical origin. In a warmer climate, two generations per year may be more common for I. typographus in Sweden. The predator is less likely to increase voltinism.",

At the farm scale, there are cropped and noncropped areas that differ in their management and plant diversity; these differences affect the spatiotemporal dynamics of natural enemies. We investigated how different habitat types can affect the conservation and spatial dynamics of predatory and herbivore insects in organic vegetable crops in Brazil. Insects were simultaneously sampled in two cropped (focal and neighbourhood crops) and two noncropped habitats (fallow and native forests) during five consecutive focal crop cycles. We found a higher species richness of predators and herbivores in noncropped habitats. All of the habitats shared species from both functional groups throughout the year, indicating that species could disperse among habitats. Fallow areas can serve as a source and sink for species migrating to/from cropped habitats where predators and herbivores can numerically increase their populations during the crop cycles. The spatiotemporal dynamics of herbivores and predators depend on the management and maintenance of natural, seminatural and cropped habitats within the farm.",

We tested two potential repellents to the redbay ambrosia beetle, verbenone and methyl salicylate (MeSA) in an 8‐month large‐scale experiment conducted in three locations in Florida. In each location, redbay trees were treated with a single or double application of SPLAT (Specialized Pheromone and Lure Application Technology; ISCA Technologies, Riverside, California) verbenone, as well as SPLAT with a 1:2 mix of MeSA and verbenone. The MeSA + verbenone mixes did not reduce beetle captures compared with the control treatment, whereas SPLAT verbenone alone significantly reduced the number of beetles captured on sticky traps placed on redbay trees in the three locations. The reduction of beetle capture was similar regardless of one or two treatments of SPLAT verbenone. The reduction of tree death with the SPLAT verbenone treatment was not statistically significant. The results of the present study suggest that trunk application of verbenone can reduce landing rates of the redbay ambrosia beetle on live redbay trees and shows promise for use in an integrated pest management strategy against laurel wilt.",

The insect is particularly associated with deciduous trees and may remain in woodlands throughout the year, feeding on species such as oak, beech, and hazel. Pentatoma rufipes is emerging as an important pest of tree fruit in northern Europe. In recent years, agronomists have been finding increasing numbers of P. rufipes in and around orchards. Feeding activity on developing fruits is being linked with pitting and distortion damage to crops including apples and pears. There has been limited research into the ecology of this pest. Crops are particularly susceptible shortly after flowering, when over‐wintered P. rufipes nymphs feed on developing fruit. Limited information is available linking local population levels and activity with damage. There has been some research on the impact of control strategies, but the most effective product tested was a broad‐spectrum pyrethroid insecticide. Assessments of more selective plant protection products and the availability of alternative control strategies would help develop more integrated and effective control programmes for this pest. This review highlights several key findings concerning the biology and control of the pest and makes specific recommendations for further research.",

To date, at least 16 of these species have been recorded as invasive eucalypt gall formers, of which less than half are known from Australia where they are thought to be native. About 80% of the species have become invasive only in the last two decades, &lt;10%, of which were known from Australia beforehand. Two species, Leptocybe invasa and Ophelimus maskelli are global invaders that have become established in 43 and 23 countries, respectively, since 2000. They belong to a large number of wasps that cause similar damage and that could become invasive in the future. The problem of identification is exacerbated by the fact that many species lack taxonomic descriptions; over 80% of the invasive eucalypt gall wasps were first described from their invasive range. The small number of taxonomists able to identify these insects slows accurate diagnoses. Even when initial identifications have been made, these may be confused with morphologically similar but distinct cryptic species, which may differ in their host range and natural enemy interactions. Furthermore, detailed information regarding their biology and native distribution is typically sparse or unknown. This lack of information delays the initiation of management actions because breeding for resistance and biological control requires accurate identification of the target pest. The gall‐forming hymenopterans associated with Eucalyptus represent an important group on which to focus the development of pre‐emptive quarantine, monitoring and potential management options. Given the global nature of invasions by these insects, an international and collaborative research approach is required, where knowledge and tools for study can be shared in a more effective manner.",

We hypothesize that orchard compositional heterogeneity (OCH), that is, different mass‐flowering crops with sequential blooming periods, may support pollinators through continuous abundance of floral resources. We assessed whether increased OCH at the landscape level had a positive effect on wild bee abundances in sweet cherry and apple orchards during bloom. We monitored 15 sweet cherry and 14 apple orchards in Flanders, Belgium, situated along a gradient of OCH. We performed pollinator surveys during bloom to measure wild bee and honey bee abundance and monitored fruit development to assess fruit set and quality. We found no positive effect of OCH on wild pollinator abundance in our study system. Solitary bees showed contrasting responses between crops. Bumble bees showed no response. Wild pollinator abundance had a positive effect on sweet cherry fruit set and apple seed set. Our results imply that increasing crop compositional heterogeneity solely in terms of orchard crops with a limited difference in bloom phenology may prove to be insufficient to support pollinators. We confirm the importance of wild pollinators for pollination services in horticulture.",

Using pheromone‐based technology, an average of 1775 female SSBs (potentially as many as 1.6 million offspring) were captured each year during 2–3 weeks in early spring. 2 Data for the first 2 years of a 3‐year project to use SSB for biological suppression of the Colorado potato beetle (CPB), Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), verified earlier research showing that augmentation of SSB (∼5 nymphs/plant) can significantly suppress CPB infestations. In the third year, wild SSBs were transferred directly from pheromone traps to mid‐plot nursery cages having a mesh size chosen to retain the adult predators but allow their offspring to escape. Pheromone dispensers were placed peripherally to promote dispersal of young predators and immigration of new wild spined soldier bug adults. Pheromone‐mediated augmentation using porous nursery cages and pheromone dispensers was less labour‐intensive than earlier methods, and resulted in significantly improved potato yield. 3 Trapping SSB adults early in the spring protects them from parasitization by tachinid flies and scelionid wasps that use the pheromone to facilitate host‐finding.

    "abstract": "Summary 1 Attack by shoot borers ( Hypsipyla grandella Zeller) is the main factor limiting the cultivation of Cedrela odorata and Swietenia macrophylla, two economically important members of the mahogany family. No viable methods of pest control are currently available. To assess for genetic variation in susceptibility to pest attack, a combined progeny/provenance test of C. odorata and a provenance test of S. macrophylla were established separately at CATIE, Turrialba, Costa Rica, and assessed intensively over an 84‐week period. 2 Variation in height growth between provenances was highly significant in both species, provenance means varying by a factor of 2.7 and 1.2 in C. odorata and S. macrophylla , respectively. Cedrela odorata also displayed provenance variation in foliar phenology, as 94.7% of the trees from a ‘wet zone’ provenance remained foliated, whereas &gt; 35% of trees from three ‘dry zone’ provenances abscised their leaves during the dry season. 3 Both species displayed significant genetic variation in susceptibility to shoot borer attack. At the peak of attack during the second year of growth, the effect of provenance was highly significant in both species, the mean number of attacks per tree varying between 0.8–2.4 and 0.6–1.3 in different provenances of C. odorata and S. macrophylla , respectively. A provenance of C. odorata from San Carlos, Costa Rica, displayed consistently lower susceptibility to pest attack, being subjected to fewer attacks during the first year and demonstrating a higher mean height to first point of damage. 4 The nitrogen, total tannin and proanthocyanidin concentration of foliage varied significantly between C. odorata provenances: nitrogen concentration was significantly lower and tannin and proanthocyanidin contents were significantly higher in trees from the San Carlos provenance, Costa Rica. This study therefore suggests that proanthocyanidins may reduce susceptibility of C. odorata to H. grandella , at least during the early period of growth. 5 These results provide support for the development of plant resistance as a strategy for managing shoot borers. In particular, there may be scope for selecting for high foliar proanthocyanidin content and the ability to tolerate attack by vigorous apical growth.",

Logistic regression analyses indicated that fourth‐instar larvae and adults exhibited a type II functional response to aphid density. Fourth‐instar larvae had a higher search rate (0.1305) than C. inaequalis female adults (0.0989).

This study examined the effects of short‐term drought conditions upon epigeal Collembola collected from arable fields. 2 An emergence trap was used in the laboratory to investigate collembolan activity, particularly the emergence of newly hatched juveniles from soils subjected to a simulated drought and to varied levels of simulated rainfall. 3 Addition of water to soils subjected to a 4‐month simulated drought resulted in synchronized emergence of juveniles of Sminthurinus elegans , Sminthurus viridis and Bourletiella hortensis . As anhydrobiotic nymphs were not found in the soil, these juveniles are likely to have recently hatched from eggs in the soil. 4 The same species were shown to emerge when desiccated soil samples were treated with simulated heavy rainfall. No emergence occurred in soils which received no water, whilst only a few juveniles were present under a regime of the lowest monthly rainfall recorded for the area in the spring. 5 This study provides the first evidence that in northern European arable systems some epigeal Collembola can survive considerable periods of drought as eggs, emergence of which is triggered by rainfall. These findings have implications for the effects of predicted climatic changes upon collembolan populations, the recovery of collembolan communities following pesticide applications in agroecosystems, and also provide a plausible mechanism for dispersal of Collembola as wind‐blown eggs.",

Several potential pheromone candidates have been identified for T. piniperda. 4 We tested various combinations of host volatiles and pheromone candidates in Michigan, U.S.A., and Ontario, Canada, to determine an optimal blend. 5 Attraction of T. piniperda was significantly increased when trans ‐verbenol (95% pure, 3.2% cis‐ verbenol content) was added with or without myrtenol to α‐pinene or to blends of α‐pinene and other kairomones and pheromone candidates. 6 Our results, together with other research demonstrating that trans ‐verbenol is produced by T. piniperda , support the designation of trans ‐verbenol as a pheromone for T. piniperda. A simple operational lure consisting of α‐pinene and trans ‐verbenol is recommended for optimal attraction of T. piniperda .",

Protected trees of most clones had grown over 2 m taller after three growing seasons. Diameter differences ranged from over 1–4 cm larger on protected trees. Insecticide protection increased above‐ground volume over 20 dm 3 in one clone, and at least 4 dm 3 in all others. Chrysomela scripta defoliation resulted in a 50–73% loss of above‐ground volume. Defoliation also resulted in increased lateral branching and forked terminals on unprotected trees. Defoliation impact varied among clone. The pure Populus deltoides clone 91 × 04‐03 showed the greatest growth response to chemical protection, whereas clone NM2 ( P. nigra × P. maximowiczii ) responded the least. Pest control is a key issue in short‐rotation plantation management. Until adequate pest‐resistant clones can be developed and natural enemy complexes better understood, chemical (biorational and organic) and cultural control may be used to reduce impacts of herbivorous pests.",

    "abstract": "Summary 1 An experiment was conducted in a winter wheat field using yellow water traps at crop height and at ground level, near to and distant from flowers, to test the hypothesis that such traps are seen as a source of food by flower‐feeding adult hoverflies and are therefore likely to selectively trap hungry individuals. Hoverflies caught in each trap were counted and identified and the amount of pollen in their guts was assessed. Ratios of numbers of hoverflies seen in the wheat crop to numbers caught in nearby traps were compared for the different treatments. 2 Most hoverflies were caught in crop‐high traps but they included a high proportion of individuals with empty guts. The taxa were: Episyrphus balteatus (De Geer), Metasyrphus corollae (F.) (these species together accounted for over 90% of the individuals trapped), with Sphaerophoria spp., Syrphus spp., Scaeva pyrastri (L.), Melanostomini and unidentified others making up the rest. 3 Significantly fewer hoverflies were captured in low than in high traps. The ratios of numbers trapped to numbers observed, in flower and in no flower treatments would be expected to be the same if the traps were not selective. This was supported for low traps. With high traps, however, there was a highly significant difference between the ratios (71.34 and 126 : 8, respectively). 4 Flies captured in high traps had less pollen in their gut than those captured in low ones. At each distance, more E. balteatus captured in high traps were in pollen category 1 (&lt; 20 grains) than in any other category. The opposite state was seen in low trap catches, where most flies were in category 5 (&gt; 5000 grains). Median pollen categories were 2 (21–200 grains) and 4 (1501–5000 grains) for flies caught in high and low traps, respectively. 5 The ecological selectivity of traps according to their height and the physiological condition of the targeted individuals is a problem likely to affect many trapping systems apart from the one described in this paper.",

Nitrogen and soluble sugar content of artificial diets were modified to obtain three different qualities of food, simulating variations in nutritive quality of host tree. 2 Larval development times were longer for Bt ‐treated larvae and pupal weights were reduced for sixth‐instar larvae only. Bt ‐induced mortality levels were influenced by food quality. Ingested dose of Bt and feeding inhibition times were strongly affected by the Bt treatment, but food quality affected only fourth‐instar larvae. Except for food digestibility, nutritional indices were negatively affected by the Bt treatment and by the reduction in food quality. 3 Contrary to early treated larvae (fourth instar), larvae treated at the beginning of the sixth instar were not able to compensate for Bt injury and were consequently more affected by the Bt ‐treatment both in terms of lethal and sublethal effects. 4 Bt efficacy was not directly related to the ingested dose. 5 Increase in larval vulnerability to Bt was more likely a consequence of a general stress induced by a less suitable food than a direct interaction between Bt and food nitrogen or sugar compounds. 6 The application of Bt on late‐instar larvae could be a successful operational strategy at low population levels when field sprays target the insect instead of foliage protection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 Because of the large numbers within a colony and their aggressive nature, red wood ants ( Formica rufa group) have a potential to greatly influence the cold‐temperate forest ecosystem. Wood ants are omnivorous and hunt in trees as well as on the forest floor. 2 A field experiment in a mixed forest in central Sweden was carried out to examine (i) the foraging behaviour of wood ants on the forest floor and (ii) the impact of increased numbers of wood ants on the soil fauna. The foraging behaviour of wood ants was manipulated by excluding the ants from their food resources in the tree canopy, with the intention to increase ant activity on the forest floor. To estimate this activity, the number of trees with foraging ants, the numbers of ants going to and from their nests and the prey carried by home‐running wood ants were determined during the summer period. Pitfall traps were placed in the soil to determine effects on mobile soil invertebrates. 3 When excluded from local trees, wood ants searched other trees further away from the nests rather than searching more intensively for prey on the forest floor. By contrast to the initial hypothesis, more soil‐living prey were caught by ants in the control plots than in the plots where the local trees were not accessible to the wood ants. The proportion of soil‐living to tree‐living prey tended to be greater in the control plots. 4 In the treated plots (no access to the trees), wood ants had a negative effect on the activity of Linyphiidae spiders. There was little effect of wood ants on other soil invertebrates. 5 This study suggests that the role of wood ants as top predators in the forest soil food‐web in central Sweden is limited.",

This knowledge will help in mass rearing, and support the development of behavioural control techniques for this insect. The present study determined the effects of delayed mating and previous matings of male L. coffeella on fecundity, egg viability and frequency of female remating. 2 The highest levels of fecundity and egg viability were obtained from matings of 1–3‐day‐old females. When females mated at 5 days of age, there were reductions of 40% in oviposition and of 43% in egg viability. 3 Females mated with 2‐day‐old virgin males were more fecund than those mated with older males; egg viability was also low (18%) from females mated with older males. 4 Virgin females that mated with virgin males laid a greater number of eggs than those mated with previously copulated males. Egg viability decreased with the increase in the number of previous male matings. 5 Five‐day‐old females remated in greater proportion than 2–3‐day‐old females. Females that copulated with males that had previously mated three times had higher rates of remating than those that copulated with virgin males. 6 The results obtained indicate that 1–3 days after emergence is the optimum age for mating. The implications of these findings for the control of L. coffeella by synthetic sex pheromone are discussed.",

In the trap crop management strategy, more colonizing adults were present in pheromone‐treated rows of potatoes compared with untreated middle rows. Significantly fewer L. decemlineata egg masses and larvae were found in potato plots that were bordered by pheromone‐treated rows, or bordered by imidacloprid + pheromone‐treated rows, or rows treated at‐planting with imidacloprid compared with untreated (control) potato plots. Densities of L. decemlineata egg masses and larvae and percentage defoliation were significantly lower, and marketable tuber yield significantly higher, in conventional imidacloprid‐treated potatoes compared with all other treatments. Although our results demonstrate the potential for use of the aggregation pheromone in the management of L. decemlineata in the field, more research is needed to optimize the release rates of the attractant and incorporate control methods for cohabiting pests.",

To improve management of these defoliating beetles in the region, canopy fogging and shoot clipping were conducted in plantations between 1999 and 2002 to identify and document the phenology of the beetle species present. 2 Eucalyptus weevil, Gonipterus scutellatus , was the most common and destructive defoliating beetle. Gonipterus scutellatus undergoes one principal generation each year with a lesser second generation or cohort in some seasons, which contrasts greatly with reports of two to four annual generations for the species in other regions. This limited reproduction by G. scutellatus may be due to the limited availability from summer onwards of new flushing foliage, which is essential for feeding and oviposition. 3 Several species of chrysomelid beetles were collected in plantations, but these were present in much lower numbers than G. scutellatus and were only a minor concern. However, some species, such as Chrysophtharta variicollis , appear to be capable of developing short‐lived outbreaks. 4 A diverse suite of natural enemies was fogged from plantations but they were significantly less abundant than defoliating beetles and are not likely to provide significant control of beetles. 5 In terms of managing these defoliating beetles, monitoring and control should focus on G. scutellatus , and be conducted during spring when most damage occurs.",

Questions addressed are: (i) how does the proportion of trap crop area of the total field area influence the equilibrium distribution of pests among the crop and the trap crop and (ii) how do crop patch size and shape influence the speed of pest redistribution from the crop to the trap crop. 2 When pest mobility in the trap crop is clearly lower than that in the crop, the pest population in the crop decreases very sharply for small trap crop proportions. When mobility in the trap crop is slightly closer to that in the crop, the pest population in the crop decreases much more gradually with increasing trap crop proportion. Thus finding a trap crop that the pest distinctly prefers over the crop appears to be crucial for developing efficient trap crop systems. 3 The rate of decay in the pest population in the crop increases with increasing perimeter to area ratio of the crop patch. Hence, designing field layouts to increase the perimeter to area ratio of crop patches may be beneficial.",

Shade trees potentially protect the main crop by increasing vegetational diversity and reducing insect herbivory through one or more mechanisms. 2 The effect of on‐farm vegetational diversity on harvesting of coffee leaves by the leaf‐cutting ant, Atta cephalotes L., was examined on 15 coffee farms varying in vegetational diversity near Turrialba, Costa Rica. The farms ranged from coffee monocultures to complex‐shade coffee systems with three or more tree species present. The vegetational diversity of each farm was quantified using a leaf area index. 3 The species composition and biomass of the plant material being carried into colonies by ants was collected, identified to species, and its biomass was quantified four times during one year for at least two colonies in each of the 15 farms. 4 The proportion of plant biomass that was coffee being retrieved by A. cephalotes differed significantly among farm management types, and was highest (40%) in monocultures and lowest (&lt; 1%) in farms with complex shade. Coffee was always harvested in a lower proportion than predicted based upon its relative abundance on the farms. 5 In dual‐choice bioassays with laboratory colonies, A. cephalotes significantly preferred the leaves of the predominant shade tree species on the farms, poró ( Erythrina poeppigiana ) over coffee. 6 The results indicate risk of injury by A. cephalotes can be reduced in vegetationally diverse coffee agroecosystems due at least in part to a foraging preference by the ants for plants other than coffee.",

Both susceptible and resistant insects were studied. Using one primer combination, more than 450 polymorphic DNA fragments were obtained and, in total, four primer combinations were used for analysis. A subsample of 59 single beetles was analysed using one primer combination. 3 AFLP profiles were analysed by similarity measures using the Nei and Li coefficient and Neighbour‐joining dendrograms were generated. The dendrogram built using 133 samples showed three distinct groups, each containing beetles representing one generation. Statistical analysis using analysis of molecular variance of single beetle samples showed no evidence of significant genetic difference between resistant and susceptible beetles. Instead, a clear difference between samples, depending on time of collection and generation, was observed. 4 The expected regional population structure, although statistically significant, explained little of the variation. The levels of genetic variation within populations were very high. There appears to be a high rate of gene flow between pollen beetle populations.

A diversified cropping system may interfere with these processes, ultimately reducing pest colonization of crops and the need for chemical interventions. 2 In the present study, nonhost vegetation was added to a broccoli ( Brassica oleracea var. italica ) cropping system to determine the effect of plant diversification on host location and colonization of broccoli by Lepidopteran pests. The two diversification strategies applied consisted of a broccoli/potato ( Solanum tuberosum ) strip crop, made up of 1.65 m (tractor width) replications of two rows of potatoes and two rows of broccoli, and a cereal rye ( Secale cereale ) cover crop, which formed a sacrificial planting that was killed and rolled flat to minimize weed competition and improve the agronomic performance of the subsequent broccoli crop. 3 Diamondback moth Plutella xylostella eggs, and subsequent larvae and pupae, were less abundant on broccoli with the cover crop, probably due to interference with host location and oviposition processes. The strip crop had no effect. 4 Numbers of cabbage white butterflies Pieris rapae eggs and larvae did not differ among treatments, probably due to the superior ability of these Lepidoptera to visually locate hosts and their active egg‐dispersing behaviour. 5 These results of the present study indicate that the success of crop diversification strategies are contingent on the relative ability of the target herbivore to locate its host plant and the scale of diversity (e.g. the distance between the host and the nonhost plants), rather than diversity itself.",

Anchomenus dorsalis was spatially associated with Ceutorhynchus spp. larvae during two peaks in the abundance of the latter in early and late June. Nebria brevicollis and A. dorsalis coincided in both time and space with larvae of the three coleopterous pests when they were most vulnerable to predation by epigeal predators and are therefore good candidates for conservation biocontrol. 5 The importance of carabid beeetles in the natural enemy complex in winter oilseed rape and their potential for biocontrol of spring and summer pests are discussed in relation to husbandry practices for the crop and its adjacent areas which could be manipulated to promote carabid survival for integrated pest management.",

However, no specific report on European host plants for this pest has been published so far. 3 In the present study, larval host plant choice and performance was tested for the first time on coniferous tree species that are widely distributed and of commercial value in Europe. 4 Based on dual‐choice tests on neonates and mortality, developmental duration and relative growth rates of the first‐ to sixth‐instar larvae, we found European larch Larix decidua to be the most suitable host for the moth larvae, whereas European black pine Pinus nigra and Scots pine Pinus sylvestris were the poorest hosts. The remaining conifer species tested, European silver fir Abies alba , Nordmann fir Abies nordmanniana , and Norway spruce Picea abies , were intermediate host plants. Douglas‐fir Pseudotsuga menziesii , originating from North America, was chosen by the larvae to the same extend as European larch, and was also highly suitable for larval development. 5 If the moth is introduced to European countries, it will become damaging in stands of European larch and Douglas‐fir, mixed stands of fir and spruce; however, it will be less damaging in forests dominated by two‐needle pines. 6 We predict that Dendrolimus superans sibiricus will be able to survive and develop on the main European coniferous tree species, including non‐native coniferous tree species, resulting in severe damage to large areas of forests.",

For each cultivar/species, responses to plants that were undamaged, previously infested by M. persicae and infested with M. persicae , were investigated using dual‐choice Petri dish bioassays and circular arenas. 3 There was no evidence that ladybirds responded to headspace chemicals from aphids alone. Ladybirds significantly preferred headspace chemicals from B. napus cv. Apex that were undamaged compared with those from plants infested with aphids. For the other four species/cultivars, there was a consistent trend of the predators being recorded more often in the half of the Petri dish containing plant headspace chemicals from previously damaged and infested plants compared with those from undamaged ones. Furthermore, the mean distance ladybirds walked to reach aphid‐infested A. thaliana was significantly shorter than to reach undamaged plants. These results suggest that aphid‐induced plant chemicals could act as an arrestment or possibly an attractant stimulus to C. septempunctata . However, it is also possible that C. septempunctata could have been responding to aphid products, such as honeydew, transferred to the previously damaged and infested plants. 4 The results provide evidence to support the ‘reliability–detectability’ theory and suggest that the effectiveness of C. septempunctata as a natural enemy of aphids may be strongly affected by which species and cultivar of Brassica are being grown.",

Statistical analyses are presented of 4 years of data that compared the presence, sharpness and duration of nocturnal layer profiles, observed using continuously‐operating entomological radar, with meteorological variables at typical layer altitudes over the U.K. Analysis of these large datasets demonstrated that temperature was the foremost meteorological factor that was persistently associated with the presence and formation of longer‐lasting and sharper layers of migrating insects over southern U.K.",

    "abstract": "Populations of the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus (F.) exhibit considerable differences in body size and larval behaviour. We examined whether such variation modifies the relationship between beetle infestation and host plant performance. Larvae from African and Asian biotypes were reared in seeds of four hosts that represented an almost four‐fold variation in seed mass. We estimated mass lost to larval consumption, and compared germination rates and seedling growth between infested and control seeds. In seeds bearing a single larva, the larger‐bodied, contest‐competing larvae of the Asian biotype caused a 38–47% greater reduction in seed mass compared with the smaller‐bodied, scramble‐competing larvae of the African biotype. The amount of seed mass lost per larva remained similar in seeds with one or two scramble‐competing larvae but decreased significantly in seeds bearing two contest‐competing Asian larvae. Differences in larval consumption and behaviour produced striking differences in the frequency of germination. Germination of singly‐infested mung bean (i.e. the smallest host) was 71% for African‐infested seeds versus 11% for Asian‐infested seeds. In cowpea (i.e. the largest host), 76% of Asian‐infested seeds germinated, whereas the germination rate of African‐infested cowpeas (92%) was similar to that of uninfested seeds. Effects of beetle origin persisted after germination. Seedlings derived from Asian‐infested seeds had greater cotyledon damage 7 days after germination, and displayed lower height and less biomass 15 days after germination. Cotyledon damage was a good predictor of seedling performance (i.e. better than seed mass consumed) 15 days after germination. Previous studies have suggested that population differences in larval size and burrowing behaviour (‘centripetal tendency’) reflect adaptation to different‐sized seeds. The present study demonstrates that these differences in turn influence the impact of larval feeding on host viability. Strong biotypic variation makes it difficult to generalize about pest impacts at the level of pest species.",

Otiorhynchus larvae are a serious pest in forest plantations in Iceland, causing 10–20% mortality of newly‐planted seedlings. We studied the effects of soil fungi on the survival of Otiorhynchus sulcatus larvae. The larvae were introduced into pots with birch seedlings grown in: (i) nursery peat; (ii) nursery peat inoculated with three different species of ectomycorrhizal fungi; (iii) nursery peat inoculated with insect pathogenic fungi; (iv) nursery peat inoculated with ectomycorrhizal fungi and insect pathogenic fungi; and (v) nursery peat inoculated with natural forest soil from Icelandic birch woodland. Larval survival was negatively affected by inoculation of: (i) the ectomycorrhizal fungus Laccaria laccata ; (ii) the ectomycorrhizal fungus Cenococcum geophylum ; (iii) the insect pathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae ; and (iv) forest soil. Inoculation with the ectomycorrhizal fungus Phialophora finlandia did not have any significant effect on larval survival. No significant synergistic effect was found between insect pathogenic and ectomycorrhizal fungi. It is concluded that ectomycorrhizal and insect pathogenic fungi have a significant potential in biological control of Otiorhynchus larvae in afforestation areas in Iceland. Further studies are needed to establish the effect of these fungi in the field and to analyse how mycorrhizal fungi affect root‐feeding larvae.",

The areas of potential forest interest in this region and the geographical range of this ant overlap. We performed field preference tests and monitored the level of ant herbivory on planted conifer seedlings next to nests. 3 Acromyrmex lobicornis preferred some conifer species and avoided foraging on others. Pseudotsuga menziesii and Austrocedrus chilensis were the less preferred species, Pinus ponderosa and Pinus contorta were the most preferred by A. lobicornis. 4 The item mostly selected by ants was young needles from P. contorta. This species was also the pine mostly defoliated. Seedlings without ant-exclusion showed a mean±SE of 60±5% defoliation during the sampling period. Pinus ponderosa was less defoliated; control seedlings showed a mean±SE of 8.5±1% of leaf damage in the sampling period. 5 The present study shows how the use of simple field tests of leaf-cutting ant preferences could allow an improved selection of appropriate conifer species for future plantations in areas where leaf-cutting ants are present.",

We investigated the acute toxicity of these pesticides to the exposed adults, as well as sublethal effects on reproduction and acetylcholinesterase and carboxylesterase activity. We also studied the effects of parental exposure on the size, development and enzyme activity of unexposed offspring. All three formulations were acutely toxic to H. graminicola , with synergism between dimethoate and fenvalerate leading to greater toxicity in the 1 : 1 mixture than for the two insecticides alone. The sublethal effects of direct pesticide exposure were a reduction in acetylcholinesterase and carboxylesterase activity and a reduction in the number of egg sacs produced by exposed spiders relative to the control spiders. The unexposed offspring of the fenvalerate and mixture exposed spiders were smaller and took longer to mature than the control spiders. Offspring of all exposed spiders also had significantly reduced carboxylesterase activity relative to control spiders. We concluded that the effects of parental exposure on the offspring were likely to increase their susceptibility to future pesticide exposures, and reduce the capacity of this spider to serve as a pest control agent.",

To validate the use of these groups, insects were collected from olive orchards in Cordoba and Granada, comprising two Andalusian provinces with different surrounding landscapes. 2 Canopies were sampled using the branch-beating technique during pre-blooming and post-blooming periods over 3 years in Granada (1999, 2000 and 2003) and 1 year in Cordoba (2003). 3 Using a nonparametric linear discriminant analysis method, based on the k-nearest neighbour algorithm, two discriminant functions were constructed. A first discriminant model took into account interannual variability in Granada Province and the second model focused on environmental heterogeneity between the two provinces. Cross-validation techniques, such as leave-one-out and split-sample, were applied to the associated discriminant functions for each model to check their performance. 4 Even though differences existed with respect to the insect composition of the regions, the second model correctly classified 78.1% of the sampled blocks under the non-organic and organic farming systems at the same time as taking into account two orders: Coleoptera and Hemiptera [excluding Euphyllura olivina olivina (Psyllidae) and the Heteroptera suborder]. The results suggest that the relative abundance of these groups in the post-blooming period could constitute a potential bio-indicator of organic olive farming system.",

    "abstract": "We investigated how modifications in winter and spring temperature conditions may affect the survival of a spring‐hatching Lepidoptera, the oak processionary moth Thaumetopoea processionea . Supercooling and chilling injury experiments indicate that eggs are especially cold hardy at the start of the winter period, although this ability is reduced later in the season. In the spring, young larvae are sufficiently cold hardy to ensure no direct mortality as a result of late frosts. A comparison of phenological models shows that neonate larvae may await the unfolding of new oak leaves for relatively long periods (e.g. 1–30 days). Under both low (4°C after 5 days at 16°C) and high temperature experimental scenarios (constant 16°C), the majority of neonate larvae can survive starvation for more than 2 weeks. Larvae may also suffer from food depletion once their development has been initiated (e.g. during cold springs) if the threshold temperature for feeding is not reached for several consecutive days, or in the case of late frosts affecting foliage availability. When temperature is reduced to 4°C, developing larvae become inactive and do not feed anymore; their starvation survival capability is reduced to approximately 2 weeks (cold spring hypothesis). At 16°C, developing larvae that are deprived of food can only survive for 10 days (late frost hypothesis). We conclude that, in the oak processionary moth, neonate larvae are relatively well adapted to early hatching relative to budburst, ensuring them the highest foliage quality for development. In some years, however, phenological asynchrony or cold spring conditions may affect the persistence of populations at the limits of the species' range.",

We grew brassica plants in several types of fertilizer, including those commonly used in conventional and sustainable farming systems, and an unfertilized control. The effects of fertilizer type on the performance of two aphid species and foliar glucosinolate content were investigated. Both aphid species performed poorly (with reduced fecundity) on the unfertilized treatment compared with those feeding on fertilized host plants. Brevicoryne brassicae , the brassica specialist, performed best on Brassica oleracea plants fertilized with an organic animal manure, with a 72% increase in fecundity and an 18% increase in intrinsic rate of increase compared with plants fertilized with ammonium nitrate. By contrast, the generalist Myzus persicae had an intrinsic rate of increase that was reduced by 15% on plants growing in the animal manure compared with those growing in ammonium nitrate. These results may explain earlier findings on the effects of fertilizer type on aphid populations in the field, and are discussed in the context of pest species' responses to sustainable and conventional agricultural systems.",

Data were collected on X. compactus infestation and key shade indicators: canopy cover, tree‐species densities, diameter at breast height (DBH) and ratio of coffee to banana. Cluster analysis revealed two coffee shade systems: a matured shade tree (MST) system and a young poly‐culture (YPC) system. Xylosandrus compactus infestations were significantly less in the MST system than in the YPC system and significantly less in the low rainfall zone than in the high rainfall zone. An increase in the density of Carica papaya and Albizia chinensis significantly reduced and increased X. compactus infestation, respectively. A higher average DBH of individual trees and a higher density of trees that exude sap significantly lowered X. compactus infestation. Suppressing X. compactus infestation requires bigger trees, a high density of sap‐exuding trees and no Albizia chinensis . Further research should aim to investigate X. compactus flight activity and microclimate influencing X. compactus population dynamics.",

This weevil is an emerging problem in areas heavily impacted by mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins. No olfactory attractants have been identified for this insect, making monitoring and management difficult. Thus, we investigated the role of vision in the host‐finding behaviour of Warren root collar weevil in the absence of known olfactory cues. We conducted three experiments in field enclosure plots aiming to characterize aspects of host‐finding behaviour by adult Warren root collar weevil. We found that both male and female weevils were readily attracted to vertical plastic silhouettes in the shape of a trunk, crown or tree at distances of less than 4 m. This pattern of attraction persisted over 2 years in two slightly different study designs. Blinding the insects removed their ability to orient to these silhouettes, indicating that host‐finding behaviour has a strong visual component. The use of different colour trunks and crowns (black, white and green) did not change the patterns of attraction of the insects to the silhouettes. Exploiting visual attraction in this walking insect may present a new management tool in forest protection strategies.",

Individuals with delayed emergence required up to 2.2-fold more time to develop from an egg to adult than individuals with normal emergence. This meant that some parasitoid adults emerged in autumn from eggs of grape leafhopper laid in August. 4 A delayed emergence as a result of a slower development ensures that the A.'atomus' parasitoid group is synchronized with the egg-laying of leafhoppers that overwinter as eggs on Rubus spp. 5 Consequently, leafhoppers overwintering as eggs on brambles play a key role in the ecology of the relationship between grape leafhoppers and the A.'atomus' parasitoid group.",

In addition, three fresh spruce logs were exposed on the same locations. Species richness did not vary significantly with elevation, whereas the abundance of most individual species did. Generally, aggressive species responded positively to higher temperature, whereas most non‐aggressive species responded negatively. In a warming scenario, it is likely that spruce forests will face increasing damage from aggressive species. This will threaten the growth and survival of N orway spruce at low elevation, especially at southern latitudes.",

Although carabids are among the main predators in both crops, crop management can affect their movement. The main aim of the present study was to measure the movement of the four most abundant carabid species ( Calathus fuscipes , Poecilus cupreus , Bembidion lampros and Pseudoophonus rufipes ) between adjacent alfalfa and maize before and after alfalfa cutting, using rubidium as a marker. Movement of predators into the herbaceous margin between alfalfa and maize was also assessed. The four carabid species showed bidirectional movements between crops, although the pattern of movement differed between species and was affected by alfalfa cutting. After cutting, the movement of C. fuscipes , P. cupreus and P. rufipes from alfalfa towards maize was higher than in the opposite direction. Bembidion lampros showed a greater degree of movement towards alfalfa than in the opposite direction before cutting and only moved to the margin after cutting. Maize and herbaceous field margins can therefore act as both refuge and donor habitat for carabids, and can help to recolonize alfalfa after cuttings. Growing maize near alfalfa and providing an intercrop refuge habitat may conserve and enhance carabid populations.",

Three types of pitfalls were used: gutter traps near field margins, as well as conventional pitfall traps or cross‐traps consisting of four gutter trap arms leading to a central pitfall. Capture of naturally occuring beetles was concurrently recorded. In total, 6952 marked A griotes obscurus (males and females) and A griotes lineatus (males) were released and 14.74% were recaptured at some time during the present study. Recovery rates ranged from 3.54% to 28.5%. A griotes obscurus dominated wild populations, with 4011 males and 1672 females trapped compared with 17 males and three females for A . lineatus . Males dominated early in the period, although the sex ratio tended towards equality as the season progressed. Generally, captures of A . obscurus males released in equal numbers at field edges followed a uniform distribution. There were differences for wild beetles caught in the same traps. Spatial trapping patterns of wild and marked beetles across the fields were similar. Within 19 h of release at the field edges A . obscurus males were captured &gt;30 m away. The crop type had a significant interspecific effect on trap counts for males and an intraspecific effect on A . obscurus females, reinforcing the need for caution when using trapping systems to monitor adult stages of these pests.

The role of this behaviour on the spatial distribution of offspring of sympatric species with overlapping host ranges has been overlooked. In the present study, two analytical approaches were used to investigate the co-infestation patterns of the fruit flies Anastrepha fraterculus (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae) and Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) (Diptera: Tephritidae), aiming to unravel the importance of cross-species infestation recognition in nature. Guava fruit were sampled in an area of coexistence of these two fruit flies and individually categorized as non-infested, infested by one of the species or infested by both species. The frequency of each type of fruit was compared with the frequency distributions expected under two models: an independent oviposition model and a competition avoidance model. As an alternative approach, co-occurrence patterns were evaluated using null models. The results showed that avoidance of competition could be occurring in nature, although only in a few cases in which infestation levels are moderate. The two approaches revealed that the spatial scale has significant impact on the resulting co-occurrence patterns, such that opposite behaviours towards infested fruit are inferred at the largest (mainly aggregated oviposition pattern) versus the smallest scale (mainly independent oviposition pattern). For the system under investigation, our findings suggest that the avoidance of infested fruit does not contribute, or at least not strongly, to the coexistence of the two species.",

Identifying the arthropod community associated with ash trees has been highlighted as an important research requirement in understanding the wider effects of EAB. We harvested live ash trees infested with EAB at 37 sites in Maryland from 2011 to 2014 and collected a total of 2031 arthropods. All arthropods were identified to order and 94.6% were identified to family or below. The community comprised 13 orders, 60 families and 41 genera, with 28 arthropod species identified. Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera accounted for 98.3% of arthropods collected. Data on changes in richness and diversity over time were fitted to second-order polynomial models, corresponding with a transition in the dominant taxa from woodboring beetles (Cerambycidae) to parasitoids (Braconidae and Eulophidae). This resulted in changes to community composition as the EAB infestation intensified. The findings of the present study provide further evidence of the diversity of arthropods at risk from EAB. Given the number of invasive non-native insects threatening North American forests, establishing what taxa are present is important for predicting the likely broader impacts of these invasions.",

In the present study, we report host range, geographical distribution, Wolbachia infection and mitochondrial strains of leafminer fly species from eastern Brazil. Four leaf miner fly species were identified using cytochrome c oxidase subunit I DNA barcoding. Liriomyza sativae is the main pest as a result of its high polyphagy and wide distribution. Liriomyza brassicae, Liriomyza huidobrensis and Calycomyza malvae are important in Brassicaceae, Curcubitaceae and Malvaceae crops, respectively. There is no relationship among host range, geographical distribution and mitochondrial strains of leafminer fly species. We did not find Wolbachia infection in any of the specimens collected. Phylogeographical analyses suggests that there are four strains of L. sativae in the world, one of which is endemic from Brazil. The lack of shared haplotypes between Brazilian specimens and those from other world regions indicates the absence of recent gene flow of leafminer flies from Brazil with specimens from Americas and Old world. The exception is L. brassicae, which exhibits one haplotype shared among Brazil, Philippines and Sri Lanka.

However, the relative importance of local and landscape effects and their possible interactions have rarely been studied. We studied carabids in 18 pumpkin fields bordered by different field margins, along a gradient from simple to structural rich landscapes. Carabids were caught in pitfall traps along transects from the adjoining semi‐natural habitat towards the field centre. Although estimated species richness generally increased towards the field edges, carabid abundance increased towards adjacent woody margins and other crop fields. By contrast, abundance decreased towards adjacent herbaceous margins. Estimated carabid species richness in organically managed fields increased with increasing landscape heterogeneity, whereas this effect was absent in conventional fields. However, estimated species richness did not differ between organic and conventional fields. The differential response of carabid abundance to distance from the field edge in accordance with the type of field margin may explain the variability of patterns reported in the literature. The results of the present study show that both local and landscape parameters must be taken into account to promote carabids as natural enemies of crop pests.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Herbivorous insects are considered to be a major problem in cranberry ( Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) production. Spraying chemical pesticides is common practice, although beneficial insects could also be affected. We aimed to strengthen the resistance mechanisms that cranberry plants themselves use to combat insect pests by manipulating available nutrient levels. We hypothesized that cranberry genotypes respond differently from nutrient availability with regard to growth and defence against multiple herbivores. In the present study, six cranberry varieties (i.e. genotypes) were subjected to four different fertilizer rates. In a greenhouse setting, we assessed soil and leaf nitrogen concentrations; weight gain of the native pests spotted fireworm ( Choristoneura parallela Robinson), sparganothis fruitworm ( Sparganothis sulfureana Clemens) and the invasive pest gypsy moth ( Lymantria dispar L.); levels of leaf proanthocyanidins (PACs); and plant growth. The results obtained showed that cranberry varieties differ in their insect resistance qualities, although this depended on the insect species identity; genotypic variation was observed in resistance against the invasive pest L. dispar but not against the two native insect pests. Overall, increased nutrient availability decreased plant resistance to the three herbivores (i.e. increased larval weight gain and reduced PAC levels), regardless of the cranberry genotype. Nutrient availability correlated negatively with PAC levels and positively with herbivore weight gain and plant growth, indicating a potential trade‐off between growth and defence. Fertilization management to strengthen insect resistance in cranberry may contribute to the development of more sustainable pest management practices, especially for organic production.",

We compared the efficacy of verbenone and Verbenone Plus for protecting individual lodgepole pine Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. and small stands of P. contorta from mortality attributed to D. ponderosae . Verbenone Plus is a blend of semiochemicals [(−)‐verbenone, acetophenone, and ( E )‐2‐hexen‐1‐ol + ( Z )‐2‐hexen‐1‐ol] originally developed to inhibit aggregation of western pine beetle D. brevicomis LeConte.

Both verbenone and Verbenone Plus were effective for protecting individual P. contorta and small stands of P. contorta from mortality attributed to D. ponderosae . Verbenone alone was as effective as Verbenone Plus. An obstacle to the broader use of semiochemical repellents for the management of bark beetles is the relatively high cost and specificity of the semiochemicals involved. A semiochemical repellent with efficacy across multiple bark beetle species and hosts, such as Verbenone Plus, would be desirable, assuming the additional components are not cost‐prohibitive or limit registration.",

Climate change in the U.K. is predicted to increase incidences of spring–summer drought events, with the aphid expected to respond to these changes. This will have serious implications for damage levels and growth of infested Sitka spruce, as well as control of the aphid pest. Under controlled laboratory conditions, nymphal survival rate, lifespan and generation time of E. abietinum were examined in time-staggered trials during the spring and autumn periods of population growth, using five levels of drought with differing frequencies and magnitude. Survivorship and lifespan were unaffected by drought stress compared with a well-watered control. Generation time, however, was increased under severe continuous and high amplitude intermittent drought stress. Advancement of Sitka spruce dormancy was not supported as no differences between the autumn trials were observed for the three parameters. The findings of the present study suggest that, under severe water deficit, populations of E. abietinum may be reduced as a result of a reduced period of time available for reproduction. This has implications for the population development of E. abietinum and, consequently, damage levels and growth reductions of host Sitka spruce under altered climatic conditions.",

The carnivore group should also be monitored as an indicator of biodiversity and invertebrate biological control. The best sampling location was the field margin where carabids are exposed to GM maize and are abundant enough to require smaller sample sizes to detect population changes. Finally, sampling should concentrate around maize pollen‐shed when carabid abundance is highest. This study provides baseline data and shows that carabids can cost effectively improve detection capacity of postmarket monitoring.",

Injecting M agnolia virginiana L . with ethanol consistently induced attacks by exotic ambrosia beetles to facilitate research on their biology and management. The ability to attract ambrosia beetles to trap trees may be useful for developing nonchemical strategies and techniques for managing them in nurseries. However, to be useful in management techniques, ethanol‐injection has to reliably induce attacks on a vlariety of tree species. Experiments were conducted in O hio, T ennessee and V irginia, where ethanol‐injection was tested on 16 species of deciduous trees from 11 families. Ethanol‐injection reliably induced attacks by exotic ambrosia beetles on all tree species tested. There were differences in the numbers of attacks by ambrosia beetles among species of trees in most experiments, although no species was identified consistently as the most or least attacked in repeated experiments. The positive association of attacks with ethanol concentrations in bark tissue indicate that the attack rates were most likely related to the uptake and emission of ethanol. The results of the present study indicate that ethanol‐injection reliably induces ambrosia beetle attacks on a wide range of deciduous tree species, which should further facilitate research on ambrosia beetles in nurseries and the development of behaviour‐based management tactics that divert ambrosia beetles away from ornamental trees.",

As a native and potentially indigenous exotic species, its distribution and potential damage is largely unknown in Mexico. We used the maximum entropy algorithm to determine the bioclimatic variables that may explain the distribution of A. auroguttatus , as well as its interaction with the distribution of known hosts in Mexico. Our model calculated high suitability for A. auroguttatus in the biogeographical provinces of California, the northern and southern areas of Sierra Madre Occidental and the northwestern area of the Mexican Plateau; moderate suitability was projected in the Baja California, Sonora and Sierra Madre Occidental provinces. Potential distribution of A. auroguttatus was overlapping with native ranges of Quercus agrifolia , Quercus emoryi Torrey and Quercus hypoleucoides A. Camus. Precipitation of the coldest quarter (23.6%), isothermality (23.5%), precipitation seasonality (17.3%) and mean temperature of the coldest quarter (11.2%) contributed most to explaining its distribution in Mexico. The geographical interaction (i.e. the likelihood that the habitat would be suitable for coexistence) of A. auroguttatus with its hosts in Mexico was projected in the California province (46 382.60 km 2 , probably as an exotic species) and the northwestern areas of Mexican Plateau and Sierra Madre Occidental provinces (74 013.45 km 2 , probably as native). Determining the areas of environmental suitability for A. auroguttatus and its host distribution can focus ground surveys, contribute to management efforts and assist in the development of risk assessments for Mexico.",

Even though several groups showed varying declines in abundance, elevated CO 2 did not measurably affect community composition. The results of the present study indicate that atmospheric CO 2 levels predicted within the next 35 years may cause declines in arthropod abundances in E ucalyptus woodland.

We used a manipulative experiment to compare the longevity and weight variation of Monochamus galloprovincialis (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) under three climatic conditions in which the mean and variance of daily temperatures were both controlled. This insect is vector of the invasive nematode, Bursapheluncus xylophilus, which is the causal agent of the pine wilt disease, one of the major threats to pine forests in Europe. Our results showed that an increase of 2.5 °C in average temperature had no effect on the survivorship and weight variations of the beetle. By contrast, larger fluctuating variations of temperature across year resulted in significantly lower longevity, whereas weight remained unchanged. The results of the present study suggest that the effect of global warming on the survival of M. galloprovincialis is likely to be driven by change in temperature stability rather than by change in mean temperature.",

We compared the colonization rate of trapnests, nesting success, parasitism and response to flower resources of cavity‐nesting bees and wasps between apple orchards and nearby semi‐natural habitats (SNHs). Trapnests were placed in orchards and neighbouring SNHs. Colonization dynamics were studied and herbaceous flower resources were estimated. Furthermore, nest and brood cell quantity, number of alive offspring and nest parasitism rate were assessed. We found a higher colonization rate in the SNHs than in the orchards. Both bees and wasps made more nests, completed more brood cells and had a higher number of alive offspring in the SNHs. The number of bee nests in the orchards showed a positive correlation with the species richness of the flowering plants. The nest parasitism of wasps was higher in the SNHs. Apple orchards in the studied small‐scale system were generally less colonized by cavity‐nesting hymenopterans than nearby SNHs that can be important reservoirs of these ecosystem service provider hymenopterans. Our results highlight the importance of diverse flowering herbaceous vegetation in the understory that increased the number of bee nests in orchards and that could have a positive effect on the nesting activity of the bee species active in summer. Therefore, management practices that support flowering plant species in the understory vegetation are highly recommended in such orchards.",

For this, we performed a greenhouse experiment with 15 potato varieties for which we caged pairs of plants (i.e., emitters and receivers) of the same variety. Half of the emitter plants were subjected to leaf damage by beetle larvae and the other half remained intact. We collected volatile organic compounds from emitter plants and estimated L. decemlineata damage on receivers. We found no evidence of quantitative (total production) or qualitative (compound composition) changes in volatile organic compound emissions due to beetle herbivory. In addition, the leaf damage treatment on emitters had no significant effect on receiver herbivore resistance, suggesting no communication between infested and non‐infested potato plants in response to Colorado potato beetle damage. Overall, this study provides baseline information on airborne signalling (or the lack of thereof) in potato plants which can inform subsequent work that identifies airborne volatiles with potentially strong effects on priming or defence induction.",

Wild plant species are major reservoirs for D . suzukii populations but their infestation rates vary greatly among geographical areas. We aimed at disentangling the relative roles of macroclimatic, landscape and local factors in the rate of D . suzukii infestation of elderberry fruits ( Sambucus nigra ), a major wild host plant in Europe. We collected elderberry fruits across 215 sites distributed in 13 regions from North to South of France. We counted the number of emerging D . suzukii adults and tested for the effect of macroclimatic, landscape, local biotic and abiotic variables, as well as plant traits using linear mixed models. Site latitude and mean daily maximum temperature since the beginning of the year had respectively the strongest positive and negative effects on mean infestation rates across regions. Infestation rates also increased with forest cover in a 100 m radius around sampling sites.

No significant associations between insect traits and landscape variables were identified.

    "abstract": "At a time when biodiversity is being lost at an unprecedented rate due to human activity, much research effort has been spent on assessment of the importance of biodiversity for the functioning and stability of ecosystems and for the delivery of ecosystem services. Pest control has been identified on numerous occasions as a valuable ecosystem service delivered by biodiversity (Mooney et al., 1995a, b; Naeem et al., 1999; Schläpfer et al., 1999), and one that is at risk from human activity (Naylor & Ehrlich, 1997). There is considerable evidence that as agricultural production systems are intensified by increased use of external inputs to increase yield, they tend to lose biodiversity and become destabilized, with increased frequency and extent of pest outbreaks (Altieri, 1991; Swift et al., 1996). However, we know relatively little about the ecological mechanisms that result in this destabilization, or how important natural enemy diversity is in maintaining pest-control functioning. Numerous studies exist which consider the ecological or theoretical basis of biological control (e.g. see Hawkins & Cornell, 1999) but relatively little attention has been given to understanding pest control as a natural ecosystem function and how changes in agricultural practice may affect function through impacts on biodiversity. This applies particularly to the non-equilibrium conditions that exist in short duration or seasonal cropping systems. As such, and whilst some notable exceptions exist, it can generally be argued that patterns of pest emergence remain poorly explained and attempts to improve natural pest control through modifications to management practices have limited ecological foundation. The aim of this paper is to explore how current ecological thinking can help to improve on this situation and to propose some ecological frameworks that may facilitate investigation of the importance of biodiversity and the impact of management practices on it. Characterization of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning has been a major research goal of ecology over the past decade. Numerous theoretical and empirical studies have been undertaken on many ecosystem properties, including biomass production (producers, consumers and decomposers), nutrient uptake and retention, decomposition, soil pH, soil water and organic matter content and community respiration (Schläpfer & Schmid, 1999), although little has been published on the importance of diversity in natural enemy assemblages for pest control functioning (but see Rodríguez & Hawkins, 2000). The majority of these studies have observed a saturating positive relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning (Schwartz et al., 2000). One mechanism whereby species diversity influences ecosystem functioning is resource-use complementarity. That is, different species occupy different niches allowing complementary functioning of species in heterogeneous or temporally variable environments. The slope of the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning is partly dependent on the extent to which species overlap functionally, with respect to the particular ecosystem process of concern. If all species have an equal and non-overlapping effect on a particular process (perfect complementarity), then a linear reduction in the rate of the process would occur as species richness decreased (Fig. 1). At the other extreme, if there is no complementarity (species are 'redundant' with respect to the function concerned, see Walker, 1992; Lawton & Brown, 1993), then remaining species would be able to compensate for lost species and a sudden and complete loss of functioning would occur as the final functional species was lost. Hypothesized response of ecosystem function to decrease in species richness. If species are redundant then the response exhibits threshold behaviour in which significant reductions in functioning occur suddenly as the threshold is reached. By contrast, if species are complementary, each having non-overlapping roles, the response is a gradual loss of function with species loss. If species identity is important then the response can follow a broad range of trajectories (represented by the shaded region) depending on the order of species loss. Another mechanism resulting in a positive relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning has been termed the 'sampling effect' (Aarssen, 1997; Huston, 1997). This effect occurs if the probability of including a species with a strong influence on ecosystem functioning increases as species diversity increases. The sampling effect is viewed by some as a true diversity effect (Tilman et al., 1997), but by others as an experimental artefact, because its expression is dependent on the probability of inclusion of species, which are under the control of the experimenter and usually do not reflect natural probabilities. The sampling effect is one expression of species composition effects, i.e. effects that arise from the fact that species differ in their functional capacity. More generally, compositional effects are expressed as variance in the relationship between diversity and ecosystem functioning (Hooper & Vitousek, 1997; Hooper, 1998; Petchey, 2000). In the extreme, a single species may have a much greater impact on process rate than other species (e.g. a keystone species). In such a scenario, the observed relationship between diversity and function would be idiosyncratic (Lawton, 1994), i.e. it could take any trajectory within a broad envelope of response (Fig. 1), depending on the order of species loss (Sala et al., 1996). Thus, strong species composition effects mean that function cannot be predicted from species diversity alone. Key attributes of a system determining important characteristics of the relationship between species diversity and ecosystem functioning are therefore the extent to which the functioning of species complement each other, and the extent to which species are unequal in their impact on a particular process. In order to predict the response of a particular ecosystem process to reductions in species diversity, we must understand the ecological mechanisms behind complementarity and species composition effects. To answer the broader question of what are the impacts of human activity on the ecosystem process of interest (in our case natural pest control), we must additionally understand how and at what rate human activities have an impact on diversity. In ecological terms, this means the linked study of both the assembly and function of diversity in human-impacted ecosystems. A conceptual framework for linking diversity assembly and function can be made by identifying the traits of species that govern their membership to functional response groups and functional effect groups (Catovsky, 1998) (Fig. 2). In other words, by bringing together the traits we know govern response to management with those that are important for function we can formulate hypotheses concerning the effect of management on functioning. The way in which this linkage is made is somewhat dependent on the relative importance of diversity and composition effects in driving function. For example, if species composition effects do not strongly influence functioning, then we have extensive overlap between effect and response groups. That is, as species identity is not important, all species remaining after management are likely to have functional significance. If species are complementary in function, then any reduction in species diversity will reduce the functional capacity of the community, as each species functions uniquely to some extent. Alternatively, in a system with extensive redundancy among species, reduction in the size of the overlap between response and effect groups will have little impact on function. Where there are strong species composition effects, the amount of overlap between response and effect groups is reduced considerably and we must focus on the traits determining joint membership of response and effect groups. Conceptual scheme linking management effects to their functional consequences. Identification of the traits governing species membership to functional response groups and those governing membership to functional effect groups, allows logical connection between the impact of human activities and their functional significance. Clearly then, as a starting point for implementing these ideas in the context of impacts on pest control of changes in biodiversity, a key issue to understand is the extent to which species composition or diversity effects predominate in determining function. To examine this issue further, we draw on a recent study concerning the effect of pest life-history characteristics and their influence on natural enemy complementarity and species composition effects via the influence on food web structure (Wilby & Thomas, 2002). It is known that major life-history characteristics of an insect herbivore, such as whether development mode is hemi- or holometabolous, can have a major influence on the number and diversity of natural enemies in the herbivore's natural enemy assemblage (Fig. 3). Endopterygote insects (holometabolous development) undergo dramatic morphological and behavioural changes between egg, larva, pupa and adult, and these life stages often play very different ecological roles, utilizing different food and occupying different sites. By contrast, exopterygote insects (hemimetabolous development) undergo relatively gradual changes between life stages, which often occupy similar sites and utilize similar food. As a consequence of these differences, we expect differences in the structure of linkages between these insect types and their natural enemies. The natural enemy complex interacting with endopterygote insects should be largely segregated into groups attacking particular life stages of the herbivore; most of those enemies feeding on adults would not be expected to also feed on larvae or pupae (e.g. see Waloff, 1968; Barrion et al., 1991; Mills, 1994; Oatman, 1995a, b; Luna & Sánches, 1999). On the other hand, due to the similarity in site occupancy and behaviour, natural enemies feeding on exopterygote insects are expected to feed on both nymphs and adults. Hence, because of the life-cycle structure, the natural enemy complex feeding on endopterygote insects should exhibit more complementarity among species compared with that feeding on exopterygote insects. Simulation studies have shown that the higher complementarity among natural enemies of endopterygote insects may result in gradual loss of pest control functioning with decreasing natural enemy species diversity, whereas control of exopterygotes should be relatively resistant, with a sudden loss of pest control functioning occurring only after extreme loss of natural enemy diversity. These predictions appear to be consistent with pest emergence patterns during intensification of Asian rice production systems (Wilby & Thomas, 2002). Life history characteristics of herbivorous insects and their hypothesized influence on the interacting natural enemy complex. (a) A simplified endopterygote insect, (b) a simplified exopterygote insect, (c) morphological or behavioural concealment, and (d) shortened life span. Other aspects of herbivore life history are likely to influence the richness or characteristics of the natural enemy complex, with implications for pest control functioning. For example, morphological or behavioural concealment tends to promote tight linkage of population dynamics between the herbivore and natural enemy (Fig. 3c). Thus, with concealed herbivores, specialist parasitoids increase in importance compared with relatively generalist predators (Memmott et al., 2000), although some concealed herbivores may be attacked by relatively more species of generalist parasitoid than specialist parasitoid (Hawkins, 1990; Hawkins et al., 1992). In essence, tight linkages between specialist natural enemies and pests inflate the importance of species composition effects and increase the uncertainty about response to random species loss. This predication is supported by simulation studies, which indicate that control of concealed pests should be relatively sensitive to natural enemy species loss, and that responses should be highly variable due to strong composition effects. These predictions are also borne out along intensification gradients in Asian rice (Wilby & Thomas, 2002). The previous discussion shows that attributes of the basic life-history characteristics of the organisms involved can lead to different predictions about the relative importance of diversity and species composition in determining pest control functioning. This allows us to move beyond arguments of whether species composition or diversity is the most important attribute of the natural enemy community, to a position where we can predict which types of pest are likely to require particular natural enemy types for control, and which are likely to be better controlled by a diverse assemblage of natural enemies. The characteristics discussed serve as examples of general widespread life-history characteristics that are hypothesized to influence the relationship between diversity and pest control. The list is by no means exhaustive, and other traits are immediately apparent. For example, herbivore life span is also likely to have important consequences for the richness and characteristics of the natural enemy complex. The shorter the life span of a herbivorous species, the smaller the number of natural enemy species that overlap phenologically with the herbivore (Cornell & Hawkins, 1993). Consequently, control of a pest with a shorter life span should depend on a group of natural enemies with less redundancy, either across the life cycle in the case of exopterygote insects, or within life-cycle stages in the case of endopterygote insects. In either case, and with all else being equal, control of short-lived insects should decrease earlier, on average, in response to natural enemy species loss. The above examples show how herbivore characteristics may influence the relative importance of natural enemy species diversity and composition and the types of natural enemies likely to be important, where composition effects are likely. The next step to facilitate prediction of the effects of agricultural management on pest control functioning is to link these arguments with management effects on diversity and composition. One approach to understanding the effects of agricultural management on arthropod diversity is to consider management impacts in the context of arthropod community assembly. Assembly rules have a long history in community ecology, where the objective has been to predict which species will occur in a particular habitat (Keddy, 1992). Although many authors reserve the term 'assembly rule' for the processes of species interaction which limit inclusion of species in a community (e.g. Belyea & Lancaster, 1999), we prefer to take a broad definition that includes processes of dispersal and colonization in addition to interspecific interactions. We follow Roughgarden & Diamond (1986) in identifying three types of filtration that govern which species from the set of all species in the region can occupy a site (Fig. 4). We also make considerable use of the terminology of Kelt et al. (1995) and Belyea & Lancaster (1999), although we present the species filtration process in a sequential fashion, relating to the order, and scale at which species negotiate the filters. Community assembly encompassing dispersal, environmental filtering and internal community dynamics. Agroecosystem management can modify each of these processes. In order for a species to be present at a particular site, it must first be capable of arriving at the site. Dispersal constraints govern which species from the regional species pool are included in the local species pool, i.e. those species that are able to disperse to the site in question. Of those species in the local species pool, only those species that are able to overcome environmental constraints imposed by abiotic filters at the site occupy the ecological species pool. Finally, internal community dynamics (or biotic filters), including intra- and interspecific processes govern composition of the actual species pool. In addition to governing presence of species in communities, these processes also influence species abundance. This allows the framework to be used to describe the important processes driving species diversity and composition. The importance of this framework with respect to management effects on natural pest control derives from its description of the full range of ecological influences (at scales below continental and regional level processes) that can influence a species' abundance in a particular site. Although this may be somewhat heuristic, rather than explicitly mechanistic, its usefulness derives from the potential for generalizations to be made connecting the filters of the assembly process to particular biological traits likely to be most sensitive to changes in these filters. We can also relate particular management practices to the filters and to the biological traits that they are likely to affect. Dispersal constraints, for example, are largely influenced by structural alterations in the landscape that occur as a result of land-use change. It is known that the way in which insects respond to fragmentation is related to several traits. Body size, for instance, has been shown to affect the spatial scale of fragmentation to which populations of parasitoids are sensitive (Roland & Taylor, 1997). Larger parasitoids tend to be more mobile and have populations extending over large areas. Thus, as a habitat is fragmented, the larger parasitoids are affected first and as a result we may expect to find changes in the size distribution of natural enemies. If this extends to predators, then this is likely to be functionally significant, given the constraints of size on prey selection. Continuing with this theme, there is a large body of literature concerning the effect of fragmentation on insect communities. Generally, fragmentation of habitats has a greater effect on the abundance and species richness of higher trophic levels, and parasitoids in general are known to be particularly susceptible (Kruess & Tscharntke, 1994; Zabel & Tscharntke, 1998; Tscharntke & Kruess, 1999). However, considerable complexity arises as dispersal constraints interact with abiotic and biotic constraints to determine how species respond to fragmentation. For example, agricultural development tends to result in an increase in crop area relative to non-crop area. We may expect therefore that species specializing on the crop habitat will respond in a different fashion to those specializing in non-crop habitats. For natural enemies, this may mean promotion of species specializing on crop pests and a decrease in the relative abundance of more generalist species. Referring to our earlier discussion, an emergent prediction from this is that control of endophagous pest species may be facilitated by increases in crop area, whereas control of external feeders, particularly endopterygotes, may be reduced. Of course, this prediction is based on the assumption that specialist natural enemies are able to persist in a crop habitat. It is known that many parasitoid species require alternative food sources such as nectar and pollen (Landis & Menalled, 1998) and may be sensitive to practices such as tillage during fallow periods (e.g. Nilsson, 1985). In this case, control of endophagous pests will only be sustained following increases in crop area if nectar sources are available and if tillage is asynchronously applied across the landscape so that natural enemies are able to re-colonize from adjacent undisturbed patches. In addition, the spatial scale at which management is synchronized will have a major influence on the ability of natural enemies to re-colonize, and this re-colonization is likely to be related to their body size due to its relationship with mobility. Similarly, although we may expect generalist natural enemies to be reduced with increased scale and uniformity of crop environment, in practice, even limited non-crop areas adjacent to crops have been shown to help maintain natural enemy abundance and diversity within the crop by providing alternative food sources and refuges from disturbance (e.g. Risch et al., 1983; Altieri & Schmidt, 1986; Andow, 1991a; Thomas et al., 1991, 1992; Dennis et al., 1994; Wratten & van Emden, 1995; Thies & Tscharntke, 1999). Moving down the assembly hierarchy, we can also identify agricultural management practices that act as abiotic filters. Insecticides, for example, generally have a broad impact across arthropod communities. The extent to which they act as a filter to alter diversity and abundance between the local and ecological species pools depends on the differential impact on individual taxa; some species may be physiologically or ecologically resistant, whereas others may be susceptible. The implications for pest-control functioning depend in particular on differential effects on herbivore and natural enemy types. Where herbivores show greater resistance and/or higher recovery rates than natural enemies, we might expect pesticide-induced resurgence. Indeed, pest resurgence following insecticide use has been recorded in many types of pests (Hardin et al., 1995). However, set in the context of our framework for the role of natural enemy diversity in pest control functioning, the effects of insecticides on control of external feeding exopterygotes are expected to be particularly striking. For these pests, we predict that control can be maintained even where there is minimal natural enemy diversity. Nonetheless, control will be lost if diversity and abundance are reduced too far. Thus, insects such as the brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) may be controlled adequately by natural enemies even under intensive rice production systems in South-east Asia, but when insecticides are applied, it can become a devastating pest (Reissig et al., 1982; Heinrichs & Mochida, 1984; Kenmore et al., 1984; Heong, 1991). The mechanism for this phenomenon has been well elucidated and it seems that they key is the near complete removal of a guild of generalist predators which impose considerable mortality on planthopper populations and are sustained by alternative prey, such as detritivorous insects, at times when N. lugens is scarce (Settle et al., 1996). Nilaparvata lugens is able to escape control partly because its eggs can survive insecticide treatment, because it is highly dispersive and can recolonize rice fields quickly, and because it has a high population growth rate (Heinrichs & Mochida, 1984). In contrast, the key complex of generalist predators have no protected stages and show slow recovery because they are, on the whole, less dispersive. As important, the build-up and/or maintenance of generalist predators is greatly hampered by the insecticide-induced reductions in alternative prey populations. Again, this illustrates the interaction between mechanisms acting at different points in the assembly process. Here, pesticides act as an abiotic constraint but their significance is mediated by biotic interactions and the differential response of predators and herbivores (and crop-associated detritivores), which is determined in part by colonization processes that link back to dispersal constraints and aspects of habitat heterogeneity (over space and/or time). Finally, agricultural management also has an impact on internal community dynamics, the third filter of our assembly framework. The abundance of weeds within a crop, for example, influences the diversity and composition of natural enemy assemblages. Generally, the change from relatively diverse vegetation to virtual monoculture, which occurs with increased weed management, is associated with a decrease in diversity of natural enemy species (although not necessarily abundance) and a decrease in the relative abundance of generalist predators (Andow, 1991b; Tonhasca & Byrne, 1994). Thus, weed management may be expected to reduce levels of control of pests attacked by generalist predators and also, perhaps, those concealed species controlled by parasitoids that require alternative food sources. Similarly, returning to another example from rice production systems, management of crop residues and levels of organic matter in the soil have been demonstrated to influence the abundance of detritivores, which play an essential role in supporting early season build-up of generalist natural enemies (Settle et al., 1996). It is these natural enemies that keep later successional species such as brown planthopper in check, unless disrupted through insecticide treatment (see above). The aim of this paper was to explore whether ecological concepts developed during the study of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and community assembly, could provide insights into the impact of agricultural intensification on pest control. Although what we present here is very much a first step in addressing this issue, we believe that making an explicit link between community response to management with potential functional implications of this response represents a valuable advance towards the ability to predict and perhaps mitigate pest emergence with agricultural intensification. Our mechanistic approach to considering the relationship between natural enemy community composition and pest control functioning reveals a number of testable predictions which appear consistent with patterns reported in the literature. We are confident that further generalizations can be made concerning the relationship between natural enemy community composition and pest control functioning. Our assembly framework for examining community response also provides us with certain testable predictions. However, it is clear that interactions and feedback between processes at different points along the assembly chain make generalizations difficult. This highlights a need for further research to identify traits that govern species' response to the major elements of agricultural intensification. In this, the assembly framework provides a heuristic model for structuring the research questions, which has received little attention in the agricultural context. Already, for example, it is apparent that dispersal constraints may be extremely important to the effects of management because, as well as determining the response to changes in landscape structure, they also govern the ability of species to recover from transient environmental pressures such as insecticide treatment or soil tillage. Moreover, one recent study showed that agri-environment schemes, which tend to focus on mitigating abiotic and biotic constraints at the local scale, were ineffective at protecting biodiversity because diversity was limited by dispersal constraints at a higher level (Kleijn et al., 2001). Perhaps with more studies and a greater appreciation of the mechanisms that underpin the assembly process, useful generalizations concerning species' response to particular agricultural practices will emerge and more effective management strategies (either pest management or biodiversity management for conservation) can be developed.

Then females turned their bodies 180° to position their ovipositors over the wounds and inserted them under the bark through the wounds. After an oviposition, a jelly was deposited while the ovipositor was still inserted. The females then withdrew their ovipositors and rubbed the oviposition scars with the tips of their abdomens. 3 When searching females encountered oviposition scars, they stopped walking and drummed the surface and inside of the oviposition scars with their maxillary and labial palpi. 4 Eighty‐six percent of females left oviposition scars containing single eggs after the palpation. By contrast, when females encountered oviposition scars containing no eggs, 76% of them began to gnaw at the scars and 64% deposited single eggs. The response to artificial oviposition scars was similar to that to vacant oviposition scars made by the females. 5 The results of various observations and experiments showed that the females could recognize oviposition scars and discriminate the scars occupied by single eggs from vacant ones, and suggested that the palpation of oviposition scars was the critical discrimination behaviour, indicating mediation by chemical cues.",

We evaluated the independent and interactive effects of atmospheric CO 2 and quaking aspen ( Populus tremuloides Michx.) genotype on chemical composition of foliage and performance of the whitemarked tussock moth ( Orgyia leucostigma J. E. Sm.). This research was conducted at the Aspen FACE (Free Air CO 2 Enrichment) site in northern Wisconsin, U.S.A. Leaf samples were collected periodically from each of three genetically variable aspen genotypes growing under ambient and elevated CO 2 , and analysed for levels of primary and secondary metabolites. Tussock moth larvae were reared in situ on experimental trees, and development times and pupal masses were recorded. Foliar chemical composition varied among aspen genotypes and in response to CO 2 enrichment. However, chemical responses of trees to elevated CO 2 were generally consistent across genotypes. Larval development times varied among host genotypes and increased slightly for insects on high‐CO 2 plants. Enriched CO 2 tended to reduce insect pupal masses, particularly for females on one of the three aspen genotypes. CO 2 × genotype interactions observed for plant chemistry and insect performance in this study with a small number of genotypes are probably too few, and too weak, to shift selection pressures in aspen populations. These results differ, however, from earlier work in which more substantial CO 2 × genotype interactions were observed for plant chemistry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko is inundatively released against the European corn borer in Switzerland. Because parasitoids dispersing from the release fields might pose a threat to native butterflies, the searching efficiency of T. brassicae was investigated in nontarget habitats. 2 In field studies, T. brassicae was released at rates of 120 000 females/ha. Parasitism of sentinel Ephestia kuehniella egg clusters was 1.6–3.6% in meadows and 2.0–4.0% in flower strips. The respective figures were 57.6–66.7% and 19.2–46.9% in maize, significantly higher than the parasitism rates in the nontarget habitats. Experiments carried out in small field cages confirmed these results: Again, significantly higher parasitism rates were found in maize compared to meadows and flower strips, and also compared to hedgerows (in sleeve cages). 3 To elucidate potential factors underlying the low searching efficiency in nontarget habitats, the behaviour of individual T. brassicae females was investigated on four meadow plants comparatively to maize and a filter paper control. Mean (±SE) walking speed on maize was 2.2 ± 0.2 mm/s, similar to three of the plants tested and filter paper but significantly higher than on Trifolium pratense (0.85 mm/s). A higher turning rate was found on T. pratense , Viola wittrockiana and Plantago lanceolata , in contrast to the longer leaved maize and Alopecurus pratensis . The number of wasps leaving the plant within the observation period differed significantly between plant species, and was twice as high for T. pratense (and the filter paper control) compared to the other plant species. 4 In a choice experiment carried out in a climate cabinet with all five host plant species in cages, we obtained the highest parasitism rates on maize and the lowest parasitism on T. pratense , thus confirming the behavioural observations. 5 In conclusion, there is evidence for a decreased searching efficiency on plants in nontarget habitats compared to maize. However, the data explain only part of the differences found between parasitism in maize compared to nontarget habitats. Other factors, such as the structural complexity of a habitat, may also play a role. We conclude that the risk for butterfly populations in the tested nontarget habitat due to mass released T. brassicae is low.",

These patterns were probably linked to variation in prey availability. 6 Despite the risk of experiencing food limitation in the annual crop, our analyses suggest that these beetles regularly move from ley into the early barley habitat and then continue to disperse within the barley, providing opportunities for enhanced biological control of pest species.",

The essential oil composition in leaves of several carrot varieties was studied in relation to oviposition acceptance by sucking insect herbivores that have different feeding strategies. Of the insect species studied, T. apicalis is a carrot specialist, T. anthrisci is an Apiaceae specialist, and L. rugulipennis is a generalist. The oil composition differed significantly between leaves from different carrot varieties (Flakkeer 2, Nantura, Parano, Napoli, Panther, Splendid, Nantes 3 Express). There were no differences in the mean numbers of eggs laid by T. apicalis or T. anthrisci on different varieties, but L. rugulipennis laid fewer eggs on the Panther variety than on Nantes 3 Express. There was a negative linear correlation between limonene concentration and number of eggs laid by T. apicalis , confirming that limonene is a repellent to the carrot psyllid. Results suggest that only particular compounds influence the preference of the carrot psyllid, and these compounds may not be the main components in the essential oil of carrots. A positive correlation was found between myrcene concentration and number of eggs laid by T. anthrisci . Essential oil composition did not explain egg‐laying preference of L. rugulipennis . The results indicate that essential oil composition of carrot varieties affects host preference of Apiaceae specialists more than that of generalists.",

However, little is known about the consequences of intraspecific competition on population quality during outbreaks, although it could have consequences on beetle population dynamics. 2 Ips typographus morphological variations among localities, years and beetle population levels were investigated in 10 Norway spruce ( Picea abies ) stands having various beetle damage intensities. Beetle size and shape estimators based on wing length, and using isometric size and log‐shape ratios, were employed. Field‐caught beetles were compared with beetles emerging from controlled breeding at different densities, performed in the laboratory. Beetles from this colony were also used to check the influence of breeding densities on the size estimator. 3 Size variations occurred among localities and years and were consistent with the epidemic or latent status of the beetle populations. Controlled breeding confirmed the negative effect of beetle densities encountered in the field on offspring size. Two hypotheses are formulated to explain this increase of intraspecific competition during an outbreak, but our data support the effect of host quality change between latent and epidemic populations. 4 Shape variations also occurred among localities but were unrelated to beetle population levels. No groups consistent with a geographical structure were found, suggesting low genetic variation for I. typographus populations in France.",

Leaf beetles preferred (i) to fly towards silhouettes; (ii) OWCs positioned 1.5 m above the ground compared with ones 0.5 m above the ground; (iii) OWCs orientated vertically compared with OWCs orientated horizontally; and (iv) reeds of a diameter of approximately 5 mm.

This compared the between‐plant distribution of aphid numbers, as opposed to the mean number of aphids per plant. 3 Results from field cage experiments showed that the effect of the resistances differed. Pyrethroid resistance resulted in lower mortality immediately after application of pyrethroids, whereas resistance to pirimicarb shortened the time over which the chemical was effective. 4 The results of laboratory bioassays suggested that these two resistances were not found together in N. ribisnigri . However, the results reported here contradict this assertion. 5 Experiments with insecticide residues showed that reproduction of resistant N. ribisnigri was greater than that of susceptible N. ribisnigri on plants with ageing insecticide residues, even in circumstances where mortality of resistant and susceptible clones of N. ribisnigri were similar. 6 If more than a few aphids are found on a plant then a whole consignment can be rejected for processing. The results reported here suggest that the effect of both insecticide resistances in N. ribsinigri will be to increase the proportion of lettuce heads with an unacceptable number of aphids on them, leading to increased rejection of plants for processing.",

The two specialist predators are part of a biological control program for A. tsugae , and the potential for competition among these species and previously established generalist predators in the field is unknown. 2 Adult predators were evaluated in branch cages during spring and summer at two field sites infested with A. tsugae . Using females only in 2003 and sexual pairs in 2004, predator survival and net reproduction were examined, as well as their feeding and impact on A. tsugae when present alone and in conspecific and heterospecific groupings. 3 Predator survival was not affected by the presence of additional predators. Total feeding was greater for all species when placed in predator groupings, suggesting that interactions do not significantly interfere with feeding activity. Net reproduction per predator was negatively affected by conspecifics, but unaffected by heterospecifics, indicating that direct or indirect intraspecific interference may occur. In spring, L. nigrinus showed the greatest impact on A. tsugae , and H. axyridis had the greatest impact during summer. 4 These results suggest that it would be beneficial to utilize multiple predator species combinations over single species when implementing biological control for A. tsugae . Low‐density releases are also recommended to reduce intraspecific interference.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 A 2‐year field study was conducted to generate data on seasonal abundance patterns of cotton aphids Aphis gossypii Glover and to develop a mechanistic model based on cumulative population size. The treatments consisted of three irrigation levels (Low, Medium and High) with 65%, 75% and 85% evapotranspiration replacement and three nitrogen fertility treatments (blanket‐rate‐N, variable‐rate‐N and no nitrogen). 2 A nonlinear regression equation, the analytical solution of a cumulative size mechanistic model, was fitted to each of the 27 individual data sets collected in 2003 and in 2004. The size and time of the peak, the cumulative aphid density, and the birth and death rates were estimated for each population, and each of these five variables was analyzed as a response variable in the analysis of variance. 3 For 2003 (a dry year), the Water (irrigation) main effect was found to be significant for the time of peak, the death rate and the cumulative density. The lower aphid death rate at low water levels might be due to the water stress in plants. 4 For 2004 (a year with moderate precipitation), the Nitrogen main effect was significant for both the birth and death rates. As nitrogen applications were increased, the decrease in both the aphid birth and death rates translates into a decrease in crowding and an increase in aphid survival. 5 The fact that treatment effects may be manifested through birth and death rate parameters in the new mechanistic model opens up new avenues for analyzing population size data of this kind.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 Sitobion avenae (F.) is a serious pest in Danish cereal crops. To understand the population genetic structure, aphids were sampled in seven different winter wheat ( Triticum sativum Lamarck) fields throughout Denmark. The aphids were genotyped with seven microsatellite markers. In total, 2075 aphids were collected and 1203 of these were genotyped. 2 The Danish S. avenae populations displayed very high genotypic diversity, high percentages of unique genotypes and low linkage disequilibria; this is likely to be a result of genetic recombination encompassed by their holocyclic lifestyle. The populations showed very limited differentiation and no sign of isolation by distance. Almost all the genetic variation was ascribed within the populations rather than between populations, probably due to a high migration rate at approximate 10% per generation. 3 Seasonal changes in clonal diversity and distribution of asexual summer generations of S. avenae within the infestation period in a single winter wheat field were followed over two consecutive years by weekly sampling from 60 plots each of 20 × 20 m. Clonal diversity was high in all samples with no dominant clonal lineages and no significant difference in the genotypic diversity between weeks or between years. However, a temporal genetic differentiation effect, throughout the infestation, suggests that selective factors or high temporal migration play an important role in shaping the genetic structure S. avenae . 4 Analyses of fungal infected and uninfected aphids were performed to test whether some clonal linage were more often infected by fungi from the Entomophthorales under field conditions. In total, 54 progeny from aphids with Entomophthorales were genotyped and compared with 422 uninfected aphid genotypes. The Entomophthorales‐infected aphid genotypes did not cluster out together, suggesting that these fungal pathogens did not affect the population differentiation or clonal distribution of S. avenae in a Danish agroecosystem. 5 Our findings indicate that S. avenae populations can be controlled using conservation biological control",

Canopy (i.e. emigrating) females had a lower incidence of infection, lower incidence of moderate–heavy infections, and had longer forewings and higher dry weights, than crown females. These results suggest that N. fumiferanae infections negatively affect aspects of female, but not male, flight performance. Regardless of infection, forewing length and dry weight of both canopy and crown females declined over the moth flight period, but infected females in both moth types were smaller than their uninfected counterparts. Forewing lengths and dry weights of moderately–heavily infected females were most severely affected. 4 Despite high annual infection rates in parents, only a small percentage of offspring (second‐instar larvae) that established feeding sites each spring were infected, indicating that high rates of horizontal transmission occurred annually throughout the larval period. 5 The present study indicates that whether N. fumiferanae infections are a debilitating sublethal factor in spruce budworm populations depends more on the disease load than on the overall incidence of infection. The potential importance of N. fumiferanae infections on various fitness parameters related to host dispersal is discussed.",

Early‐season sugar provisioning, when larvae of the pest were first hatching and parasitoid adults were newly emerged, did not affect the numbers of cereal leaf beetle larvae that matured in treated plots but increased parasitism rates of beetle larvae by four‐fold in 2006 and by seven‐fold in 2007.

General population models, encompassing a wide range of SIT types, were used to derive principles for optimizing the success of SIT, with particular emphasis on the application of partial sterility leading to inherited sterility in the F 1 population. 2 The models show that inherited sterility can only be guaranteed to be more effective than complete sterility if matings between irradiated‐lineage partners are unsuccessful. This is widely assumed but rarely examined experimentally. 3 The models allow the critical overflooding ratio, φ c , to be calculated for a particular target species, suggesting the release rate required to prevent population increase. Successful eradication using SIT alone should aim for a substantially higher release rate than suggested by φ c . 4 The models show that pest populations may continue to increase in the first few generations of SIT releases, regardless of release rate, as irradiated‐lineage individuals infiltrate the population. This does not necessarily imply that the SIT programme will be unsuccessful in the longer term. 5For pests with overlapping generations, the models suggest that frequent small releases may be more effective than less frequent large releases, particularly when the average release rate is close to the critical threshold for success.",

In some cases, the margin of the outbreak area is distinct, allowing comparisons of adjacent areas that may identify factors leading to such differences in abundance. The northern pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pinivora presently occurs at outbreak densities within a well‐defined area of approximately 3000 ha on the island of Gotland, south Sweden. We investigated whether cohorts of young larvae (first and second instar) had higher growth rate and survival inside or outside the outbreak area. 2 Group‐feeding appears to promote outbreaks in certain insect groups. Because T. pinivora larvae are highly social, we also compared larval performance between groups of different sizes inside and outside of the outbreak area: ‘small’ (33 eggs/group) and ‘normal’ (100 eggs/group). 3 Averaged over group size, whole colony mortality through the first two instars was two‐fold higher in the non‐outbreak area compared with the outbreak area. Mortality of individual larvae in the surviving colonies, however, did not differ between the two areas. There were only small differences in food quality (toughness, nitrogen content) between the areas, with no detectable effects on larval performance. 4 Larval relative growth rate did not differ between reduced and normal‐sized groups, which is surprising given that growth rate is known to increase with group size in other group‐feeding lepidopterans. 5 Reduced group size negatively affected larval survival, particularly in the outbreak area; by contrast, normal‐sized groups survived equally well in the two areas. Wood ants ( Formica spp.) were more common outside the outbreak area, and appeared to be the main cause of colony mortality at low larval density. A different result was observed with regard to per‐capita mortality, which was higher in the outbreak area. We speculate that this could have been due to solitary predators being locally specialized on T. pinivora in the high‐density area.",

Failure of at least some larvae to complete development on some Eucalyptus species indicates that gypsy moth larvae have a limited ability to process secondary metabolites in eucalypt leaves. 5 At least some individuals, however, appear to already possess biochemical mechanisms that process the secondary metabolites in leaves of Eucalyptus species, and therefore the abilities of larvae to complete development on phylogenetically and chemically unfamiliar hosts are already present before the gypsy moth encounters these potential hosts.",

We arranged the data from previous projects in a hierarchical system and conducted a study to identify the critical taxonomical levels that had the highest discriminative potential between sites (Europe and Argentina) or management types (forests, grasslands, fallows, succession, recultivation and agricultural sites). For the Gamasina community, geographical location was by far more important than the influence of any land use type. The analysis including only the European sites demonstrated that communities belonging to sites subjected to different land uses were also significantly different. The species data set provided a clearer separation of sites according to both the geographical and the land‐use gradients than the genus and family data sets. The genus and, to a lesser extent, the family approach may be sufficient to elucidate the influence of great geographical differences and also of certain land uses (e.g. grasslands from the forests and arable sites). Species presence/absence data provided valuable information in our analyses, although the use of quantitative data yielded a clearer separation of sites.",

The occurrence of two pathogens, Gregarina typographi and Chytridiopsis typographi , was determined throughout the period of beetle swarming activities. Weekly and annual data sets were then analysed by smoothing statistical techniques and epidemiological models. The pathogens spread differently within the beetle population with respect to their biological characteristics: infectious forms of C. typographi were immediately available after their development in the insect's gut, but not those of G. typographi . Both of the pathogens had a low prevalence in swarming beetles, especially C. typographi , and there was no evidence of a between‐year or within‐year epidemiological process. Conversely, it was shown that G. typographi has a positive effect on the rate of increase of trapped beetles. Fitting a nonlinear model to the data suggested that: (i) this was due to a higher catch ability of beetles infected with G. typographi than of healthy beetles; (ii) when this effect is taken into account, G. typographi induces a specific within‐year low mortality in beetle populations; and (iii) beetle populations increase naturally within a year, despite their infection by both pathogens. No clear effect of C. typographi was detected in the trapped data set when the prevalence of this species was high in beetle populations collected from trees. It is hypothesized that both pathogens induce different behavioural effects on their host, resulting in: (i) favouring the trapping of G. typographi ‐infected beetles and (ii) hindering the capture of C. typographi ‐infected individuals. This could be the result of both of the pathogens having an opposite effect on the flight abilities of beetles and/or on the beetles' response to the aggregation pheromones used in the traps.",

Elevated carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and ozone (O 3 ) may also influence phytochemistry and thereby alter the performance of insect herbivores such as the aspen leaf beetle Chrysomela crotchi Brown. The present study aimed to relate genetic‐ and atmospheric‐based variation in aspen phytochemistry to C. crotchi performance (larval development time, adult mass, survivorship). The experiment was conducted at the Aspen Free‐Air CO 2 Enrichment (FACE) site in northern Wisconsin. Beetles were reared on three aspen genotypes under elevated CO 2 and/or O 3 . Leaves were collected to determine chemical characteristics. The foliage exhibited significant variation in nitrogen, condensed tannins and phenolic glycosides among genotypes. CO 2 and O 3 , however, had little effect on phytochemistry. Nonetheless, elevated CO 2 decreased beetle performance on one aspen genotype and had inconsistent effects on beetles reared on two other genotypes. Elevated O 3 decreased beetle performance, especially for beetles reared on an O 3 ‐sensitive genotype. Regression analyses indicated that phenolic glycosides and nitrogen explain a substantial amount (27–45%) of the variation in herbivore performance. By contrast to the negative effects that are typically observed with generalist herbivores, aspen leaf beetles appear to benefit from phenolic glycosides, chemical components that are largely genetically‐determined in aspen. The results obtained in the present study indicate that host genetic variation and atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases will be important factors in the performance of specialist herbivores, such as C. crotchi , in future climates.",

In particular, insect development rates may differ from field populations, making it more difficult to target control measures. The present study investigated how protected environments affected adult vine weevil ( Otiorhynchus sulcatus ) feeding and reproduction on red raspberry ( Rubus idaeus ). We focused on the period between adult emergence and the onset of oviposition (i.e. the pre‐reproductive period), which represents the optimal period for control. Tunnels were up to 4 °C warmer than field plantations in 2008, with plants growing significantly faster (50% increase in height and 16% increase in leaf area) than field grown plants. The carbon/nitrogen ratio in leaves was higher in tunnels (12.07) than the field (10.89) as a result of a significant decrease in nitrogen concentrations (3.40 and 3.90 mg g −1 , respectively). Over 4 weeks, weevils consumed significantly more foliage in tunnels (370.89 mg) than weevils in the field (166.68 mg), suggesting compensatory feeding to counteract lower leaf nitrogen concentrations. Weevils in tunnels achieved sexual maturity 8 days earlier than those in the field and produced 20‐fold more eggs by the time they were 5 weeks old. Applying a degree‐day model showed good agreement between predicted and observed pre‐reproductive periods for weevils in tunnels (36 and 30 days, respectively) and in field plots (41 and 38 days, respectively).",

Identifying these relationships for a forest pest can add to population dynamics modelling. Agrilus planipennis is a pest of N orth A merican Fraxinus species. The relationship between A. planipennis body size and latitude was investigated through field trapping adult A. planipennis in eastern U . S .A., and the relationship between body size and fecundity was investigated through egg production of laboratory‐reared A. planipennis adults. Accumulated growing degree days base 10 °C ( GDD 10 ) were calculated and used to identify the influence of local climate on A. planipennis body size. Adult female A. planipennis body size (length and mass) was negatively related to latitude, with larger individuals at southerly sites where the number of days to accumulate 450 and 1000 GDD 10 was the lowest. Using positive linear models relating body size and eggs produced, females from southerly sites would potentially produce twice as many eggs as females from northerly sites. Agrilus planipennis population latitudes influenced female body size. Because larger A. planipennis females produced more eggs, there is a potential for populations at southerly sites to increase in density and geography more rapidly than northerly populations.",

    "abstract": "Diachasmimorpha krausii is a braconid parasitoid of larval tephritid fruit flies, which feed cryptically within host fruit. At the ovipositor probing stage, the wasp cannot discriminate between hosts that are physiologically suitable or unsuitable for offspring development and must use other cues to locate suitable hosts. To identify the cues used by the parasitoid to find suitable hosts, we offered, to free flying wasps, different combinations of three fruit fly species ( Bactrocera tryoni , Bactrocera cacuminata, Bactrocera cucumis ), different life stages of those flies (adults and larvae) and different host plants ( Solanum lycopersicon , Solanum mauritianum, Cucurbita pepo) . In the laboratory, the wasp will readily oviposit into larvae of all three flies but successfully develops only in B. tryoni . Bactrocera tryoni commonly infests S. lycopersicon (tomato), rarely S. mauritianum (wild tobacco) but never C. pepo (zucchini). The latter two plant species are common hosts for B. cacuminata and B. cucumis , respectively. The parasitoid showed little or no response to uninfested plants of any of the test species. The presence of adult B. tryoni , however, increased parasitoid residency time on uninfested tomato. When the three fruit types were all infested with larvae, parasitoid response was strongest to tomato, regardless of whether the larvae were physiologically suitable or unsuitable for offspring development. By contrast, zucchini was rarely visited by the wasp, even when infested with B. tryoni larvae. Wild tobacco was infrequently visited when infested with B. cacuminata larvae but was more frequently visited, with greater parasitoid residency time and probing, when adult flies (either B. cacuminata or B. tryoni ) were also present. We conclude that herbivore‐induced, nonspecific host fruit wound volatiles were the major cue used by foraging D. krausii . Although positive orientation to infested host plants is well known from previous studies on opiine braconids, the failure of the wasp to orientate to some plants even when infested with physiologically suitable larvae, and the secondary role played by adult fruit flies in wasp host searching, are newly‐identified mechanisms that may aid parasitoid host location in environments where both physiologically suitable and unsuitable hosts occur.",

Zeyh. over a 10‐year period from 2002 to 2012. Cameraria ohridella damaged up to 75% of the total leaf area of A. hippocastanum , but it had no influence on stem radial growth or general tree condition. Aesculus carnea was rarely attacked and only when growing close to heavily infested A. hippocastanum . BCD , in contrast, was responsible for the death or removal of 11% of A. hippocastanum and 27% of A. carnea , and surviving trees showed a decrease in growth rate and decline in crown density. Cameraria ohridella was more abundant on larger A. hippocastanum , whereas BCD was more prevalent amongst young, fast‐growing A. hippocastanum , which resulted in a partial separation of the moth and disease between trees and habitats, as well as in the wider environment. Trees with higher rates of leaf miner damage generally had a lower incidence of BCD and there was no evidence that C. ohridella either facilitated the spread of the disease or accentuated its impact.",

    "abstract": "Bark beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) are commonly recognized as important tree mortality agents in coniferous forests of the western U.S.A. High stand density is consistently associated with bark beetle infestations in western coniferous forests, and therefore thinning has long been advocated as a preventive measure to alleviate or reduce the amount of bark beetle‐caused tree mortality. The present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of thinning to reduce stand susceptibility to bark beetle infestations over a 10‐year period in Pinus jeffreyi forests on the Tahoe National Forest, California, U.S.A. Four treatments were replicated three times within 1‐ha square experimental plots. Treatments included thinning from below (i.e. initiating in the smallest diameter classes) to a residual target basal area (cross‐sectional area of trees at 1.37 m in height) of: (i) 18.4 m 2 /ha (low density thin); (ii) 27.6 m 2 /ha (medium density thin); (iii) 41.3 m 2 /ha (high density thin); and (iv) no stand manipulation (untreated control). Throughout the present study, 107 trees died as a result of bark beetle attacks. Of these, 71% (75 trees) were Abies concolor killed by Scolytus ventralis ; 20.6% (22 trees) were Pinus ponderosa killed by Dendroctonus ponderosae ; 4.7% (five trees) were P . jeffreyi killed by Dendroctonus jeffreyi ; 1.8% (two trees) were P . jeffreyi killed by Ips pini ; 0.9% (one tree) were P . jeffreyi killed by Orthotomicus (= Ips ) latidens ; 0.9% (one tree) were P . ponderosa killed by both Dendroctonus brevicomis and D . ponderosae ; and 0.9% (one tree) were P . jeffreyi killed by unknown causes. In the low density thin, no pines were killed by bark beetles during the 10‐year period. Significantly fewer trees (per ha/year) were killed in the low density thin than the high density thin or untreated control. No significant treatment effect was observed for the percentage of trees (per year) killed by bark beetles.",

Flight interception traps are commonly employed to monitor beetle assemblages, although little explicit knowledge of the efficiency of this trapping method is available. The present study investigated how slight changes in sampling effort can influence species richness and species composition of assemblages in data sets from standard window‐flight traps. At both trap and plot levels, an additional year or an additional trap provided a 50% increase in the number of species detected (a 75% increase for rare species) and resulted in a different estimated composition of the assemblages. Adding 2 or 3 years of sampling gave twice as many species and resulted in assemblages that were 50% dissimilar. Increases in the detection of species and the dissimilarity of assemblages were similarly affected along a gradient of forest conditions, suggesting that changes in sampling effort were not affected by forest condition. At the forest level, year or trap replication provided smaller increases in species richness (31% and 25%, respectively). Within sites, distance measures in species composition between traps did not differ significantly when based on 1 or 2 years of data. Using two traps per plot compared with one trap influenced comparisons between stand types, based on species richness, in 25% of the cases. Species detection was similarly increased by either year replication or trap replication. The results of the present study highlight the significant role played by finescale patterns of habitat structure and inter‐annual variation with respect to determining catch size and assemblages of saproxylic species.",

This occurred even though the debarked area of protected seedlings 5 weeks after the shields had been removed was similar to that of the unprotected seedlings. This indicates that initial protection rendered the seedlings more tolerant to later wounding by pine weevil. 5 Planting in soil inversion significantly reduced feeding compared with planting in humus. 6 We conclude that nutrient-loading of seedlings in the autumn before planting would not increase pine weevil feeding after planting. Mortality could be reduced by treatments that postpone the start of pine weevil feeding on seedlings. Such treatments, combined with planting in soil inversion, would result in increased seedling growth, vitality and tolerance to pine weevil attack.",

The highest prevalence of N. fumiferanae infection in post‐hibernation second‐instar larvae occurred in the plot where prevalence in female pupae was the highest in the previous generation, suggesting higher rates of vertical transmission. There was little change in the prevalence of N. fumiferanae infections between the second and sixth instars in the later generations. In the two other plots, N. fumiferanae prevalence increased by approximately 25% from the second to sixth larval stadia. Coincident with the changes in N. fumiferanae prevalence were substantial declines in the populations of spruce budworms, making it difficult to determine rates of horizontal transfer of the disease. In all plots and in all years, there were progressive increases in the intensity of N. fumiferanae infections (spore loads/individual) from the second to sixth instars and pupae. Annual spruce budworm mortality associated with N. fumiferanae was ≤15% of all mortality in reared specimens and was positively correlated with but generally less than 30% of annual N. fumiferanae prevalence.",

    "abstract": "Grass buffer strips have been widely sown to mitigate against intensive agricultural management practices that have negatively impacted on invertebrate and plant biodiversity in arable farming systems. Typically, such strips are floristically species poor and are dominated by grasses. In the present study, we developed management practices to enhance the floristic and structural diversity of these existing strips for the benefit of spiders, a key provider of natural pest control in crops. Across three UK arable farms, we investigated the benefits of: (i) scarification to create germination niches into which wildflower seeds were sown and (ii) the effect of graminicide applications to suppress grass dominance. Spiders were sampled twice per year (July and September) during 2008 and 2009. The combination of scarification with wildflower seeds, as well as graminicide, resulted in the greatest wildflower cover and lowest grass cover, with a general trend of increased abundance of adult and juvenile spiders. The abundance of Pachygnatha degeeri , Bathyphantes gracilis and juvenile wolf spiders of the genus Pardosa was positively correlated with wildflower cover, probably reflecting increased prey availability. Sward structure was negatively correlated with Erigone atra , Oedothorax fuscus and juvenile Pardosa abundance. Management that utilizes existing commonly adopted agri‐environment options, such as grass buffer strips, represents a potentially important conservation tool for increasing the quantity and quality of invertebrate habitats. This can maximize opportunities for the provision of multiple ecosystem services, including pest regulation by predators such as spiders. These management practices have the potential to be incorporated into existing U.K. and European agri‐environment schemes.",

    "abstract": "Two experiments were performed to determine the extent to which ash species (black, green and white) and larval developmental stage (second, third and fourth instar) affect the efficiency of phloem amino acid utilization by emerald ash borer (EAB) Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire (Coleoptera: Buprestidae) larvae. EAB larvae generally utilized green ash amino acids more efficiently than those of the other two species. For example, the concentrations of only six (two essential) and seven (two essential) amino acids were lower in frass from EAB that fed upon black and white ash than in the corresponding phloem, respectively. By contrast, concentrations of 16 (eight essential) amino acids were lower in the frass from EAB that fed upon green ash than in the phloem. In addition, in green ash, the frass : phloem ratios of 13 amino acids were lower than their counterparts in black and white ash. The concentrations of non‐essential amino acids glycine and hydroxylproline were greater in frass than in phloem when EAB fed on black ash, although not when EAB fed on green or white ash. The concentration of total phenolics (a group of putative defensive compounds to EAB, expressed as antioxidant activity of acetone extraction) was high in EAB frass but even higher in the phloem samples when the data were pooled across ash species and EAB larval stages. This suggests EAB larvae may eliminate phenolics through a combination of direct excretion and enzymatic conversion of phenolics to nonphenolics before excretion. Because the ratio of frass total phenolics to phloem total phenolics in white ash was lower than the ratios in black and green ash, the ability to destroy phenolics or convert them to nonphenolics was greater when EAB larvae fed on white ash. Fourth‐instar EAB extracted phloem amino acids, including threonine, more efficiently than third‐instar EAB. The different larval developmental stages of EAB did not differ in their apparent ability to destroy phenolics or convert them to nonphenolics.",

Orius spp. were unresponsive to shifts in habitat composition despite being present in maize and associated habitats; however, they were positively related to edge density. Larger‐scale variation in Orius spp. abundance was best explained by changes in Z. scutellaris abundance in maize. Leafhopper colonization is responsible for the recruitment of Orius spp. in maize. Orius spp. conservation in intensive agricultural landscapes might require permanent field margins and complementary crops (e.g. alfalfa) that ensure resource continuity in time.",

The activity density and nutritional state of Poecilus cupreus decreased after harvest, comprising a period related to a decrease of resource availability and the end of life cycle. We detected a tendency of movement from OSR to the adjacent habitat after harvest for Amara similata , although this was not as strong as expected. The presence of grassy field margins influenced the spatio‐temporal dynamics of Pseudoophonus rufipes and A. similata , suggesting that spillover processes exist for these two species but not for P. cupreus .

The present study related wing and body morphology of female mountain pine beetles ( Dendroctonus ponderosae ) to flight distance, as measured by flight mill bioassays. Beetles that flew long distances (&gt; 11 km) had a greater body weight and larger wings than beetles that flew short distances (&lt; 1 km). These heavier female beetles should also be more capable pioneers because other studies have shown that body weight is positively correlated with lipid content. Wing and body morphology of females are significant predictors of flight distance; heavy beetles with large wings generally flew further than smaller beetles, although this relationship is heteroscedastic. Dispersion of flight distance values increases with wing loading (weight/wing area) as a result of a cohort of ‘lazy’ individuals that fly short distances (&lt; 1 km) regardless of flight phenotype. The observed morphology explained less than 20% of the variation in flight capacity, indicating a substantial contribution from other intrinsic factors that remain to be investigated. The present study may have implications for dispersal modelling, providing estimates of flight capacity using morphological measurements.",

The European corn borer (ECB) is a major insect pest of corn in North America. Its speed of development could potentially accelerate under a warmer climate, leading to an earlier development of the first generation and an increase in the number of generations per year. The main objective of this study was to assess the potential impacts of climate change on ECB management for the future period 2041–2070 in Quebec, Canada, using bioclimatic modelling and climate analogues. First flight of ECB moths could occur about 15 days earlier in the season in 2041–2070 compared to the reference period 1970–1999. The window for insecticide interventions may be reduced under climate change by 15.6% to 27.8% for univoltine ECB and by 13.8% to 52.7% for bivoltine ECB. Climate change could promote the development of an additional generation in the southern region for both races, considering temperature increases and factors inducing the overwintering diapause. ECB management could become more costly both economically and environmentally under the future climate, and it should be revised according to the results of this study.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wild apple Malus sieversii (Ledeb.) M. Roem. (Rosales: Rosaceae), the ancestor of cultivated apples, is widely distributed in Central Asia and is recognized as an important germplasm bank. Recently, the invasive pest Agrilus mali Matsumura (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), originally distributed in eastern Asia, has damaged endemic apple forests in the Yili River valley, Xinjiang, China, and has spread rapidly, infesting more than 80% of wild apple trees in this region. We investigated the life‐history traits and native natural enemies in the recently invaded range during 2016 and 2017. Agrilus mali has a univoltine life cycle and overwinters as young larvae in galleries in the cambium. Adults emerged from early June to mid‐August and their density peaked in mid‐July. Several native natural enemies were identified from Agrilus mali larvae, including Atanycolus denigrator (L.) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae), the mite Pyemotes moseri Yu et Liang (Acari: Pyemotidae) and fungal entomopathogens. Combined, these natural enemies were responsible for mortality rates ranging from 20% to 80% during the summer and autumn. The most abundant and important natural enemy was A. denigrator , which was responsible for up to 15% mortality of A. mali . The results of the present study suggest that augmentation and conservation of A. denigrator and P. moseri should be considered with respect to biological control against this devastating pest.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Migratory insect pests pose a substantial challenge to global food security. These issues are particularly acute when pest incursions occur considerably beyond the expected range, through natural migration or human‐aided transport, because the lack of species‐specific control strategies and a potential absence of species‐specific natural enemies in the newly‐invaded area may lead to rapid establishment of a new pest. One such threat is posed by the Oriental migratory locust Locusta migratoria manilensis in China, which, historically, has been restricted to eastern China from the Bohai Gulf southwards, and now threatens to expand its range into the agriculturally important region of northeast China. We analyzed data from a recent outbreak of migratory locusts in Heilongjiang Province (extreme northeast China), &gt; 700 km north of its current known range, and identified the source region, timing of arrival and probable migratory routes of this incursion. We further show that warming temperatures in this region will likely allow subsequent invasions to establish permanent populations in northeast China, and thus authorities in this important crop‐producing region of East Asia should be vigilant to the threat posed by this species.",

    "abstract": "Abstract During host‐breadth expansion, phytophagous insects incur risk from potentially deleterious novel host environments at the same time as potentially securing a potential escape in space or time from competing species. Bark beetles reproduce under the bark of stems and branches of mature, stressed or moribund trees, and may suffer high mortality from plant defences and inter‐ and intraspecific competition. An epidemic of mountain pine beetle ( Dendroctonus ponderosae H opkins) in western C anada has extended to over 18.1 million hectares of lodgepole pine ( Pinus contorta D ouglas ex. L oudon) forests. In some areas, mountain pine beetles have been found to reproduce within interior hybrid spruces [ Picea glauca ( M oench) Voss × engelmannii P arry ex. E ngelmann], a normally rare occurrence. Using mountain pine beetles reared from naturally‐infested interior hybrid spruce and lodgepole pine hosts, we examined the effect of female natal species and colonized host species on the ability to attract mates and reproduce within spruce and pine logs deployed as a choice assay in a field setting. Additionally, we examined whether the arrival and reproduction of competitors such as pine engravers ( Ips spp.) was associated with reduced brood production. Females reared from pine and spruce exhibited similar reproductive potentials. Recruitment and establishment of ovipositional galleries, larval galleries and pupal chambers were similar in the typical and novel hosts. Reproduction by mountain pine beetles in spruce, although successful, was significantly lower than in pine. This reduction occurred despite spruce logs being almost entirely free of competing secondary beetles.",

We hypothesize that colonization by this plant‐associated microbe impacts survival and invasiveness of the gallmaker and, using K och's postulates, we evaluate its effects on the gallmaker and on the gallmaker's primary natural enemy. Morphologically identical colonies were isolated from galls and insects, and DNA sequences matched with the fungal genus Colletotrichum , a causal agent of plant‐pathogenic anthracnose. Inoculations generated comparable symptoms. After the formation of superficial lesions, the pathogen rapidly penetrates galls, colonizing insect tissue in gall chambers and causing extensive larval mortality. Minimal effects were evident on the associated parasitoid Torymus sinensis K amijo ( H ymenoptera: T orymidae). We report a plant pathogen utilizing a gall‐inducing arthropod at the same time as sparing its parasite and expand reports of Colletotrichum impacting insects.

    "abstract": "Abstract Plant resistance strongly depends on plant characteristics that affect herbivore preference or performance. Different plant genotypes may express specific characteristics that lead to differential resistance to herbivores. Few studies have investigated these aspects for weevils, a particularly speciose taxon of insect herbivores, on fruit tree cultivars, which are vegetatively propagated. We studied the influence of apple cultivar on preference and performance of a fruit tree herbivore, the flower‐feeding apple blossom weevil Anthonomus pomorum ( C oleoptera: C urculionidae). We quantified field infestation of five different apple genotypes by the weevil at different collection dates as measure of preference, as well as the mass and emergence time of weevils developing on these cultivars as measures of performance. Infestation of apple flower buds by A. pomorum differed significantly between cultivars. The collection date affected the number of infested flowers in a cultivar‐specific way. Weevil mass differed significantly between apple cultivars. The average mass of weevils from A riwa, the cultivar producing the heaviest weevils, was 40% higher than the mass of weevils from R ewena, the cultivar producing the lightest weevils. Weevil emergence time from infested flowers differed significantly between cultivars. Weevils emerged earliest from cultivars A riwa and R etina, at an intermediate time from D iscovery and F lorina, and latest from R ewena. The present study demonstrates that preference and performance of florivores feeding on fruit trees can strongly differ between apple cultivars representing specific tree genotypes. These differences may directly and indirectly affect herbivore and antagonist populations and can be considered for pest management.",

We surveyed leafminer abundance and collected mined leaves to estimate parasitism and parasitoid species richness. Leafminer abundance was not influenced by either type of diversity. Similarly, there were no effects of genotypic diversity or species diversity on parasitism or parasitoid species richness. Plant diversity effects on parasitoids were probably absent because the species attacking P. meliacella are dietary generalists that likely recruited to multiple host species (in addition to P. meliacella) and their responses to diversity could have cancelled each other out. Future work should explicitly investigate how predator and parasitoid traits mediate the effects of plant diversity on tritrophic interactions.",

The time elapsed from girdling to the first attack of bark‐ and wood‐boring beetles was 1–19 months (mean = 10.7) and differed significantly among trees girdled on different dates. The part of the tree and the date and wave (rank) of colonization were the most significant factors that explained a considerable portion of the variability in the occurrence of bark‐ and wood‐boring beetles. The species composition changed dramatically from the tree base to its top and branches. The colonization of trees was initiated most frequently in the upper thin‐barked part of the trunk and in thick branches. In total, 32 species of bark‐ and wood‐boring beetles colonized the studied trees. Particular species were significantly associated with certain periods of tree dieback and colonization (colonization waves). Phaenops cyanea ( F .) and Pissodes piniphilus ( H bst.) were by far the most aggressive first‐colonizing species. Pityogenes chalcographus ( L .), Ips acuminatus ( G yll.) and Tomicus minor ( H tg.) were shown to be moderate‐aggressive species, followed by Tomicus piniperda ( L .), Monochamus galloprovincialis ( G erm.) and Pissodes pini ( L .).

There can be considerable variation in predation levels within and between sites, and among different times of year; therefore, understanding what causes these differences is necessary for effectively predicting EAB population dynamics. We examined the temporal dynamics of woodpecker predation on EAB in Michigan and Maryland, as well as how they were affected by season, region, resource availability, tree size and crown condition. In Michigan, we quantified predation in association with EAB developmental stages on different trees over 2 years, whereas, in Maryland, we recorded woodpecker attacks on the same trees for 1 year. Season was a significant predictor of woodpecker predation, with most occurring in winter when late‐instar larvae were abundant. Predation also was affected by crown condition and tree size. Additionally, predation levels were similar throughout the year in a region where generations are considered to be less synchronized, representing a more consistent resource for woodpeckers. The present study highlights the various factors affecting woodpecker predation over time. The results demonstrate the importance of multi‐season studies of interactions between invasive species and native natural enemies when aiming to fully understand their dynamics.",

The flight activity of male moths was detected and monitored using traps baited with sex pheromone. The study aimed to determine the population dynamics of noctuid pests in sugar beet crops and to propose damage forecasts and thresholds based on male moths capture in pheromone traps in specific weather conditions. A strong positive correlation between captured male moths in pheromone traps and the level of damage to sugar beet crops was established. The population densities were extremely affected by the weather conditions that prevailed in the sugar beet growing period. If the weather conditions are not optimal, the population of the second generation of moths and larvae will be smaller, and the level of damage to plants will decrease accordingly. Thus, intensive monitoring of noctuid male moth flights and weather conditions in the sugar beet growing season enabled forecasting of future damage to a larger area, although visual inspections are necessary to plan insecticide applications.",

To assess and counteract the effect of periodic intensive forestry interventions, such as clear‐cutting and reforestation, it is important to adequately quantify the recovery rate and composition of the native biota. We aimed to characterize the above parameters for ant assemblages in forests with different structure and age. Epigeic ant assemblages were studied using pitfall traps in young (6–10 years old), middle‐aged (23–26 years old) and mature (35–37 years old) poplar forest plantations in the Kiskunság region of Hungary. Species richness of ant assemblages and the abundance of nonforest ants did not differ among the age classes. The abundance of forest specialist ants was, however, higher in middle‐aged and mature stands compared with young plantations. The assemblage composition of ants significantly correlated with habitat structure and forest age. We conclude that nonforest ant species can persist throughout the entire forestry cycle in poplar plantations with moderate tree density. The present study suggests that forest age and habitat structure together shape the ant assemblages of lowland poplar plantations.",

Using several pine forests throughout Ontario, we examined the relationships between parasitism and S. noctilio activity, as well as S. noctilio activity and the availability of susceptible and suitable pine. We also evaluated parasitism at two points in time (5–7 years apart). We found correlative evidence indicating that the availability of suitable hosts limited the S. noctilio population in Ontario. Sirex noctilio killed more pine when more pine was available, especially suppressed (highly suitable) pine. More co‐dominant (healthy) pines were attacked but not killed by S. noctilio at sites with more S. noctilio activity, indicating that higher densities of S. noctilio were needed to overwhelm healthy pines. The role of parasitoids was less clear. Parasitism did not vary consistently with the amount of S. noctilio activity at sites.

Hemlock ( Tsuga canadensis ) infestation by hemlock woolly adelgid (HWA; Adelges tsugae ) results in the accumulation of the defensive hormone salicylic acid. We explored the potential for HWA infestation to interfere with anti‐folivore‐induced defence signalling and its implications for a native folivore (hemlock looper; Lambdina fiscellaria ). Hemlocks were infested with HWA and/or sprayed with methyl jasmonate; foliar defences were analyzed and foliage quality for looper larvae was assessed. Both treatments activated foliar defensive traits, including a HWA‐mediated increase in peroxidase activity and an accumulation of cell wall‐bound phenolics and lignin, as well as a methyl jasmonate‐mediated increase in lipoxygenase activity. The two treatments had an additive effect on other defensive traits and both treatments negatively affected looper performance. These results suggest that salicylic acid and jasmonic acid are not strictly antagonistic in conifers and that both have a role in anti‐folivore defence signalling. The present study illustrates the need for a better understanding of hormone signalling, cross‐talk and induced responses in conifers.",

Although it is widely known that the relationship between temperature and insect development rate is nonlinear, model‐based studies have been conducted to investigate the global warming impacts on insect voltinism using the degree‐day approach based on a linear model. In the present study, the wheat armyworm Mythimna sequax (Franclemont) was used as a model organism to test whether voltinism estimated under current and future climate conditions varied among phenological models, locations and climate change scenarios. In general, voltinism increased in different years and climate change scenarios compared with current climatic conditions. The degree‐day overestimated the number of generations compared with the nonlinear models and also predicted an increase in voltinism in the entire study area as a result of global warming. Location, phenological model and the interaction between these factors explained 94% of the variance in the estimated voltinism. The results obtained in the present study reveal that the choice of phenological models affects voltinism predictions and that a nonlinear model can be used to understand the effects of climate change on insect voltinism, especially in regions where temperature will reach the upper threshold of a species more often.",

Potted coriander plants under field conditions were used to test: (i) the contribution of insect pollination (open versus bagged umbels) to coriander seed production and (ii) the contribution of floral margins (mixed or monospecific) to pollinator visitation to coriander. Although coriander showed the capacity to self-pollinate, bagged umbels (no insect pollination) produced significantly less seeds than open-pollinated coriander umbels. In the vicinity of floral margins (mixed or monospecific), coriander plants were more frequently visited by pollinators than control plants (no margins), which consequently improved seed production and quality (seed weight and germination rate). Finally, the present study showed that the presence of both mixed and monospecific margins can improve the production of coriander seeds by more than 220% and, in addition, conserve local pollinators within agro-ecosystems.",

The present study investigated whether genotypic diversity in Capsicum chinense peppers influenced attack by leaf‐mining fly larvae ( Lyriomyza trifolii ) and fruit‐eating weevils ( Anthonomus eugenii ), as well as parasitoid attack associated with weevils. We established genotypic monocultures ( n = 10, two plots/each of five inbred lines) and polycultures ( n = 5, random mixtures of three out of the five lines) and conducted weekly surveys of fruit number, leafmines and weevil fruit attack over a 5‐month period. In addition, we collected fruits to rear weevils and estimated parasitism associated with this herbivore. There was a tendency for a negative effect of diversity on leafminer attack, with polycultures exhibiting a 24% reduction in leafminer attack relative to monocultures. By contrast, diversity did not influence weevil fruit attack or the level of parasitism associated with the weevil. Our findings show that plant genotypic diversity effects vary among herbivore species, presumably as a result of differences in herbivore traits (e.g. diet breadth, mobility). We also emphasize that manipulating plant genotypic diversity can be an important consideration for pest management in this commercially important crop.",

Little is known about activity‐density and assemblage composition of carabid beetles within sown wildflower areas ( SWA ) compared with conventional grassy field margins and adjoining arable fields. In 10 landscapes, two pairs of winter wheat fields with adjoining SWA and grassy field margin were studied. We compared activity‐density, species richness, ecological traits and assemblage composition of carabids among 20 winter wheat fields, 10 adjoining grassy field margins and 10 adjoining SWA . Beetle activity‐density was higher in wheat fields compared with adjoining semi‐natural habitats regarding total carabids, macropterous, polyphagous‐carnivorous and euryoecious open habitat beetles. Although total species richness (analysis of variance) did not significantly differ among habitat types, we found significantly higher species numbers in SWA than in wheat fields adjoining SWA and grassy margins when the number of recorded species was standardized to the number of individuals (rarefaction). Carabid assemblages in wheat fields differed from assemblages in adjoining SWA and grassy margins. The results of the present study emphasize the important contribution of semi‐natural habitats to diversify the spring carabid fauna in agroecosystems. In particular, SWA were shown to be useful to enhance carabid biodiversity conservation in agroecosystems, rather than to enhance their density‐dependent functions.",

A popular strategy for enhancing insect diversity in intensively cultivated habitats involves maintaining plant diversity in field margins by means of sown grass and wildflower strips. Despite extensive cultivation of maize/corn (approximately 3.1 million ha) in the grassy biomes of South Africa, little effort has been made to understand whether plant groups maintain insect biodiversity within these agro-ecosystems. The diversity relationships between three prominent guilds of arthropods (herbivores, parasitoids and predators) and three large plant families (Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae) are described at regional scale across the Grassland and Savanna Biomes of South Africa. The results obtained indicate general positive relationships between plant and arthropod diversity of the lower vegetation layers (≤2 m). An increased abundance of members of the grass family (Poaceae) led to significantly higher invertebrate numbers in maize fields and adjacent vegetation. This suggests that grasses play a significant role in supporting arthropod diversity within these agro-ecosystems. When considering farm design in maize-agro-ecosystems, our results indicate that maintaining grassy natural vegetation patches adjacent to actively cultivated maize fields may be sufficient to maintain and conserve arthropod diversity within agricultural landscapes.",

The ET for profitable production (∼3 nests/ha) would not be operatively applicable in a long‐term management program in our study site. This methodology could be extrapolated to other Neotropical forest plantations attacked by Acromyrmex species.",

Automatic detection of such insects is crucial to the future of crop protection by providing critical information to assess the risk to a crop and the need for preventative measures. We describe an experimental set‐up designed to derive audio recordings from a range of weak‐flying aphids and beetles using an LED array. A rigorous data processing pipeline was developed to extract meaningful features, linked to morphological characteristics, from the audio and harmonic series for six aphid and two beetle species. An ensemble of over 50 bioacoustic parameters was used to achieve species discrimination with a success rate of 80%. The inclusion of the dominant and fundamental frequencies improved prediction between beetles and aphids because of large differences in wingbeat frequencies. At the species level, error rates were minimized when harmonic features were supplemented by features indicative of differences in species' flight energies.",

Predatory arthropods were collected in the field in four urban parks using the tree‐beating technique. A real‐time PCR workflow was applied to detect H. halys DNA from the gut content of predators.

Vane traps and pan traps required a similar number of samples to detect a change in the abundance and richness of bees; however, vane traps caught four times more bees and 97% of genera compared to pan traps. Vane traps required far fewer samples to detect changes in the abundance and richness of bumble bees compared to target netting.

Domestic livestock is a major disturbance affecting flowering plant abundance at the bottom of insect food webs with unpredicted consequences on ecosystem functioning. This work evaluated livestock effect on flower‐associated insect functional groups (i.e., predators, herbivores and pollinators) hypothesizing that plant damage produced by grazing exerts bottom up effects on insect populations, affecting their interactions. On contrary, livestock might supply food resources for several dipteran pests (e.g., scavengers, parasites or bloodsucking) or benefit predator species by increasing habitat transparency with grazing. Seven independent rangelands within the same arid environment and increasing livestock density, were used to test these hypotheses using a regression approach. Insect, herbivore and pollinator diversity decreased with increasing livestock density, and increased with increasing vegetation. Bare soil affected solitary bees (but not all the pollinators) and habitat transparency benefited predators, as expected. Dipteran pests quadratically decreased with increasing livestock density, rejecting the hypothesis of food supply. Apparently, predators reduced the abundance of almost all insect groups. Grazing reduce vegetation positively affecting predators, which negatively affect other insect groups (top‐down), potentially altering species complex interactions and ecosystem functioning. Resumen Las perturbaciones afectan a la diversidad vegetal con consecuencias en otros niveles tróficos, como las comunidades de insectos asociadas. El ganado doméstico es una perturbación importante que afecta la abundancia de plantas con flores, siendo la base de las redes tróficas de insectos, con consecuencias impredecibles en el funcionamiento del ecosistema. Este trabajo evaluó el efecto del ganado sobre grupos funcionales de insectos asociados a las flores (es decir, depredadores, herbívoros y polinizadores) con la hipótesis de que el daño producido por el pastoreo a las plantas ejerce efectos de abajo hacia arriba sobre las poblaciones de insectos, afectando sus interacciones. Por el contrario, el ganado podría estar suministrando recursos alimenticios para varias plagas de dípteros (por ejemplo, carroñeros, parásitos o hematófagos) o estar beneficiando a especies depredadoras al aumentar la transparencia del hábitat con el pastoreo. Se utilizaron siete campos independientes con creciente densidad de ganado dentro del mismo ambiente árido para probar las hipótesis, utilizando un enfoque de regresión. La diversidad de insectos, herbívoros y polinizadores disminuyó con el aumento de la densidad ganadera, y aumentó con el aumento de la vegetación. El suelo desnudo afectó a las abejas solitarias (pero no a todos los polinizadores) y la transparencia del hábitat benefició a los depredadores, como se esperaba. Los dípteros disminuyeron cuadráticamente con el aumento de la densidad ganadera, rechazando la hipótesis del suministro de alimentos. Aparentemente, los depredadores redujeron la abundancia de casi todos los grupos de insectos. El pastoreo reduce la vegetación afectando positivamente a los depredadores, que afectan negativamente a otros grupos de insectos (efecto de arriba hacia abajo), alterando potencialmente las interacciones complejas de las especies y el funcionamiento del ecosistema.",

Plant diversification has shown excellent potential to improve the diversity of crop predators such as spiders. However, in agroecosystems with frequent disturbances such as annual crops, it is unknown whether the effect of plant diversification on spiders depends on the surrounding landscape and the stages of the agricultural cycle (i.e., periods with differences in vegetation, weather and agricultural practices). Here, we evaluated the effect and interaction of local management (plant diversification), landscape (forest areas) and agricultural cycle on the richness and abundance from the main spider guilds of a maize polyculture in Mexico. We found that greater crop diversification (i.e., addition of legumes and leafy plants) caused a greater abundance of ground‐hunting spiders. We also show that a larger area of forest around the crop favours a greater richness and abundance of ground‐ and vegetation‐hunting spiders. We found that each stage of the agricultural cycle had a different spider richness and abundance, ground hunters were more common at the beginning of the agricultural cycle, while vegetation hunters and web‐builders were more common during the peak developmental stages of the crops. Our findings support the idea that to foster functionally diverse spider communities that potentially enhance natural pest control, we must jointly manage plant elements within the crop, in the surrounding landscape, considering the high dynamics of spider communities throughout the agricultural cycle.",

The take‐off and free flight of Drepanosiphum platanoidis and Myzus persicae were studied in still air using high‐speed photography in HD. The wing tip and body posture were tracked to show how they are displaced during each wingbeat cycle. The important structural elements of the wing are described. The wingbeat is driven by a reinforced leading edge, the pterostigma and costa. The remainder of the coupled fore‐ and hindwing acts as a single aerofoil that deforms during flight, due to sparse venation and a lack of cross veins. During flight, aphids use a ‘near clap and fling’ mechanism with a body pitch close to 90°. Rapid acceleration about the thoracic lateral axis into wing reversal generates enough lift for take‐off, typically within the first or second wingbeat. Unique footage shows that aphids demonstrate a high degree of flight control and manoeuvrability in the lab, occasionally using forward and inverted flight, two flight modes that are otherwise poorly known. While research into the impact of turbulent convection is needed, we posit that the strength of atmospheric forces presents a formidable challenge to aphid migrants. Above the flight boundary layer, migrating aphids may not easily oppose upwardly moving air, although if used, ‘frozen flight’ may cause them to descend on average. We evaluate five devices for insect flight research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Conservation biocontrol, the regulation of crop pests by naturally occurring biocontrol agents (e.g., predators and parasitoids), is predominantly monitored throughout periods of primary crop growth when pests exert the most observable impact on yields. Pest‐focused agricultural biomonitoring often overlooks post‐harvest, winter and even early‐season biocontrol, despite the significant predator–pest interactions during these periods that profoundly affect pest abundance and, consequently, crop yields. Rapid advances in biomonitoring, particularly in the detection of predator–pest interactions that underpin biocontrol, provide an opportunity to reconsider how and when we monitor these interactions. Advances in agricultural biomonitoring must transcend methodological innovation and encompass conceptual changes in the monitoring of agricultural systems. Here, we assess existing evidence supporting the importance of periods beyond primary crop growth for biocontrol and how predator–pest interactions are likely to evolve during these periods, subsequently influencing pest population dynamics during the primary crop growth period. We advocate for a greater concerted effort to establish continuous monitoring of biocontrol interactions, particularly beyond primary crop growth periods in temperate climates. To facilitate this, we also summarise the methodological approaches that can make it possible and explore how extending sampling across the full annual cycle might impact the practicalities and outcomes of these approaches. Year‐round monitoring of biocontrol interactions, both in crops and adjacent semi‐natural habitats, will provide a previously intractable understanding of predator–pest dynamics, offering significant potential to enhance our ability to optimise and manipulate these systems. This would manifest in reduced crop yield losses, pest infestation rates and disease transmission, with concomitant long‐term financial, environmental and land‐use benefits.",

This lack of specificity can translate into low attraction/capture levels, something that is undesired, especially when the intent is to detect the pest when still at low population densities. In this context, an interesting opportunity arises to increase trap sensitivity by incorporating visual cues. For this, we evaluated potential sources of visual information that, in accordance with the ecology of the species, could elicit an attractive response complementary to the olfactory cues. We measured the reflectance spectra of pine bark, chlorotic needles and woodwasp male abdomens. The spectra were then compared with 120 commercial paint colours to be applied on panel traps. During two flight seasons, field experiments were conducted with the deployment of 155 traps, combining the volatile bait (turpentine) and different coloured traps. We observed a significantly higher number of captures towards traps with pine bark‐like colourations compared with the black control traps. Our results are encouraging, as they suggest the potential of combining visual and chemical information for sustainable pest biomonitoring.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cameras are increasingly used by ecologists to study species distribution and interactions. They are mainly used to study large animals such as mammals but can also be used to record small invertebrates, including insects. Camera traps, capturing images within a specified field of view, can be used for biomonitoring and investigating insect‐related interactions, such as predation. Understanding predation on insect prey has direct implications for agriculture and conservation biology, enabling predator species identification and quantification of biological control. This review examines 28 studies published between 1988 and March 2024 focusing on the use of cameras to monitor insect predator–prey interactions, predominantly targeting agricultural pests. Studies varied in recording equipment used and tended to be spatially and temporally limited, making results difficult to generalise at larger scale. We provide an overview of equipment options, camera settings, the merits of video versus picture recording, night‐time imaging strategies, trigger mechanisms, equipment costs, and strategies for managing theft and vandalism. Additionally, we discuss avenues for improving image processing efficiency, including enhancing predator identification through artificial intelligence methods. Challenges related to limitations in the taxonomic levels of predator identification are also addressed. Finally, we offer guidelines for researchers interested in using camera technology and propose future perspectives on their use in insect conservation and biocontrol efforts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Insects play crucial roles in nearly every ecosystem and provide a wide array of ecosystem services. However, both managed and wild insect populations face threats from parasites and pathogens, which require surveillance to mitigate. Current infectious disease surveillance methods for insects often involve invasive, time‐consuming and occasionally destructive techniques, such as manual inspections and molecular detection. Volatile organic compound (VOC) surveillance provides a real‐time, accurate and non‐invasive alternative for disease detection and has been well‐established in humans and livestock. Recent advances in sensor technology now allow for the development of in‐field VOC surveillance devices. This review explores the need for disease surveillance in insects and highlights recent advances of using VOCs for this purpose, focusing on honey bees as an example. We outline potential applications, challenges and future prospects of using VOCs for insect disease surveillance, providing examples of how this technology could be globally applied to mitigate the impacts of disease in a range of insect systems.",

In contrast, such damage is widespread where pine plantations are colonized by native ants, predominantly Tapinoma nigerrimum and Lasius niger , which seemingly disregard the larvae. 2 Where L. humile ‐ and native ant‐occupied sectors adjoin, there is a 20–50 m overlap in the transition area between L. humile ‐ and native ant‐occupied pines. This was most evident in a &gt; 500 ha plantation where there was severe or very severe T. pityocampa attack in native ant sectors contrasting with none in adjoining L. humile sectors. 3 Predation by L. humile is no doubt enhanced by its existence as super‐colonies over very large areas, by its foraging activity and recruitment on trees throughout the time when T. pityocampa and other prey are present, and by honeydew‐ producing Homoptera which help retain foraging L. humile workers in pine tree crowns. 4 The role of L. humile could be enhanced by cultivations that disturb the soil and restrain ground vegetation.",

Despite similar numbers of each species migrating at the time of colonization, M. persicae is usually less abundant on the crop than A. fabae, suggesting differences between the species in their selection of, and performance on, sugar beet. 3 The intrinsic rate of increase of both species declines as sugar beet matures, however, at any given plant age the intrinsic rate of increase of A. fabae is one and a half times greater than that of M. persicae. This results in more rapid population growth and a later decline of the population. 4 Intraspecific competition appears to result in M. persicae becoming very restless, but there is no evidence for interspecific competition between the two species on this host. 5 A population growth model which takes account of the decline in host quality of sugar beet shows that the M. persicae population peaks 30 days before that of A. fabae, and, excluding differences in emigration rate, the maximum A. fabae population is 14 times greater than the maximum M. persicae population.

The foliage types differ in chemistry, toughness, waxiness and timing of production. 3 In the field, feeding damage caused by adult beetles was 15% more frequent on adult foliage than on juvenile foliage; however, egg batches were three times more common on juvenile than on adult foliage. 4 Oviposition preference for juvenile foliage over adult foliage was confirmed in choice trials in the laboratory, with adult fecundity and longevity not significantly different between foliage types. 5 Larval survival, development time and subsequent pupal weight were also unaffected by foliage type, suggesting that neither foliage type is nutritionally superior for adults or for larvae.

The risk that food in store will become infested is related to the number of beetles dispersing by flight. A means of predicting years with high dispersal rates is needed to warn farmers when to be vigilant. 2 The relationship between climatic variables and pheromone trap catches was observed in a forest‐savannah transition zone in Ghana. These observations were used to devise a model using a mix of biological and empirical rules that operate on temperature and humidity data. The predicted and actual trap catch deviated by only +5% to −1% in years when there were high dispersal rates. 3 The first part of the model estimates the numbers of beetles with potential for dispersal. The second part predicts the proportion likely to disperse. This is based on the apparent effect that those P. truncatus developing under low temperature conditions (about 24 °C) have a lowered propensity for flight, a response previously observed in a related species. 4 The model was validated using climate data and trap catches from a woodland–savannah zone and a short grass steppe zone. With minor adjustment, the model worked well for these two habitats.",

However, there was no evidence to support a link between oviposition preference and larval performance, which supports the Phylogenetic Constraints Hypothesis. 3 Our preference data led us to test whether female budworms use oviposition strategies to select the sites where they lay their egg masses. Our experiments were designed to make direct comparisons between latent and eruptive insect herbivores with respect to two oviposition behaviours: egg retention and avoidance of conspecifics. This type of research has not previously been conducted on any eruptive forest Lepidopteran. 4 Female budworms retained eggs instead of laying them on less preferred hosts in two of three experiments, but the percentage of eggs they retained was significantly less compared to latent insect herbivores. 5 In addition, female budworms actively avoided oviposition in areas with the highest density of conspecific egg masses, but they laid egg masses in all the other locations provided. This contrasts with the pattern seen in latent insect herbivores, which consistently avoid laying their eggs near any sites already used by conspecifics. 6 Our research indicates that there are extreme differences between latent and eruptive insect herbivores with respect to egg retention and avoidance of conspecifics, thus supporting the Phylogenetic Constraints Hypothesis.",

Male captures with pear ester were higher in the pheromone‐treated than in the insecticide‐treated orchard, whereas captures with ( E )‐β‐farnesene were not different. Subsequent wind tunnel experiments confirmed that pre‐exposure to sex pheromone codlemone increased the behavioural response of codling moth males to pear ester. This supports the idea that male attraction to the plant volatile pear ester and sex pheromone codlemone is mediated through the same sensory channels. 2 Pear ester is a bisexual codling moth attractant and even captures of female moths were significantly increased in the pheromone‐treated orchard. In the laboratory wind tunnel, pheromone pre‐exposure had no effect on female response to pear ester, but significantly more mated than unmated codling moth females flew upwind towards a pear ester source. Differences in mating status in insecticide‐treated vs. pheromone‐treated orchards may thus account for the differences in female trap captures with pear ester. 3 These findings are important with respect to monitoring of codling moth with pear ester in mating disruption orchards.

The freezing avoidance of parasitized eggs was also examined. 3 The northernmost Inari population was found to be the cold hardiest, and the southernmost (Hanko) was the least hardy population. The within‐population variation between females was greatest in the population from Inari, and the next greatest in the one from Hanko. The inland populations in Eastern Finland had the smallest within‐population variation in freezing avoidance. 4 The high variation in freezing avoidance of eggs will enable N. sertifer to adapt to the predicted climate change and to spread its distribution northwards. This may also change the risk for outbreaks in this area. Parasitized eggs froze at higher temperature than healthy eggs. This observation indicates that N. sertifer may experience reduced egg parasitism in certain winter climate conditions.",

The damage rate in the fourth summer was approximately the same on burned and unburned sites. 3 Pine weevil feeding was the major cause of mortality of freshly planted pine seedlings on unburned sites. On burned sites, mortality was higher than the rate of severe feeding damage, particularly in the second summer after burning, possibly owing to fungal attack and abiotic factors. 4 At a retention tree level of 50 m 3 , feeding damage to the seedlings was lower than on clearcuts and at a 10 m 3 retention tree level. Furthermore, on sites with 50 m 3 of retention trees, scarification of the soil was found to decrease feeding damage more effectively than on clearcuts and 10 m 3 sites. If the seedlings were situated in the centre of scarified patches, scarification alone was as effective as insecticide treatment on unscarified soil for decreasing feeding damage and mortality. 5 The results suggest that when burning is applied as silvicultural treatment after clear‐cuts, retention of trees is recommended to reduce the damages caused by pine weevils on pine seedlings.",

Btk efficacy on the two host trees was compared and examined according to the foliar content of nutrients and allelochemicals and the insect developmental stage at the time of spray. 2 Larvae fed white spruce foliage were less vulnerable to Btk ingestion than larvae fed balsam fir foliage. Higher larval survival on white spruce, observed 10 days after spray, was related to higher foliage content in tannins and a lower N /tannins ratio, which might have induced inactivation of Btk toxins. 3 Larval mortality due to Btk did not depend on spruce budworm larval age. 4 Foliage protection of both host trees was similar in plots treated with Btk : larval mortality due to Btk treatment reduced insect grazing pressure on balsam fir trees; meanwhile, suitability of white spruce foliage seemed to decrease very rapidly, which induced high larval mortality among spruce budworm fed on white spruce trees. Nevertheless, following Btk sprays, 50% more foliage remained on white spruce than on balsam fir trees, because of the higher white spruce foliage production. 5 Both spray timings achieved similar protection of white spruce trees, but Btk treatments had to be applied as early as possible (i.e. during the flaring of balsam fir shoots to optimally protect balsam fir trees in mixed balsam fir‐white spruce stands).",

The LC 50 increased from 4 × 10 6 granules/mL for neonate larvae to 1.2 × 10 7 , 1.1 × 10 8 , 4.4 × 10 8 , and 4.2 × 10 9 granules/mL, signifying resistance ratios of 3, 29, 110, and 1051, for 5, 6, 7, and 9‐day‐old larvae, respectively. 3 The relationship between log‐ LC 50 values and log‐larval weight was significantly linear. A logistic function described significantly the relation between larval weights and physiological age measured in degree‐days (DD &gt; 13.4 °C). Both functions allowed prediction of the activity ratio of Po GV for different larval ages by using temperature summation to express physiological age. 4 Po GV was found to be highly active against P. operculella larvae up to a physiological age of approximately 50 DD (&gt;13.4 °C) (i.e. the first third of the total larval development time). Thereafter, the virus rapidly lost its activity against older larvae. Prospects for applying this knowledge in the field are discussed.",

We compared the effect of verbenone, a well known bark beetle anti‐aggregation pheromone, with that of acetophenone on the attraction of D. brevicomis to its aggregation pheromone in a ponderosa pine forest in northern California. We tested the D. brevicomis aggregation pheromone alone and with three different release ratios of the aggregation pheromone (attractant) to verbenone or acetophenone (1 : 1, 1 : 2 and 1 : 5). 2 All treatments containing acetophenone or verbenone resulted in a significant reduction in the catch of D. brevicomis relative to the aggregation pheromone alone. When beetle responses to the three verbenone or three acetophenone treatments were pooled, the pooled verbenone treatment caught more D. brevicomis than the pooled acetophenone treatment. 3 There was no significant difference in the number of D. brevicomis caught among the three release rates of verbenone. By contrast, the 1 : 2 attractant : acetophenone ratio attracted significantly more D. brevicomis than the traps with the 1 : 5 attractant : acetophenone ratio. 4 Attraction of a major predator, Temnochila chlorodia (Mannerheim) (Coleoptera: Trogositidae), to the aggregation pheromone of D. brevicomis was reduced by verbenone, but not by acetophenone. Moreover, the T. chlorodia : D. brevicomis ratio for the pooled acetophenone treatment was 1.7‐fold greater than that for the attractant alone and two‐fold greater than the ratio for the pooled verbenone treatment, suggesting that acetophenone would not disrupt populations of this natural enemy. The importance of anti‐attractants in the biology of D. brevicomis and other bark beetles is discussed.",

The network‐wide, simultaneous sudden increase in light trap catches, and after subsequent decrease, indicated a seasonal long‐distance night migration of ground beetles, with Pseudoophonus griseus (Panzer) predominant, in August. 2 Aerial net trapping indicated that carabids were able to ascend to altitudes of at least 200 m and become windborne. Radar observations indicated that the migratory beetles formed high‐density layer concentrations at approximately 200–300 m. 3 These concentrations were coincident with the top of the temperature inversion and a wind speed maximum, which suggested that the carabids tended to select warm, fast moving air for their long‐distance migration. 4 The ground beetles orientated and displaced towards the downwind direction in southerly winds. Their air speed decreased as the tailwind increased and, thus, migrating beetles appeared to be conserving energy. 5 The mean ± SD displacement speed (ground speed) and air speed were 6.85 ± 1.73 m/s ( n = 172) and 4.45 ± 1.54 m/s ( n = 172), respectively.

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 The native range of the gypsy moth Lymantria dispar (L.) spans the temperate forests of Eurasia. Across this region, a clinal female flight polymorphism exists; gypsy moth females in eastern Asia are mostly capable of directed flight, those in western and southern Europe are largely incapable of flight and populations distributed across the centre of the distribution exhibit a range of intermediate flight behaviours. 2 Although information exists about the timing and duration of female flight from laboratory and wind tunnel studies, little or no quantitative data are available on average distances flown by Asian gypsy moth females prior to oviposition in the field. This information is critical for estimating risk of contamination at specific ports and transit terminals, as well as for predicting the spread of populations that might someday invade currently uninfested regions of the world. 3 In the present study, an extensive visual survey of gypsy moth egg masses was conducted during a walk through streets and paths in a 3.92 × 5.76 km area in Kanazawa, Japan. This area consisted of a matrix of urban, agricultural and forest land uses. The distribution of egg masses relative to distances from host forests was used to infer the magnitude of pre‐ovipositional female flight. 4 A total of 3172 egg masses was recorded from surveys conducted during the search of a path totalling 384 km. Within urban areas, egg masses were most abundant in the area &lt;1 km from the edge of forest land. 5 These results suggest that most female gypsy moth flight is limited to the area within 1 km of host forests. They also suggest that shipping containers and other parcels located &gt;1 km from forests are at a much lower risk of contamination with Asian gypsy moth egg masses.",

    "abstract": "Florida has an exceptional burden of invasive species. The history of the classical biological control of invasive arthropod pest species in the region largely is one of inadequate pre‐release testing for nontarget effects. A recent analysis indicated that a substantial risk of nontarget effects may exist in Florida, although the risk appears to be confined to a relatively small group of species within approximately ten families and documented cases of nontarget effects are rare, despite previous risky practices. Great progress has been made recently in creating an organized framework for dealing with the uncertainty accompanying biological control importations in Florida and elsewhere. We suggest some ways in which balancing the risks and associated costs of releasing a biological control agent against the risks and associated costs of not releasing the agent may be improved. Ultimately, experts will need to set some level of acceptable risk, and the ‘precautionary principle’ has been advanced to guide this process. As it stands, however, the precautionary principle applied to biological control falls short as a guide because it does not provide a prescription for action. Florida case histories clearly illustrate both the complexity and urgency related to developing a prescription for action.",

A potential microbial control, now in development, is the broad host-range virus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV). 2 The relationships between the three host plants and the feeding behaviour, larval movement and performance of cabbage looper larvae that might relate to their interaction with AcMNPV applications were investigated. 3 Larvae reared on cucumber plants consumed approximately ten-fold more leaf area than larvae reared on pepper plants and almost five-fold more than larvae reared on tomato plants. This could influence the amount of AcMNPV consumed if it were used as a microbial spray because increased consumption can be associated with increased probability of infection. Survival from neonate to pupa also varied, with the greatest being on cucumber, followed by tomato and pepper plants. Larvae fed cucumber were approximately four-fold heavier than larvae fed tomato and over 15-fold heavier than larvae fed pepper plants. 4 The distribution of larvae on plants in commercial greenhouses where a single crop was being grown also varied with food plant with 73% being found on the bottom and middle portions of tomato plants and 87% occurring in the top portions of pepper plants. Larvae tended to be distributed on the middle portion of cucumber plants, the lower portion of tomato plants and the top portion of pepper plants. Larval movement did not vary between AcMNPV-infected and uninfected controls. 5 It is predicted that the higher leaf area consumption and location of larvae in the middle portion of cucumber plants may make them more susceptible to viral sprays. Furthermore, given their greater survival than larvae fed tomato and pepper, there may be a greater need for virus applications.",

Annual environmental changes did not have detectable effects on population growth rates, leading to the conclusion that intrinsic processes influenced local population density more than extrinsic factors during this outbreak. 3 Our calculated value of r max (1.16) does not suggest intrinsically cyclic population dynamics.

A suite of invasive weevils has become established in the northern hardwood forests of North America. How these insects will respond to increasing CO 2 or O 3 is unknown. The present study examined the effects of elevated atmospheric CO 2 and O 3 on the invasive weevil Polydrusus sericeus Schaller at the Aspen Free Air CO 2 Enrichment (FACE) site near Rhinelander, Wisconsin. A performance assay was conducted in the laboratory during the summer of 2007 using mated pairs of P. sericeus fed a combination of aspen, birch and maple foliage. We recorded leaf area consumption, oviposition and adult longevity. We also conducted visual abundance surveys in the field from 2004 to 2007 on aspen and birch at Aspen FACE. Elevated CO 2 , but not O 3 , significantly affected P. sericeus performance. Female, but not male, longevity was reduced under elevated CO 2 . Polydrusus sericeus also produced fewer eggs under elevated CO 2 conditions compared with ambient conditions. Adult P. sericeus strongly preferred birch over both aspen and maple, regardless of fumigation treatment. The effects of elevated CO 2 on P. sericeus populations at Aspen FACE were minimal, and varied among years and host tree species. Polydrusus sericeus abundance was significantly greater on birch than aspen. Over the long term, elevated CO 2 may reduce adult female longevity and fecundity of P. sericeus . Further studies are needed to evaluate how this information may scale to ecosystem impacts.",

The results obtained in the present study showed that the Sirex awareness campaign had increased knowledge of forestry pests in general but basic knowledge regarding the identification and symptoms of specific pests, such as S. noctilio , was poor. This will negatively influence monitoring efficacy. Traditional paper‐based media and personal contact contributed most to enhanced awareness. Electronic media were less effective and improvement would require a more focused effort. It was of concern that private farmers and contractors, as well as non‐European first language speakers, were less well informed about forestry pests.

During three to four crop seasons, eight olive, five chestnut and one almond groves were sampled. In each grove, five samples were collected from 10 randomly selected trees using the beating technique and the coccinellids were counted and identified to species. Principal component analysis was used to establish associations among crop and coccinellid species. The mean species richness was higher in chestnut, with 15 ± 3.81 species/grove, followed by olive and almond, with 13 ± 2.76 and 10 ± 2.97 species/grove, respectively. Scymnus mediterraneus was the most abundant species in olive and almond, whereas Scymnus interruptus was dominant in chestnut. Brumus quadripustulatus , Chilocorus bipustulatus , Scymnus subvillosus , S. mediterraneus and Rhyzobius chrysomeloides were associated with olive, whereas S. interruptus , Coccinella septempunctata and Adalia decempunctata were associated with chestnut and Hippodamia variegata , Oenopia conglobata and Adalia bipunctata with almond. Both Stethorus punctillum and Scymnus apetzi species were similarly associated with chestnut and almond. The differences in coccinellid communities could have been related to the kind of prey item present in the different trees. This knowledge can be used to develop integrated pest management programmes that encourage greater natural enemy biodiversity in agroecosystems.",

The consumption of carbohydrates by the adults significantly increased the length of the oviposition period, fecundity, fertility and longevity of P. sequax .

Surveys confirmed that P. digoneutis populations have become established throughout eastern North America and that the spread of the parasitoid continues. For unknown reasons, previous releases of P. digoneutis in Western Canada were not successful. A bioclimate ( climex ®; Hearne Scientific Software Pty Ltd, Australia) model for P. digoneutis in North America was developed, based on climate and ecological parameters, and then validated with actual distribution records. The current distribution of P. digoneutis in eastern North America was consistent with the predicted distribution. The model suggests that P. digoneutis will probably continue its spread westwards throughout the U.S.A. along the Great Lakes. The southern distribution of P. digoneutis is expected to be limited by hot summer temperatures, whereas its northern range is limited by the number of Lygus host generations rather than cold stress. Peristenus digoneutis has the potential to occur in the southern parts of the prairie ecozone of western Canada; however, Ecoclimatic Index values in the prairies indicate mainly marginal or unfavourable conditions, which may explain why earlier releases of P. digoneutis in Western Canada failed.",

Data on gypsy moth egg mass abundance recorded at 282 permanent monitoring sites from 1980 to 2004 were incorporated in a geographic information system with the vegetational, geomorphological and pedological features of the sites. Statistical analyses revealed that the relative outbreak frequency was related to the predominant host tree, slope and elevation of the monitoring sites, whereas there was no correlation between outbreak frequency and exposure and soil type. By using bioclimatic modelling, probability maps of gypsy moth outbreaks were generated. The model identified a probability surface with climatic conditions favourable to gypsy moth outbreaks and thus potentially subject to defoliation. The maps included 92 sites where outbreaks never occurred, suggesting that the Sardinian climate may not be a determinant factor for gypsy moth outbreaks. The geostatistical method cokriging with outbreak frequency as a covariate was found to be the most suitable technique to estimate gypsy moth egg mass abundance. Semivariograms showed spatial correlation of egg mass abundance within the range 18.5–53 km. The results obtained were used to create regional gypsy moth distribution maps by cokriging, which demonstrated the outbreak foci and different infestation levels at each monitoring area. These results can help to delimit the treatment areas and develop rational gypsy moth management programmes.",

Within the group of visited trees, more ants were found on bigger trees and on trees close to the ant mounds. 4 Extrapolated from plot to stand level, we estimated that 0.5–6.6% of the trees were host trees in at least one of the three study years, and that only 0.01–2.3% of all the trees were consistently visited by ants during all 3 years.

We used pitfall traps set in 5–14‐year‐old sapling stands and 30–45‐year‐old pole‐stage stands of Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.) and birch ( Betula spp.) forests. Pitfall trap catches of red wood ants did not vary significantly between the forest stand types, although some groups of other arthropods showed clear responses to stand type (e.g. catches of other Formicinae and Gnaphosidae were higher in sapling stands than in pole‐stage stands). The number of red wood ants clearly explained less of the variation in assemblages of other ground‐dwelling arthropods than the forest stand type. Red wood ant numbers decreased significantly with distance from the mounds, but the other ground‐dwelling arthropods were insensitive to this gradient or even showed a preference for proximity to ant mounds and high ant activity. The results obtained in the present study suggest that wood ants do not have strong effects on several other ground‐dwelling arthropod groups in young managed forests other than in the immediate vicinity of their mounds.",

Introduced parasitoids, host plant resistance, pathogens and native predators led to the successful control of the spotted alfalfa aphid ( SAA ; Therioaphis maculata Monell) in California and elsewhere, although the relative contribution of each factor remained largely unknown. The relative contribution of each control factor was estimated using a weather‐driven physiologically‐based demographic system model consisting of alfalfa, SAA , its three exotic parasitoids [ Aphelinus semiflavus H oward, Praon palitans M uesebeck and Trioxys complanatus ( Q uilis)], a native coccinellid beetle [ Hippodamia convergens ( G uérin‐ M enéville)], a fungal pathogen [ Erynia neoaphidis R emaudière &amp; H ennebert ( Z ygomycetes: E ntomophthorales)] and host plant resistance ( HPR ). Daily weather data for the period 1995–2006 from 142 locations in A rizona and C alifornia were used to drive the model. The factors were introduced to the model singly or in combination to assess their effects in suppressing simulated SAA populations using SAA ‐days m −2 year −1 (i.e. density) as the metric of control. Data from selected runs were mapped using the geographic information system grass ( http://grass.osgeo.org ). The simulation data across all factor combinations, years and locations were summarized using linear multiple regression, with the dependent variable being log 10 SAA ‐days m −2 year −1 and the independent variables being the presence–absence (0, 1) of the various factors and their interactions. Marginal analysis of the regression model (∂ y /∂ x i ) enabled separation of the average effects of the different factors ( x i ) given the average effects of the other factors. Alone, each factor failed to control SAA , as did combinations of the parasitoids and coccinellid predation. Control was predicted across all ecological zones only when all mortality factors were included. The marginal analysis suggests that the order of importance of the mortality factors is HPR &gt; coccinellid beetles &gt; T. complanatus &gt; P. palitans &gt; A. semiflavus &gt; the fungal pathogen. The variability of control by coccinellid beetles and the fungal pathogen was high and hence unreliable.",

Abundance of insect predators was increased by both the presence of companion plants and extrafloral nectar but parasitism of the leafroller Platynota idaeusalis was not affected. There were no consistent effects of biodiversity treatment on either tree growth or fruit yield. Insect injury to Empire apple and peach fruit was not consistently affected by the biodiversity treatments. Granny Smith apples were harvested later than Empire and had more fruit injury in the biodiverse treatments than the standard insecticide control. A reduction in pesticides with added biodiversity proved to be a viable alternative to standard chemical insecticide management for temperate tree fruit.

In the present study, post‐diapause, early summer, late summer and colony adult beetles, both fed and unfed before release, were tracked with a harmonic radar to establish their walking movement pattern in a bare‐ground field. The random walk model successfully described the dispersal of all beetle types, whether fed or unfed. The diverse life history of this species was manifested by an increased distance travelled and deviations of individual paths from the random model. Starved post‐diapause beetles travelled furthest and individual paths deviating from random were both local and directed, probably aiming to maximize opportunities for host colonization. Starved early summer beetles also travelled further than fed beetles but relied more on random movement to disperse in the habitat. Starving had little impact on the distance travelled or the path deviations of late summer beetles that are searching for overwintering site rather than hosts. The increased displacement of starving beetles over fed beetles corresponded with an increased walking step and index of straightness. The impact of starvation on travel distance was greater than expected from laboratory tests. In conclusion, the results obtained in the present study suggest a random walking pattern to search arable land until host volatile or visual impulses trigger a more directed walk or flight.",

    "abstract": "Aphid population dynamics in crops are often driven by interactions with their host plants, which can be extensively influenced by environmental change. Protective environments (i.e. plastic tunnels) are now frequently used for soft fruit production, which may affect the localized climate and alter such interactions. This two year study on red raspberry ( Rubus idaeus ) addressed how protected environments affected two aphid species; the large raspberry aphid Amphorophora idaei (LRA) and the small raspberry aphid Aphis idaei (SRA). Temperatures were higher (up to 7–10 °C) in tunnels compared with the field. Plants in tunnels grew approximately 1.4 cm/week faster and had lower (approximately 35%) foliar amino acid concentrations than plants in the field. Aphids affected plant growth differently depending on growing environment; they promoted plant growth by 18–37% in tunnels, although they had no such effect in the field. Aphids reduced total and essential amino acid concentrations, with SRA causing greatest reductions (approximately 40% and 33%, respectively). Aphid population sizes were similar in both environments, although individual LRA were smaller in tunnels (30% smaller in 2007) compared with those in the field. We suggest that faster aphid development rates inside warmer tunnels were not realized as a result of the variable effects of the growing environment on amino acid composition. We conclude that the increasing use of protected environments in crop production will not necessarily cause predictable increases in aphid populations, although it may alter aphid–plant interactions in terms of aphid‐induced changes to plant growth.",

    "abstract": "1 Earlier population genetic spatial analysis of European corn borer Ostrinia nubilalis (Hübner) indicated no genetic differentiation even between locations separated by 720 km. This result suggests either high dispersal resulting in high gene flow or that populations are not in migration–drift equilibrium subsequent to their invasion of the central U.S.A. in the 1940s. 2 To discriminate among these two possibilities, samples were collected at 12 locations in eight states from New York to Colorado, a geographic scale that is three-fold greater than previously tested. Eight microsatellite markers were employed to estimate genetic differentiation and gene flow among these populations, and to test for isolation-by-distance. 3 Although pairwise FST estimates were very low, there was a significant isolation-by-distance relationship. 4 Wright's neighbourhood area (i.e. the surface area covered by a panmictic group of individuals within a larger continuous distribution) was calculated as 433 km2, and the radius indicates that approximately 13% of O. nubilalis adults disperse a net distance >12 km per generation from their natal source. 5 Analyses indicated significant differentiation between the north-eastern region (New York and Pennsylvania) and the region combining sample locations from Ohio to Colorado, suggesting the potential for isolation of populations by topographic barriers in the Northeast. 6 Taken together, the results suggest that O. nubilalis exhibits substantial gene flow over long distances and that the lack of genetic differentiation between populations across hundreds of kilometres is not simply a result of migration–drift disequilibrium arising from the recent range expansion.",

    "abstract": "African mahogany Khaya senegalensis is a high‐value timber tree. Pilot plantings showed that the fruit‐spotting bug Amblypelta lutescens causes severe damage of the tree in the wet–dry tropics of northern Australia. The weaver ant Oecophylla smaragdina is an efficient biocontrol agent in some horticulture crops. To investigate whether the ants control this pest, field experiments were conducted from April 2006 to January 2009 at two study sites in the Darwin area, Australia. A laboratory experiment was carried out in March 2007 at Berrimah Farm. During the experimental period, in the weaver ant treatments, the overall percentage of trees damaged by the pest was 0–8% at both sites, and the damaged trees were attacked once only. In the treatments without weaver ants, however, the damage level was &gt; 80% at Berrimah Farm and 31–100% at Howard Springs, and the damaged trees were attacked more than once. The mean percentage of trees damaged per monitoring occasion was 0–2.6% in the weaver ant treatments at both sites, whereas, in the treatments without the ants, the damage percentages were 14.2–27.0% at Howard Springs and 28.2–48.6% at Berrimah Farm. Extrafloral nectar of African mahoganies is attractive to weaver ants. Fruit‐spotting bugs only damage the tender parts of flushing shoots and growing tips. Weaver ants live on sugar solution and meat, and they frequently harvest extrafloral nectar on growing shoots, on which they catch nymphs of the pest for their meat supply. The aggressive behaviour of the ants also repels the pest away from flushing shoots. The data suggest that weaver ants were effective biocontrol agents of fruit‐spotting bugs, and the ants can be used to manage the pest on African mahoganies. The present study demonstrates that the introduced African mahogany comprises another major host of the fruit‐spotting bug.",

For sterile insect technique programmes, the influence of larval (developmental) temperature variation on subsequent adult field performance is generally poorly understood but may be a significant avenue for increasing efficacy. In the present study, we investigated the influence of larval thermal acclimation on several traits of adult performance in the false codling moth T haumatotibia leucotreta ( M eyrick). After larvae were reared at 15, 20 or 25 °C for their full larval developmental period, we determined the effect of different acute (2 h) temperature treatments (10, 15 or 20 °C) during the adult stage on traits of (i) cold tolerance; (ii) fecundity; and (iii) longevity. Cold tolerance of adults was not influenced by larval acclimation temperature but was affected by sex and adult treatment temperature. Adult fecundity and longevity were affected by larval acclimation temperature, adult treatment temperature and the interaction of these factors with sex. These results suggest a complex, sex‐dependent interplay of short‐ and longer‐ term temperature history across developmental stages for these traits. Exploring the field impacts of this trait variation is essential, coupled with information on how these traits might respond to artificial manipulation.",

The present study identified source habitats and the effects of temperature and prevailing wind direction on colonization of B russels sprouts by pests and their natural enemies. We sampled arthropods on standardized monitoring plants in 18 landscapes with different areas of potential source habitats. Most abundant pests and antagonists were A leyrodes proletella , B revicoryne brassicae , P lutella xylostella and syrphid larvae. Variation in A . proletella colonization was best explained by the upwind area of oilseed rape (positive effect) and temperature (negative effect). Variation in B . brassicae colonization was best explained by the downwind area of oilseed rape (positive effect), whereas no effects on P . xylostella were found. Syrphid colonization was affected by prey abundance only (positive effect). The results of the present study suggest that A . proletella was transported downwind, whereas B . brassicae located host plants during an upwind flight for approximately 1 km. This is remarkable for aphids with often limited upwind flight ability. Consideration of prevailing wind directions improves forecasting of the colonization intensity by pests from important source habitats.",

It currently includes three subspecies: Lymantria dispar dispar (L.), Lymantria dispar asiatica Vnukovskij and Lymantria dispar japonica (Motschulsky). The first subspecies is known as the European gypsy moth (EGM), whereas the latter two are collectively referred to as the Asian gypsy moth (AGM). Asian gypsy moth possesses traits that include a strong female flight capability and broader larval host range, which make it a more threatening pest than EGM when invading new areas. To better understand the genetic structure within AGM and in particular among Chinese populations, we reconstructed a mitochondrial gene tree based on four mitochondrial protein‐coding genes (ND2, ND6, ATP6 and ATP8) from 17 Chinese locations and 21 locations from other countries. None of the three subspecies of gypsy moth is recovered as monophyletic on the mitochondrial gene tree, likely as a result of human‐mediated transportation and a high level of cryptic genetic diversity. Chinese populations are split into four mitochondrial clusters. Surprisingly, China I is nested within EGM and China II is the sister group of sampled EGM. China III grouped with samples from South Korea and the Russian Far East to represent the typical L. d. asiatica . China IV formed a sister relationship with the former group. The results of the present study confirm that the recently discovered genotype from the Black Sea‐Caspian region consists of an independent mitochondrial genetic lineage from other subspecies.",

Annual detection, and delimiting surveys if detected, are mandatory in the European Union. The trapping of Monochamus beetles, vectors of pine wood nematode, is included in both types of survey. The efficient use of traps increases the probability of detecting the pine wood nematode. How stand type, bait composition, wet or dry collecting jars, and trapping period during the summer affect the catches of Monochamus was investigated in central Sweden. Monochamus sutor and Monochamus galloprovincialis occurred together in half of the trapping locations, suggesting that the two species could interact as vectors for the pine wood nematode. Baited traps caught 25‐ to 30‐fold more M. sutor than unbaited traps. Monochamus sutor was four‐ to seven‐fold more abundant on clear‐cuts than in pine stands, whereas numbers of M. galloprovincialis were similar in both habitats. There was no difference in catch between fresh and old clear‐cuts for M. sutor . The addition of α‐pinene to the pheromone baits increased catches of M. sutor by 1.6‐fold on old clear‐cuts, whereas there was no difference for M. galloprovincialis . Wet traps caught approximately two‐fold more M. sutor than dry traps. Most M. sutor were caught in June and July, whereas the flight period of M. galloprovincialis started approximately 1 month later and peaked in July.

    "abstract": "Abstract In Australia, eucalypt plantations require management to prevent economic damage by native chrysomelid leaf beetles, generally by aerially spraying a broad‐spectrum insecticide. These beetles also pose a serious threat to plantations in other countries. Various alternatives, both ‘landscape’ and ‘control’ options, for managing leaf beetles were reviewed and evaluated by a panel of experts. Options were scored on effectiveness, feasibility for use, impact on the environment, perceived social acceptability (including by certification bodies) and perceived cost. None of the options were scored as well as broad‐spectrum insecticide for effectiveness, feasibility and perceived cost, although virtually all of the other options scored better for environmental and social outcomes. The highest ranked options were the ‘landscape’ option of tree improvement to reduce susceptibility to insect attack, and the ‘control’ option of attract‐and‐kill traps. The next three ranks were two ‘landscape’ options aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of natural enemy populations by conserving their overwintering sites and their alternative food and hosts, and then silvicultural management. The best strategy for an Integrated Pest Management programme would be a combination of ‘landscape’ options to reduce the frequency of pest outbreaks and, if outbreaks occur, spraying with biological insecticides until attract‐and‐kill traps become available, possibly in combination with repellent sprays in a push–pull strategy. If control measures fail to prevent damaging defoliation, plantations could be fertilized to encourage recovery. Because most of the alternative options are not yet available, many research directions were identified, with the highest priorities being to develop plantation stock that is less susceptible to defoliation and to develop attractants for leaf beetles.",

Although added nitrogen significantly increased soluble nitrogen content, CCI and soluble nitrogen : phosphorus ratios in the foliage of walnut seedlings, there was no effect on walnut aphid population growth. Similarly, there was no relationship between aphid density and CCI for mature trees in the field. A neutral response suggests that walnut aphid population growth on potted seedlings is limited by factors other than soluble nitrogen, such as other nutrients, amino acid composition or defensive compounds.

To protect fagaceous trees, it is necessary to understand the host selection process used by the beetle in heterogeneous forests. The occurrence of beetle attack on Quercus crispula and Castanea crenata was monitored from 2008 to 2011 in two 1-ha and one 0.5-ha plots established in a secondary forest. The stem and crown densities of each fagaceous tree species were calculated at 11 different spatial scales for each individual tree. Model application and selection were performed to clarify factors affecting the probability of attack by P. quercivorus. As shown in previous studies, a higher probability of attack was predicted for Q. crispula than for C. crenata, and the predicted probability of attack was lower for trees attacked in the previous year. The effect of stem density on the probability of attack was positive at a small (radius 5 m) spatial scale and negative at larger (radius 5–17.5 m) scales. We interpreted this to indicate that a dense distribution of fagaceous trees in a small area had a higher probability of attack, and that this probability decreased with an increasing density of fagaceous trees in a surrounding concentric area. A positive effect of crown density was detected, suggesting that P. quercivorus has a means of detecting host trees in areas with high crown densities of fagaceous species.",

In northern Italy, the most widespread exotic tree in alluvial forests is the North American Robinia pseudoacacia . We quantified the difference in species composition and abundance among saproxylic beetles of two European broad‐leaved trees, Populus alba and Quercus robur , and the exotic broad‐leaved tree Robinia pseudoacacia. We collected beetles emerging from 29 fallen trunks with a diameter of between 29 and 31 cm and belonging to the second decomposition stage. We identified 249 individuals from 25 saproxylic beetle species. Species richness and composition did not differ among tree species. Although permutational multivariate analysis of variance highlighted significant differences in species composition, linear mixed effect models showed that differences depend exclusively on spatial distances between logs and not on the host tree species. The Morisita‐Horn index and principal coordinate analysis confirmed this pattern. Thus, we found that saproxylic beetles use all dead trees available in the forest, without distinguishing between exotic or native trees but only occupying the nearest ones. From a forest management point of view, this supports the practice of leaving dead wood of exotic trees at restorations for saproxylic beetles.",

Ant–aphid associations can be mutualistic or antagonistic, with ants increasing or reducing aphid numbers. Within‐species plant variation or other herbivores may further influence these ant–aphid interactions. Okra is an economically important crop in C ameroon. Several okra varieties are grown here and attacked by the facultatively ant‐tended cotton aphid A phis gossypii . We conducted field and screenhouse experiments where plant variety, ant presence and predator access were manipulated to investigate the multitrophic interactions on okra and their effects on okra yield. In the field, ants did not protect aphids from their natural enemies and syrphid larvae reduced aphids by 42%. Additionally, aphid recruitment of ants reduced chewing herbivore damage by 11% and indirectly increased okra fruit set. We also found aphid numbers, aphid predation by syrphids and chewing herbivory to vary across okra varieties. Finally, in the screenhouse, we recorded a 24% reduction in aphid numbers on plants with ant presence. The present study highlights the importance of direct and indirect biotic interactions for pest biocontrol.

    "abstract": "Abstract Weeds are one of the most limiting factors in the commercial production of lowbush blueberries V accinium angustifolium ( E ricaceae). Sheep sorrel ( R umex acetosella ) and hairy fescue ( F estuca tenuifolia ) are prominent weeds in lowbush blueberry fields. Because the granivorous insects H arpalus rufipes ( C arabidae) and G ryllus pennsylvanicus ( G ryllidae) are common in lowbush blueberry fields when sheep sorrel and hairy fescue are dispersing seeds, we examined how granivorous insects can contribute to the biocontrol of these weeds. In the laboratory, H . rufipes and G . pennsylvanicus consumed a significant number of seeds of sheep sorrel and hairy fescue, and a field experiment found that insects probably consume a significant number of sheep sorrel and hairy fescue seeds in blueberry fields. Additional experiments found that H . rufipes was highly susceptible to field rates of phosmet and acetamiprid, although not to field rates of spirotetramat, which are insecticides that may be used in blueberry fields when the beetle is active. Natural populations of granivorous insects probably provide a valuable ecological service in commercial lowbush blueberry fields and should be conserved in the development of integrated weed management programmes.",

R ecently, the outbreak range has shifted northward and new outbreaks have been recorded in E stonia and F inland. The dynamics of the supercooling capability of pre‐imaginal stages of A . posticalis (eonymphs, pronymphs, pupae) collected from the soil in a pine forest on the I sland of S aaremaa, E stonia, were determined. The supercooling points ( SCP ) of overwintering eonymphs and pronymphs changed during the winter, although there were no significant differences between the mean SCPs of either larval stage on any measuring date. The mean SCPs decreased from O ctober (−8 to −10 ° C ) to J anuary and M arch (−15 to −17 ° C ) and increased once again in M ay (−9 to −11 ° C ). The average SCP of pupae was considerably higher (−5.3 ° C ). Overwintering larvae in the soil are potentially covered by an insulating layer of forest litter, moss and snow, thus avoiding direct exposure to low temperatures. Cold‐hardiness in both overwintering larval stages of A . posticalis is sufficient for successful survival during winter in the northern B altic region. At present, outbreaks of A . posticalis in higher latitudes are concentrated in milder maritime regions near the coast of the B altic S ea, although these may expand in the future as a result of climate warming, with the sawfly possibly becoming a serious pest of pine forests of northern E urope.",

Annatto (Bixa orellana) is a buzz-pollinated neotropical tree. We compared the pollination service provided by AHBs and native Melipona beecheii (Mb) to annatto in the Yucatan. As a result of the different abilities of both species to sonicate, a prediction of the present study is that AHBs on individual visits would result in less efficient pollinators on this crop. A higher frequency of AHBs on flowers (73.8%) compared with Mb (21.3%) was found. However, AHBs deposited significantly less pollen on the stigma and produced less fruits, with fewer seeds and weight, than Mb. A higher pollination index efficiency was obtained for Mb (0.9) compared with AHBs (0.6). AHBs did not sonicate annatto and gleaned the pollen released after Mb visits, which suggests that they act as commensals of the latter. By acting as commensals, AHBs, despite their high abundance, appear to marginally contribute to the pollination of annatto. Studies conducted under scenarios with a differential abundance of AHBs and efficient sonicating species are necessary to test this hypothesis on annatto and other buzz-pollinated plants in the neotropics.",

Individuals from two populations, selected as representative of T h. pityocampa and T h. wilkinsoni , were used to test whether hybridization is possible under controlled conditions. The hybrid offspring showed intermediate morphological and performance traits, whereas heterosis for pupal weight was detected in one of the hybrid lines. The genetic analysis confirmed the crosses. Both species have large phenological plasticity and may come into contact at the edge of their range, where they could hybridize.

Although it has been shown for plants that the diversity of communities can result in improved ecosystem functioning, it remains uncertain how the species richness of ants affects multiple ecosystem services and disservices. In the present study, we used experimentally enhanced natural gradients in ant species richness on 100 cacao trees in a plantation aiming to analyze the effect of ant species identity and species richness on predation pressure and the incidence of cacao pod borer ( CPB ), as well as the spread of black pod disease ( BPD ). Ant species richness did not significantly improve predation of experimentally exposed insects, and was not associated with a reduction in the incidence of CPB . However, the incidence of BPD was higher in ant species rich trees, presumably because more ant species were pathogen vectors. The identity of the dominant ant species affected the incidence of CPB and BPD , as well as predation pressure. Although both ant species richness and identity affected ecosystem services and disservices delivered by the ant community, the results of the present study suggest that the identity of dominant ants is the main driver for ecosystem services in these systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract For many species, dispersal among populations has profound impacts on local dynamics and the spread of outbreaks. Understanding the environmental and genetic triggers of density‐dependent dispersal is important for improving population models and developing reliable management strategies. We hypothesized that moth dispersal in the spruce budworm ( Choristoneura fumiferana Clem.) is triggered by reductions in larval food availability and mediated by the expression of the for gene, which affects movement and dispersal activity in Drosophila and other species. Late‐stage larvae were reared under different food‐limitation treatments. Dispersal of adults was assessed using three measures of flight performance on flight mills: maximum velocity, 1‐h flight distance and maximum sustained flight time. Accumulation of for transcripts was measured by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction on moths from each treatment. Flight activity was positively related to moth size and, although food limitation caused reductions in moth size, it also had an independent and positive effect on maximum velocities, sustained flight times and flight distances. Food limitation had no effect on expression of the for gene. We conclude that reductions in food availability will produce moths that are smaller but exhibit increased flight activity, potentially increasing the population of dispersing individuals. The physiological basis for this effect remains unknown.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Little is known about the relative effect of different mortality factors triggering the population dynamics of outbreaking L epidoptera (e.g. climate, natural enemies, habitat diversity), especially at the egg stage. The presence of broadleaved hedgerows bordering pine stands has been shown to reduce infestation by Thaumetopoea pityocampa ( D enis &amp; S chiffermüller, L epidoptera). This effect of habitat diversity has been proposed to result from the disruption of visual and chemical cues that the female moth uses to locate its host. In the present study, we further hypothesized that egg mortality was higher behind broadleaved hedgerows because of higher predation or parasitism, or as a result of harsher microclimatic conditions. A total of 120 egg masses obtained from laboratory rearing were exposed under three exclusion treatments (large predators, predators and parasitoids, no exclusion). Overall egg mortality was 35%. Predation was the main cause of mortality (22%). Mortality as a result of abiotic factors (abortion) was only 12%. Almost no parasitoids were observed. Overall mortality did not differ between pines bordered (or not) by deciduous hedgerows, nor did mortality differ as a result of predation or abortion. Despite an important contribution of predation to mortality in T. pityocampa eggs, the effect of deciduous hedgerows on tree infestation by this pest is more likely to result from disruption of female moth behaviour than from differential mortality.",

Suction trap captures of alate viviparous Aphis glycines in summer, and gynoparae and males in the autumn, were subjected to negative binomial regressions with environmental parameters. Models were ranked by using information‐theoretic methods to determine which parameters best explained aerial density of aphids. Multiparameter models incorporating the best parameters were constructed. Best‐fit models were used to compute peak values of each parameter, where a quadratic relationship between captures and that parameter occurred. Data were subjected to non‐metric multidimensional scaling and analysis of similarity to observe patterns in the geographical and temporal distribution of captures. Summer flight activity A. glycines was explained best by the level of aphid infestation in fields local to the trapping site, although the autumn female flight activity peak and male activity was best explained by photoperiod. Seven‐metre tall suction traps are useful for determining when flight activity of A. glycines occurs within a region.",

The data set included time series with known migration event (Bas St‐Laurent, QC, 2013), which were used to calibrate numerical thresholds associated with immigration. The study site on west coast of Newfoundland provided a natural laboratory to infer long‐range immigration due to geographic isolation from the mainland, proximity to the coast and low population density at onset of the study. Time series between 2014 and 2016 exhibited trends consistent with scenario of closed population, including low numbers of budworms, limited variation in day‐to‐day abundance and strong level of protandry (males fly seasonally earlier than females). Time series with candidate major immigration event (Bas St‐Laurent 2013, Sally's Cove 2017, 2018) displayed specific combinations of parameters, including: (a) sharp increment (&gt;one order of magnitude) in abundance of both males and females from one day to the next (statistical mode, approximately corresponding to timing of migration); (b) pure (100%) convergence of pulse detection interval (post‐immigration period when migrants with nonzero survival rate are collected at light traps) across traps for males and females and (c) overall absence of protandrous flight. Parameters related to immigration thresholds highlighted that females are more likely to migrate than males, as indicated by increased ratio of females per male during pulse detection interval. Aerial collection of adult spruce budworms with helikite in 2019 confirmed the preponderance of females among true migrants.",

No study has provided clear reports regarding the effects of temperature on the development and reproduction of Thrips flavus Schrank (Thysanoptera: Thripidae). Our aim was to study whether the population dynamics of T. flavus were affected by temperatures. Thus, the development, reproduction and growth of T. flavus populations reared on soybean leaves were studied at five different constant temperatures. The temperature and rate of development from eggs to adults were linearly related between 19 and 31°C. The developmental threshold temperature and effective accumulated temperature were 11.60°C and 273.89 degree‐days for the whole generation. The viability of adult survival decreased with the increase in temperature between 19 and 31°C. The value of life expectancy of females ranged from 7.47 days (at 31°C) to 16.66 days (at 22°C), while the life expectancy value of males ranged from 5.33 days (at 19 and 31°C) to 17.0 days (at 25°C). The mean fecundity per female was highest at 19°C, with 7.85 eggs/day. The intrinsic rate of increase was the highest (0.102) at 31°C. The results obtained indicate that temperature is a key factor associated with the development and reproduction of T. flavus on soybean.",

Woodlot area, landscape context (isolation and landscape heterogeneity), and syntaxonomic heterogeneity explained most of the differences among habitats (non‐linear vs . linear) in wild bee abundance and species richness, regardless of the habitat type.

In a factorial experiment conducted for one year in pesticide‐free orchards, we analysed the effects of three common plant species ( Capsella bursa‐pastoris Medik., Veronica persica Poir. and Vicia sativa L.) in association with apple trees on parasitoid wasp recruitment and parasitism of one major apple pest, Dysaphis plantaginea (Passerini). We combined morphological and molecular identifications to characterize the parasitoid communities associated with each plant species. Parasitoid communities were different between plant species. Plant effects on the abundance of the parasitoid wasps did not depend on the amount of floral resources provided by the tested plants. Over the whole season, the parasitoid wasp species Ephedrus persicae (Froggatt) and Aphidius matricariae (Haliday) involved in D. plantaginea parasitism accounted for 6% of the total parasitoid abundance and were mainly associated with V. persica plots. We observed a higher parasitism rate in apple trees associated with V. persica and a lower number of aphid colonies in apple trees associated with V. sativa . However, plant treatments had no effect on the abundance of D. plantaginea or on generalist predators and ant occurrences in aphid colonies.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the anti‐predator defensive behaviour of two economically important pests, Scrobipalpa cf. ocellatella and Autographa cf. gamma (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae and Noctuidae, respectively), and the effectiveness of this behaviour in combination with their body size. During our laboratory experiments, the caterpillars of these species defended themselves against predators using body tremors, striking the predator with the anterior part of the body and secretion (for A. cf. gamma ) or regurgitation (for S. cf. ocellatella ). Interestingly, the defensive behaviour itself had no effect on hunting success. Instead, the killing of caterpillars depended mainly on the variance in their body size. Our results suggest that predatory lacewing larvae can be effective predators of the caterpillars S. cf. ocellatella and A. cf. gamma due to their ability to overcome their defensive behaviour. However, field experiments will be necessary to determine the effectiveness of lacewings as biocontrol agent.",

We hypothesise that successive generations of an insecticide‐resistant lady beetle population, under constant physical conditions and fed alternative prey, could compromise its quality as a natural enemy. Adaptive costs of resistance are particularly high in insecticide‐resistant populations. The predatory lady beetle, Eriopis connexa (Germar), exhibits resistance to λ‐cyhalothrin (EcViR), and others pyrethroids. We compared the biological and predatory traits of the EcViR population to those of a field‐collected and susceptible population (EcCV). During 35 days of observations, when females from both populations faced food shortages, EcViR females demonstrated higher fecundity and similar survival rates. Predation of the aphid, Lipaphis pseudobrassicae (Davis), resulted in a similar response for both populations and greater aphid consumption by EcViR beetles in the presence of λ‐cyhalothrin residue. Rearing larvae and adults at three constant temperatures (18, 25, and 32°C) resulted in similar developmental times between populations, but adult EcCV beetles were larger and produced more eggs at 25 and 32°C. The results show that food shortages did not affect the reproductive output or the developmental time at 18, 25, and 32°C in EcViR compared with EcCV. Nevertheless, egg production at 25 and 32°C was lower for EcViR females than for EcCV. Among the studied traits, only an effect on fecundity was observed, as predicted previously, due to the adaptive cost of resistance in EcViR, which became more evident at higher temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Rice is a staple food for more than half of the world's population and provides around 20% of the plant‐based calories consumed by humans. Pentatomoids are important in Neotropical rice paddies because they group several main crop pests. A better understanding of the relationships between these species and crop traits influencing their abundance is needed to generate pest prediction tools and crop management strategies. Here, we present information on the abundance and richness of Pentatomoidea concerning relevant crop characteristics: phenology, seasons (temporal), rice cultivars and plot zones (local). This allowed us to measure whether these crop traits influenced the abundance of this group of insects throughout the rice growing cycle in early and late‐sown plots. We also included an analysis of trophic guilds and species crop importance to account for potential pests. We found that three crop traits stood out as the most critical in determining the interactions of phytophagous pentatomoids with rice plants and that early planting helps to reduce insect abundance in paddies. Our results also show that the stem‐feeding guild concentrated the highest number of species, of which one is a main pest, and three are potential pests reported in other countries but have yet to be found in Argentina. Given the importance of the stem‐feeding guild in rice paddies, it is necessary to develop monitoring to determine whether any of these potential pest species could replace the main crop pests, especially under climate change scenarios that could provide the right conditions for the emergence of new pests.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The dried bean beetle, Acanthoscelides obtectus , is a serious pest of legume crops, particularly Phaseolus vulgaris beans, and its management is challenging due to the beetle's cryptic larval stage. The major male‐produced pheromone of A. obtectus is methyl ( E,R )‐2,4,5‐tetradecatrienoate, crucial for female attraction, with the ( S )‐enantiomer emitted in smaller amounts ( R:S ca. 9:1). Despite its identification half a century ago, it is still not commercially available for bruchid surveillance due to production and stability issues, with gaps in our knowledge relating to the bioactivity of the stereoisomers. We thus aim to clarify the behavioural specificity of the ( R )‐ and ( S )‐enantiomers of methyl ( E )‐2,4,5‐tetradecatrienoate, along with two commercially available isomers (methyl myristoleate and methyl myristate). Electrophysiological (EAG) assays with unmated females show that stereochemically pure methyl ( E,R )‐2,4,5‐tetradecatrienoate is EAG‐active alone or when part of the natural 9:1 or the racemic 1:1 blends, whereas the stereochemically pure ( S )‐enantiomer is inactive. Moreover, the structural analogues do not elicit significant EAG responses. Unmated females give positive behavioural responses in the olfactometer only to methyl ( E,R )‐2,4,5‐tetradecatrienoate, but not to its antipode or the structural analogues. Furthermore, stereochemically pure methyl ( E,R )‐2,4,5‐tetradecatrienoate elicits the same level of behavioural activity as the 9:1 blend. Curiously, the presence of the ( S )‐enantiomer in equal proportions synergizes female preference for stereochemically pure ( R ). These findings provide a better understanding of the pheromone biology of A. obtectus and create a platform for the development of pheromone trap‐based surveillance with racemic methyl ( E )‐2,4,5‐tetradecatrienoate.",

Nevertheless, pollinating beetles are little studied compared to other pollinators, even though they play a key role in forest plant reproduction. In this study, we model the population dynamics of Eusphalerum , a predominant pollinating beetle genus in northeastern North American forests, to improve our understanding of this abundant taxon. The models were derived from beetle samples collected using flight‐intercept traps from 2015 to 2022 across various forest habitats in Eastern Canada. We also examined whether this genus was exhibiting congeneric aggregation and intergeneric aggregation patterns. In this study, 113,563 beetles from 606 species were collected. Congeneric aggregation was excessively high in Eusphalerum , while intergeneric aggregation with all other pollinating and non‐pollinating beetles was low. Eusphalerum populations peaked in early July and were mainly influenced by elevation as well as years, and little by habitat variables such as forest composition and management. Eusphalerum was more abundant in high‐elevation northern regions, a territory not coveted by dominant pollinator species because of the harsher climate and shorter growing seasons. This study represents a first step towards a better understanding of this abundant forest pollinator and how it varies at the landscape scale.",

It is native to Eurasia and was introduced in North America in 2012 and in South America in 2016. In South America, it has progressively increased its distribution, causing problems in the exportation of pears and apples that have resulted in significant economic losses. The climates of the areas recently invaded and of the regions where it is established in Eurasia were compared and ecological niche models were built to evaluate if it has gone through a niche shift while invading the Americas, to identify where there are suitable conditions for its establishment in South America in the present and in the future. Results indicate that M. unicostata has conserved its climatic niche while invading South America but has not been conservative while invading North America. Therefore, an increase in its distribution in North America could occur if it continues to broaden the range of environmental conditions it occupies. Evidence indicates that M. unicostata is not in equilibrium in South America, suggesting that it is likely to continue spreading its distribution to other countries. Therefore, it is advisable to implement monitoring programs to prevent its further expansion or ensure early detection. Maxent models indicate the environmental conditions allow the spread of M. unicostata to all Argentinean provinces and Chilean regions as well as to neighbouring countries. Future climatic scenarios forecast that the suitable areas will remain in similar locations but will expand in extent.",

One of the many advantages of leks is the possibility to efficiently assess the quality of potential mates by comparing aggregated individuals of the same sex with one another. When direct mate choice occurs in a lekking species, it is often exhibited by females, but some studies have also demonstrated the presence of male mate choice. We investigate mate choice in the lek‐forming European woodwasp, Sirex noctilio . We determine the importance of age and size as predictors of mating success. We demonstrate that mating is not random and that male and female traits affect mating success. Age plays an important role in mating success in both males and females, with older males mating more and younger females being more attractive and more receptive to mating. Relative male size seems to play a role in mating success, with males being more successful when attempting to mate with females that are larger than they are.",

Agronomic practices that support beneficial insect populations are important for sustainable crop production. We installed 13 floral strips next to agricultural fields in 2019 and then monitored beneficial insects on field edges and within fields 1–3 years after establishment. Treatments included strip, control (crop fields with naturally occurring vegetation) and unmanaged natural sites (no crop or enhancement). Ground beetle active density and Shannon diversity were greater within strips in 2020 but declined to similar levels as control sites in 2021. Though no effect of treatment was found, bees were more abundant in strips compared to other treatments. Both bee abundance and diversity at strip sites increased over time. Syrphid abundance and diversity were not affected by treatment. Spillover of bees into adjacent blooming and non‐blooming crops was twice as high in strip fields as the control comparisons, though no differences in spillover were found between treatments for syrphids or ground beetles. Floral strips increased the abundance of pollinators within adjacent crops, including blooming canola, which may lead to increased ecosystem services within crops.

In this study, we compared aphid communities in two microhabitats (tree canopy and orchard alley) in commercial apple orchards under organic and integrated pest management (IPM), in relation to aphidophagous predator abundance at three stages of the growing season: early fruit development, fruit maturity and post‐harvest. 3. We sampled eight organic and eight IPM apple orchards in eastern Germany using standardised canopy beating of apple trees and suction sampling in the orchard alleys. 4. Our results indicate no significant differences in aphid infestation between organic and IPM orchards, regardless of the sampled microhabitat. However, aphid communities in the tree canopy of organic orchards exhibited greater evenness across species than those of IPM orchards. Eriosoma lanigerum consistently dominated canopy aphid communities across both management systems, highlighting the need for targeted management practices for this pest. Additionally, aphidophagous predator abundance in the tree canopy increased over time and showed a positive association with aphid abundance. Aphid community structure varied significantly across sampling periods and microhabitats. Differences between organic and IPM orchards were observed during the early fruit development phase in orchard alleys, with higher levels of infestation in organic orchards. Aphid taxa such as Macrosiphum euphorbiae , Dysaphis spp., Aphis spiraecola and Rhopalosiphum insertum contributed to these differences. 5. Our findings provide a better understanding of the temporal dynamics of aphid communities in apple orchards in eastern Germany, highlighting the importance of microhabitats and host plant phenology.",

We calculated inter‐annual variation for 31 species, and the date of peak abundance and length of the flight season for 18 species. We found that for the 23 species for which we had phylogenetic information, larger moths and those with adult colour variation showed less inter‐annual abundance variation, which corroborates the results of previous studies. We found no indication that phenological traits are associated with the tested species traits. However, species that can feed on the dominant broad‐leaved tree in which the traps were placed ( Quercus petraea ) tended to have a later date of peak abundance than other species.

Beetles contribute to the spread of the disease by extruding fungus‐infected wood particles (frass). Disease mitigation can benefit from knowledge of ambrosia beetle life‐history and fungal survival in affected ‘ōhi‘a. We investigated temporal associations among tree death, the timing and duration of beetle attacks, and the persistence of viable C. lukuohia within intentionally infected (inoculated) ʻōhiʻa at three sites that approximate the elevational range of the disease on the Island of Hawaiʻi. Beetles most frequently attacked inoculated trees at the time when foliage first showed symptoms of infection (yellow leaves; n = 9) although some attacks were observed during earlier (green leaf; n = 3) and later (brown leaf; n = 3) stages of symptom progression. On average, beetles initiated new attacks for nearly one year after trees were inoculated. We tracked active galleries of Xyleborinus saxesenii , Xyleborus ferrugineus and Xyleborus simillimus and found they produced frass with viable C. lukuohia propagules for 122.8 ± 40.0, 275.8 ± 32.7 and 304.2 ± 53.4 days, respectively. Infected ʻōhiʻa felled from our mid‐elevation site at the end of the study revealed viable fungal propagules and the presence of X. ferrugineus over two years after trees first appeared symptomatic of infection, suggesting that Ceratocystis wilt of ʻōhiʻa remains a threat to spread from infected trees long after trees succumb to the disease.",

We examined the upper lethal thresholds (ULT; at which 50% of the insects died), the lower lethal threshold (LLT; the super cooling point) and development time at 15, 20 and 25°C of Gonipterus sp. n. 2 and its biological control agent, A. nitens , collected from high and coastal populations. Gonipterus sp. n. 2 adults had higher ULT's and LLT's than A. nitens adults across populations. The coastal population of A. nitens had a higher ULT than the inland population. No further evidence of local adaptation was detected. Results indicate a climatic mismatch between Gonipterus sp. n. 2 and A. nitens consistent with observed patterns of pest outbreaks .

The aim of this study was to identify the beetle species associated with Ceratocystis ‐infected trees and to assess their potential role in dispersing C. manginecans . Beetle and frass samples were collected from Ceratocystis ‐infected compartments of Acacia and Eucalyptus propagated as monocultures in Riau, Indonesia, either by using traps or by direct collection from infected trees. The samples were screened for the presence and viability of Ceratocystis propagules using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction‐high‐resolution melting analysis (qPCR‐HRMA) diagnostic tool and a carrot baiting technique, respectively. Fourteen beetle species, predominantly collected from traps, representing nine genera of the Scolytinae and Nitidulidae , were identified from the two plantation types. The qPCR tool detected the presence of Ceratocystis DNA on 13 of the 14 beetle species at concentrations as low as 0.015–0.0019 ng. However, viable Ceratocystis propagules could not be recovered from these beetles using culture‐based methods. Of the 105 frass samples screened, qPCR detected Ceratocystis DNA in 67 samples; however, only one Ceratocystis isolate was obtained using the carrot baiting method. The results of this study suggest that the beetles and beetle frass can harbour Ceratocystis propagules, as indicated by the detection of fungal DNA.

Despite their acknowledged importance, they are to this day largely understudied, especially concerning their community ecology. We compared communities of pentatomoid bugs, representing many pest species, and their respective egg parasitoids between farmland ecotones—comprising the initial rows of apple orchard and bordering hedges—and semi‐natural ecotones. A focus was laid on Trissolcus japonicus , an exotic and newly introduced parasitoid of Halyomorpha halys . We also investigated the total communities of hymenopteran parasitoids and potential arthropod hosts, expecting increased diversity in semi‐natural ecotones for both. Trissolcus japonicus was not detected, whereas Trissolcus mitsukurii , another exotic parasitoid of Halyomorpha halys , was found only in farmland ecotones, reflecting its host's primary distribution. Pentatomoid bugs were more abundant in farmland ecotones, while their specialized parasitoids were equally distributed between both ecotones. Arthropod richness was higher in semi‐natural ecotones, while parasitoid diversity scored higher in farmland ecotones, suggesting that farmland ecotones represent a suitable environment for diverse parasitoid communities. Furthermore, the communities of both potential hosts and parasitoids were correlated, as evidenced by parasitoid‐host co‐occurrences in both habitats. Our study emphasizes the role of different habitat types in maintaining diverse parasitoid communities and underlines the high value of hedges along field margins in agroecosystems. Further research on species–habitat networks, as well as parasitoid‐host co‐occurrences, is needed for optimizing habitat management and ensuring sustainable pest regulation.",

However, the role of forest fragments in the provision of ecosystem services for agroecosystems, such as biological control, is still not well understood. This study analyses the relationship between tree diversity and arthropod communities in forest fragments and adjacent sugarcane fields around Jaboticabal (São Paulo, Brazil) to evaluate the benefits of preserving Atlantic Forest fragments. We tested the hypotheses: (1) arthropod diversity and the abundance of key functional groups in forest fragments are favoured by tree diversity, (2) diversity and abundance of these functional groups in sugarcane fields depend on adjacent forests and (3) the insect community composition of forest fragments and sugarcane fields is similar due to spillover effects. Arthropods were sampled in 10 forest fragments over 2 years (2020 and 2022) using traps (Malaise, yellow pan) and direct tree sampling. We identified arthropods to morphospecies (2020) and family level (2022) and associated families to functional groups. We found that the quality of forest fragments, particularly tree species richness, was positively related to forest arthropod richness and frequency (occupied samples) of functional groups involved in ecosystem services such as predators, but also of phytophagous insects. There was also a strong positive correlation between insect family richness and functional groups of forest fragments and adjacent sugarcane fields, indicating potential spillover and spatial connectivity between habitats. Although insect community composition was significantly different between forest fragments and sugarcane fields, NMDS ordination revealed partial overlap of family communities, suggesting many shared taxa in both habitats. This study highlights the importance of diverse forest fragments in preserving insect biodiversity and related ecosystem services in tropical agricultural landscapes and advocates for the conservation and restoration of these habitats. However, the benefits in terms of crop damage reduction and yields remain to be confirmed.",

Acalolepta aesthetica females oviposited on all tested species in no‐choice trials, but larvae growing within ʻōhiʻa ( Metrosideros polymorpha Gaudich.) and koa ( Acacia koa A. Gray) died. It therefore poses a low risk to these two tree species, which are foundational to Hawaiian native forests. Acalolepta aesthetica was able to complete its development within ʻōlapa ( Cheirodendron trigynum (Gaudich.) A. Heller), which could be monitored if the distribution of A. aesthetica spreads to native forests. The host species preferred by A. aesthetica are highly valued for agricultural, horticultural and cultural uses. Developing monitoring and management techniques for this cerambycid and employing strong biosecurity could prevent human‐mediated spread and limit negative impacts to other Hawaiian Islands, the U.S. mainland, and the world.",

Apart from its native range, this species has been recorded infesting pine trees in Italy [Campania (island of Ischia) and Marche regions], Croatia, and recently in Australia. While not a severe pest in its native habitat, M. hellenica has been found to negatively impact pines in the invaded regions. Neoleucopis kartliana (Tanasijtshuk) (Diptera: Chamaemyiidae), a key natural enemy of M. hellenica in its native range, was introduced from Greece to Ischia as a biological control agent. In the current study, Neoleucopis populations from 22 sites across Greece and six sites from Ischia were examined using DNA barcoding and morphological traits to determine their identities and elucidate their distributions in Greece. This integrated approach allowed the separation of three genetically diverged mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages within Neoleucopis , leading to the conclusion via morphology that there were possibly two additional mtDNA lineages besides that of N. kartliana . The three Neoleucopis mtDNA lineages were unevenly distributed in Greece, and all individuals screened from Ischia were identified as the N. kartliana mtDNA lineage. These findings highlighted the need for further taxonomic work and provide a deeper insight into the diversity and distribution of Neoleucopis mtDNA lineages in their natural range and Ischia, which are essential for optimising biological control strategies against M. hellenica in other regions.",

The vertical movements of these pest insects in the soil make the timing of control measures a difficult task. The forecast model SIMAGRIO‐W utilizes soil temperature and moisture data to predict the migration of Agriotes wireworms to the upper soil layer. The model distinguishes between two risk levels: low risk (less than 30% of the wireworm population in the upper soil layer) and high risk (more than 30%), which are considered adequate for practical purposes. In German field sites, the model demonstrated an 80% success rate across four soil types. The SIMAGRIO‐W model was tested under the warm and dry climate in eastern Austria. The validation process revealed an overall accuracy of just 46%, primarily due to the fact that SIMAGRIO‐W assumes a maximum activity level for wireworms at 11°C. However, high activity levels were observed at soil temperatures of up to 26°C at the experimental sites. The discrepancy in the prediction power of the model between the German and Austrian field sites may be explained by differences in temperature tolerance between the Agriotes species occurring in eastern Austria (e.g. A. ustulatus) and in western Germany (e.g. A. obscurus ). Our findings demonstrate that the thermal preferences of different wireworm species must be taken into account to make the SIMAGRIO‐W model a widely applicable decision support tool for predicting vertical movements of Agriotes wireworms.",

Chemical control remains the primary management strategy, but concerns over pesticide resistance and environmental impact underscore the need for sustainable alternatives. Companion planting has shown potential for pest suppression by modifying vegetation structure, influencing insect populations through top‐down and/or bottom‐up effects. This study investigated whether maize planted at soybean field edges could reduce major pest populations, including R. pedestris , and enhance biodiversity. Field experiments were conducted in seven small soybean fields, comparing monoculture soybean plots (four replicates) with those bordered by maize (three replicates). Arthropod densities were monitored from July to November 2022. The densities of R. pedestris nymphs and adults were significantly lower in maize treatment plots (peak: 0.37 per planting hole on 5 and 16 September, and 0.60 per planting hole on 7 October, respectively), than in control plots (peak: 0.74 and 1.13 per planting hole on 18 August, respectively). Furthermore, densities of whitefly (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) were also lower in maize treatment plots. However, the densities of other organisms, including herbivores and natural enemies, and their biodiversity or evenness indices did not significantly differ between treatments. These results suggest that maize may act as a physical or chemical barrier, limiting pest movement and reducing R. pedestris and whitefly densities through bottom‐up effects in soybean fields. Maize appears to be a promising companion plant for pest management in soybean cultivation.",

Controlled release devices that use a plastic tube or polymer to regulate the emission of pheromone have been registered for use in Canada for controlling this pest.

Two application schedules of sprayable pheromone were tested during 1997 and two formulations of sprayable pheromone were tested during 1998. The mating disruption efficiency of the pheromone treatments was compared using pheromone‐baited traps and the efficacy of the pheromone and insecticide treatments was compared by inspecting grape clusters for feeding injury caused by grape berry moth larvae. 3 The estimated mating disruption efficiency of the pheromone treatments ranged from 67 to 100%. There was no difference in the efficiency of the two application schedules of 3M Sprayable Pheromone during 1997. The estimated efficiency of Isomate ® GBM was greater than that of 3M Sprayable Pheromone during the first two flights of 1997. During 1998, the estimated efficiency of 3M Sprayable Pheromone and Isomate ® GBM was similar. 4 The average percentage of grape clusters with grape berry moth feeding injury was greater in the border than in the interior zone on 13 ocassions, and greater in the interior zone than in the border zone of experimental plots on six of the 72 occasions when clusters were inspected during the 2‐year study. 5 The average percentage of grape clusters with feeding injury was similar in plots treated with 3M Sprayable Pheromone, Isomate ® GBM and insecticide during both years of the study. There was no difference in feeding injury in plots treated with 3M Sprayable Pheromone and Isomate ® GBM, despite the greater estimated mating disruption efficiency of Isomate ® GBM. 6 The use of sprayable pheromone may have several operational and cost advantages compared with a hand‐applied dispensing system such as Isomate ® GBM.",

    "abstract": "If, like me, your mother continues to interfere in your life, far beyond her genetic contribution to your phenotype, then you may be sympathetic to the concept of maternal effects and their influence upon organismal ecology. Non-Mendelian maternal effects describe the transfer of information from the maternal environment to the phenotype of offspring (Mousseau & Fox, 1998). In essence, many aspects of the parental environment (climate, food quality, natural enemies) can influence the allocation of resources by parents to offspring and the quality of parental care. Before you scream ‘Lamarck’ and run for your copy of The Selfish Gene (Dawkins 1976), non-Mendelian maternal effects do not result in heritable (genetic) change in offspring. Rather, they describe the contribution of the parental environment to phenotypic variation in progeny. What does this have to do with the population ecology of agricultural and forest pests? My interest in maternal effects was reawakened recently at the combined meeting of the Royal Entomological Society and the International Union of Forestry Research Organizations in Aberdeen, Scotland (September 2001). At the meeting, I heard two presentations in which the expression of maternal effects could be inferred to explain patterns of population change in pest insects. In the first presentation, Werner Baltensweiler described the analysis of 50 years of data on the larch budmoth, Zieraphera diniana (Baltensweiler & Rubli, 1999). The larch budmoth has been considered to provide a classic case of population cycles driven by insect-mediated changes in plant quality (Baltensweiler, 1984; Baltensweiler & Fischlin, 1988). Declines in needle size and nitrogen concentration during budmoth outbreaks have been thought to provide the time-lagged negative feedback necessary to drive population cycles. However, at the conference, Baltensweiler reported that it may not be that simple. Towards the end of his 50-year dataset, reductions in needle size were not apparent during outbreaks, yet cycles continued as before. Having previously discounted the influence of natural enemies on population cycles, Baltensweiler suggested that time-lagged maternal effects may be responsible for cyclic dynamics. In a second presentation, Vince Nealis reported that the overwintering survival of spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) larvae was a major factor in population declines of budworm at the end of outbreaks. Budworm larvae hatch in the autumn and generally do not feed before entering winter diapause (Royama, 1992). Consequently, their resources for surviving the winter are provided entirely by the maternal provisioning of eggs. Nealis noted that declines in winter survival were associated with changes in the species composition of forest stands from which one might conclude (at least, I did) that changes in maternal diet may be responsible for changes in egg provisioning and subsequent declines in larval survival. The tremendous effort that has gone in to the collection of long-term data on spruce budworm and larch budmoth has yielded tantalizing glimpses of the possible action of maternal effects in pest population dynamics. Because few of us have collected population datasets even approaching the length of these classics, we have to hope that there exist faster ways to assess the prevalence of maternal effects in our own systems of study. Here, I explore what we know to date about the action of maternal effects and their potential to influence pest population dynamics. Maternal effects are ubiquitous in natural and managed ecological systems (Bernardo, 1996; Mousseau & Fox, 1998a). Organisms as diverse as baboons (Alberts, 1994), barnacles (Holm et al., 2000) and salamanders (Collazo, 1993) all exhibit maternal effects on offspring performance. The term ‘maternal effect’ is generally used as a shorthand for non-Mendelian parental effects, which can include contributions from the father as well as from the mother. For example, environmentally determined variation in the quality of male ejaculate as a resource for females would be considered as a paternal effect (Savalli & Fox, 1998) if it influenced the phenotype of offspring. For simplicity, I will stick with current convention and use the phrase ‘maternal effect’ to describe all non-Mendelian parental effects of both maternal and paternal origin. The forms and consequences of maternal effects are remarkably varied. A few of my favourites from the recent literature include maternal effects upon the size of cultured edible snails (Dupont-Nivet et al., 1997) and the glancing rate of infant baboons (Alberts, 1994). I was also amused to discover that both hormones and vaginocervical stimulation are required for the induction of maternal behaviour in sheep (Kendrick & Keverne, 1991). Of course, not every trait expressed by offspring is influenced by maternal effects. I am happy to report that male licking behaviour does not appear to have a maternal component, at least in Drosophila (Welbergen & Van Dijken, 1992). However, many of the traits that we do know to be important for population dynamics (Rossiter, 1991a, 1992, 1994; Ginzburg & Taneyhill, 1994; Benton et al., 2001) and rates of evolutionary change (Bernardo, 1996; Rossiter, 1996, 1997; Mousseau & Fox, 1998a; Wolf et al., 1999; Brodie & Agrawal, 2001) have strong maternal effects components. These include offspring survival, dispersal, growth rate, diapause and fecundity. There is also growing evidence that some maternal effects are not simply the accidental transmission of environmental information from one generation to the next. Rather, in many cases, the form and function of maternal effects appear to have been shaped by natural selection (Mousseau & Fox, 1998b). In many organisms, a female's environment provides a reliable indicator of the environmental conditions that her progeny will encounter. In such cases, maternal effects may evolve as mechanisms for transgenerational phenotypic plasticity, whereby, in response to a predictive environmental cue, a mother can change the type of eggs that she makes or can programme a developmental switch in her offspring, which produces offspring prepared for the environmental conditions predicted by the cue (Fox et al., 1999a). The first to recognize the potential for maternal effects to influence population dynamics were Wellington (1957) and Leslie (1959). Both pointed out that the phenotypic traits expressed by individuals within populations could vary among generations, leading to variation in susceptibility to environmental challenges. For example, Wellington (1957) tracked variation in the behaviour and performance of western tent caterpillars, Malacosoma pluviale, through different stages of population growth and concluded that dynamics were influenced by the changing quality of individuals. He developed this theme in subsequent work (Wellington, 1960, 1964) and came to the conclusion that population biologists ‘sometimes act as though they … have forgotten the animals from which their disciplines sprang’ (Wellington, 1977). In other words, populations are not lumps of phenotypically identical protoplasm that remain invariant within and among years. Maternal effects provide a mechanism by which the environment in a given year is expressed in the phenotypic variation of offspring in subsequent years (Rossiter, 1994) and therefore provide a route of delayed negative feedback (Berryman, 1999). It is well established that delayed density dependence can destabilize population dynamics and promote cyclic dynamics (Schaffer & Kot, 1986; Turchin, 1990; Royama, 1992). Exactly how is environmental information transferred between parental and offspring generations? One mechanism by which females influence the phenotype of their progeny is through heterogeneity in egg quality, in which females vary egg size and egg provisioning (Rossiter, 1991a,b; McIntyre & Gooding, 2000). Mothers who provide significant resources to their offspring by provisioning their eggs are essentially transmitting components of their own environment to that of their offspring in an oocytic ‘packed lunch’, and differential allocation by mothers of resources to eggs has become a classic example of a maternal effect (Rossiter, 1991a,b; Gliwicz & Guisande, 1992; Rossiter et al., 1993; Rolff, 1999). In some cases, the transmission of maternal environment to the offspring may simply reflect the non-adaptive legacy of previous conditions. Overall reductions in egg provisioning or larval performance when mothers are reared in poor environments provide examples of this type of maternal effect in insects (Gould, 1988; Jann & Ward, 1999; McIntyre & Gooding, 2000). The tragedy of ‘crack babies’ provides an example from humans. Nevertheless, maternal effects are not always the passive transmission of good or bad parental experiences to offspring. Egg provisioning in many species is a plastic trait in which environmental conditions influence the expression of the trade-off between egg size and egg number. In such cases, adaptive changes in resource allocation to offspring under varying environmental conditions can be considered as a form of flexibility in ‘family planning’. For example, Daphnia mothers grown under conditions of low food availability produce a few large offspring that are able to withstand some degree of starvation. In contrast, mothers grown under conditions of high food availability produce many more offspring that are not resistant to starvation (Gliwicz & Guisande, 1992), presumably because their offspring are unlikely to encounter significant food deprivation. In a similar kind of study, Kim & Thorp (2001) report that the solitary bee, Megachile apicalis, varies seasonally the allocation of resources to eggs. Spring females produce many small offspring, whereas summer females produce a few larger offspring. The production of large offspring later in the season is considered to increase the probability of overwintering survival. Recent work suggests that maternal effects acting upon the egg size/egg number trade-off may be adaptive primarily for the mother, increasing her fitness at the expense of offspring fitness (Einum & Fleming, 2000). Of course, parental care can extend well beyond the provisioning of eggs, and much of that care can be envisaged as a sort of protracted ‘packed lunch’. At its most simple, post-hatch care can include the provisioning of resources for larvae in the absence of contact with the parent (dinner is in the fridge, so to speak). However, the resources provided need not always be nutritional. For example, when females of the desert tenebrionid, Parastizopus armaticeps, are provided with supplementary food, they do not increase allocation to their young. Rather, they spend less time foraging and more time aiding males in digging natal burrows. The depth of natal burrows is related to larval survival because deep burrows reduce the probability of desiccation (Rasa, 1998). In this case, moisture rather than food represents the currency of the maternal effect, even though the availability of food for the mother initiates the effect. The longer-term consequences of parental provisioning can be dramatic. For example, larvae of the long-horned dung beetle Onthophagus taurus are provided with fragments of dung before the departure of their parents. In a fascinating example of a paternal effect, males that aid females in the provisioning process produce sons with horns, whereas males that do not help provision the nest produce males without horns. The extra dung provided by the helpful males is sufficient to induce horn production in their male offspring (Hunt & Simmons, 2000). The effects of such paternally determined variation in morphology for the population ecology of the beetles is unclear, but is very likely to influence the competitive ability of male beetles. In other words, maternal effects can influence the phenotype of offspring well beyond the first few days or weeks of life. In the outbreak insect, Epirrita autumnata, maternal environment still influences the consumption and growth of fifth-instar larvae and their subsequent pupal mass (Alonso et al., 2001). Given that pupal mass is a reliable indicator of fecundity in E. autumnata, maternal effects have a clear potential to influence population growth. The pupal mass of Papilio butterflies is also influenced by maternal diet (Thompson et al., 1990). Maternal effects can be of even longer duration. For example, egg-to-adult viability in Drosophila serrata is dependent upon both maternal and grandmaternal effects (Hercus & Hoffmann, 2000). Similarly, the ‘telescoping generations’ of many aphids, whereby the development of grandchildren commences within the grandmaternal body (Mousseau & Dingle, 1991), provides a substantial time-lag between the current environment and the expression of phenotype in offspring. Lest we consider grandparental effects as unique to insects, studies have shown that the mass of deer fawns and their susceptibility to wolf predators is a function of both maternal and grandmaternal environment (Mech et al., 1991). The life-history traits that are influenced by maternal effects are many and diverse (Mousseau & Dingle, 1991). For example, maternal effects have been invoked to explain variation in fly mating behaviour (Mangan, 1991), adult morphology (Bryant & Meffert, 1998), the choice of pupation site (Bauer & Sokolowski, 1988) and the competitive ability of offspring (McIntyre & Gooding, 2000). Maternal effects are the most important determinant of head width in alfalfa leafcutting bees, Megachile rotundata (Owen & McCorquodale, 1994) and a significant contributor to variation in the body size of adult carabid beetles (Desender, 1989). Maternal effects may be mediated by the interaction of mothers with natural enemies in the environment. For example, in the damselfly Coenagrion puella, a high ectoparasite load (Acari: Arrenurus cuspidator) on mothers stimulates the production of fewer, larger offspring (Rolff, 1999). Although the adaptive value, if any, of this maternal response is unclear, changes in offspring size and number have the potential to influence damselfly population dynamics. Within a single clutch of eggs, some female insects may allocate resources differentially depending upon the risk of predation. Female shield bugs, Elasmucha ferrugata, allocate more resources to individual eggs with low risk of predation than they do to eggs with a higher risk of predation (Mappes et al., 1997). In this case, female shield bugs guard their eggs from predators and are more likely to lose eggs from the edge of clutches than from the clutch interior (Mappes et al., 1997; Kudo, 2001). Central eggs are significantly larger than those at the periphery of the mass. Of course, maternal effects can also act to delay the response of individuals to immediate predation risk in the environment. For example, soldier production by the eusocial bamboo aphid, Pseudoregma bambucicola, cannot adjust immediately to an increase in predator abundance because the fate of developing eggs within the mother's body appears to be determined by prior environmental experience (Shibao, 1999). This time-lag in response to environmental conditions is precisely the kind of effect that can influence subsequent population fluctuations. The natural enemies of insects are themselves subject to maternal effects, and such effects have the potential to influence the population dynamics of both enemies and their prey. For example, the efficacy of the parasitoid Muscidifurax raptor declines rapidly in laboratory culture, in part because the fecundity of the parasitoid is largely determined by non-genetic maternal effects (Geden et al., 1992). Similarly, both development time and body mass of the pentatomid predators, Podisus maculiventris and Podisus nigrispinus, are influenced by maternal effects (Legaspi & O'Neil, 1994; Mohaghegh et al., 1998a,b). Dispersal, a key component of population change, can be influenced dramatically by maternal effects, and two pathways appear to be responsible. First, the environment experienced by the mother can influence the tendency of her offspring to disperse (Messina, 1993; Dingle & Winchell, 1997; Massot & Clobert, 1995; Diss et al., 1996). Second, maternal environment can affect the probability that the offspring will survive the dispersal process (Morse & Stephens, 1996). Examples of the former abound in the literature. Alate production by aphids is a classic case in which the environment of the mother (climate, density and food quality) influences the phenotype and dispersal ability of her offspring (Dixon, 1971; Mittler, 1973; Harrewijn, 1978; Messina, 1993). I doubt that many would argue that the production of winged adults and a sexual generation has no influence on aphid population dynamics, and this may be the clearest link between maternal effects and population change of which we are currently aware. Changes in dispersal ability have also been noted in other systems. For example, the tendency of gypsy moth larvae to disperse after hatching from their egg masses is related to the environmental experience of the mother (Diss et al., 1996). Likewise, the proportion of macropterous and micropterous offspring produced by some Japanese crickets is influenced by maternal effects (Masaki & Shimizu, 1995). Finally, maternal effects are a key component of phase change in locusts and contribute to the production of the migratory forms that are so devastating to developing agriculture (Islam et al., 1994). The influence of maternal environment on survival during dispersal is much harder to record and, as a consequence, fewer examples exist. However, variation in mortality during dispersal of the crab spider, Misumena vatia, is almost entirely dependent upon the foraging success and subsequent mass of the mother spider (Morse & Stephens, 1996). The study of Bruchid seed beetles has provided considerable insight into the expression of maternal effects. Maternal effects may influence adult dispersal (Messina, 1987), host preference and host expansion (Fox et al., 1997a; Messina & Slade, 1997; Fox & Savalli, 2000), egg size and viability (Fox, 1993; Fox et al., 1995, 1997b), larval survival (Fox et al., 1995; Fox & Savalli, 2000) and the development time of larvae (Fox, 1993; Fox et al., 1995, 1999b). Even ejaculate size of male beetles, a significant contributor to female fecundity, may be influenced by maternal effects (Savalli & Fox, 1998). Critically for population dynamics, the expression of maternal effects in seed beetles can be density dependent (Fox & Savalli, 2000), paving the way for time-lags in the action of density-dependent processes, and the potential induction of population cycles (Rossiter, 1991a, 1994). If you are a Bruchid beetle, chances are that your mother's environment has had a major impact on your life. Likewise, laboratory and field studies of crickets and grasshoppers have provided a wealth of information on the expression of maternal effects. Environmental variation experienced by mothers can influence wing size (Masaki & Shimizu, 1995), the morphology of sound-producing organs (Webb & Roff, 1992) and components of the calling song of males (Webb & Roff, 1992). Perhaps most significantly for population dynamics, maternal effects can have a strong influence on the induction of diapause and subsequent voltinism (Mousseau & Roff, 1989; Dingle et al., 1990; Mousseau, 1991; Groeters, 1994). For insects in general, rates of population growth can be affected markedly by the number of generations exhibited each year (Carrière et al., 1995; Hunter & McNeil, 1997). When diapause is facultative, the environment experienced by mothers can promote continued development when conditions are favourable, or induce diapause when conditions are unfavourable (Roff, 1983; Hunter & McNeil, 2000). Environmentally based maternal effects have been shown to influence diapause and/or voltinism in parasitic Hymenoptera (Brodeur & McNeil, 1989; Fabres & Reymonet, 1991), Lepidoptera (Sims, 1983a,b; Hunter & McNeil, 2000), Diptera (Saunders, 1987; Rockey et al., 1989, 1991; McWatters & Saunders, 1998; Webb & Denlinger, 1998) and Homoptera (MacKay & Wellington, 1977; Harrewijn, 1978). Simply put, when voltinism is variable for a given species of insect, maternal effects are often part of the story (Mousseau & Dingle, 1991). Despite Wellington's (1957, 1960, 1964) early interest, the expression of maternal effects in Lepidopteran pests has received less attention than it merits. However, there are convincing examples where maternal effects have been shown to influence a broad range of phenotypic traits related to population dynamics (Gould, 1988; Rossiter, 1991a,b, 1992, 1994; Rossiter et al., 1993; Diss et al., 1996; Behmer & Grebenok, 1998). For example, the allelochemistry of the parental diet can influence the performance of Heliothis virescens larvae, with the expression of the maternal effect dependent upon offspring environment (Gould, 1988). Essential nutrients (or the lack thereof) also invoke maternal effects. Phytosterols in parental diet, required for normal development of larval offspring, can have positive or negative effects upon the larvae of Plutella xylostella, depending upon whether the phytosterols are from host or non-host species (Behmer & Grebenok, 1998). Similarly, iron deficiency in the parental diet of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, reduces the fitness of offspring regardless of the diet that they receive, and accounts for 28% of the phenotypic variance in larval performance (Keena et al., 1998). Indeed, environmentally based maternal effects have been shown repeatedly to influence the phenotypic traits of gypsy moth larvae and pupae, and provide an interesting example of the development of a theory of population dynamics from empirical studies of quantitative genetics and maternal effects. In 1990, following studies of the genetics and ecology of host use by the gypsy moth (Rossiter, 1987a,b; Rossiter et al., 1988), Rossiter demonstrated that the susceptibility of gypsy moth larvae to the bacterial insecticide, Bacillus thuringiensis, was determined in part by maternal provisioning of eggs (Rossiter et al., 1990). In subsequent studies of egg provisioning, Rossiter reported that daughters emerging from large gypsy moth eggs hatched earlier, grew faster and attained greater pupal weights and fecundities than did daughters emerging from small eggs (Rossiter, 1991b). Although egg size had a genetic component, there was also a strong influence of maternal diet and thus maternal effects contributed significantly to offspring development and fecundity. For example, mothers reared on damaged foliage of red oak, Quercus rubra, produced offspring with heavier pupae than did mothers reared on undamaged foliage (Rossiter, 1991a). In addition, the condensed tannin concentration of the maternal diet was related both to the length of the larval pre-feeding period and to the pupal mass of sons. When parents were fed on two different oak species, parental diet accounted for 24% of the variance in larval development time, whereas offspring diet accounted for 52%. These results led Rossiter (1991b, 1992) to suggest that maternal effects could play a hidden role in the population dynamics of the gypsy moth. Subsequent work by Rossiter developed along two lines; studies of the causes and consequences of maternal provisioning (Rossiter et al., 1993, 1996; Yerger & Rossiter, 1996), and the development of conceptual models of population dynamics that included time-lagged contributions of maternal effects (Rossiter, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998). For example, the dominant storage protein in gypsy moth eggs is vitellogin. In experiments comparing quaking aspen, chestnut oak, red oak and pitch pine as parental diets, maternal diet was found to influence vitellogin levels in eggs (Rossiter et al., 1993). In addition, the solubility of the egg proteins was related to phenolic compounds in the eggs derived from the parental diet (Rossiter et al., 1996). In her conceptual models, Rossiter explored the consequences of time delays in the expression of environmental conditions for population stability, escape from regulation, and outbreak dynamics (Rossiter, 1994). Maternal effects have the potential to uncouple the density and quality of herbivore individuals from other factors in the environment, including host quality and the density of natural enemies. As with many time-lagged density-dependent factors, maternal effects can generate population fluctuations and cyclic dynamics (Berryman, 1999). Rossiter's work has stimulated both theoretical (Ginzburg & Tanneyhill, 1994, 1995; Berryman, 1995; Crone & Taylor, 1996; Ginzburg, 1998; Berryman & Chen, 1999; Benton et al., 2001) and empirical (Harrison, 1995; Myers et al., 1998; Erelli & Elkinton, 2000; Ergon et al., 2001) studies of the role of maternal effects in population dynamics. The theoretical work has largely centred around the appropriate model structure for incorporating maternal effects into population models and the relationships between model structure and the predictions that they generate (Ginzburg & Tanneyhill, 1994; Berryman, 1995; Benton et al., 2001). Even when authors disagree about the appropriate manner in which to model maternal effects, all agree that they have the potential to generate population cycles and may be difficult to untangle from other sources of delayed negative feedback (Berryman, 1995, 1999; Benton et al., 2001). Agreement has been less forthcoming in empirical studies of maternal effects in natural populations. Two field studies of the gypsy moth have reported effects of maternal environment on offspring performance (Diss et al., 1996; Yerger & Rossiter, 1996), whereas two other field studies have not (Myers et al., 1998; Erelli & Elkinton, 2000). However, in my opinion, all four studies are flawed. In each case, eggs or larvae were collected from different gypsy moth populations that varied in their population trajectories (e.g. population trough, population increase, population peak). Effects on larval dispersal, survival and/or growth were then compared to test the hypothesis that individuals from similar positions on the population trajectory would share phenotypic traits in common because of shared maternal experience. All four studies are therefore examples of ‘space-for-time’ replacements in which spatially disjunct populations at different growth stages are used to simulate changes in a single population over time. The problem is that maternal effects, by their very nature, are not amenable to space-for-time replacements. The studies do allow a test of whether or not populations at a particular phase of growth share common phenotypic traits. They do not allow a test of the hypothesis that changes in maternal provisioning within a single site over time are associated with temporal population dynamics. The critical question is whether females change their allocation to eggs over time as environmental conditions change, not whether those allocation patterns are in any way similar to those of other populations. In other words, there may not be a consistent pattern of phenotype among populations at the same stage of growth. However, each population may exhibit variation in allocation over time and time-lagged effects on performance sufficient to generate population cycles. As has been stated clearly in the past, the expression of maternal effects varies in space and there is no shortcut to exploring links between maternal effects and population dynamics in natural populations over time (Wellington, 1957; Labeyrie, 1988; Mousseau, 1991). Multigenerational studies of insect density, insect quality, and the environment (biotic and abiotic) are required for an adequate test of the maternal effects hypothesis of insect outbreak (Rossiter, 1994). The current state of affairs, then, is that there exists (a) strong empirical evidence from laboratory studies to suggest that maternal effects influence the life-history traits of insect pests, (b) recognition that maternal effects provide the potential for delayed negative feedback in populations, and (c) a well-developed theory linking delayed negative feedback to population dynamics, outbreaks and cycles. What we are still missing is clear evidence of population dynamics in the field that are driven by maternal effects. Although the work reported by Baltensweiler and by Nealis in Aberdeen is strongly indicative of maternal effects, demonstration of cause and effect remains elusive. As Berryman (1995, 1999) has pointed out, it will be difficult to untangle the influence of maternal effects from other delayed negative feedback processes such as wound-induced declines in plant quality or the influence of natural enemies. Maternal effects therefore fall squarely among the ranks of other ecological processes that must be explored with a combination of experimental studies, life table data and time-series analysis (Hunter et al., 1997; Hunter & Price 2000; Turchin & Berryman, 2000; Hunter, 2001). Examination of maternal effects in population dynamics have the added difficulty that ‘space-for-time’ replacements are inappropriate experimental techniques, and studies must be multigenerational within single localities. Whether maternal effects will prove to be major drivers of population change is not yet clear. However, it is clear that ignoring, or failing to control for, maternal effects may result in misleading interpretations of experimental and census data, whether or not such effects are a focus of the research (Mousseau & Dingle, 1991; Bernardo, 1996). I would like to thank the National Science Foundation (Grant DEB-9906366) for supporting our work on the population dynamics of insect herbivores. I would also like to thank my mother for her continued interference, genetic and otherwise, in my life. Accepted 5 November 2001",

The catches were highest near the middle of the transects and lower at both ends of them. 4 This pattern was associated, on the one hand, with an urbanization gradient with the numbers of flying individuals increasing with the distance from the city centre and, on the other hand, with lower catches at the periphery of the city where a high proportion of broadleaved trees may have disrupted the response to aggregation pheromones. 5 In addition to the probable rural origin of the beetles, high catches at the Port of Brussels indicated that some of the insects might be of foreign origin and enter the city with imported timber, highlighting a pathway for unintentional introductions of organisms, including potentially invasive species.",

As herbivorous arthropods, planthoppers and leafhoppers ingest Cry proteins depending on their feeding behaviour. Consequently, they are directly exposed to these entomotoxic proteins and can also serve as a source of Cry protein exposure to predatory arthropods. Therefore, it is reasonable to use Auchenorrhyncha in the risk assessment of genetically modified crops. 2 During a 2‐year field study, we evaluated four different methods in terms of their feasibility to assess the impacts of plant‐incorporated protectants from Bt ‐maize and of insecticide use on this group of arthropods. Visual assessment of plants, sweep netting, yellow traps and custom made sticky traps were utilized in field plots of Bt ‐maize MON810, untreated near‐isogenic maize and insecticide‐treated near‐isogenic maize and were compared with respect to their capability to reflect the diversity and abundance of Auchenorrhyncha species. 3 Zyginidia scutellaris (Herrich‐Schäffer) (Cicadomorpha: Cicadellidae) represented more than 94% of all captured individuals in both years. The analysis of Z. scutellaris data showed no consistent differences between Bt ‐maize MON810 and the untreated near isogenic hybrid, demonstrating no negative impact of MON810 on this species. Insecticide treatment, on the other hand, was not equivalent to the isogenic maize in terms of Z. scutellaris densities. Based on the collected data and on practical considerations, we recommend the combined use of transect‐wise sweep netting and sticky traps for the sampling of Auchenorrhyncha in maize.",

Comparison of insect distribution with intra‐plot characteristics, such as vine plant vigour (leaf density and leaf chlorophyll concentration) and phenology, plot topography and surrounding vegetation, revealed that E. vitis clearly aggregates in areas with the most vigorous vine plants. Even though the presence of natural enemies in the surrounding vegetation was confirmed by specific observations, we did not observe significant population decrease at the contiguous plot edges. Natural ground cover, together with the absence of insecticide, might allow the spreading and perennial conservation of E. vitis natural enemies inside the plots. Clear adult aggregations observed along downwind woodlands suggest that this vegetation acts as a barrier and intercepts the adults flying passively across the plot. However, this surrounding vegetation could also serve as an alternative refuge when vine water deficit and vine foliage temperature increase.",

In 2003, the European Commission implemented measures aimed at slowing down the spread of the WCR in Europe. Nevertheless, this pest has already been found in 20 countries of the European region. To establish a sustainable production system, the evaluation of native (nontransgenic) resistance in maize cultivars is essential. 3 This review emphasizes the future challenges involved in the research of native resistance breeding in maize against the insect.",

Although pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum genotypes exhibit intraspecific variation in population growth in response to atmospheric composition, the proximate mechanisms underlying this variation are largely unknown. By rearing single (green, pink) and mixed (green + pink) pea aphid genotypes on red clover Trifolium pratense at the Aspen Free Air CO 2 and O 3 Enrichment (Aspen FACE) site, we assessed whether: (i) elevated CO 2 and/or O 3 concentrations alter aphid growth and development and (ii) individual aphid growth rates predict aphid population densities. We showed that growth and development of individual green and pink aphids were not influenced by CO 2 and/or O 3 concentrations when reared as individual or mixed genotypes. Individual growth rates, however, did not predict population densities. Reared as a single genotype, green pea aphid populations decreased in response to elevated CO 2 concentrations, but not in response to elevated CO 2 + O 3 concentrations. Pink pea aphid populations reared as a single genotype were unaffected by augmented CO 2 or O 3 . Populations of mixed genotypes, however, were reduced under elevated CO 2 concentrations, irrespective of O 3 concentrations. Herbivore population sizes may not readily be predicted from growth rates of individual organisms under atmospheric conditions associated with global climate change.",

The present study investigated the dispersal and distribution of WCR larvae in the maize root system during their development at two growth stages of maize (BBCH 13–14 and BBCH 17–18). Dispersal of the WCR larvae increased as they developed; the larvae moved off their original place of emergence and into deeper soil layers. Overall, changes in the horizontal distribution of the larvae were more extensive than changes in the vertical distribution. The spatial analysis of distance indices revealed that the larvae had an aggregative distribution throughout their development. The feeding site of larvae in the root system was determined by the stage of larval development. Initially, WCR larvae started feeding in close proximity to their emergence location and moved to more developed root tissue towards the end of their development. Differences in root phenology mainly influenced the distribution of the larvae at the end of their development, when larvae exhibited increased vertical movement at a later growth stage of maize. The mechanisms of these distributional changes and the implications for the management of WCR larvae are discussed, especially with regard to chemical control, because fewer larvae are expected to be targeted at a later growth stage of maize.",

Using the geometrid pest of Eucalyptus plantations, Mnesampela privata (Guenée), we determined the effect of delaying mating when imposed on males only, females only or on both sexes simultaneously, for 1, 3, 5 and 7 days. 2 Delayed mating had a significant negative impact on reproduction, with a 0.89-fold decrease in the likelihood of mating and a 0.67-fold decrease in the likelihood of that mating resulting in fertile eggs for every day that mating is delayed. A mating delay of 7 days reduced the mean number of viable eggs laid to 4–13% of that laid by moths paired immediately after emergence. 3 Male only imposed mating delays had a significantly lower effect on reducing the likelihood of pairs mating than when both sexes were delayed. A delay imposed on one sex only or on both sexes simultaneously, however, had a similar negative impact on the proportion of fertile matings as well as on the total number of fertile eggs laid. 4 Longevity of mated female and male M. privata was significantly different between mating delay treatments, with a significant decline in female longevity when they mated with older males. 5 The underlying mechanisms causing a decline in female reproductive output when a mating delay was imposed on males versus females are discussed in relation to the reproductive biology of M. privata and the potential of using mating disruption strategies to control populations in Eucalyptus plantations.",

Newly‐emerged weevils were tested for their ability to fly and assessed for wing muscle and reproductive development. In addition, the effect of summer–autumn maturation feeding on reproductive development was assessed in field bioassays. There was considerable variation in development between newly‐emerged weevils that was related to the timing of emergence. The first weevils, emerging in early July, weighed less than later‐emerging ones, had undeveloped flight muscles and did not fly. Over the emergence period, wing muscle size and flight ability increased markedly, with 50–60% flying by mid‐September. Differences between emerging adults are likely to have been affected by temporal changes in the quality of the bark on which the larvae feed. Reproductive development lagged behind that of wing muscles but, in early August, there was a rapid increase in the proportion of weevils with immature eggs and a corresponding increase in oocyte size. However, although wing muscles were fully formed in later‐emerging weevils, immature eggs were only approximately 10% of the volume of mature eggs. In field bioassays of summer–autumn maturation feeding, eggs continued to develop and some weevils laid mature eggs. Feeding and development during the pre‐overwinter period is likely to influence winter survival and also dispersal and reproduction in the following spring. The potential effects of climate change on the weevil life cycle are briefly discussed. Weevils are likely to benefit from the higher temperatures and later autumns predicted under climate change, resulting in an increase in damage to transplants.",

New methods of control for this pest are continually being sought and the use of entomopathogens as biological control agents of the soil-dwelling life stages of T. leucotreta has shown great promise. Current understanding of T. leucotreta pupation biology, behaviour and survival is limited; thus, improving upon this knowledge would be useful for the biological control of this life stage. Abiotic factors, namely soil texture class, ground cover, soil compaction and soil moisture, were investigated in the laboratory, aiming to determine the effects of these on T. leucotreta pupation variables. The investigations consisted of an examination of the wandering behaviour of larvae prior to pupation site selection, the pupation behaviour after selecting a pupation site, and eclosion biology and success. These abiotic factors often had a limited influence on T. leucotreta pupation. Interesting consistencies included limited wandering behaviour, the shallowness of T. leucotreta pupation and a high eclosion success in sandy loam soils in certain cases. These factors are likely to have both positive and negative implications for entomopathogenic biological control programmes.",

Cold temperatures are considered a limiting factor for the insect's range, yet the cold hardiness of larch casebearer has never been quantified. We investigated (i) larval survival after acute and prolonged exposure to subzero temperatures and (ii) supercooling points (i.e. temperatures causing the onset of freezing) of overwintering and active larvae from November 2015 to April 2017. We developed models linking exposure temperatures to survival and evaluated them with larvae from field conditions. Historical minimum temperature data were used to estimate changes in survival across time at a site in northern Minnesota. The cold tolerance of larch casebearer changed significantly with season: both lower lethal temperatures and supercooling points were lowest in mid‐winter and highest in spring and autumn. For example, 50% survival was estimated after acute exposure to a mean ± SE temperature of −28.9 ± 1.77 °C in October, −40.8 ± 0.77 °C in January and −27.8 ± 1.00 °C in April. A model predicting survival using supercooling points provided conservative estimates of overwintering survival because it overestimated survival by approximately 4% and 8% in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Analysis of climate data suggested that overwintering survival could have increased significantly over the previous half century.",

Microdots, originally developed for covert security applications, are small polymer discs (diameter 0.5 mm) bearing up to 26 characters of information and have the potential as an alternative to the larger bee tags. In the present study, we test microdots for the individual marking of a 9‐mm parasitoid wasp. We individually marked 505 wasps.

A captive survival experiment showed no difference in lifespan between marked and unmarked wasps. The present study shows that microdots can provide an effective, durable, low‐cost method for individually tagging small insects.

Hosts were better able to compartmentalize injury from small, unsuccessful E. rufulus galleries than large, successful galleries from which larvae survived to adulthood. 7 Healthy Q. rubra, as survivors of the recent outbreak, were able to effectively tolerate feeding pressure from borers at the same time as sustaining growth and maintenance.

The use of gamma radiation to induce sterility, however, negatively affects both somatic cells as well as reproductive cells. Consequently, mating performance of sterilized individuals decreases drastically over time. The mating propensity of sterilized Euscepes postfasciatus (Fairmaire) males irradiated with a single dose of 150 Gy (the current standard of the Okinawa Prefecture SIT programme) is equal to that of non-irradiated weevils for the first 6 days. 3 Fractionated irradiation, in which a sterilizing dose is delivered over time in a series of smaller irradiations, reduces the damage of irradiation in insects. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of fractionated irradiation on male fertilization ability, longevity and mating propensity of E. postfasciatus for a period of 16 days after irradiation. 4 Although fractionated irradiation totalling 150 Gy was found to induce full sterility regardless of the number of individual doses, the mating propensity of male weevils sterilized by fractionated irradiation was maintained for the first 12 days. These results demonstrate that fractionated irradiation can be highly advantageous in programmes aimed at eradication of E. postfasciatus.",

    "abstract": "The vine weevil Otiorhynchus sulcatus is a major pest of horticultural crops worldwide, with root‐feeding larvae causing most damage. Adult oviposition aboveground may therefore influence levels of damage as the larvae are relatively immobile after oviposition. The present study investigated feeding and oviposition behaviour on red raspberry Rubus idaeus using intact plants, ensuring that choices reflected the realistic differences in cultivar appearance and chemical composition. Previous studies investigating vine weevil feeding and oviposition on other crops have used excised plant material, which may inadvertently influence behaviour. Adult weevils significantly preferred to feed on particular cultivars in the choice experiment (e.g. Tulameen), although they consumed significantly more foliage (0.22–1.03 cm 2 /day) on different raspberry cultivars (e.g. Glen Moy, Glen Rosa and a wild accession) in no‐choice situations. In choice experiments, weevils tended to avoid laying eggs on some cultivars (e.g. Glen Moy and the wild accession). The number of eggs laid (1.91–4.32 eggs per day) did not, however, differ significantly between the cultivars in a no‐choice situation. Foliar nitrogen and magnesium concentrations were positively, although weakly, correlated with the total number of eggs laid. The present study highlights the importance of considering both choice and no‐choice tests when assessing crop susceptibility to attack because weevils may avoid feeding on certain cultivars (e.g. Glen Moy) when given a choice, although this would cause significant damage to such cultivars if they were grown in monoculture (i.e. when there is no alternative).",

Classical biological control, comprising the import of exotic natural enemies to control target pest populations, has a successful history in many countries. However, little is known about how these natural enemies contribute to the suppression of pests that are yet to arrive. Biotic resistance theory, though, posits that communities resist species invasions as a result of natural enemies. We assessed the potential of the resident exotic parasitoid wasp fauna in New Zealand (intentionally‐introduced biological control agents and unintentionally‐introduced species) to provide biotic resistance against possible future pests. A dataset was generated containing resident exotic parasitoid species (Ichneumonoidea: Braconidae; Ichneumonidae) in New Zealand, as well as their known global host ranges and the pest status of host species, to infer the potential for biotic resistance. The known exotic ichneumonoid fauna in New Zealand comprises 65 species. These species associate with 107 host species in New Zealand, of which 54 species are pests. However, the current exotic species could potentially suppress 442 pest species not yet occurring in New Zealand. This approach could be used to inform pest management programmes worldwide. Future research should consider how biotic resistance from the established parasitoid fauna can be used to inform specific decisions with respect to classical biological control.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Wildflower plantings on farms have been shown to attract foraging wild bees, however, whether these added floral resources increase nesting densities of bees remains largely untested. We placed nest boxes containing natural reeds at 20 fruit farms in Michigan. We then compared nesting densities between farms with and without wildflower plantings and analysed nest provisions to evaluate use of wildflower plantings for brood provisioning. We found significantly greater nesting at farms with wildflower plantings, with only one out of 236 completed nests at a farm without a planting. The majority of nests were completed by Megachile pugnata , with a portion of nests completed by Osmia caerulescens . We found that nesting bees collected pollen from only a subset of the available flowers in the wildflower plantings, with a strong preference for Centaurea maculosa , and Rudbeckia type pollens. While these species were found growing in the plantings, only Rudbeckia type species were seeded in the plantings. This study provides evidence that wildflower plantings (though not only seeded species) are filling a critical resource gap for stem‐nesting bees in agricultural landscapes and likely support local populations.",

From 2011 to 2013, we studied the dynamics of the goldspotted oak borer Agrilus auroguttatus Schaeffer (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), a new pest of oaks in southern California, at six sites that had been colonized recently. At all sites, the percentage of coast live oaks Quercus agrifolia Née, colonized by A. auroguttatus increased between 2011 (6–33%) and 2013 (23–40%), although beetle densities did not grow rapidly at most sites. From 2011 to 2013, there were minor changes in signs and symptoms of A. auroguttatus infestation (adult emergence holes, bark staining, and evidence of woodpecker foraging), except at one site where an outbreak occurred. At some sites, noticeable negative changes in oak crown health occurred 1 year prior to positive A. auroguttatus population growth. Among sites, most of the A. auroguttatus population density (66–93%) was produced by a small number of heavily-infested trees (= brood trees). Early identification and removal of brood trees in newly-invaded areas could slow the growth of A. auroguttatus populations.",

The natural enemies of P. solenopsis (predator Menochilus sexmaculata and parasitoid Aenasius bambawalei ) were infrequently present on E. adenophorum . We hypothesize that E. adenophorum facilitates the colony growth of P. solenopsis by excluding their enemies. We measured the biological parameters of P. solenopsis on E. adenophorum and two cultivated host plants ( Gossypium hirsutum and Hibiscus rosa‐sinensis ). The results show that, when reared by E. adenophorum , female mealybugs had a shorter developmental duration, greater fecundity, higher survival and larger populations. Compared with cultivated plants, M. sexmaculata experienced lower predatory performance and fecundity on E. adenophorum . Phenacoccus solenopsis also exhibited a lower percentage of parasitism on E. adenophorum . Both predator and parasitoids avoided colonizing the mealybug infested and uninfested E. adenophorum plants in a significant way. These results suggest that E. adenophorum may facilitate the colony growth of P. solenopsis by excluding enemies through their chemical cues.",

Field trials conducted in red clover seed production fields in A lberta, C anada, during the summers of 2010–2012 tested the efficacy of pheromone‐baited traps to predict population density and assess male flight phenology of C. deauratella . Male moth pheromone‐trap capture was positively related to larval abundance and proportion seed damage at both moderate and high population densities.

The study was conducted in five large forests in north‐eastern Poland. Insects were reared from wood samples cut from the upper and lower parts of trees growing in both shaded and sun‐exposed conditions. We found that the species richness of overwintering insects on killed trees was mainly driven by the position in the lower trunk strata rather than in crowns or along a sun–shade gradient. Even though pine and spruce shared almost the same species composition, spruce hosted a significantly higher number of species, including beneficial ones. These results support the hypothesis that disturbance regimes change the spatial distribution of biodiversity, which is higher in low strata, as is known for abiotic disturbances that change the environment of the forest. One of the most important messages emerging from the present study is that pest beetle disturbance during non‐outbreak periods creates habitats that are necessary for the survival of myriads of other insects. Thus, maintaining parts of the trees that were killed by bark and wood‐boring beetles, especially high stumps, would help to support biodiversity in managed forests.",

It is widely established in Chile, Australia, and western North America. It arrived in California as a contaminant in alfalfa seed in 1859 and, by 2002, had infested >7.7 million hectares in the U.S.A. Biological control of YST using capitula feeding weevils, picture wing flies and a foliar rust pathogen has been ongoing in the western U.S.A. for more than three decades with limited success. Modelling and field research suggest natural enemies that kill whole plants and/or reduce seed production of survivors are good candidates for successful biological control. A candidate species with some of these attributes is the rosette weevil Ceratapion basicorne (Illiger). In the present study, a model of the rosette weevil is added to an extant system model of YST and its capitula feeding natural enemies and, in a GIS context, is used to assess YST control in the Palearctic region and the weevil's potential impact on YST in western U.S.A. The results obtained suggest densities of mature YST plants in western U.S.A. would be reduced by 70–80% in many areas.",

However, in recent decades, pollinator biodiversity, especially in wild bees, is declining on a global scale, with potentially far‐reaching consequences for crop production. Thus, there is an urgent need to determine whether wild bees are present in agricultural systems, such as fruit orchards. In the present study, we examined the wild bee fauna at species and community levels during the period of bee activity (May to August) in apple and high‐bush blueberry orchards in New England. Bee communities are crop‐specific and dominated by very few species, which fluctuate according to crop and season. The blueberry associated bee fauna was more diverse. In apple, communities were phylogenetically clustered at the genus level and dominated by solitary ground nesting bees within the genus Andrena . Species fluctuated widely in presence and abundance throughout the season, leading to differences in community composition and functional trait structure. The results obtained in the present study show that apple and blueberry harbour a distinct and diverse bee fauna that performs vital pollination services in orchards. Our results provide essential baseline data for wild bees in blueberry and apple orchards and this can be used to improve management and conservation strategies for wild bee preservation in these crops.",

In contrast, the egg parasitoid Telenomus tetratomus preferred green traps. Overall catches of beneficial insects were relatively low, except Phoridae.

A preliminary survey in Kenyan citrus groves after the invasion of ACP had revealed that lime‐green sticky traps (Asacp) were not effective in detecting and monitoring ACT and ACP. Therefore, this study compared eight differently coloured double‐sided sticky traps to evaluate, which colour was most effective for detecting ACT and ACP, particularly at low densities. The traps were coded Red, Blue, Asgreen1, GLMgreen, Asacp, Asyellow, White, and Black. Asyellow and GLMgreen traps captured more ACTs and ACPs than any other trap type. However, since there was no clear difference in the efficiency of Asyellow and GLMgreen in trapping ACP, any of the two trap types would be useful in the presence of both pests. Among the eight traps, Asyellow and GLMgreen traps are potentially promising options for monitoring and detecting the pests in areas where they coexist. Our findings will guide biosecurity agencies in decision‐making and designing ecologically friendly integrated pest management (IPM) strategies for citrus greening vectors in Africa as well as serve as an early warning to safeguard against pests' invasion into unaffected areas.",

We investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of the species of Dolichopodidae (Diptera) in organic vegetable farms because they are one of the most abundant generalist highly mobile predators in Brazilian agroecosystems. We simultaneously sampled the abundance of Condylostylus Bigot and Chrysotus Loew adults (both Dolichopodidae) in the crop, fallow areas, agroforests and forest fragments within five organic farms for 2 years. Predators preferred open‐field habitats to agroforests and forest fragments. Probably, open‐field habitats present more opportunities to prey foraging, resulting in higher population densities. To the extent that abiotic conditions become more restrictive during the dry season, agroforests and forests act as breeding sites and shelter, thereby maintaining the predators' populations in the overall farmland habitat. Both predatory genera occupy habitats with distinct features across time, forming a dynamic and contiguous population unit within the farm. Therefore, conservation biological control strategies in organic crops should consider the role of agroforests and forest fragments in species conservation beyond the plot level.",

We assessed effects on insect survival, fertility, population growth, and effects through changes in tree palatability and in other pests and pathogens. Late‐spring frost reduced D. kuriphilus to 25–40% of previous abundance. Wasp populations recovered rapidly (&gt;7‐fold in 3 years), consistent with density‐dependence in population dynamics. Larvae affected by freeze or drought were smaller. Female fecundity was affected by the freeze 1 year later. Late‐spring frosts and severe drought affected leaf size and physiology. Water content was higher within galls, but nitrogen was higher within galls in non‐freeze plots after weather conditions improved. Freezing also influenced the secondary chemistry of leaves. Phenol concentrations were lower, and terpenes higher, in frozen plots, while condensed tannins remained the same. Condensed tannins were reduced to half in the drought year. Freezing had limited effects on damage from other pests and pathogens. Our work expands understanding of how climate and weather affects forest pests.",

We also assessed the role of alternative blooming resources for the flower visitors of deciduous fruit trees. Overall, we found 66 taxa of flower visitors, 35 of which visited deciduous fruit trees. There was a greater abundance of flower visitors when there was higher richness of weedy species and greater blooming cover of deciduous fruit trees. Networks were less connected when there was lower crop and weedy species richness.

However, the phloem‐feeding weevil, Pagiophloeus tsushimanus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), has been observed to feed exclusively on this plant without incurring apparent fitness costs. This phenomenon remains to be elucidated. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analysis of essential oil extracted from the phloem of camphor tree was performed. The top three components, all monoterpenoids, were eucalyptol (31.9%), D ‐camphor (19.2%) and linalool (10.2%), respectively. In headspace bioassays, both eggs and larvae showed the greatest sensitivity to eucalyptol, and there was a bell‐shaped relationship between the concentrations used and developmental time for eggs when exposed to D ‐camphor volatile. Exposure to essential oil mixture and D ‐camphor notably increased the activity of glutathione S‐transferase in the weevil. A corresponding short‐term induction of gene expression was also observed according to quantitative real‐time polymerase chain reaction analysis. In general, P. tsushimanus possessed various levels of tolerance to different host monoterpenoids. Over‐expression of glutathione S‐transferase in vivo probably relates to detoxification metabolism of these monoterpenoids. Our findings provide a valuable clue to understanding the mechanism underlying resistance to host‐specific chemical defences in this weevil pest.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The frosted elfin ( Callophrys irus ) butterfly inhabits landscapes that may be subject to frequent fire to be sustained. Frosted elfins pupate primarily in leaf litter, at the soil surface, or just below it, and may suffer high mortality rates when fires occur. Gathering better information on this source of mortality is critical to planning prescribed fire operations in a manner conducive to the long‐term survival of the species. We buried lab‐reared frosted elfin pupae ( n = 61) at 0.75 cm ( n = 31) or 1.75 cm ( n = 30) below the ground and conducted two experimental fires that mimicked typical prescribed fires. Eighteen of 30 (60%) buried at 1.75 cm survived 4 weeks postburn; no pupae buried at 0.75 cm survived. Most ( n = 17) of the pupae that survived successfully enclosed the following year. Surviving pupae encountered lower maximum temperatures and were exposed to shorter durations of above‐lethal temperatures compared to those that died. Our data demonstrate that high mortality rates can be expected due to fire, yet fire remains a critical tool for maintaining the habitat. Fire practitioners should mitigate losses by using ignition patterns and suboptimal burn conditions to reduce fire intensity, or burn in a mosaic pattern across the landscape to ensure enough survival to perpetuate frosted elfin populations.",

Both blue ash and white ash were largely unaffected by emerald ash borer in 2012. By 2018, nearly 90% of the blue ash trees observed in these forests had full or nearly full canopies, as opposed to less than 20% of the white ash encountered in our studies. In 2021, blue ash maintained a similar degree of canopy health as in 2018, but no standing live mature white ashes remained. Bark removals revealed no current or past larval feeding attempts in blue ash in 2018 or 2021, except for one attacked and killed tree in 2018. All white ash trees examined were attacked. In a laboratory bioassay with cut stems, emerald ash borer larvae fed less and grew significantly more slowly on blue ash than on white ash. Both reduced larval performance and reduced adult oviposition likely contribute to the persistence of blue ash in forests devastated by emerald ash borer.",

We investigated how three pasture types (improved native, forage oat and inter‐sown rye/clover) influence the dung quality, the number of broods and reproductive output measured as brood size (dry weight and ellipsoid volume), development time and F 1 progeny size (beetle length and pronotum width) of Onthophagus binodis , Euoniticellus africanus and Euoniticellus intermedius . Nitrogen content was highest in rye/clover‐derived dung compared with improved native and forage oat. Improved native‐derived dung had the highest carbon, energy, organic matter, pH and insoluble non‐starch polysaccharide content, whereas forage oat had the lowest contents. Forage oat had the highest moisture content, ash and soluble non‐starch polysaccharide content compared with the other pastures. Progeny length was influenced by pasture type, with female E. intermedius, and males and females of O. binodis being 11.4%, 11.2% and 7.3% longer, respectively, in rye/clover‐derived dung than forage oat dung. The pronotum width of O. binodis F 1 progeny was 9.8% wider when produced from rye/clover dung than forage oat. Rye/clover‐ and improved native‐derived dung provided the best resource for dung beetle reproduction compared with forage oat dung. Based on this study, cattle diet is important for consideration when evaluating reproductive ability and progeny measurements. Cattle diet should be further investigated as only three pasture types were investigated out of a numerous number of species and combinations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bees play an important role by contributing to the pollination of a diverse range of crops and wild plants. However, bees are threatened by deforestation and habitat degradation caused by urbanization and agricultural intensification, which reduce floral and nesting resources. In this study, the effects of local (orchard size, flowering plant abundance and richness and floral abundance) and landscape factors (surrounding agricultural, forest and urban cover) on bee richness and abundance in mixed fruit orchards were determined from 28 mature orchards interspersed along a gradient of landscape complexity. Bees were observed for 15 min in 2 × 2 m plots. We categorized all bees into one of the three groups: (a) honey bees, (b) solitary bees and (c) stingless bees. Several local and landscape factors were found to influence bee richness and abundance. Honey bee abundance was positively affected by orchard size, whereas honey bee richness was not. Stingless bee richness and abundance were positively correlated with floral abundance. Forest cover within a 3‐km radius positively affected solitary bee richness. Solitary bee abundance was positively affected by forest cover within a 3‐km radius and negatively impacted by urban cover within a 1.5‐km radius. In our study area, small forest patches are found in abundance; thus, the high proportion of forest edge, relative to the forest interior, greatly supports solitary bee abundance and richness in this landscape. Moreover, most solitary bees are soil‐nesting species that may be excluded from environments that are converted from natural to anthropogenically developed areas. Recommendations to protect pollinators included conserving existing forest patches, especially forest margins; restoring forest patches within farmland landscapes; maintaining a diversity of herbs and grasses within mixed fruit orchards; establishing live fences composed of diverse plant species and retaining dead trees within farmland. For urban areas, augmenting floral resources in green spaces is suggested.",

Five‐day‐old parasitoids were exposed to all five developmental stages (I–V) of host and non‐host psyllids in choice and non‐choice tests. Similar bioassays were used to assess parasitoid preferences for specific nymphal stages, identifying their preferred developmental stages of potential hosts. Glycaspis brimblecombei was identified as a potential host for P. blastopsyllae , and S. cf. plicatuloides as an alternate host for P. bliteus , though emergence rates were three to four times lower than for their known hosts. Psyllaephagus pilosus showed no interest in non‐host psyllids. Female parasitoids displayed stage‐specific preferences for both known and newly identified hosts. The current findings indicate that some Psyllaephagus species attack hosts within an ecological niche, whereas others are highly host specific. Additionally, the distinction between potential host range observed in laboratory conditions and ecological host range in field conditions should be considered, as laboratory tests typically exhibit a broader host range.",

We investigated whether the natal host (the tree where an immature beetle develops) influenced SPB host selection preference by rearing beetles on either loblolly or longleaf pine logs in the lab and testing their host acceptance via no‐choice and choice trials. While the natal host did not influence female beetle acceptance of either loblolly or longleaf hosts, a significantly higher proportion of longleaf‐reared females did not accept either host. The natal host hypothesis does not adequately explain the relative rarity of SPB outbreaks in longleaf versus loblolly pine forests.

This review compiles current knowledge on the characteristics, diversity and bionomy of cossid moths as well as the damage they cause on woody plants. Adult cossids are nocturnal, robust and generally have a low dispersal ability. Their habitat is very diverse from desert to boreal forests and high mountains. They have a long life cycle that varies from 1 to 3 years, the majority of which is spent in the larval stage. Most cossid larvae are highly polyphagous caterpillars and can migrate both intra‐host and inter‐host. Twenty‐six species of cossid have been reported as pests of commercial woody plants in forestry and horticulture. The feeding tunnels of cossid larvae can make large branches or trunks of small trees prone to wind breakage and can lead to tree decline and mortality. Cossid larvae damage reduces growth, yield, quality of fruit and wood as well as its commercial value. Current knowledge on cossid pest management is reviewed highlighting the importance of pheromone traps and the need for an integrated pest management approach for effective control. Lastly, future risks and challenges are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract One key management strategy for fruit flies (Tephritidae) is the sterile insect technique (SIT), which involves mass production, sterilisation (via radiation) and the release of sterile males into the field. For Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann, 1824) (Diptera: Tephritidae), SIT is well‐established and requires the visual differentiation of male and female pupae. To enhance the efficiency of sex separation in the mass‐reared C. capitata tsl Vienna‐8 strain, identifying specific spectral ranges suitable for integration into automated sorting equipment is crucial. This study analysed hyperspectral profiles and RGB spectra to determine the most effective wavelength and spectral ranges for distinguishing males from females at various pupal developmental times. Images of pupae at different degree‐days (DD) of development were captured from dorsal and ventral perspectives. At 130 and 163.9 DD, the viability of imaged pupae was below 40%. Hyperspectral profile graphs showed significant disparities between males and females at 185.5, 220.4 and 243 DD in the 230–380 nm range. Additionally, RGB images captured at 243 DD from a dorsal perspective revealled radiometric differences, with females exhibiting higher intensity values than males. Principal component analysis (PCA) further clarified the segregation of distinct clusters representing sex and orientation. Cross‐validation of the radiance intensity‐based classification demonstrated a classification accuracy of 81% for distinguishing the sexes. These findings highlight specific wavelengths and spectral ranges with significant differences based on sex and position, supporting their potential application in automated sorting systems.",

This study investigates the population dynamics and infestation levels of the FAW, Spodoptera frugiperda , on maize farms in Togo's Guinean and Sudanese climatic zones to improve pest management strategies. Male FAW moths were monitored using pheromone traps over 15 months, and larval densities and plant damage were assessed on 100 maize plants per farm. Results revealed more frequent moth captures in the Sudanese than in the Guinean climate zones (2.77 ± 0.16 vs. 2.05 ± 0.13). During the major rainy season (June to August), captures peaked in the Sudanese zone (5.28 ± 0.52) and were substantially more frequent compared to the Guinean zone (3.77 ± 0.55). No significant differences were observed during the minor rainy season (September to November), while in the dry season (December to May), captures were higher in the Guinean zone (0.54 ± 0.07) than in the Sudanese zone (0.24 ± 0.05). Despite similar larval densities, plant damage was greater in the Guinean zone during the major rainy season, likely due to positive correlations between adult captures, larval counts and plant damage in this region. Conversely, no such correlations were observed in the Sudanese zone. Additionally, maize stage‐specific analyses in Lomé and Toaga found no correlations between FAW captures, larval densities or damage. These findings highlight the need for climate‐specific pest management strategies rather than uniform national approaches, supported by linear regression models for each region.",

The aggregation pheromone of females was reported earlier; however, an effective trapping method has not yet been developed. Therefore, this study aimed to unravel the males' pheromonal communication system. Volatiles produced by P. aubei males, as well as sex‐ and mating status‐specific extracts from mid‐ and hindguts of unmated and mated males and females were analysed by GC‐EAD, and compounds eliciting antennal responses were identified by GC–MS. Two male‐specific pheromone components, cis ‐verbenol and verbenone, were identified in the extracts from mated males. α‐Pinene, known to be a kairomone component, as well as the female‐produced pheromone (in a combination with (−)‐myrtenol), was also found in extracts of mated males. None of these components were found in unmated males. Four‐arm olfactometer tests showed that females were attracted to the combination of (−)‐myrtenol, (−)‐α‐pinene and (−)‐ cis ‐verbenol, rather than to either (−)‐myrtenol or (−)‐α‐pinene alone. When this ternary blend was combined with (−)‐verbenone, the attractiveness for both males and females was reduced. Female and male P. aubei spent significantly more time in the olfactometer arm containing (−)‐α‐pinene and (−)‐ cis ‐verbenol than in the control arms. The ternary mixture of (−)‐myrtenol, (−)‐α‐pinene and (−)‐ cis ‐verbenol proved to be the most effective trap bait in the field, which could serve as a potent attractant for monitoring of P. aubei .",

Rhizobacteria, beneficial root‐associated bacteria, present a promising alternative by enhancing plant growth and defence against pests. This study explored the use of sodium alginate encapsulation for precise inoculation of two rhizobacteria, Acidovorax radicis and Bacillus subtilis , to suppress aphid ( Sitobion avenae ) populations on barley ( Hordeum vulgare ). We optimised a method using 4 mm diameter wet‐matrix alginate beads for controlled bacterial delivery directly to plant roots. Rhizobacteria inoculation via alginate beads at root emergence significantly reduced aphid reproductive output, outperforming seed soaking methods, with increased effects when plants were infested with a high initial density of aphids. This suggests the prolonged release from alginate beads led to more consistent bacterial establishment to enhance plant defence responses triggered by aphid feeding. Alginate bead encapsulation demonstrated effective long‐term bacterial viability following storage at 4°C for 8 months. Our findings highlight the potential of alginate bead‐encapsulated rhizobacteria for reducing aphid populations on barley but emphasise the need for precise inoculation timing and placement. This approach offers a robust method for empirical research and practical agricultural application, paving the way for sustainable pest management strategies. Future work should focus on optimising formulations and understanding plant‐microbe interactions to enhance field efficacy.",

Neither the mean egg‐laying tunnel length nor the number of eggs per gallery system varied significantly with attack density. These results suggest that P . proximus adults disregard galleries constructed by conspecifics and continue to lay eggs irrespective of attack density. Conversely, the number of adult offspring per female decreased significantly as attack density increased, indicating that intraspecific competition among offspring within fallen trees limits reproductive success. The relationships between attack density and offspring density showed a clear carrying capacity. In contrast, offspring elytra length did not differ significantly among attack densities. Our findings suggest that P . proximus adults search for and locate already colonised hosts using conspecific pheromones, and as a result, intraspecific contest competition occurs among offspring and limits their reproductive success, but not their body size.",

This micro‐wasp is a gregarious and predominantly univoltine species, active during the summer when host eggs are present in the wild. Both longhorn beetles occur sympatrically in holm oak, cork oak and Pyrenean oak forests in SW Iberia, where they can cause significant damage to trees by boring large galleries into the wood. Despite the potential of O. rudnevi as a native biocontrol agent, our understanding of its life history and parasitic capacity remains limited. This study aimed to investigate whether host egg species and oak species interact to influence O. rudnevi's reproductive allocation, adult size and sex ratio. To achieve this, we compared sentinel eggs of C. cerdo and C. welensii , which were field‐exposed in holm oak, cork oak and Pyrenean oak forests over a two‐year study (2017–2018). Our main findings were: (1) both host egg species and oak tree species significantly affected wasp clutch size and adult size, (2) larger host eggs were parasitised more frequently, regardless of host or oak species, and (3) host eggs with larger clutch sizes produced smaller adult parasitoids and more females than males. These results advance our knowledge of the life history of O. rudnevi as a native biocontrol agent of C. cerdo and C. welensii in oak woodlands and are discussed from an evolutionary perspective.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Albizia, Falcataria falcata (L.) Greuter &amp; R. Rankin (Fabaceae), is a native tree species in the Moluccas and surrounding areas. It was introduced to Java Island through a reforestation programme. Today, this tree has become one of Indonesia's top three tree species in terms of wood production. However, pests severely challenge its cultivation, notably the native stem borer Xystrocera festiva Thomson, 1861 (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). This study reviews the history, biological ecology, impact and management strategies for mitigating the impact of X. festiva in Indonesia. Native to the Indomalayan realm in Indonesia, it is restricted to the western islands. Historical records indicate that its presence in Java dates back to 1861 when the beetle species was first described. It exhibited a reliance on pre‐existing indigenous Fabaceae before the introduction of F. falcata in 1871, which later became its primary host. To date, other hosts have been observed only on Fabaceae. While its population growth on native hosts has been slow, it has surged on albizia, triggering outbreaks in many areas and contributing to wood losses. This demonstrates an example of how a minor native pest becomes a major pest on an exotic host due to large‐scale cultivation in a new environment. Broader invasion potential exists through the movement of host plants transported via interregional trade. Our review highlights the importance of sustainable pest management strategies in ensuring the viability of albizia plantations in Indonesia. Selective thinning is considered a promising silvicultural strategy, along with enhancing awareness among forestry stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the interactions between crop pests, natural enemies and semi‐natural habitats in agricultural landscapes is crucial for developing ecology‐based pest management in agroecosystems. In the present study, we investigated the local‐scale species‐specific effect of tree and shrub cover and diversity on the incidence and natural pest regulation of the millet head miner (MHM), Heliocheilus albipunctella (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) de Joannis and subsequent grain losses in a tree‐crop agroforestry system in Senegal. To this purpose, we monitored a network of 60 millet fields with variable tree and shrub species composition within a 50‐m radius buffer around the centre of millet fields. The proportion of egg‐infested panicles increased with the area covered by baobabs ( Adansonia digitata ) but decreased with that of soapberry trees ( Balanites aegyptiaca ). Baobabs and apple‐ring acacias ( Faidherbia albida ) locally increased pest incidence and associated grain loss, likely by providing favourable microhabitats for MHM and limiting the impact of larval parasitoids, respectively. In contrast, bushwillow shrubs ( Combretum micranthum ) increased egg parasitism, but not enough to disrupt the relationships between crop colonization, pest incidence and yield loss. Furthermore, Shannon's diversity index had no measurable influence on pest dynamics, suggesting that species identity and functional traits are more important than diversity per se. These findings underline the importance of careful selection of tree and shrub species in agroforestry design strategies for optimizing the delivery of multiple ecosystem services. Integrating tree functional traits, seasonal canopy dynamics and spatial scale considerations is key to enhancing ecosystem services such as biological control in tree‐crop agroforestry systems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Crop diversification can improve biological pest control, by providing resources and habitat to enhance the performance of natural enemies. The polyphagous black bean aphid ( Aphis fabae ) is a major pest in sugar beet and also an important pest in faba bean. Faba bean is potentially suitable for intercropping with sugar beet due to its beneficial attributes such as nitrogen fixation. Biological pest control, in cases where the same pest attacks both crops, thus depends on the performance of natural enemies present in those crops. To investigate the potential benefits of crop diversification on predator performance, a laboratory experiment was conducted to study the reproductive response of the predatory bug Orius majusculus, in mixed and single crop setups with faba bean and sugar beet plants. The number of eggs laid and the choice of reproductive site by O. majusculus were assessed. Orius majusculus laid nearly twice as many eggs in cages that contained both faba bean and sugar beet plants, compared with cages that contained just one of the plant species. In conclusion, faba bean has characteristics suitable, in combination with sugar beet, for an intercropping system, by supporting reproduction of O. majusculus , thus improving the biological control of the black bean aphid. Understanding arthropod ecological interactions in crop‐diverse agroecosystems makes a significant contribution to the development of resilient cropping systems.",

Egg and larval parasitoids provide inconsistent control; hence, predators present an additional integrated pest management tool. The community of arthropod predators present on Eucalyptus bosistoana F.Muell. (Myrtales: Myrtaceae) trees was defined in fortnightly abundance assessments from September to March over two consecutive growth seasons at a site in Marlborough. Subsequently, predatory taxa feeding on the two pest beetles were identified and their predation activity estimated by combining quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis of field‐collected predators (i.e., percentage of individuals testing positive for each predator taxon) and field observations of predation events. The paropsine predator community consisted of three Coccinellidae (Coleoptera) species, one Miridae (Hemiptera), one Hemerobiidae (Neuroptera), one Pentatomidae (Hemiptera), one Anystidae (Acari), one Erythraeidae (Acari) and the three spider families Araneidae, Oxyopidae and Salticidae (Araneae). Oechalia schellenbergii (Guérin) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) and Cleobora mellyi (Mulsant) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), both naturally occurring in Australia, were the most promising candidates for the support of future paropsine control in New Zealand. Oechalia schellenbergii was the most abundant predatory insect and the most active predator, with 100% of individuals testing positive for the paropsines, and the only predator taxon that fed as both immatures and adults on all paropsine life stages. Cleobora mellyi was the second most active predator, with an estimated 87% of individuals testing positive for paropsines. The results also highlight spiders as paropsine predators, especially the abundant family Araneidae. In conclusion, augmentative or conservation biocontrol using O. schellenbergii and Cl. mellyi is a promising integrated pest management opportunity. Research on methods to achieve this in plantations is required.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Biological invasions and climate change are key drivers of biodiversity redistribution, leading to severe environmental, economic, and public health consequences. This issue is particularly problematic for insect pests, which often expand their distribution via transportation with commodities. The peach twig borer, Anarsia lineatella Zeller, exemplifies an agricultural pest with a primarily restricted distribution that expanded its range to other regions. This study used species distribution modelling to predict the distribution of A. lineatella under current and future climate conditions. The model was developed using the Maxent algorithm, following best practices and recommendations for species distribution modelling. The optimized model exhibited strong statistical performance, effectively identifying suitable areas for the species (TSS = 0.76, AUC = 0.91; CBI = 0.89). It predicted suitable areas beyond the pest's current distribution, encompassing countries in the Neotropical region, northern and sub‐Saharan Africa, northeastern Asia, and southeastern and southwestern Australia. Under climate change scenarios, the model projected an expansion of A. lineatella 's range, especially under the high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP5‐8.5) for 2041 to 2060. In this scenario, the model estimated an increase of up to 14% in areas classified as optimal and 52% in areas with a high probability of occurrence, with the expansion primarily concentrated in eastern Europe. The results provide valuable insights into the potential distribution of A. lineatella , aiding in the prioritisation of regions for monitoring and adopting preventive measures against this pest.",

Samples in Hungary were taken from the canopy and herb layer of apple and pear orchards in five markedly different fruit‐growing regions by beating and sweep‐netting methods. 2 The composition of canopy spider assemblages of apple orchards was analysed for the Holartic region and found to be determined by latitude at family level, and by the main zoogoegraphical regions at genus level. At the European scale, both the genus and species composition changed along a north–south gradient. 3 A comparison among apple and pear orchards located in different regions in Hungary, showed that both foliage‐ and grass‐dwelling spider assemblages varied considerably in species composition and dominance order. 4 Within the same region, both the foliage‐ and grass‐dwelling spider assemblages showed moderate differences in apple and pear orchards submitted to different treatments. Although the assemblages of spiders inhabiting the canopy and the herbaceous layer can be unambiguously distinguished, some overlap still occurs. 5 We conclude that the composition of spider assemblages is basically determined by geographical location. Although both pesticide treatments and available prey densities can influence the population of spiders, such factors are of moderate importance when compared with the effect of regionality, even when considered at smaller scale. However, most members of the family Theridiidae and the large orb‐weavers (Araneidae) decreased considerably in treated plots. Scale‐specific differences are thus relevant in determining the composition of prey–predator systems in orchards, and should be taken into account when designing integrated pest management (IPM) programs for apple and pear orchards.",

However, because trees are totally defoliated during outbreaks, the next generation is forced to feed on current‐year needles. 2 Bupalus piniarius larvae feeding on previously defoliated trees may show lower performance either because of induced resistance or because larvae have to feed on needles not normally fed upon (current instead of mature). 3 These hypotheses were tested in an experiment where larvae were reared on (i) shoots naturally defoliated the previous year, and thus, bearing only current‐year needles, (ii) non‐defoliated shoots where larvae had access only to current‐year needles, and (iii) control shoots with access to both current and mature needles. 4 There was no support for the induction hypothesis. Survival was lower on naturally defoliated shoots than on control shoots (81.3 vs. 90.9%), but survival was lower also on non‐defoliated shoots where larvae had access only to current‐year needles (78.8%). Data on larval feeding distribution showed a strong preference for mature needles. 5 Needle nitrogen concentration of current‐year needles was 38% higher on defoliated trees than on non‐defoliated trees. 6 It is concluded that defoliation affected larval performance primarily through the removal of the preferred type of needles and not because of an induced resistance. Effects of increased concentrations of allelochemicals in defoliated shoots, if present, were probably cancelled out by increased nitrogen concentrations.",

There was a significantly higher likelihood of being parasitized by D. capito for beetle larvae developing on S. alba than on B. napus . We argue that semiochemical or morphological properties of plant species could be responsible for differential parasitism by D. capito . 4 Neither survival of D. capito nor parasitoid size differed from hosts developing on S. alba or B. napus . Pollen beetle emergence was the same for both plant species, but beetles that developed on S. alba weighed less than those from B. napus .

Forty and 120‐year‐old Scots pine trees were inoculated with ‘single’, i.e. a few inoculations of Leptographium wingfieldii and Ophiostoma minus , two blue‐stain fungi associated with the pine shoot beetle Tomicus piniperda .

Almost no emergence occurred in July and August, which may be an adaptation to avoid high temperature mortality. Emergence patterns appeared similar across seasons, with the time of year serving mainly to shift the pattern through time. 3 Cycles in D. frontalis abundance may be the result of delayed density dependence generated by its natural enemy complex.

All larger larvae were vulnerable to attack, which leaves a window of vulnerability for parasitoids of about 90% of weevil larval life. 4 Parasitoids presented with a range of host sizes showed no preference above 100 mg for the size of host first attacked, but allocated more eggs and a greater total handling time to larger hosts. 5 Most eggs were deposited on the first host attacked, with progressively fewer allocated to subsequent hosts. However, oviposition experience did not affect the time spent on the next host. 6 From these results it is anticipated that when weevil larval size is reduced by less favourable feeding substrates, fewer parasitoid eggs will be allocated to each but more host larvae will ultimately be attacked. 7 Generation time, host finding, oviposition rate, clutch size, life expectancy and diapause induction are strongly affected by temperature. Life expectancy is substantially shorter for parasitoids deprived of non‐host food supplement. At 15 and 20 °C the number of hosts attacked and the number of eggs deposited decreased with female age. 8 Bracon hylobii is inevitably poorly synchronized with a variable life‐cycle host; it is egg‐limited and can enter diapause at a relatively high field temperature. None of these characteristics suggest that it could stabilize the abundance of its host below an economically acceptable threshold density. However, the reproductive potential of the parasitoid suggests that it could make a significant contribution to larval mortality and suppress adult recruitment, thus complementing other control strategies.",

Both species were released in the summer into two E. nitens plantations with economically damaging Chrysophtharta populations. 3 Differences between dispersal of coccinellids fed the three diets were slight; beetles brought straight out of overwintering before release were initially slower moving onto trees. 4 Numbers of coccinellids on trees in monitoring plots decreased exponentially with time, and populations had returned to prerelease levels 7 days after release. The number of coccinellids recaptured decreased with increasing distance from the release point with very few coccinellids per tree at 70 m distance. Dispersal of C. mellyi away from the release plot was slower than that of H. conformis. 5 Numbers of coccinellids on trees were significantly related to predation levels of C. bimaculata with a large decrease in the C. bimaculata population to below the economic damage threshold in plots where the numbers of coccinellids were high. 6 The results of this study suggest that inundative release of laboratory reared coccinellids is possible for biological control of C. bimaculata , although it may only be economically viable in small, environmentally sensitive areas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Swietenia macrophylla King (Meliaceae: Swietenioideae) provides one of the premier timbers of the world. The mahogany shoot borer Hypsipyla robusta Moore (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) is an economically important pest of S. macrophylla throughout Asia, Africa and the Pacific. No viable method of controlling this pest is known. Previous observations have suggested that the presence of overhead shade may reduce attack by H. robusta, but this has not been investigated experimentally. This research was therefore designed to assess the influence of light availability on shoot‐borer attack on S. macrophylla , by establishing seedlings under three different artificial shade regimes, then using these seedlings to test oviposition preference of adult moths, neonate larval survival and growth and development of shoot borer larvae. Oviposition preference of shoot borer moths was tested on leaves from seedlings grown under artificial shade for 63 weeks. A significant difference in choice was recorded between treatments, with 27.4 ± 1.5 eggs laid under high shade and 87.1 ± 1.8 under low shade. Neonate larval survival on early flushing leaflets of S. macrophylla did not differ significantly between shade treatments. Larval growth rate, estimated by measuring daily frass width, was significantly higher for those larvae fed on seedlings from the high and medium shade treatments (0.1 mm/day), than the low shade treatment (0.06 mm/day). In laboratory‐reared larvae, the total mass of frass produced was significantly higher in the high shade treatment (0.4 g) than under the low shade treatment (0.2 g). Longer tunnel lengths were bored by larvae in plants grown under high shade (12.0 ± 2.4 cm) than under low shade (7.07 ± 1.9 cm). However, pupal mass under low shade was 48% higher than that under the high shade treatment, suggesting that plants grown under high shade were of lower nutritional quality for shoot borer larvae. These results indicate that shading of mahogany seedlings may reduce the incidence of shoot borer attack, by influencing both oviposition and larval development. The establishment of mahogany under suitable shade regimes may therefore provide a basis for controlling shoot borer attack using silvicultural approaches.",

Therefore, the overall effect of azadirachtin on weevil populations in the field is difficult to assess, except by collecting weevils to determine whether they are able to lay viable eggs.",

The possibility that the performance of E. abietinum is reduced on previously infested Sitka spruce, and that this is the cause of year‐to‐year fluctuations in population density, was investigated by comparing population development and the growth rate of individual aphids on experimentally defoliated trees. 2 Separate experiments were performed to determine whether aphid performance was reduced either in the autumn immediately after defoliation in the spring, or was reduced in the spring of the next year. Different rates of initial defoliation on trees used to test aphid performance were created by artificially infesting the trees with aphids in the spring before the experiments, and varying the time of infestation. 3 Population development and the mean relative growth rate (MRGR) of individual aphids on previously defoliated and undefoliated Sitka spruce did not differ significantly in the spring of the next year. No differences were observed in the nutrient content of the 1‐year‐old needles of previously defoliated or undefoliated trees at this time. 4 In the autumn and winter immediately after spring defoliation, aphid MRGR was significantly higher on trees that had been heavily defoliated earlier in the season compared with trees that had been lightly defoliated. However, the difference in MRGR decreased over the winter period. Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium concentrations were 9.4–12.2% higher, at the beginning of the autumn, in the current year needles of heavily defoliated trees than in the current year needles of lightly defoliated trees. 5 The experiments indicate that high populations of E. abietinum in the spring do not induce any defensive mechanisms in Sitka spruce that adversely affect subsequent generations of the aphid. By contrast, the results suggest that high spring densities of the aphid improve the nutritional quality of the current year's foliage for autumn generations.",

We hypothesized that forest fragmentation and the resulting proportional increase in stand edge habitats may have led to the increase in outbreak area: D. pini may profit from edge habitats and so escape its control mechanisms more easily. This hypothesis was based on the observation that no outbreak occurred in neighbouring Russian Karelia, where the proportion of edge habitats between different stand types and/or successional stages is significantly less than in Finland. 2 To test the hypothesis, we determined the amount and condition of cocoons in an outbreak area, along transects going from stand centres through edge habitats, towards neighbouring stand centres. 3 Both the total number and number of cocoons in different conditions varied significantly between edges and centres. The effects were more pronounced when age difference between neighbouring stands increased. 4 Edge habitats did not benefit D. pini . Both the total number and number of hatched cocoons were consistently higher in centre than in edge habitats. 5 Defoliation was unrelated to distance from the edge, even on transects where cocoon density and condition was correlated to distance from the edge. 6 We conclude that edge habitats have an inhibitive effect on D. pini densities, and therefore our original hypothesis was rejected. The importance of small mammals to D. pini mortality was demonstrated, and we suggest further investigation of this predator–prey relationship because of its potential for limiting outbreak risk and/or damage through silvicultural measures.",

There is potential for parasitoids to be exposed directly to contaminants, including gene products in transgenic crops, through feeding on plant materials, honeydew or hosts. Among such potential contaminants are lectins such as Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) and concanavalin agglutinin (Con A). The effect of direct exposure to honey diets containing GNA and Con A on the longevity and fecundity of E. pennicornis was examined. These lectins have been expressed in a number of plant species for the control for various insect pests. Both GNA and Con A significantly reduced longevity and fecundity at the highest concentration used (0.5% w/v). The effect on fecundity was shown to be related to a reduction in longevity. Examination of the gustatory response of adult female E. pennicornis to honey diet containing 1% w/v GNA or Con A revealed no significant differences in consumption rate on first exposure. A significant reduction in the time spent feeding on diet containing 1% Con A was found on the second exposure to the diet. This could have been the result of either a conditioned aversion response or the intoxication of the insect. The effect of Con A on longevity and fecundity could have been, in part, a result of reduced food intake. Studies on nutrition and egg resorption demonstrated that the availability of honey solution prolongs the longevity of E. pennicornis and the lack of a source of nutrition promotes oosorption. A greater understanding of feeding behaviour and ovigeny is required to understand fully the potential ecological consequence of transgenic crops on parasitoid species through routes of direct exposure to transgene products.",

    "abstract": "The sweet potato butterfly Acraea acerata is an indigenous species in Ethiopia that has become a major pest on the introduced sweet potato Ipomoea batatas . To assess the role of wild Ethiopian Ipomoea species as host plants, the presence of larvae on wild ipomoeas was studied, and female oviposition choice and larval performance were tested on five wild ipomoeas, as well as on sweet potato. In laboratory tests, oviposition and larval development were successful on two wild ipomoeas ( Ipomoea tenuirostris and Ipomoea cairica ) but no oviposition occurred on the remaining three species. Of the latter, larvae did not feed on Ipomoea hochstetteri and Ipomoea indica , and survival rates were extremely low on Ipomoea purpurea . Sweet potato was a better host plant than I. tenuirostris and I. cairica in terms of oviposition preference, larval survival and pupal size; pupae were larger, resulting in more fecund female butterflies. In the wild butterfly populations were abundant on I. tenuirostris but absent on I. cairica . Females also tended to prefer I. tenuirostris to I. cairica in oviposition choice experiments. However, no significant differences in performance were found between larvae raised on I. tenuirostris and I. cairica in the laboratory. Wild populations of A. acerata also existed on Ipomoea obscura , a plant not investigated in the present study. The abundance of A. acerata on wild ipomoeas is too low to likely affect butterfly population densities on sweet potato. However, wild populations may act as reservoirs subsequent to butterfly population bottlenecks on sweet potato.",

Despite numerous field-trapping studies on this predator, the response of individual T. dubius to bark beetle pheromones, host tree volatiles and visual stimuli has seldom been studied in the laboratory. 2 We present a detailed description of T. dubius chemotactic behaviour using wind tunnel observations. We investigated the effect of a synomone, the tree volatile α-pinene, on the T. dubius response towards two kairomones, ipsenol and frontalin, which are, respectively, principal components of Ips grandicollis (Eichhoff) and Dendroctonus frontalis (Zimmermann) prey pheromones. We also compared the chemotactic responses of predators to vanilla (an artificial flavour) and α-pinene, and the response to black and white silhouettes presented near the volatile source. 3 The mean rate of one antennal behaviour (called 'stand up') was significantly higher when adult T. dubius were exposed to a semiochemical relative to a blank (no chemical) or to vanilla. The percentage of upwind flights (insects landing upwind and performing at least one 'stand up' antennal behaviour) was also significantly higher for semiochemical treatments. The presence of α-pinene did not increase significantly the T. dubius response to ipsenol or frontalin. Predators landed more frequently near black silhouettes but the difference was not significant. 4 Percentages of predators landing closer than 40 cm to the semiochemical source increased significantly during the second trial (43–63%), suggesting a possible effect of experience on chemotactic behaviour.",

For these reasons, it is highly advisable to find a way of reducing the risk of bark beetle outbreaks without extensive removal of logging residues, which is inconsistent with nature conservation. The coverage of Pityogenes chalcographus (L.) galleries and the presence of other bark beetle species on 3520 fragments of logging residues of the Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris L.) that originated over different months from 2004 to 2008 were examined in 135 stands in four study areas of the Czech Republic. Pityogenes chalcographus was the most abundant species. The month of felling had a significant effect on the coverage of P. chalcographus galleries on logging residues. Concentrating felling in August and September (and possibly October) can minimize the risk of P. chalcographus multiplication and outbreaks.",

Dendroctonus micans and R. grandis were reared at a range of constant temperatures. Lower developmental threshold temperature (LDT) and day degree (DD) requirements for the egg, larval and pupal stage of D. micans were estimated to be 7.4 °C 153 DD, 6.6 °C 527 DD and 7.2 °C 126 DD, respectively. At 12.5, 15 and 17.5 °C, prior to prepupal cell formation, fifth-instar larvae underwent a diapause, which has not been observed previously in this species. Prepupal development rate also did not increase linearly with temperature. For R. grandis, the LDT and DD requirements for the egg, larval, prepupal and pupal stages were 5.7 °C 84 DD, 6.2 °C 263 DD, 8.1 °C 90 DD and 6.8 °C 178 DD, respectively. At 12.5 and 15 °C, most prepupae failed to pupate, which is indicative of a facultative diapause. The key developmental parameters reported in the present study may be used to model the phenology of the beetles throughout their range, providing better-timed control strategies or to predict outbreak risk under climate change as a result of reduced biocontrol effectiveness.",

Males from selected colonies are more sexually competitive than nonselected males. The present study aimed to analyse the demographic changes recorded in the study colony throughout four consecutive generations, comparing this colony with the parental colony and a wild strain. The results obtained showed that, in the selected strain, fecundity increased, whereas survival diminished, compared with the laboratory parental strain. The increases in fecundity rates were observed at the first generation after selection. No changes were observed in the duration of the reproductive period in the selected strain. Compared with wild flies, selected flies had lower life expectancy, earlier and shorter reproductive period, and greater daily fecundity at young ages (10–30 days), although with lower lifetime fecundity rates. The four generations of the selected colony showed similar patterns of survival and reproduction. The better mating performance and the increase in early fecundity suggest that selection could contribute to improve rearing efficiency and SIT effectiveness.",

Predators were sampled by sweep‐net at regional and local scales within the Dry Highveld Grassland Bioregion. A list is provided of predators that occurred naturally inside maize agro‐ecosystems, which may be good candidates for the biological control of pests. Diversity indices displayed significantly lower values in maize fields compared with uncultivated vegetation. Marginal and rangeland vegetation had similar diversity levels. Predator diversity of maize was probably dependent on source populations from uncultivated vegetation, highlighting the importance of field margins with respect to maintaining predator diversity in pest management regimes for maize fields. Some predators frequented maize fields, suggesting adaptability to agricultural disturbance. Generalists including Cheilomenes lunata , Chrysoperla congrua and Enoplognatha molesta may be suitable for conservation biocontrol because they can persist in annual agro‐ecosystems year‐round provided that they have access to field margins.",

Factors controlling the timing of swede midge diapause events are not well understood. Pre‐diapause larval swede midge populations were isolated within cages in the field and tracked for emergence over 3 years. Diapause frequency was inversely correlated with photoperiod and absolute maximum air temperature, however photoperiod did not influence emergence timing. Emergence from diapause occurred in two large peaks, in mid‐June and early July, with a third, smaller peak in late August. Emergence phenotypes may correspond to different diapause durations from 236 to 296 days, or post‐diapause development requiring between 516 and 1449 degree days. Approximately 2% of swede midges overwintered for 2 years. Early control efforts would be most effective if they targeted the diapausing cohort ( i.e. adults emerging June to July) to prevent damage by subsequent generations. Although few individuals overwintered for 2 years, prolonged diapause should be considered when crop rotation is employed for swede midge management.",

We evaluated the traditional practice of storing black ash logs submerged in water as a possible method for killing within‐tree life stages of A. planipennis at the same time as preserving the wood's value for basketmaking. Black ash trees infested with overwintering A. planipennis larvae were felled and cut into 60‐cm bolts in 2010 and in 2011. These were submerged in a river for different lengths of time and, after treatment, placed into rearing tubes to determine survival and adult emergence, or dissected within 24 h to determine larval mortality, and then pounded and peeled into splints to assess colour and pliability. In 2010, all A. planipennis larvae had died and no adults emerged from logs submerged in spring for 10 weeks or longer, whereas some larvae survived and adults emerged from logs submerged for up to 9 weeks. In 2011, submergence for 18 weeks during winter or 14 weeks in spring resulted in complete mortality of A. planipennis larvae and no emergence of adults at the same time as still preserving wood quality for basketmaking.",

From 2002 onward, PTW has emerged as a problem in the Bologna province, the main potato production area in Northern Italy. Field investigations were performed to study the temporal and spatial dynamics of PTW. Adult moths were monitored using pheromone-baited traps over 3 years (2009–2011). Traps were georeferenced and catches were analyzed by geostatistical maps. Each year, the percentage of damaged tubers at harvest was assessed. Pheromone trapping, integrated with temperature-dependent developmental times, showed that PTW completed two generations throughout the potato-growing season; the remaining generations developed in the noncrop season. Maps showed a clumped distribution of PTW at the landscape scale. The hot spots of infestation corresponded to the areas most intensively cropped with potato. Trap catches from hilling to harvesting were linearly and positively correlated with the percentage of damage in 2 out of 3 years and in the pooled data set. The present study demonstrated the widening of PTW areal to Northern Italy. In this area, georeferenced pheromone traps were validated as a useful monitoring technique for describing the phenology and distribution of PTW, thus providing crucial knowledge for the rational management of this pest.",

    "abstract": "Eriophyoid mites are among the most ubiquitous gall‐inducing arthropods, and are adapted species‐specifically to a broad diversity of plants, although their life histories remain poorly studied outside agricultural systems. We examined the seasonal phenology of a leaf‐galling eriophyid mite, the maple spindle gall mite Vasates aceriscrumena (MSGM), in naturally occurring stands of sugar maple Acer saccharum in south‐central Ontario in 2007 and 2008. Galls were first induced in spring (mid‐May) and were devoid of mites by late August. In the study region, MSGM appears to have at least two generations, with overwintering, deutogyne females that initiate galls in spring (mid‐May) after leaf flush, giving rise to a generation of protogyne (primary) females and a few morphologically similar males (&lt;1 for every 10 females) and, subsequently, to a new generation of deutogyne females in mid‐July to early August. In July, some galls can be highly crowded, with 50–200 individuals per gall. In addition, a tarsonemid mite, Tarsonemus acerbilis , was found in approximately 40% of MSGM galls examined. As much as 95.4% of galls in 2007 and 97.4% in 2008 that contained tarsonemid larvae did not contain MSGM eggs (by contrast, only 2.3% of tarsonemid‐free galls contained no MSGM eggs), suggesting that these juveniles feed, at least opportunistically, on MSGM eggs. Gall ostiole morphology appeared to influence both MSGM and Tarsonemus densities within galls, with ‘open’ ostioles (versus ‘closed’) being much more susceptible to invasion by the tarsonemid. The latter is likely to be an important regulator of MSGM populations. We hypothesize that the two ostiole types are the result of selection pressures on the gall inducer, favouring closed gall entrances for increased protection, and possibly also on the host tree, favouring open galls to increase predator access.",

The weevil is known to be relatively sedentary and closely associated with its host plant but little is known about the species' ability to migrate between banana fields and in nonhost habitats. 2 Mark–recapture experiments were conducted to assess the weevils' migration potential, possible differences between the sexes, and the relative attractiveness of pseudostem and pheromone baits. 3 One thousand two hundred marked weevils were released in the nonhost habitat at five distances (5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 m) from fresh pseudostem, and from pitfall traps baited with 45 mg of sordidin. 4 Two hundred males and 200 females were marked and released at five distances (5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 m) from the pheromone traps. 5 Distance and distance/bait interactions had a significant effect on recaptured weevils (binary logistic regression). The two baits were almost equally attractive to weevils in the range 0–10 m, whereas the pheromone was more attractive in the range 10–100 m. 6 Distance, bait and distance/bait interactions had a significant effect on the time elapsed from release to recapture (regression with life data) but the pattern observed was not consistent. 7 There was no significant difference between males and females with respect to distance or time elapsed from release to recapture. 8 The results obtained in the present study show that the migration potential of the banana weevil is greater than previously reported.

We quantified patterns of host availability and the capacity of adults to succeed in a system with high host variability both within and between seasons in Michigan, U.S.A. We quantified phenological development of foliage on three host species [sugar maple, Acer saccharum Marshall; ironwood, Ostrya virginiana (Mill.) K. Koch; and raspberry, Rubus spp.]. We estimated adult abundance using emergence traps and sweep net sampling over 3 years, and compared field host associations with laboratory choice assays. Host plant phenology varied among species, between years, and in their interactions. The four most common weevils, Phyllobius oblongus (L.), Polydrusus sericeus (Schaller), Barypeithes pellucidus (Boheman) and Sciaphilus asperatus (Bonsdorff), emerged in early to mid‐June, in approximately that order. After emergence, each species showed evidence of host preference based on their abundances on foliage. Overall, P. oblongus and B. pellucidus were most prevalent on sugar maple, P. sericeus was most prevalent on ironwood, and S. asperatus was relatively evenly distributed. Laboratory choice tests with P. oblongus and P. sericeus confirmed these preferences. These four invasive species comprised over 99% of all 12 845 weevils obtained, suggesting displacement of native species. The optimal sampling methods varied among weevil species. These invasive weevils contend with the highly variable conditions of their environment, and also potential phenological asynchrony, via relatively late emergence, even at the cost of lower host quality. Annual variation is greater for numbers of adults than larvae, suggesting that mortality of late instars or pupae is particularly important.",

We studied how Calosoma sycophanta influences the interaction between its prey [Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera, Lymantriidae)] and two microsporidian pathogens [Nosema lymantriae (Microsporidia, Nosematidae) and Vairimorpha disparis (Microsporidia, Burellenidae)] infecting the prey.Using laboratory experiments, C. sycophanta was allowed to forage on infected and uninfected L. dispar larvae and to disseminate microsporidian spores when preying or afterwards with faeces.The beetle disseminated spores of N. lymantriae and V. disparis when preying upon infected larvae, as well as after feeding on such prey. Between 45% and 69% of test larvae became infected when C. sycophanta was allowed to disseminate spores of either microsporidium.Laboratory choice experiments showed that C. sycophanta did not discriminate between Nosema-infected and uninfected gypsy moth larvae. Calosoma sycophanta preferred Vairimorpha-infected over uninfected gypsy moth larvae and significantly influenced transmission.When C. sycophanta was allowed to forage during the latent period on infected and uninfected larvae reared together on caged, potted oak saplings, the percentage of V. disparis infection among test larvae increased by more than 70%. The transmission of N. lymantriae was not affected significantly in these experiments.Beetles never became infected with either microsporidian species after feeding on infected prey.We conclude that the transmission of N. lymantriae is not affected. Because no V. disparis spores are released from living larvae, feeding on infected larvae might enhance transmission by reducing the time to death and therefore the latent period.",

For many insects, these parameters are difficult to assess directly, although they may be assessed indirectly using population genetic data. We used microsatellite markers to examine population genetic structure of the western cherry fruit fly, the main pest of cherry crops in western North America, in British Columbia, Canada, and make inferences about connectivity and potential for movement among populations. Comparing populations from four geographical regions (separated by up to approximately 400 km), we found significant genetic differentiation both among and within regions. Using populations as the units of analysis, we observed significant isolation by distance (IBD) at larger spatial scales but not below approximately 20 km. By contrast, using individual flies as the units of analysis, we found significant IBD at scales as small as < 100 m. We saw no evidence of genetic differentiation among populations sampled from different species/varieties of plants. Our results suggest that the movement of individual flies is limited, although high levels of gene flow are maintained at scales of up to 20 km, possibly through combined effects of stepping-stone gene flow and large population sizes.",

Beetle diversity was similar between plot types, although functional grouping revealed differences as a result of mulching but not weeding. Predatory and granivorous Carabidae were most abundant in unmulched plots, mycetophages were most abundant in pine needles, and saprophages were most abundant in compost. Predatory Staphylinidae were most diverse in compost plots, and the diversity of granivores was greatest in unmulched plots. Carabid biomass was greater in unmulched than compost mulched plots partly as a result of larger beetle size. Beetle communities in unmulched and pine needles mulched plots were more similar than those in compost mulched plots. A combination of compost mulched and unmulched areas should benefit all predatory taxa, although mulch use for pest control will need to be evaluated within the context of other production goals.",

However, many of these interactions occur within trees, where beetles and mites develop. Within‐tree interactions are potentially important to beetle and mite reproduction, as well as beetle–mite phoretic pairings. We performed experiments aiming to characterize the behaviours of mites associated with Ips pini (Say) and Ips grandicollis (Eichoff) during nondispersal life stages. Mites are highly specific in the location on which they attach to beetles. Detachment from beetles is elicited by cues associated with both beetle vectors and tree hosts. Beetle condition can trigger rapid mite departure and Iponemus confusus Lindquist detach more rapidly from beetles colonizing tissue amended with the host tree secondary compound α‐pinene than in un‐amended tissue. Within‐plant movement by detached mites is elicited by host plant volatiles. In olfactometer assays, Dendrolaelaps quadrisetus (Berlese) preferred volatiles from beetle‐infested phloem over fresh phloem and blank controls. Within host plant tissue, fungal symbionts of beetles provide a resource for mites.

To apply sex pheromone‐based pest control techniques effectively, we characterized a range of application parameters, as well as the effects of synthetic sex pheromones, in jujube orchards. Trapping radius was determined by comparing the mean number of trapped individuals at different inter‐trap distances, and mating disruption parameters were inferred by comparing the rate of trapping efficiency reduction and the infestation ratio of fruits in the experimental fields by uniformly placing different number/types of lures/100 m 2 . These studies revealed capture rates with significant differences across 10–50‐m inter‐trap distances: for example, a 30‐m or greater inter‐trap distance was suitable for monitoring and mass trapping, whereas distances &lt;20 m significantly decreased the trapping efficiency in the testing area. The studies lay the foundation for the implementation of these technologies within the context of a well‐conceived control strategy against this significant agricultural pest.",

Considering the preference of LCA for drought‐stressed plants, edge‐induced drought‐stress in plants could be one of the mechanisms behind this bottom‐up response. We hypothesized that plants growing along the forest edge suffer higher levels of drought stress, which makes them a more suitable food resource for LCA and affects LCA colony density in a Brazilian Atlantic rainforest remnant. Additionally, we investigated whether this effect is stronger in north‐facing edges because the radiation load is higher in this edge aspect in the southern hemisphere. We examined LCA colony density and plant relative water content (RWC) by relating them to edge distance and edge orientation. We recorded 57 LCA colonies in which the density showed an approximately six‐fold increase within the first 50 m of the forest compared with distances &gt; 150 m. North‐facing edges presented an approximately four‐fold higher colony density compared with other edge aspects. Among the 296 plant individuals sampled, the average RWC was unrelated to edge distance, although plants growing near north‐facing edges had approximately 10% lower RWC values compared with in south‐facing edges. We also found that, considering edge orientation, the lower the average RWC, the higher the LCA colony density. We conclude that drought stress‐induced osmoregulation of plants varies with edge orientation and also that LCA may profit from changes in leaf quality in terms of an increased population density along edges, where plant individuals face higher drought stress levels.",

We investigated the effects of a cold treatment (2 °C for 16 h) on flight performance in adult false codling moth, Thaumatotibia leucotreta . Using diverse methods, flight performance was tested using flight assays in the laboratory and in the field under varying environmental conditions. The flight performance of T. leucotreta in the laboratory was affected by cold treatment (relative to a 25 °C control group), test temperature and their interaction. Field recapture of released moths was significantly affected by the interaction between cold treatment and environmental conditions. Field recapture counts depended on the ambient temperature upon release. For example, under warmer conditions (&gt;17 °C), the recapture count of cold‐treated moths was lower than that of the untreated control group, whereas the recapture count of cold‐treated moths at cooler temperatures was significantly higher. Our results suggest a temperature‐dependent interaction between acute cold exposure and flight performance in adult T. leucotreta , which may be used to enhance the efficacy of the sterile insect technique under cooler environmental conditions.",

We quantified the effect of seed and carabid density on consumption by two carabid species ( Poecilus cupreus and Harpalus affinis ) of the weed species Taraxacum officinale and Viola arvensis . For each pairing of carabid and weed species, we quantified per capita seed mortality (PCSM) over 72 h under combinations of low and high densities of carabids and seeds, aiming to assess whether per capita consumption increased more or less than proportionally with seed density. We tested three hypotheses: (i) PCSM is constant as seed availability increases; (ii) for a fixed seed density, PCSM decreases with increasing numbers of carabid conspecifics; and (iii) the response of PCSM changes with the interaction between seed and carabid density. Without intraspecific competition, we detected a seed density‐independent predation effect, which became inverse density‐dependent over time. At similar seed densities, the presence of conspecific carabids did not affect PCSM, although it led to a faster shift towards inverse density dependence in T. officinale . The findings of the present study suggest that a sufficiently large carabid numerical response might lead to direct predation density‐dependence.",

Despite being attacked by a number of natural enemies, populations occur frequently at high density in several areas. Egg parasitism was studied in 27 pine and cedar forests in Algeria, in relation to the host density (tents per tree) and the proportion of forest cover in the landscape. Egg parasitism varied from 2% to 25%, accounted by two parasitoid species, the specialist Baryscapus servadeii and the generalist Ooencyrtus pityocampae . Tent density was negatively correlated with parasitism by B. servadeii but not with that of O. pityocampae . Conversely, parasitism by O . pityocampae increased with the proportion of forest and agricultural cover, but not in the case of B. servadeii . Maximum summer temperature showed no correlation with parasitism rates. Still, temperature frequently exceeded 40 °C during the period of adult parasitoid activity. The low performance of the egg parasitoids at the southern edge of the host range could be explained by the reduced fecundity of the host, climate effects, and phenological mismatching between the parasitoids and the egg development. These and other factors potentially involved the need to be further explored with a long‐term study of population dynamics.",

Hence, ecologists increasingly call for measures that reduce those negative effects on associated biodiversity. However, our knowledge about the efficiency of such measures remains scarce. We investigated the effects of gap implementation in short rotation coppices (SRCs) on carabid diversity and assemblage composition over 3 years, with pitfall traps in gaps, edges and interiors. In parallel, we quantified soil surface temperature, shrub‐ and herb cover. Edges had the highest number of species and abundances per trap, whereas rarefied species richness was significantly lower in short rotation coppice interiors than in other habitat types. Carabid community composition differed significantly between habitat types. The main environmental drivers were temperature for number of species and abundance and shrub cover for rarefied species richness. We found significantly higher rarefied species richness in gaps compared with interiors. Hence, we argue that gap implementation benefits overall diversity in short rotation coppices. Furthermore, the differences in species community composition between habitat types through increased species turnover support carabid diversity in short rotation coppices. These positive effects were largely attributed to microclimate conditions. However, to maintain positive effects, continuous management of herb layer might be necessary.",

We used a randomized block design with 60 pitfall traps to compare the system's spider diversity with that of three commonly applied corn rotations: mustard-corn, green fallow-corn and bare fallow-corn. We sampled from 13 March to 26 June 2012, which included the corresponding cultivation changes to corn. The pennycress-corn system harboured a higher spider species richness and diversity (Shannon index) than the other three systems, driven by web-building spiders. Abundance only differed between the pennycress- and bare fallow-corn system. However, separated into foraging guilds, hunting spiders were most abundant in the mustard-corn system, whereas web-building spiders were more abundant in the pennycress-corn than in the mustard- and bare fallow-corn system. The results obtained in the present study suggest that cultivation of pennycress as a biofuel feedstock in a double-cropping system has positive (and not negative) effects on the spider diversity compared with other commonly used cultivation systems.",

In the present study, we examined aggregation patterns and the influence of environmental and spatial factors on the distribution of Altica sylvia Malloch larvae within extensively managed blueberry fields to determine how exogenous and endogenous factors affect this defoliator. Altica sylvia larvae and defoliation exhibited clumped within-field distributions. A lack of correspondence between larval density and defoliation indicated that oviposition habitat selection is occasionally suboptimal in this species. Clumped distribution patterns were not explained by endogenous factors or associations with spatially structured variables. Conversely, exogenous factors acting at the patch scale affected distribution patterns because larvae were less abundant in patches located close to forest edges, as well as in patches where weeds or a nonhost blueberry plant occurred. As a result of exogenously-produced variability in A. sylvia spatial distribution, we suggest that focused sampling methods be used to monitor this herbivore. We emphasize the need for similar assessments for herbivores that forage in extensively managed crops or somewhat heterogeneous monocultures.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of the plasticity of Phratora vulgatissima (Colepotera: Chrysomelidae) behavioural responses to cues of its willow host plants is essential for understanding host affiliations of this species and for developing management strategies. We investigated how the experience obtained by adult P. vulgatissima with two different willow species shapes olfactory, feeding and oviposition preferences in the laboratory. The willow species differed in their leaf odours and phenolic glycoside contents. Females that had experienced Salix viminalis (Salicaceae) neither discriminated between odours of S. viminalis and Salix dasyclados, nor between blends of green leaf volatiles (GLV) that mimic quantitatively those released by S. viminalis and S. dasyclados. However, when females had experienced S. dasyclados, they preferred the experienced odour of S. dasyclados and the respective GLV blend to the odour of S. viminalis or its GLV blend. By contrast, regardless of their experience obtained in the adult stage, females preferred S. viminalis over S. dasyclados for feeding and oviposition. Exposure of beetles to odour of stands with various willow species might affect the experience-induced olfactory preference for a single species and thus impair host location success.",

Because larvae are incapable of leaving the fruit in search of non‐infested fruit, they are forced to share nutritional resources and eventually compete with other larvae for these. In the present study, we investigated the effect of intraspecific competition on the development of A. fraterculus and C. capitata larvae, and compared the strategies adopted by these species. To this end, newly‐hatched larvae were transferred into a container with a fixed amount of larval diet at increasing larval densities and several developmental parameters were measured. The two species showed similarities and differences in the way in which they responded to an increasing density. In A. fraterculus , pupal weight and the duration of the larval stage decreased as the competition levels increased. Larvae of C. capitata showed a consistent reduction in pupal weight and larval survival as the larval density increased. In A. fraterculus , the reduction in pupal weight was heterogeneous, with most pupae showing a marked decrease in weight and only few pupae showing slight negative effects or no effect at all, whereas, in C. capitata , the reduction was similar for all pupae. The differences in the way in which these species responded to competition suggest that there are different patterns of resource distribution among conspecific larvae. The implications of these findings for oviposition behaviour and the life history of the two species are discussed.",

To predict the risk of invasion of spotted pine aphid Eulachnus agilis (Kaltenbach, 1843), green pine aphid Eulachnus brevipilosus Börner, 1940 and narrow brown pine aphid Eulachnus rileyi (Williams, 1911) on a global scale, ecological niche modelling was applied. We used the maximum entropy model, based on associations between unique occurrence localities and a set of environmental variables. We obtained models of potentially suitable habitats, based on climatic variables and distribution of host plants, suggesting that favourable conditions for each species may be present on every continent. However, E. agilis and E. rileyi appear to be potentially the most widespread species. In Europe, models showed that the potential distribution of the representatives of the genus Eulachnus overlapped with that of the host plants. In places where they have been introduced, these aphid species have readily adapted to indigenous or introduced pines, including trees grown commercially for timber. A jackknife test indicated that annual mean temperature and mean temperature of the coldest quarter were the most important environmental variables restricting the expansion of the species under investigation. Moreover, the most important factor in the decrease in population density of the feeding aphids is the rainy season and, on a smaller scale, the presence of their natural enemies.",

The projected increase in winter temperatures under climate change could affect overwinter survival, timing of spring emergence and, ultimately, the severity of this pest. We assessed the potential effects of warmer winters in field experiments performed in three consecutive years. Three warming levels were applied: (i) heated approximately 4 °C above ambient; (ii) unheated with snow cover left intact; and (iii) unheated with snow cover removed. Survival and date of emergence were assessed in all years, and beetle lipid content was analyzed in 1 year to determine rates of energy use. Overwinter survival was 6.5–14.5% among years. Winter warming inconsistently affected overwinter survival: increasing survival in one winter, decreasing survival in the warmest winter and having no effect in one winter. Beetles that received supplemental winter warming emerged approximately 2 weeks earlier in spring, and lipid content did not differ among treatment groups. Earlier spring emergence may allow for the production of an additional generation per year of C. trifurcata under future climate change. However, further experiments are required to establish the relationship between overwinter survival and subsequent beetle population growth to determine potential pest status and best management practices under future climate conditions.",

Although the impact of T. piniperda on forestry is likely to increase in the future due to climate change, little is known about its dispersal within the United Kingdom (UK) or between continental Europe and the UK. This study addressed these knowledge gaps using mitochondrial and microsatellite DNA markers. Mitochondrial DNA revealed high levels of genetic diversity as previously reported for this species across Europe. Nuclear DNA diversity revealed two geographically incoherent groups (Scotland, Wales, Belgium and the Netherlands vs. England and Switzerland). These genetic patterns likely reflect a combination of historical gene flow, anthropogenic introduction and restricted contemporary gene flow between the UK and Europe. Significant structure was found among UK samples suggesting T. piniperda might not disperse extensively between pine stands. This differs from widespread gene flow across continental Europe and may be due to the low percentage of land covered by forests in the UK in addition to the high fragmentation of its forest cover. Genetic variation was higher among the Scottish samples compared to those from more southern clines, suggesting the potential proximity of Scotland to a Pleistocene glacial refuge for T. piniperda .",

There is a limited number of studies that have addressed these questions for generalist predator–prey networks. We investigated how vegetation complexity during crop development and management type (conventional vs. organic) affect the trophic networks of orb‐weaving spiders and their prey in rainfed lowland rice ecosystems in southern Thailand. Specifically, we investigated orb‐weaving spiders and prey composition, prey selectivity and network structure. Overall, orb‐weaving spiders captured mostly detritus‐associated Diptera, aquatic‐associated Ephemeroptera and Hemiptera pests. The increasing vegetation complexity during rice development significantly restructured the network of orb‐weaving spiders and prey, while field management had only a marginal effect. The increased vegetation complexity during rice development led to an increased number of weak trophic interactions in comparison to few but strong interactions in simple vegetation. Our results indicate that increasing the number of spider species per prey taxon (prey vulnerability) in late rice season may enhance their top‐down control of prey including rice pests. This study also highlights that the network complexity and the stability of rice ecosystems increased during the rice growing season as the vegetation became more complex. Future practices could look for a way to support the densities of detritus and aquatic insects and to artificially increase habitat complexity during the early stage of rice development to improve the biocontrol services provided by the orb‐weaving spiders.",

To better understand the risk of establishment when mobile life stages are moved, it is critical to know how long spotted lanternfly mobile life stages will survive without food and water under different temperatures. This work reports on spotted lanternfly first, second, and third instar nymphal and adult survival without food over the 10–30°C temperature range. Survival time without food declined exponentially as temperature increased for all life stages of spotted lanternfly that were evaluated. At temperatures &lt;30°C, first instar nymphs survived longer than second or third instar individuals. Female adults survived about 1 day longer than male adults at all but 10 and 25°C. Without food, 99% of all adults of both sexes are predicted to be dead in less than a week over the temperature range evaluated. First instars, which were the smallest, survived the longest and their survival exponentially decreased as temperature increased. This suggests that more attention to first instar movement may be warranted. The data presented here will provide a basis for assessing the risk of survival of transported spotted lanternfly active life stages along various pathways.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ecological intensification (EI) provides an important and increasingly adopted pathway for achieving more sustainable agricultural systems. However, the implementation and success of on‐farm EI practices may vary depending on landscape context and local management practices. We evaluated how EI interventions, including two different agricultural input regimes (high or low use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers) and floral border crops, affected local natural enemy biodiversity, pest abundance and crop yield, and how this was influenced by the surrounding landscape context across 12 rice fields on smallholder farms in Puducherry, India. Reducing agricultural inputs positively impacted the overall natural enemy assemblage; however, responses to landscape factors varied. For example, coccinellid beetles were negatively correlated with higher densities of field edges (landscape configuration). In contrast, spiders, the most abundant group surveyed, were not significantly influenced by any landscape metric. Furthermore, pest abundance was greatest in fields with reduced inputs but only at sites where floral border crops were not present. Mean rice grain yield was lower across low‐input sites compared with high‐input sites and floral border crops had opposing effects across high‐ and low‐input sites. At low‐input sites, mean yields were 33% higher where floral border crops were present. At high‐input sites, the presence of floral border crops was correlated with a lower mean yield (16%). These findings show that ecological intensification practices can benefit smallholder crop systems but highlight the need to account for variations in landscape context and local management practices for developing effective sustainable management practices.",

This has been reduced due to an increase in cone and seed damage associated with the spread of the western conifer seed bug (WCSB) throughout the Mediterranean region and the Dry Cone Syndrome appearing on pine cones. Studies on several conifer species have associated cone and seed damage with WCSB feeding. To relate cone and seed damage of stone pine to WCSB feeding, one exposure and exclusion trial of cones to the feeding of the natural WCSB population was carried out. To determine the seasonality of cone and seed damage caused by this pest, another trial consisting of bagging cones with insects was performed with first‐, second‐ and third‐year cones at different stages of cone development. The natural WCSB population was associated with cone abortion in second‐year cones (unprotected: 43.6% vs. protected: 2.7%), a decreased number of seeds per cone (82.0 vs. 105.3), kernel yield (1.8% vs. 3.8%) and proportion of sound kernels (35.6% vs. 73.6%), and numerous types of kernel damage. Cone mortality in first‐ and third‐year cones bagged with insects decreased as the bagging date advanced. A temporal sequence of kernel damage in third‐year cones (aborted, dry embryo without endosperm, and totally or partially damaged endosperm) was reported for seed development and the timing of WCSB feeding. Our findings may be useful in the management of WCSB populations to prevent significant damage to the stone pine nut crop.",

However, they potentially host pest insects, which can cause economic loss in crop fields. Some insect species have been found to spill into crops from these areas, but this varies depending on species, landscape composition and the time of the season. To determine if five common pest insects of canola crops were spilling into fields during the late growing season, we collected samples at various distances from non‐crop areas, in a part of the Canadian Prairies (Alberta, Canada) where this crop is widely grown. Sampling occurred at 15 sites in each of 10 fields ( N = 150 sites). We modelled changes in pest abundance over distance from the non‐crop areas and contrasted the abundance of each taxon in the crop and non‐crop areas. Only leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) demonstrated a declining gradient in abundance that is consistent with spillover from non‐crop vegetation areas into the canola fields. Weevils were found to have significantly higher abundance in the non‐crop areas, indicating a relationship between this taxon and the non‐crop area in the late season, but there was no decline in abundance, which might indicate spillover occurring. All taxa demonstrated spatial differences in abundance among fields. This study found limited evidence that the pests are spilling over from non‐crop vegetation into canola crops during the late season. Therefore, movement of pests from non‐crop vegetation areas at this time is unlikely to be a driver of pest pressure for this economically important crop.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Forest management practices creating small‐scale forest edge habitats in managed forests have substantial impacts on the formation of beetle assemblages. In 2021, we conducted research in a managed oak woodland in Central Slovakia using three flight interception traps (FITs) to study beetle assemblages. Two FITs were installed at the forest edge, facing both, the clearing and the closed‐stand forest, while the third FIT was positioned 100 m within the closed‐canopy forest. We employed a novel methodological approach, which involved separately collected subsamples within the ecotone using FITs differentiated as ‘ecotone inwards’ and ‘ecotone outwards’ to capture distinct directional movements at the edge. We recorded 5.997 beetle specimens, encompassing 417 species across 284 genera and 58 families. We found that the species diversity and abundance of beetles were not significantly different between the FITs. However, the species composition was significantly different. The partial detrended canonical correspondence analysis suggests that these compositional differences might be closely associated with the distribution of trophic guilds, indicating varied responses to habitat modifications induced by forest edge creation. The results of our study showed that phloephagous, saproxylophagous, xylomycetophagous, xylophagous and zoophagous beetles exhibited a positive association with the forest edge, while mycophagous, phytophagous and saprophagous groups were distinctly associated with the closed‐canopy forest. Our analyses indicated that the ‘ecotone outward’ part of forest edges of managed forest may attract higher number of trophic groups, while the ‘ecotone inward’ part of the forest edge hosted high abundances of phloephagous and xylomycetophagous species.",

Floral field margins have shown successes in reducing crop pests, though the effect may not be precise enough to control infestations in commercial crops. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) may provide a more species‐ and time‐specific control and combining these methods may have synergy. Three in‐field vegetation margins, divided into four plots each (two floral and two grass), were established in March 2022. Three strips of sprouting broccoli were planted parallel in April, May and June. Each strip had a split‐plot design, with eight replicates of four nematode treatments placed alongside each floral/grass plot: Steinernema carpocapsae , S. feltiae and Heterorhabditis bacteriophora and a nematode‐free control. Pest pressure was assessed using adult counts. Assessments of crop yield and crop damage associated specifically with the swede smidge ( Contarinia nasturtii ) were also made. It was found that utilising a combination of control measures was successful in controlling a wider range of pests, though the success of each control method was highly dependent on the time of crop plantings. Field margins had a significant influence on crop damage associated with the swede midge. The EPN H. bacteriophora was an effective control method for the cabbage stem flea beetle and the swede midge, as well as reducing crop damage and yield loss. Field margins and EPNs combined have an interactive effect on crop yield, highlighting the need for control methods to be tested in combination in future integrated pest management research to accurately understand their effects within an integrated system.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Many studies have explored the potential of companion plants to manage pests through top–down or bottom–up effects in agricultural fields. Buckwheat is known as a good candidate for companion planting with various crops to enhance pest management, but rarely in soybeans. We investigated the impact of planting buckwheat as a new companion plant on the population dynamics of major soybean pests and their natural enemies in soybean fields in Andong, Republic of Korea. We recorded numbers of pests and natural enemies at 9–10‐day intervals from 20 soybean plants each in eight small experimental fields throughout the cropping season. Significant reduction in pests, such as Riptortus pedestris (F.) (Hemiptera: Alydidae) adults, and a significant increase in natural enemies, such as Orius species (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae) and crab spiders (Araneae: Thomisidae), were observed in the buckwheat treatment plots. However, there were significant increases in other pests, such as leafminers and leafhoppers, in the buckwheat treatment plots. While we observed effects on R. pedestris adult density, we did not find significant effects on other developmental stages of this pest or its parasitoids. Although there were some concerns in the buckwheat treatment plots, the positive effects of buckwheat in soybean fields appear to outweigh the drawbacks. Buckwheat is likely a suitable companion plant for use in soybeans to manage pests.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E. Smith), identified as an invasive pest worldwide, has severely threatened agricultural production and food security in India. To formulate eco‐friendly integrated pest management strategies for S. frugiperda in its new invasive habitat, the basic knowledge about demographic parameters and damage potential of this pest is crucial. The effects of five host crops viz. maize ( Zea mays L.), popcorn ( Zea mays everta Sturt), sweet corn ( Zea mays saccharata Sturt), sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor (L.)) and soybean ( Glycine max (L.) Merr.) on the development and food consumption of S. frugiperda were examined. Population projection curves based on life table and consumption rates were drawn on different hosts using computer simulation. The pre‐adult development of S. frugiperda was fastest on popcorn (28.02 days), maize (28.04 days) and sweet corn (28.31 days) but slowest on soybean (34.83 days). The highest net reproductive rate, intrinsic rate of increase and finite rate of increase were observed on maize. The feeding potential of S. frugiperda was also highest on maize. The maximum consumption of the sixth larval instar was observed on maize (19470.47 mm 2 ) while lowest on soybean (9033.67 mm 2 ). In the simulation period of 90 days, the fastest growth of S. frugiperda was expected on maize, popcorn and sweet corn while the slowest on soybean. High larval and pupal survival recorded on the non‐maize hosts (sorghum and soybean) reflects that fall armyworm could be an obstacle in their production as well as in the success of maize‐soybean intercropping system. Simulations based on age‐stage, two‐sex life table could be helpful in predicting the most appropriate time for the pesticide application as well as augmentative releases of egg and larval parasitoids for the control of fall armyworm.",

The other economically important crops in Maine are potato, dairy and organic mixed vegetable produce. Lowbush blueberry is a complex of 1–4 Vaccinium species, primarily dominated by Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton. All but one of the insect pest species in this crop system are native to the regions where it is managed in North America. Insect decline has been shown to be a recent global phenomenon although it has rarely been studied in agricultural ecosystems. Long‐term datasets of insect species abundances are a powerful tool for insect population trends. To determine if native insect pests have declined over the past several decades in Maine lowbush blueberry, we surveyed three native species. All surveys were conducted in commercial blueberry fields; although, none of the sample sites were sprayed with insecticides. Insect pest sampling comprised two surveys (1961–2014 and 1998–2017) conducted on the larval stage of the blueberry maggot fly ( Rhagoletis mendax Curran), one survey (1981–2016) on the larval stage of the blueberry spanworm ( Itame argillacearia (Packard)), and one survey (1983–2019) on the larval stage of the blueberry flea beetle ( Altica sylvia Malloch). Based upon the analysis of our long‐term population‐level datasets, we found no evidence that insect decline has occurred in this native blueberry insect pest complex intimately associated with the lowbush blueberry, a native crop plant in North America, despite recent documentation of rapid climate change occurring in the lowbush blueberry production areas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Spring oilseed rape is severely affected by early season herbivory of various flea beetle species. Flea beetle pest management strategies with less reliance on conventional chemical insecticides are direly needed. However, the current knowledge of flea beetle ecologies and life cycles is insufficient to design and inform such strategies effectively. Using a combination of pitfall and emergence traps, we followed the life cycles of flea beetles in 13 spring oilseed rape fields in south central Sweden, measuring densities in three sampling seasons: spring activity at crop seedling stage, summer emergence of the new generation, and emergence of overwintered adults in the following spring in the adjacent grassy field margins. We found a strong positive relationship between densities of emerging Phyllotreta atra , P. striolata and P. undulata in summer and their densities earlier in spring. Flea beetle assemblage composition differed across the seasons, driven by changes in the relative abundances of different species. While assemblages emerging in summer were filtered for species reproducing in spring oilseed rape, assemblages emerging from the grassy field margins in the following spring were again more heterogeneous. Spring activity peaks and summer emergence peaks differed among species, with P. vittula having an earlier activity peak and emerging earlier than most other species. This knowledge of spatiotemporal habitat use can contribute to a more effective flea beetle management in spring oilseed rape. Especially summer emergence in the fields became apparent as a so far unexplored point in time to control flea beetle pests.",

In many regions, D. suzukii management is complicated by the fly's ability to persist on non‐crop hosts and then invade or reinvade crop fields from surrounding natural habitats. In California, non‐crop habitats adjacent to commercial cane berry fields often contain wild blackberry ( Rubus spp.), a potential overwintering host for D. suzukii . We sampled D. suzukii and its naturally occurring parasitoids (the pupal parasitoids Trichopria drosophilae and Pachycrepoideus vindemmiae ) in commercial berry fields and adjacent non‐crop habitat throughout the year, to determine whether non‐crop habitat is a seasonal or year‐round refuge for D. suzukii , and whether numbers of D. suzukii and its parasitoids in berry fields are dependent on the composition of the surrounding landscape. Numbers of D. suzukii adults were consistently higher in non‐crop habitat, and proportions of female D. suzukii were highest in berry fields, indicating that females dispersed more widely than males. The effect of habitat diversity on numbers of D. suzukii adults was positive in fall and negative in early spring, possibly reflecting differing habitat requirements of D. suzukii over time. Parasitoid numbers were also higher in non‐crop habitat and were positively affected by proportions of non‐crop habitat and cropland in summer. Results indicate that non‐crop habitats were a year‐round refuge for both D. suzukii adults and its parasitoids, and that landscape effects on D. suzukii abundance in crop fields can change over the seasons.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Insects play a vital role in ecosystem functioning, but in some parts of the world, their populations have declined significantly in recent decades due to environmental change, agricultural intensification and other anthropogenic drivers. Monitoring insect populations is crucial for understanding and mitigating biodiversity loss, especially in agro‐ecosystems where a focus on pests and beneficial insects is gaining momentum in the context of sustainable food systems. Biomonitoring has long played an important role in providing early warnings of insect pests and their vectored pathogens and for assessing agro‐ecosystem management. However, identification of invertebrates by taxonomists is time‐consuming and fraught with numerous other challenges, particularly when it comes to real‐time monitoring. Recent technological advances in both computational image recognition and molecular ecology have enhanced biomonitoring efficiency and accuracy, reducing labour efforts, but leading to unprecedented volumes of data generated. This perspective article examines the significance and further potential of deep learning with image‐based recognition, aided by complementary technologies, in advancing entomological biomonitoring. Using entomological sticky traps as an example, we discuss each step of the workflow required to create ecological networks using image‐based recognition, multimodal data and deep learning, and we identify the challenges inherent to this method and other insect survey techniques. In order to become mainstream for global biomonitoring, access to long‐term, standardised multimodal data is required for comprehending ecosystem dynamics, structure and function and for mitigating insect population declines.",

Relatively few beetles remained in the coppice fields during the winter. 3 Phratora vitellinae at the poplar sites emerged several weeks later than G. lineola and P. vulgatissima at the willow sites, reflecting the later leafing of poplar compared to willow. For all species, dispersal was by flight, with most activity during warm periods. Dispersal continued for several weeks for the willow‐ feeding species but was shorter for P. vitellinae. 4 All three species initially colonized the edge of the coppice field. Typically, 80% or more of the beetles colonising a plantation were within 8 m of the edge. Both Phratora spp. accumulated in the plantation edge zone for several weeks before leaving this area and colonising the crop interior. 5 The patterns of dispersal and colonization identified by this study may facilitate chrysomelid management practices in infested short rotation coppice that avoid the need for insecticide applications over the entire plantation.

The present work assessed the role of two biotic factors, plant quality and parasitism by Lysiphlebus testaceipes , in determining within‐plant distribution and performance of R. maidis . The mean relative growth rate of aphids inside the whorl and on a mature leaf was compared, and the concentration of hydroxamic acids in those tissues determined as an indicator of plant quality. Parasitism effectiveness and parasitoid behaviour were evaluated using three treatments: aphid colonies placed (1) wholly inside the whorl, (2) on the inner and outer surfaces of the whorl, and (3) on a mature leaf. 2 The mean relative growth rate of aphids was lower on the whorl than on the mature leaf, and hydroxamic acid concentration in the whorl was higher than in the mature leaf. 3 The number of parasitized dead aphids (mummies) inside the whorl was considerably lower than in the other two treatments. Mummies were present in 80% of the replicates in the whorl, whereas mummies were present in all replicates of the other treatments. 4 Host location time of the parasitoid was increased on the mature leaf compared with the other treatments. No significant differences in the residence time of the parasitoid in the aphid colony occurred between treatments. 5 Host location time showed a negative correlation, and residence time of the parasitoid a positive correlation with the number of aphids on the outer surface of the whorl.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Kampimodromus aberrans (Oudemans) is the most important predatory mite found in vineyards of southern France. This mite also occurs in surrounding uncultivated areas from where it disperses to colonize adjacent vineyards To determine accurately origins of immigrant mites and to study their establishment in vineyards, a study using RAPD markers (Random Amplified Polymorphism DNA) was performed. Females of K. aberrans were sampled on leaves collected in an experimental vineyard, and from several adjacent areas including neighbouring vine plots and natural plants, both of which harboured high densities of the mite. Samples were taken in May and July before and after major dispersal of K. aberrans into the experimental plot occurred. For both dates, genetic distances within population were lower than between populations and three groupings of mites were observed. Strong relationships were observed between (1) females from different parts of the same experimental vineyard (variety Cabernet‐Sauvignon), (2) females from several plants in the woody margin neighbouring this experimental plot, and (3) females from two neighbouring vineyards (variety Carignan). Populations seemed to be structured and no correlation between genetic and geographical distances was observed. Hence, definitive conclusions about origins of migrants were not possible. Once in a vineyard, mites are probably exposed to selection pressures (i.e. pesticide applications or vine variety characteristics) that largely determine differentiation of populations. Thus, despite many immigrants moving into vineyards, our study indicated that there was limited survival or reproduction of immigrants. Further studies of within vineyard selection factors and impacts on immigrant mites are needed to determine the influence of natural colonization on grape pest management.",

    "abstract": "In its second year of publication, Agricultural and Forest Entomology has continued to cover the full range of agricultural and forest entomology. Indeed, such is the diversity of topics covered in the last year that it is very difficult to summarize them all. Two papers, however, deserve mention at the outset. The first sought the middle ground between ‘hyperbole and hysteria’ on the controversial topic of the deployment of transgenic crops. The second dealt with ‘cross-talk’ between signalling pathways in plants – the idea that defence pathways induced by insects can interfere with the pathways that respond to pathogens, and therefore that insect attack can make plants more susceptible to pathogenic infection. Both were written by Mark Hunter in a series of occasional papers on Issues in Agricultural and Forest Entomology. A third paper, on the often-neglected pests that attack plants below-ground, is published in this issue. This series, by focusing on topics of particular current relevance to agricultural and forest entomology, will continue to make AFE a journal that must be read. No single topic area, pest or crop dominated the pages of AFE in 2000. There were, however, some notable themes. At a time when there is perhaps too much focus on ‘conventional’ solutions to pest management, it was particularly gratifying that natural enemies of field pests were considered in about 25% of the published papers, with many considering pathogens such as Metarhizium anisopliae var acridum. A large number of papers also dealt with other aspects of pest management. Most of these focused on the problem of monitoring and assessment for decision making; others dealt with radiation quarantine treatments, mating disruption techniques and silvicultural approaches to pest management. Studies on insect–plant interactions were the subject of several papers including research on the response of Colorado potato beetles to volatiles emitted by potato, the biochemical basis for resistance to Diprion pini in Scots pine and the rapid adaptation to resistance in gall midges on willow. Tri-trophic interactions were covered in a paper on the influence of resistance cabbage cultivars on susceptibility of diamondback moth to Bacillus thuringiensis and in the ‘Issues’ paper referred to above. The possible impact of climate change was the topic of two papers, one on drought stress and temperature on the spread of BYDV and the other on the impact of elevated CO2 on aphids feeding on Vicia faba. Other topics covered included the quantification of the impact of pests on their host-plants, pollinator management in agroecosystems, the development of insecticide resistance and the ecology of phoretic mites. We were particularly pleased to include three papers on modelling the population dynamics of pests and their natural enemies (on the horizontal transmission of Beauveria bassiana, the use of nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) for the control of the Asian gypsy moth, and the population dynamics of the bird cherry-oat aphid). The second volume of AFE has demonstrated how wide the subject of agricultural and forest entomology is and, in publishing papers across the breadth of this field, AFE has become a highly attractive journal for those interested in the management of pests, their biology, physiology and ecology, and their interactions with both their host plants and their natural enemies. We are very keen to receive your manuscripts on all of these topics. We are also keen to receive papers on the impact of management practices on the biodiversity of agroecosystems and forests. We published two papers on this topic in 2000 but, given the increasing awareness of the importance of managed forests and agroecosystems for the conservation of biodiversity, we would like to publish more. In addition, the current interest in the use of non-chemical agents for pest management in field crops has resulted in the need for an improved understanding of large-scale agri-ecology. Thus papers addressing issues of integrated pest management or ecotoxicology on a farm or regional scale would compliment those we already publish dealing with research on a field scale, and would be particularly welcome. Finally, further development of the record of AFE in publishing research into issues surrounding transgenic crops, pesticide resistance and climate change will ensure that forthcoming editions will continue to address the areas of science of current interest. Finally, we would like to take this opportunity to thank Blackwell Science, the Royal Entomological Society, the many authors who have submitted papers to AFE, the reviewers and the Editorial Board. We would particularly like to thank Keith Day for assisting us as acting editor during the year and the Board members outside the UK who have worked hard to make AFE a genuinely international journal.",

Intervention with chemical spraying has often been necessary. 4 The population data suggest that populations of P. flammea may have had a cyclic pattern over the monitoring period, with outbreaks occurring at regular intervals of between 6 and 7 years. 5 The amplitude of population cycles was large during the 1970s and 1980s, but has dampened in recent years. Natural enemies are believed to contribute to this trend.

Nut damage in the field was also significantly greater on early than on late cultivars during generation 2, while no significant differences were observed during generation 3. 4 The data suggest that the variation in codling moth damage among walnut cultivars is related to bloom phenology due to the influence of nut phenology on larval performance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Previous applications of the mating disruption technique to Neodiprion sertifer resulted in decreased numbers of males caught in the treated area but no effect on sex ratio or overall population density. The present study assessed the efficacy of mating disruption against N. sertifer outbreaks in pine stands surrounded by agricultural areas or pasture, and therefore isolated from other infested areas. Pine stands were treated by placing dispensers with an erythro‐mixture of the acetate ester of 3,7‐dimethyl‐2‐pentadecanol every 10 m in a grid. The efficacy of this technique was evaluated by comparing the number of males caught in sticky traps baited with synthetic pheromone, and by comparing the sex ratio and the population density of the sawfly in the subsequent generation between treated and control pine stands. The number of males caught within treated areas was significantly lower than in the control area. In the treated pine stands 46% of the egg clusters resulted in male cocoons only, compared to 3% of the clusters in the control stand. A significant reduction of the sawfly population was observed in the treated pine stands. The results contrast to the earlier mating disruption attempts with N. sertifer and can probably be ascribed to the isolation of the experimental stands.",

Attraction recurred during early milk stage at or before 50% emergence of adult female D. barberi or D. v. virgifera , respectively, and before populations declined for the season. 4 Synergistic interaction of 2‐phenyl‐1‐ethylamine with 2‐phenyl‐1‐ethanol in attracting D. barberi females did not occur until maize matured to late milk stage. 5 The amine‐alcohol blend (0.44 point sources m −2 ) doubled the density of D. barberi but not D. v. virgifera when applied to small plots within mostly milk‐stage or younger maize. Traps without bait within attractant‐treated plots captured more female, but not male, D. barberi than did traps in untreated control plots, hinting that females accounted for most of the observed increase in beetle density. 6 The results suggest that attractants can be used despite phenological limitations to concentrate preovipositional females within field areas and thus to complement a variety of corn rootworm control strategies.",

However, the number of eggs laid was equivalent to the egg load at the beginning of the oviposition period, suggesting that eggs available in the morning are laid during the following day. 4 Population estimates of daily oviposition rates, approximately 0.7 eggs per beetle and day, were close to estimates from laboratory studies when the proportion of gravid females was taken into consideration.",

Less than 30% of female P. strobi became sexually mature and laid eggs without experiencing dormancy under a temperature regime of 2 °C for 4 weeks. Among the females that experienced a cold temperature treatment after emergence, 80% laid eggs after dormancy when exposed to a long‐day (LD 16 : 8 h) photoperiod and 17.6% laid eggs when exposed to a short‐day (LD 8 : 16 h) photoperiod. Significantly more eggs were laid by all the females (with and without a cold treatment) when subjected to a long‐day photoperiod compared with a short‐day photoperiod. A period of cold temperature followed by exposure to a long‐day photoperiod with warmer temperatures is required to break reproductive diapause and to obtain a good oviposition response in female P. strobi . This study reveals the existence of much intraspecific variation in the response of the white pine weevil to temperature and photoperiod with respect to the induction and termination of reproductive diapause.",

Geostatistical procedures were used to characterize spatial dependence of locust density, to evaluate the possibility of estimating locust densities at unvisited sites, based on information obtained at surveyed sites, and to create density maps. 2 Sample variograms indicate that population densities were spatially correlated over ranges from 5 to 24 km. The range of spatial correlation decreased as dry conditions towards the end of the rainy season concentrated the locusts in contracting areas of sufficient humidity and availability of green vegetation. The rather small ranges of spatial correlation indicate that sampling needs to be conducted at a refined scale (&lt; 24 km between sample points) to avoid missing hot spots of desert locust. 3 Locust densities were highly correlated with cover abundance of the wild plant Heliotropium arbainense and cultivated millet, Pennisetum typhoidum . The association of locusts with these host plants can be used to target sampling and enhance detection chance. 4 The relationship between sampling intensity and kriging variance was explored.

This type of induced plant response may reduce insect damage and could potentially be utilized for plant protection in agricultural systems. 2 Here, we investigated if the willow species most commonly used for biomass production in short rotation coppice, Salix viminalis , also responds to adult beetle grazing by increasing trichome density. Larval performance and feeding behaviour on plants previously exposed to adult beetles was compared with that on undefoliated control plants in a greenhouse. 3 We found an overall decrease in trichome density within all the plants (i.e. trichome density was lower on new leaves compared to that for older basal leaves on S. viminalis ). However, leaves of beetle defoliated plants had a higher trichome density compared to control plants. Larval growth and feeding was not affected by this difference between treatments. Larvae appeared to remove trichomes when feeding on S. viminalis , a behaviour that might explain the lack of difference between treatments.",

Three traps per site were baited with 100 µg of the N. sertifer sex pheromone, the acetate ester of (2 S ,3 S ,7 S )‐3,7‐dimethyl‐2‐pentadecanol (diprionol), in maturing pine stands in southern and central Finland. In addition, three different dosages (1, 10 and 100 µg) of the pheromone were tested in 1991–92. The highest number of males was observed in traps baited with the highest dose. On average, there was a 10‐fold increase in trap catch between lure doses. Density of overwintering eggs was used to evaluate the effectiveness of pheromone traps in predicting sawfly populations. The proportion of healthy overwintering eggs was determined each year. A model based on the number of current shoots on sample trees, diameter at breast height and tree height was formulated to estimate eggs per hectare. Linear regression analysis produced high coefficients of determination between number of males in traps and density of total eggs in the subsequent generation, when populations were at peak densities. The relationships were not significant for low population densities. The results indicate a risk of moderate defoliation when the seasonal trap catch is 800–1000 males per trap or higher.",

These compounds, in a similar ratio, were previously reported to be the pheromone of Carpophilus lugubris , a closely related species. The four minor C. sayi compounds (less than 4% as abundant as the first) were also alkyl‐branched hydrocarbons and consisted of two additional tetraenes and two trienes. 3 The pheromone of C. lugubris was re‐examined to refine the comparison with C. sayi , and C. lugubris was found to have the same additional, minor tetraenes as C. sayi , but not the trienes. 4 A synthetic mixture of the two major compounds was behaviourally active for both sexes of C. sayi in oak woodlands in Minnesota. The pheromone was tested in combination with fermenting whole wheat bread dough (a potent synergist of nitidulid pheromones). The combination of the 500‐µg pheromone dose and dough attracted at least 30‐fold more C. sayi than either pheromone or dough by itself. The synergized pheromone has potential as a tool for monitoring insect vector activity in an integrated management program for oak wilt. 5 Although C. lugubris was not present at the Minnesota test sites, two other Carpophilus species, Carpophilus brachypterus and Carpophilus corticinus , were clearly cross‐attracted to the synergized pheromone of C. sayi .",

Counts were made during the middle week of each month from September to July for 4 years (1999–2003), and mean E. abietinum densities at each canopy position were calculated separately for each month and for the low‐, mid‐ and high‐altitude sites. 3 During September to November, the highest densities of E. abietinum occurred on 3–4‐year‐old needles on branches low in the canopy. Over the winter and spring, the centre of the aphid’s distribution shifted outward and upward, so that by June of the next year the highest aphid densities occurred on current and 1‐year‐old needles on branches near the top of the tree. 4 The aphid distribution was re‐set each year during July, at the time when the nutrient quality of the host was in decline and E. abietinum populations were decreasing. Aphid densities decreased less on 3–4‐year‐old needles than on current and 1‐year‐old needles, suggesting that older needles were a superior food resource at this time of year and in the autumn. However, other factors, such as higher temperatures in the upper canopy during the summer or differential mortality caused by natural enemies, could also have contributed to the change in distribution. 5 The outward and upward shift in the aphid distribution over the winter period provided no evidence that aphids at positions lower and deeper in the canopy were better insulated from freezing temperatures and had higher over‐winter survival rates. Mean air temperatures at the top and bottom of the canopy during the winter were also found to differ by only 0.1–0.2 °C. 6 The percentage of the total aphids per tree that occurred on current or 1‐year‐old needles varied widely between seasons and between sites. Consequently, sampling programmes designed to estimate total population numbers of E. abietinum have little option but to sample needles throughout the canopy, and at regular intervals during the period when the aphid is abundant.",

In the cool‐wet ecozone of western Amhara, sole maize was compared with maize intercropped with faba bean, mustard, potatoes and cowpea. In the semi‐arid ecozone of eastern Amhara, the trial was conducted on both maize and sorghum with the companion crops haricot bean, sesame, cowpea and sweet potatoes. 2 The results showed that the predominant borer species in western and eastern Amhara were, respectively, Busseola fusca and Chilo partellus . In Addis Zemen, western Amhara, maize intercropped with mustard and potatoes had significantly lower pest numbers and percent tunnelling than other intercrops and the maize monocrop during the vegetative stage. In eastern Amhara, the cropping system did not significantly affect pest densities but damage to stem, ear or heads tended to be greatest when cereals were intercropped with sweet potatoes. 3 Parasitism of C. partellus by the braconid Cotesia flavipes was greater on maize than sorghum, and on maize it was greater with sweet potatoes than in other intercrops or sole maize. Cocoon mass number per plant did not vary significantly between treatments. 4 There were significant differences between treatments in yields of both sorghum and maize (per plant and per unit area) with the lowest yields observed when they were intercropped with a tuber crop. 5 The results suggest that simultaneous planting of the crop species selected has little advantage over monocropped maize.",

Since being listed in the ISI Web of Knowledge for four years, we obtained our first Impact Factor, which, at 1.533, put Agricultural and Forest Entomology in the top 10 entomological journals. In the last four years we have published 150 papers, written by 449 authors, covering a wide variety of topics on agricultural and forest entomology. Papers have discussed important pests such as the Colorado potato beetle Leptinotarsa decemlineata and the large pine weevil Hylobius abietis, natural enemies such as the predatory mites of the apple-grass aphid Rhopalosiphum insertum and the entomopathogenic nematodes of the cabbage root fly Delia radicum, options for managing pests, including trap cropping and floral understoreys, the implications of climate change, organic farming and many other topics. For the last five years, the Royal Entomological Society journals have been awarding prizes for the best papers published over a two-year period. The paper awarded the Agricultural and Forest Entomology prize for 2002–3 was by Dirk Babendreier et al. (2003) who considered the risk posed by the inundative release of Trichogramma brassicae to nontarget insects in meadows, flower strips and hedgerows. The paper awarded the prize for 2005–6 was by Zhang & Schlyter (2004) who studied the effect of nonhost volatiles on conifer-inhabiting bark beetles. The authors proposed a semiochemical-diversity hypothesis, based on the inhibitory effect of nonhost volatiles on host location by bark beetles. They suggested that this could contribute to the lower frequency of outbreaks of forest insects in mixed forests. In providing support for the more general ‘stability-diversity hypothesis’, this paper has much wider relevance. Agricultural and Forest Entomology will continue to publish a wide on a wide range of entomological topics, including, in this issue, papers on the impact of dead wood on saproxylic insects, bacteria associated with grape phylloxera, methods for studying root-feeding insects, the effect of forest design on sawflies, gypsy moth mating disruption, and the effect of farm diversity on leaf-cutting ants. Agricultural and Forest Entomology was established because of the view that agricultural entomology and forest entomology have much in common. This issue provides good examples of this perspective. The effects of diversity on the pests and other insects found in farms and forests are closely related topics. Root-feeding insects pose problems for both agriculture and forestry and looking back over previous issues we can see, for example, that research reported in this issue on the disruption of gypsy moth mating is related to work on scarabids (Wenninger & Averill, 2006), pine sawflies (Lyytikainen-Saarenmaa et al., 2006), codling moth (Yang et al., 2005) and grape berry moth (Trimble et al., 2003). We look forward to many more years of diversity in agricultural and forest entomology.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 The pecan weevil Curculio caryae (Horn) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) is an indigenous pest of pecan Carya illinoinensis (Wangenh.) K. Koch, in North America. Understanding the movement of this pest from the orchard floor to host trees could lead to pest management practices that exploit weevil behaviour and thus reduce insecticide application to the entire orchard canopy. Furthermore, no information exists on diel periodicity of pecan weevil movement. 2 Movement of adult pecan weevils crawling and flying to the host trunk, flying to the host canopy, crawling within the host canopy and flying between host trees was studied using four types of passive traps over four seasons. Each type of trap was used to capture weevils at different locations on or near the tree and to discriminate flying versus crawling behaviour. 3 More pecan weevils crawl to the trunk than fly and a proportion of the population flies directly from the orchard floor into the pecan canopy. The majority of this movement occurs at dusk. 4 The vertical distribution of weevils was generally uniform throughout the canopy but more weevils were captured in suspended traps nearest tree tops, rather than traps near the ground, when flying between trees and this was significantly so for two of 4 years. 5 The results of the present study are contrary to previous reports suggesting that most adult pecan weevils fly to the pecan trunk after emergence from the soil; however, our results did indicate that a proportion of the population flies directly from the orchard floor into the pecan canopy and thus would circumvent strategies that attempt to control weevils moving up the trunk.",

Resolving this question is especially challenging if populations of the same species in different areas or of closely‐related species in the same area are considered. The present study focused on three closely‐related geometrid moth species, autumnal Epirrita autumnata , winter Operophtera brumata and northern winter moths Operophtera fagata , in southern Finland. There, winter and northern winter moth populations can reach outbreak densities, whereas autumnal moth densities stay relatively low. We tested the hypothesis that a lower vulnerability to pupal predation may explain the observed differences in population dynamics. The results obtained do not support this hypothesis because pupal predation probabilities were not significantly different between the two genera within or without the Operophtera outbreak area or in years with or without a current Operophtera outbreak. Overall, pupal predation was even higher in winter and northern winter moths than in autumnal moths. Differences in larval predation and parasitism, as well as in the reproductive capacities of the species, might be other candidates.",

Mean pathogen load was 13.4 and 22.6 propagules per beetle, on P. setosus and P. carmeli , respectively, and decreased from May to November for both species. The pathogen was also isolated from approximately 55% of both beetle species that emerged from infected branches. Mean propagule load on emerged P. setosus and P. carmeli was 39 and 66.5, respectively. 3 On the basis of these data, beetle species were treated with one of three propagule loads (low, medium, high) and caged onto live branches to determine whether they could transmit the pathogen. At all propagule loads, both species transmitted the pathogen, and transmission percentage and lesion length, a measure of tree susceptibility, were positively correlated with propagule load. 4 To investigate further whether the previous transmission by beetles could affect response of the same trees to subsequent infection with F. circinatum , different branches were inoculated on the same trees used in the transmission study, and lesion lengths were measured. Lesion lengths were lower on trees that had been previously exposed to beetles treated with high or medium propagule loads than on trees that had previously been exposed to beetles treated with low propagule loads. This suggests that the initial infection by beetles carrying high or medium propagule loads induced resistance to subsequent infections of the host, whereas infections caused by beetles with low propagule loads did not.",

Pressure to reduce the use of toxic fumigants has created a need for alternative control techniques. 2 A visual based push–pull strategy that exploits a differential attraction to yellow and ultra violet (UV) lights was tested for its efficacy at controlling Cerambycidae. 3 The relative attraction of four ‘push’ lighting treatments [two yellow (high and low‐pressure Sodium), one white (metal halide) and a control (no light)] to beetles was assessed. Highly attractive UV ‘pull’ traps were compared with a paired control trap, the difference used as a measure of the UV traps attractiveness to residual beetles attracted by ‘push’ lights. 4 Trap catch beneath the two yellow ‘push’ lights was more similar to the control (no light) treatment than the white light for both species. Control ‘push’ lights had the highest average catch of Arhopalus ferus , whereas white light was least attractive. This finding was counter intuitive to expectations, and potential mechanisms are discussed. The white ‘push’ light was most attractive to Prionoplus reticularis. 5 Ultraviolet ‘pull’ traps were highly attractive to residual beetles drawn to yellow ‘push’ light treatments. Relative attraction to the UV ‘pull’ traps beneath control and white ‘push’ lights differed between species. 6 The results obtained suggest that a push–pull strategy combining yellow site lighting with UV kill traps could provide site specific control of wood borers.

In particular, captures of male oak processionary moth (OPM) Thaumetopoea processionea in pheromone traps can be highly variable, hence, two trials were conducted to determine whether the tree species in which traps are positioned or edge effects are influential factors in OPM pheromone trapping. In a ‘host plant trial’, pheromone traps that were positioned in the canopy of pedunculate oak ( Quercus robur ) trees captured significantly more male OPM than traps positioned in any of the other six tree species (including other species of oak) used in the trial over two successive years. In an ‘edge effects trial’, pheromone traps positioned on the edges of oak woodland blocks captured more moths than traps positioned within the oak woodland itself. Although wind direction influenced the numbers of moths that were captured in pheromone traps on woodland edges, with more moths captured in traps positioned on sheltered north‐facing edges, the differences in trap catches between north, south, east and west edges were not significant. The results from the present study indicate that a greater emphasis should be taken to deploy pheromone traps for oak processionary moth in the canopies of pedunculate oak trees with an open, sunnier disposition rather than within the interior of the forest or woodland, thereby maximizing their efficiency.",

In agroecosystems, foraging‐tactic selection may determine whether the predator feeds on pest or nonpest prey. We examined the foraging behaviour of a flexibly‐foraging web‐building spider in response to pest (aphids) and nonpest prey (springtails) aiming to assess the potential role of predator foraging behaviour in biological control. Spiders were allowed to choose between simulated microhabitats with and without a given prey item aiming to determine what tactics spiders would use to forage for the given prey. Spiders preferred microhabitats with aphid prey over paired microhabitats with no prey but showed no preference for springtail prey. Spiders rarely constructed webs in response to aphids but frequently utilized web‐construction tactics in the presence of springtails. These findings demonstrate that predators can regulate their foraging activity to maximize the consumption of specific prey items. In the many cases where pest and nonpest prey differ in ecology, prey‐specific foraging tactics such as these may limit the usefulness of natural enemies in pest suppression: high‐quality, nonpest prey may cause shifts in predator behaviour that reduce consumption of pest prey. Therefore, nonpest prey can have behaviour‐mediated, indirect effects on biological control.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In cotton fields in Texas, spider mites are sporadic pests, whereas thrips are considered as major pests on early stages (before the fourth true leaf stage). Thrips are also important predators of spider mite eggs. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the presence of spider mites on seedling cotton may increase the likelihood of the occurrence of thrips. Based on a greenhouse experiment, it was confirmed that seedling cotton was a suitable host for spider mites. Subsequently, we conducted a 2‐year field experiment in which we studied the likelihood of thrips infestation in cotton plants with/without experimental spider mite infestations. Spider mites established better in 2011 (dry and hot season) than in 2010 (rainy and cooler season), and there was a positive association between spider mites on cotton plants and natural thrips infestation. Thus, we showed that the probability of thrips infestation strongly increased with the presence of spider mites. To confirm the proposed hypothesis on a larger scale, a second field experiment was performed, in which one half of a field was infested with spider mites. Weekly sampling of thrips and spider mites showed a two‐fold increase of thrips immatures on plots previously infested with spider mites. The results obtained in the present study emphasize the importance of incorporating spider mite population dynamics into risk assessments of thrips infestation in seedling cotton fields in Texas and elsewhere.",

This information is crucial for evaluating the potential of mass trapping when aiming to reduce beetle populations. Groups of 10 beetles were released at 14 points spaced 1 m apart along a linear track, at one end of which was a pheromone and wind source. Beetle response to the pheromone and/or wind was recorded 150 s after release and characterized as orienting either towards or away from the pheromone and/or wind source. Data analysis indicated the attraction range of the sex pheromone is &lt;5 m in still air, which is considerably lower than estimates from previous studies and emphasizes the challenge of mass trapping this species in the field. The attraction range increased when there was air flow. Unexpectedly, not all male beetles respond to the pheromone, and beetles are inclined to move downwind even in the presence of pheromone. The latter finding suggests that wind direction may influence beetle dispersal and mate finding in the field. The implications of these results for determining the efficacy of mass trapping as a management approach are discussed.",

Female oviposition preference, in particular, is a key factor for understanding species habitat use, as well as for developing species monitoring and control programmes. We tested the influence of vegetation type (forest, vineyard and hedgerow) and soil cover (broadleaf litter and grass) on the oviposition preference of the species. A 3‐year study was conducted and 18 sites across the outbreak area were sampled with emergence traps. A higher nymph density was recorded in woody vegetation than in vineyards without a density gradient from the inner forest to the edge. Moreover, a significantly lower density was found under grass cover (approximately three individuals per trap) compared with broadleaf litter (approximately 39 individuals per trap). Although B. vicetinus is commonly found in vineyards, where it can cause severe damage, these habitats did not offer to the species suitable oviposition sites. These results provide useful insights with respect to the management of B. vicetinus outbreaks.",

At the local scale, we (i) characterized the temporal development of CWSB and explored associations with environmental and shade‐related indicators. During two growing seasons and on 84 coffee plots, we recorded CWSB incidence/infestation and microclimate on an altitudinal gradient and different shading systems. The bimodal rainfall, altitude and shade affected CWSB development through their effect on minimum temperature. At the landscape level, we (ii) analyzed the spatial pattern of CWSB. Data on CWSB were collected on 180 plots. Pest incidence showed a spatial arrangement varying by districts. A possible relationship with human movement and the landscape context contributing to pest spread is suggested.

    "abstract": "Abstract Diversifying agroecosystems by establishing or retaining natural vegetation in and around crop areas has long been recognized as a potentially effective means of bolstering pest control as a result of attracting more numerous and diverse natural enemies, although outcomes are inconsistent across species. Little is known about the underlying mechanisms driving such differences in species responses, creating challenges for determining how best to manage landscapes for maximizing environmental services such as biological control. The present study addresses gaps in our understanding of the link between noncrop vegetation in field margins and pest suppression by using a system of partial differential equations to model population‐level predator–prey interactions, as well as spatial processes, aiming to capture the dynamics of crop plants, herbivores and two generalist predators. We focus on differences in how two predators (a carabid and a ladybird beetle) colonize crop fields where they forage for prey, examining differences in how they move into the fields from adjacent vegetation as a potential driver of differences in overall pest suppression. The results obtained demonstrate that predator colonization behaviour and spatial scale are important factors with respect to determining the effectiveness of biological control.",

Using mango fruits of distinct levels of ripeness, we investigated both competition among larvae and among adult females for oviposition. We quantified competition by the numbers of eggs laid and the intensity of agonistic interactions between adult females. Interactions between immature fruit flies led to reduced size and number of emerged adults of both species. These impacts were felt more acutely in the native species. Interspecific competition between females led to fewer eggs laid on semi‐ripe fruit by both species, which may be the result of niche overlap associated with oviposition. Intraspecific interactions between A. obliqua individuals led to intense agonistic behaviour, with a concurrent decrease in number of landings on these host fruits. These results suggest that the native species undergoes a partial niche displacement when facing the invasive species. A portion of the fundamental niche of A. obliqua remained unoccupied by the invading C. capitata , which may allow their coexistence under natural conditions.",

In this study, we exposed sentinel egg masses and collected naturally laid egg masses in southern France in 2016 and 2017, to identify the egg parasitoids of L. occidentalis and investigate their potentials. Three egg parasitoids were detected: Anastatus bifasciatus , Ooencyrtus pityocampae and Ooencyrtus telenomicida . The overall parasitism was low compared to that observed in the native range with 6.4% of all eggs being parasitized, while 17.1% of egg masses carried at least one parasitized egg. The total number of parasitized egg masses was similar between parasitoid species, but the mean number of parasitized eggs per egg mass was highest for A. bifasciatus (5.57 vs. 1.25 for Ooencyrtus spp.). Sentinel egg masses underestimated the parasitism compared to natural egg masses (respectively, 1.42% and 7.71%). Our results suggested that the three generalist parasitoids detected can respond in a Leptoglossus egg density‐dependent manner, but this requires further investigations.",

The invasion and subsequent spread of emerald ash borer Agrilus planipennis F airmaire ( C oleoptera: B uprestidae) threatens the ash resource in N orth A merica and the basketry tradition. Submersion of infested ash logs has been proposed as a potential tactic to control A. planipennis emergence, although the duration of submergence required to prevent adult beetle emergence is unknown. We assessed the survivorship of A. planipennis prepupae through adult beetle emergence in green ash ( F. pennsylvanica M arshall) bolts submerged at weekly intervals for up to 6 weeks and in black ash bolts submerged at 4‐week intervals for up to 24 weeks. The moisture content of sapwood at depths where prepupal chambers are commonly found was quantified in the black ash bolts after 0, 12 and 24 weeks of submergence. Mortality of A. planipennis from prepupa to adult was low (5.7 ± 2.3%) for the first 6 weeks of submersion but rapidly increased to 100% in green ash and black ash bolts submerged for 8 weeks or longer. In black ash, the outer 1.3 cm of wood became highly saturated after submersion for 12 weeks (81.0 ± 4.5%) and moisture increased only slightly after 24 weeks (83.9 ± 2.8%). The results obtained in the present study indicate that A. planipennis prepupae in green ash and black ash bolts can survive complete submersion for extended periods of time (i.e. at least 6 weeks) and successfully emerge as adults afterwards. Logs submerged for at least 8 weeks, however, produced no live A. planipennis beetles, indicating that submersion represents an efficacious control option.",

Previous research has shown that the taxonomic richness of invertebrates in organic kiwifruit orchards is significantly higher than in integrated pest management (IPM) orchards, suggesting that orchard management practices may affect invertebrate biodiversity. We used multiple regression models to investigate the relationships between the diversity of ground-active invertebrates in three functional groups [natural enemies, herbivores, detritivores (including fungivores)] and 14 management practices used on 10 organic and 10 IPM orchards. The significant relationships between the management variables and invertebrate communities differed for each functional group: (i) the greater diversity of natural enemy and detritivore taxa in organic orchards was significantly correlated with less toxic agrichemical sprays; (ii) greater amounts of vegetative ground cover in the organic orchards was significantly correlated with a greater diversity of detritivore and herbivore taxa; and (iii) differences in magnesium application rates explained some of the variation in the herbivore and detritivore communities. Management practices on IPM kiwifruit orchards could be altered to increase invertebrate biodiversity, which also may improve ecosystem services on these orchards; however, care should be taken to ensure that pest populations do not also benefit from these changes.",

The model was validated against field observations of L. rugulipennis population dynamics monitored under both open‐field and protected conditions on weeds and strawberry plants. Predicted L. rugulipennis population patterns from the model agreed well with the observed data. The L. rugulipennis model can be used in practice to enable growers to identify the timing of the first generation of L. rugulipennis adult dispersal into strawberry, or other crops, from weeds. The model will also assist growers with the timing of the deployment of pheromone traps and interpreting the importance of trap catches. This will allow growers to better time and target applications of insecticides against damaging life stages of the pest.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Red wood ants ( Formica rufa group) are the dominant ant species in European forests that can affect the abundance of other arthropods (e.g. herbivorous insects in tree canopies or beetles on the forest floor). Notably, ants can prevent pine weevils ( Hylobius abietis ) from feeding on conifer seedlings supplied with food sources for ants. This is a potentially important observation because the weevil is a serious pest in forest regeneration areas. We hypothesized that frequent encounters between red wood ants and pine weevils on the ground may decrease the weevils' feeding on conifer seedlings. To test this hypothesis, we compared feeding damage caused by pine weevils on spruce seedlings in areas with high and low abundance of red wood ants. Despite a four‐fold difference in the numbers of ants in pitfall trap samples, there were no significant differences between areas with high and low ant abundance in terms of feeding‐scar areas, proportions of attacked seedlings or proportions of killed seedlings. Thus, in contrast to previously documented deterrent effects on ground‐dwelling beetles, high abundance of ants on the ground did not influence the feeding activity of pine weevils on the spruce seedlings. We conclude that the mechanisms underlying seedling protection by ants are probably mainly related to the ants' protection of food sources, whereas the frequency of encounters elsewhere has less effect on the weevils' feeding.",

The poorer survival of the two genotypes with extremely elevated carboxylesteraseresistance was not due to a reluctance to transfer to new diet at each diet change.3. Although available for only two replicates, a revertant clone of 794J (794Jrev), which has the same genotype as 794J but the amplified E4 genes are not expressed leading to a fully susceptible phenotype, did not appear to survive any better than this clone.This suggests that the poor survival on artificial diet of the extreme-carboxylesterase genotypes is not due to the cost of over-producing the enzyme.4. That the frequency of insecticide-resistant genotypes is low in the population until insecticide is applied indicates they have reduced fitness, but not necessarily that this reflects a direct cost of expressing the resistance mechanism.",

These seeds result in trees with higher growth rates and better wood quality than trees originating from seeds collected in local forest stands. Insecticides are used to reduce damage to seeds in seed orchards. Hypothetically, this may be ineffective because the suppression of one insect species may relieve interspecific competition and trigger corresponding increases in damage caused by another species. Therefore, we investigated the effects of three insect species [Dioryctria abietella Denis and Schiffermüller (Pyralidae), Cydia strobilella L. (Tortricidae) and Strobilomyia anthracina Czerny (Anthomyiidae)], singly and in all possible permutations, on the numbers and quality of seeds in Picea abies cones. Species were manipulated by insecticide treatments. The cones were examined for externally visible damage caused by D. abietella and S. anthracina after which the seeds were extracted, counted and X-rayed to assess seed quality and the number of seeds infested by insects. Finally, the cones were dissected to identify and count C. strobilella larvae. There was no evidence of trade-offs between absence of one species and increased damage by the remaining species. Instead, damage tended to increase as the number of species in a cone increased. The most serious pest species in the present study was D. abietella, reducing the number of filled seeds by approximately 60%. Our results indicate that there is little risk that suppression measures directed towards one particular species will lead to increased damage by other species. The insecticide, α-cypermethrin, showed promising results against D. abietella and S. anthracina.",

The predatory guild of spiders Tachyporus spp. carabids was reduced by frequent harrowing. Spiders and Tachyporus spp. were the most sensitive, with up to 38% higher density in plots harrowed only twice compared with four times. Furthermore, a marginally significant decrease in arthropod diversity was found after four harrowings. The negative effect of frequent harrowing on arthropods was probably caused by a combination of direct lethal effects and habitat disruption. Additional harrowings reduced weeds with weed seed biomass, on average, being 77% higher and species diversity being 48% higher in plots harrowed only twice compared with four times. There was a positive relationship between weed biomass and predatory arthropod guild density, supporting the hypothesis that weeds promote generalist arthropod predators. Weed harrowing should be carried out early and limited to a minimum to protect flora and fauna.

The native congener, Sirex nigricornis F., is common across the eastern U.S.A. and has been studied as a proxy for S. noctilio . Predicting the emergence of S. noctilio is important for guiding monitoring efforts. Degree‐day models have been developed to predict flight phenology of S. noctilio and S. nigricornis across eastern North America. These model parameters were tested against three years of S. nigricornis collections from two locations in Arkansas. Neither of the proposed models accurately predicted emergence. The emergence of females for both S. noctilio and S. nigricornis was significantly negatively correlated with minimum and maximum temperature, indicating that emergence increases when minimum and maximum temperatures decrease. These results suggest that, as S. noctilio spreads south, where higher mean temperatures are present, it will emerge later in the season as the temperatures decline compared with the current northeastern population. We propose that monitoring for the spread of S. noctilio in the southeastern U.S.A. should begin slightly before daily temperatures are expected to decline (i.e. mid‐September).",

The objective of this study was to assess the contribution of emerging natural enemies in spring to biological control, and their response to the interaction between landscape heterogeneity and farming intensity. We monitored the overwintering insect community using emergence traps and measured the local potential pest predation using prey cards in 30 cereal fields, in spring in France. Study fields were selected along a landscape heterogeneity gradient and farming practices were recorded. None of the 10 emerging taxa influenced predation of lepidopteran eggs or weed seeds. On the ground, aphid predation was positively correlated with emerging carabid beetles. On foliage, aphid predation was negatively correlated with emerging parasitoids. Overall, the community of natural enemies that overwinters within crop fields seemed to benefit from landscape‐scale lower crop diversity and higher edge density in combination with higher local‐scale farming intensities. This suggests that they represent a subset of species adapted to intensified farming systems. This study highlights a broad taxonomic range of emerging natural enemies and their potential contribution to local pest predation.",

We hypothesized that pheromone components might be conserved between New and Old World species, and so tested blends of known pheromones in California and Washington states. Males of the endemic species Idolus californicus and Idolus columbianus (subfamily Elaterinae) were attracted to blends of neryl esters, many of which are known pheromones of related European species. Electroantennogram assays determined that antennae of male beetles responded strongly to two neryl esters, and in field bioassays, males of both species were specifically attracted to neryl hexanoate. Female I . californicus were found to produce both neryl hexanoate and neryl octanoate, and lures that contained neryl hexanoate alone or in blends attracted male beetles. Neryl octanoate was not attractive, and neither synergized nor antagonized attraction to neryl hexanoate. Males of Dalopius spp. also were captured in traps baited with lures containing neryl octanoate. Our results support the hypothesis that the neryl ester pheromone motif is conserved among taxonomically related European and North American elaterids in the tribe Elaterinae, which should aid in the identification of pheromones of pest species within the tribe.",

The exact impact of this farmland consolidation on composition and functional traits of wild bee communities remains poorly understood. We studied these communities and functional traits in oilseed rape fields embedded in 18 agricultural landscapes located in Jiangxi Province, China, with 11 sites representing traditional (pre‐consolidation) and the remaining 7 sites consolidated agricultural landscapes. The composition of wild bee assemblages was not differentiated into consolidated and traditional farmland communities. The mean body size of wild bee species similarly did not shows significant differences between consolidated and traditional farmland. The mean intraspecific body size for a dominant species, Lasioglossum proximatum , was larger in consolidated than traditional farmland, while individuals of co‐dominant Eucera floralia showed no such differentiation. In consolidated farmland, the proportion of semi‐natural habitat was positively linked to the abundance‐based average interspecific body size of wild bee species. For abundance‐based calculations, the proportion of aboveground nesting bee species was lower in consolidated landscapes than in traditional ones. Our study suggests that farmland consolidation might affect intraspecific composition, particularly in abundant small‐bodied species. Above‐ground nesting bees may require specific management interventions in consolidated agricultural landscapes to promote their persistence, which could take the form of semi‐natural habitat patches introduced to fields that can also benefit the pollinator community more widely.",

More bees were captured in canopy gaps early‐season, but differences due to canopy openness declined by late‐season. Bee diversity was higher in open‐canopy sites and bee assemblage composition varied across canopy openness. Low cover was positively associated with large‐bodied bees and negatively associated with solitary, polylectic ground‐nesting bees. Parasitic bee taxa were more abundant when the canopy was composed of pinyon pine; ponderosa pine‐dominant canopies were associated with large‐bodied bees with variable nesting habits.

After that, changes in crop systems may have affected aphid‐parasitoid communities. The objective of this work was to evaluate the current assemblage of cereal aphid parasitoids, describing their oscillations, parasitism level, and trophic relationships in food webs in a cereal succession system (wheat‐corn‐oat) currently adopted in this region. Over a year, the associated parasitoid/hyperparasitoid species were inventoried by field‐exposed Rhopalosiphum padi , Schizaphis graminum , M. dirhodum , and Sitobion avenae (recruitment method) and by Moericke traps. Six species of primary parasitoids were sampled in both aphids and traps with the same abundance sequence: A. platensis , A. rhopalosiphi , L. testaceipes , D. rapae , A. uzbekistanicus , and A. ervi . Parasitism and complexity of food webs were higher during the wheat season (winter–spring), decreasing in corn (summer) and increasing again in oat (autumn). In the current assemblage of cereal aphid parasitoids in the subtropical region of South America, three species of parasitoids that were already present before the biological control program and three that were introduced oscillate in abundance throughout the year, resulting in an alternation of the complexity of the food webs and in the levels of parasitism in the crop seasons. A. platensis and A. rhopalosiphi are the most abundant species and A. rhopalosiphi remains fundamental in the control of M. dirhodum and S. avenae .",

The main approach for protecting forests against this defoliator is aerial spraying of insecticides. Despite the crucial role of aerial insecticide applications in the global forest protection strategy, little is known about its real effects on tree mortality or the stand characteristics that may affect its long‐term efficacy. We evaluated the efficacy of the protection program that was implemented during the 1967–1992 outbreak in Quebec (Canada) in tree mortality reduction. We established 422 plots in eastern Quebec based upon the following parameters: insecticide application; stand composition; drainage quality; and stand age. Unprotected plots exhibited 18 to 44% greater tree mortality than protected plots. Insecticide efficacy was affected by drainage condition. Protected plots that established on sites with poor quality drainage exhibited 67.53% lower balsam fir ( Abies balsamea ) mortality than did unprotected plots. Stand age did not affect tree mortality. Insecticide application had no substantial effect on spruce mortality. Our study also found that the return on protection investment in terms of mortality reduction may decline after 7 years of aerial spraying, and that it is not necessary to achieve the target protection goal (50% foliage protection) every year to reduce host tree mortality. Our results may be useful for decision‐makers to decide where and when to apply insecticides during a spruce budworm outbreak and may help to determine the appropriateness of treating the forest on an annual basis depending upon the protection goals.",

In the open woodland we observed a higher number of species in all trophic categories, except for mycophagous specialists. Several microhabitat variables reflected the different stage of recovery of the two woodlands. Our findings suggest the crucial role of diversified environments in protected areas: even a small difference in the degree of recovery (i.e., tree closeness) can affect the number of beetle species.

Viticulture is one of the fastest‐growing sectors of English agriculture, although there is currently limited research on habitat management practices. In a vineyard in East Sussex, England, we tested five inter‐row ground cover treatments on their potential in supporting beneficial insects: two commercially available seed mixes (meadow mix and pollen and nectar mix), a wild bee seed mix (formulated based on pollinator foraging preferences), natural regeneration, and regularly mowed grass. Over two years, from May to August, we conducted monthly floral surveys and insect surveys using transect walks and pan traps. The abundance and richness of flowers in the natural regeneration treatment were twice that of the regularly mown inter‐row treatment. By year 2, the abundance of “total insects” sampled was significantly higher in the wild bee mix compared to mown. Likewise, there was a significant effect of treatment type on pollinator richness, with a higher mean richness found in wild bee mix. Solitary wasp family richness was highest in the natural regeneration treatment and lowest in the mown treatment. Given the rapid growth and lack of specific environmental recommendations for British viticulture, we demonstrate a simple and effective approach for supporting beneficial insects and ecosystem services. Promotion of perennial wildflowers through sowing or allowing natural regeneration in inter‐row ground cover in vineyards has the potential to boost biodiversity in vineyards on a large scale if widely adopted.",

This study describes the Syrphidae community in Portuguese vineyards and the response of the most abundant species, Sphaerophoria scripta Linnaeus, 1758, and Melanostoma mellinum Linnaeus, 1758, to the landscape composition and configuration within a gradient of distances (500, 1000, and 2000 m) from the sampled vineyards. The presence of seminatural habitats and other crops in the surrounding landscape increased both species at the largest distance, whereas the presence of artificial territory, olive orchards, and vineyards reduce M. mellinum at some of the buffers. Increasing seminatural habitats in the vineyards surrounding landscape (2000 m) and, potentially, introducing nature‐friendly practices in the principal crops around vineyards may favour syrphid abundance.",

We evaluated three pine‐associates (the scolytine six‐spined ips, Ips calligraphus , a foliage feeding pine sawfly, Neodiprion lecontei , and the detritivorous eastern subterranean termite, Reticulitermes flavipes ), for transcriptome sequence overlap with the SPB dsRNA and performed bioassays to evaluate lethal and sublethal effects after dsRNA ingestion. Genetic analyses revealed little overlap between dsRNA sequences and target gene orthologs, with only two matches found in I. calligraphus , the most closely related phylogenetically. No lethal or sublethal effects were observed in any of the nontarget organisms evaluated, and changes in gene expression occurred only in I. calligraphus , but with no discernible effects on adult survival. Our findings build on previous nontarget evaluations for SPB‐specific dsRNA in model insects and demonstrate that the use of RNAi as a component of an IPM strategy would not directly compromise commonly occurring non‐congeneric pine associates.",

Field margins represent a stable habitat for arthropods, but community structure depends on many factors, including management type and vegetation features. We studied the effects of agroecological transitions and vegetation features on arthropods of horticultural field margins, focusing on three feeding guilds (herbivores, predators and parasitoids). We sampled arthropods using the beat‐sheet method in five conventional fields and five under agroecological transition. We also measured vegetation height, richness, flower abundance and plant cover. Our results showed that arthropod diversity was higher in agroecological fields whereas herbivore abundance was lower, with a consistent pattern across most taxonomic orders. Vegetation features displayed multiple effects among functional and taxonomic groups. Herbivores did not respond to most vegetation variables whereas predators correlated with several, with similar trends among orders. We conclude that agroecological transitions and field margins with high vegetation richness and floral resources influence arthropod communities with potential benefits regarding pest regulation. These practices might be more effective if considered alongside other methods that enhance biodiversity and if they are consistent at a landscape scale.",

While drought alone can cause tree death, direct warming effects on WPB are a contributing factor. Research on WPB generation timing (voltinism), however, is lacking. We monitored WPB tree attacks and adult emergence timing at two California sites and developed a degree‐day model from field‐observed data. Historical, contemporary, and future temperatures for several California sites were used with the model to examine trends in WPB voltinism. Field data showed a single summer and an overwinter generation at a northern California site. As summer temperatures increased beyond 1900–1980 averages, the predicted number of full and partial WPB generations by 2021 had increased from ~2 annual (one summer and one overwinter) generations historically to ~2.3 at two northern California sites and from ~2.3 to ~3.2 at two warmer California sites. Historical and contemporary data suggest winter warming was not sufficient for an additional generation overwinter. Instead, increases in generations were driven by summer and fall temperatures. Unconstrained increases in the number of future annual generations will be limited by complex, but not well understood, WPB thermal adaptations. Increased knowledge of temperature‐driven WPB population growth will improve forest vegetation models aimed at predicting ponderosa pine mortality in a changing climate.",

We conducted trapping experiments to determine the efficacy of semiochemicals to attract and repel Xyleborini ambrosia beetles within two ʻōhiʻa ( Metrosideros polymorpha ) forests on the Island of Hawaiʻi. We compared the attraction of beetles to 100% ethanol and a 1:1 mixture of ethanol: methanol at Waiākea Forest Reserve and ʻŌlaʻa Forest in Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park. In addition, we tested the extent to which verbenone and verbenone + methyl salicylate repellents (SPLAT® Verb and SPLAT® Beetle Guard, respectively) deterred beetles from baited traps at Waiākea Forest Reserve in two separate experiments.

Parasitism rates of egg masses of all species averaged 50–70% but were significantly lower for the more important pest species, including the green vegetable bug, than for some of the agriculturally less important species. 3 Trissolcus basalis emerged from nearly all species collected and was the major parasitoid to emerge from most species. A number of native species were parasitized heavily by T. basalis and parasitism of such species may enhance biological control of the green vegetable bug, but may also pose environmental concerns. Parasitism of predatory bugs by T. basalis may have a negative impact on the biological control of other pests, especially lepidopterous pests. 4 Although the impact of T. basalis on native and predatory host species was not directly quantified, these host species remain abundant and therefore do not appear to be affected adversely by such high rates of parasitism.",

Although the principle environmental cues for diapause induction are often temperature and photoperiod, we demonstrated recently that the quality of host plant consumed by the larvae of Choristoneura rosaceana (Harris) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) influences the proportion of larvae that enter diapause and therefore voltinism. 2 Previous work has also suggested that non‐Mendelian parental effects influence diapause by C. rosaceana larvae, but the mechanism was not established. Here, we report further evidence for parental effects on diapause and examine whether parental diet influences diapause induction. 3 We collected larvae of C. rosaceana from six sites at three latitudes in the Province of Québec. There was an increase in the proportion of larvae entering diapause with increasing latitude. Rearing larvae under identical conditions on artificial diet for two generations significantly reduced variation in diapause among populations within a given latitude, and supported the existence of parental effects that influence offspring diapause. 4 Experiments with different host plants and high‐ vs. low‐quality artificial diets provided no evidence that the parental effects on offspring diapause were based on the quality of food consumed by parents. Diapause in C. rosaceana appears influenced by a hierarchy of cues, including temperature, photoperiod, current larval diet and parental environment.",

Consumption of slug eggs and aphids was also investigated. 3 All five prey types were consumed to varying degrees during the experiments. Both beetle species showed a significant preference for Calliphora larvae over slugs. Pterostichus madidus showed a significant preference for earthworms over slugs. No preference was shown between earthworms or Calliphora larvae by P. madidus females or N. brevicollis . However, P. madidus males showed a significant preference for Calliphora larvae over worms. Pterostichus madidus showed no preference between slug eggs and aphids; N. brevicollis showed a significant preference for aphids over slug eggs. 4 The results from this study indicate that generalist beetles will often attack other prey in preferences to adult slugs. Slugs may not be preferred because of their mucus. Other prey items occur frequently in arable soils and generalist carabids may ignore slugs altogether and may only feed on them when slug density is high or other prey are unavailable.",

Observational field studies determined Johnson distributions to model the spatial pattern of cadavers and prepupae in the field. The model also implicitly incorporates within‐field larval spatial pattern into estimates of field‐level horizontal transmission. 4 Potential for horizontal transmission is higher in simulations using weather data from the warmer year of 1995, than in simulations of the cooler growing season of 1993. 5 Simulations of CPB populations under northern Maine climatic conditions recorded in 1993 and 1995 suggest that horizontal transmission can range from 3 to 24% depending upon the timing of primary infection of larvae in the field. 6 Two simulated sequential applications of B. bassiana targeted at peak first instars resulted in maximum horizontal infection in both years. 7 Sensitivity analysis suggests that horizontal transmission is most sensitive to changes in the proportion of cadavers that sporulate and least sensitive to changes in the time between larval death and the onset of cadaver sporulation. 8 Field validation of the model indicates good prediction of one measure of horizontal infection, the proportion of prepupae which eventually sporulated after being released in controlled field experiments.",

    "abstract": "The rarefied atmosphere of US politics has been heating up recently. During March, President George W. Bush contributed significantly to the accumulation of hot air over Washington and elsewhere by announcing two major policy shifts related to the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere. First, President Bush reneged on a campaign pledge to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from U.S. power plants. Soon afterwards, his administration explicitly opposed the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement setting country-by-country limits on emissions of greenhouse gases. These two policy positions ensure that little will change in the near future to reduce the amounts of CO2 entering the atmosphere from US sources. In short, it is a great time to be in the CO2 business. Entomologists have recognized for some time that elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2 may influence the distribution, abundance and performance of insects that feed on plants (Lincoln et al., 1984, 1986; Fajer et al., 1989). Major questions remain, however, on the relative importance of changes in weather, changes in plant quality and changes in predation pressure on the dynamics of insect herbivore populations under conditions of elevated CO2. If you grow crops or trees for a living, these questions boil down to one simple concern; will yields increase or decrease as CO2 levels continue to rise? The problem is that we do not really know yet, and it is going to cost significant sums of money to find out. There are too many interacting variables to make simple predictions about changes in pest damage to forestry and agricultural commodities. CO2–mediated changes in temperature or precipitation may affect insects directly and may influence the geographical ranges of agricultural and natural plant communities (Cannon, 1998). The predators, parasites and pathogens that maintain some level of control over insect populations may also be affected by global climate change or changes in plant phenotype (Stiling et al., 1999). Changes in the nutritional and defensive characteristics of host plants may drive changes in levels of insect damage to plants (Bezemer & Jones, 1998) and all of these ecological effects may interact with other sources of environmental variation including drought, nutrient availability and light (Arnone et al., 1995; Roth et al., 1997; Haettenschwiler & Schafellner, 1999; McDonald et al., 1999). In the longer term, elevated CO2 may influence the fundamental ecosystem properties upon which all plant productivity depends (Ball & Drake, 1997; Jones et al., 1998; Kampichler et al., 1998; Kandeler et al., 1998; Hungate et al., 1999; Strand et al., 1999). While presidents and policy makers play Russian roulette with the climate, ecologists and entomologists are exploring with ever-increasing accuracy and complexity the potential ramifications of elevated CO2 for plant–herbivore interactions. Without long-term studies of the crucial variables, we will simply be unprepared for the enriched CO2 atmosphere that is developing (Coviella & Trumble, 1999). Atmospheric CO2 concentrations have already risen by about 25% since the industrial revolution and are expected to increase from current ambient levels of 350–360 p.p.m. (or µL/L) to around 600 p.p.m. by the end of the century (Houghton et al., 1995). All of the potential consequences of elevated CO2 concentrations are too great to cover in detail here. In this paper, I focus upon what we know about changes in plant quality under elevated CO2 and how changing food quality might interact with other ecological variables to alter the performance and abundance of insects on plants. As the principle source of carbon for photosynthesis, it should be no surprise that changes in concentrations of CO2 have marked effects upon the phenotype of plants (Lincoln, 1993; Ceulemans & Mousseau, 1994; Curtis & Wang, 1998). For example, elevated CO2 generally results in increased rates of photosynthesis (Drake et al., 1997; Norby et al., 1999), increased rates of growth (Saxe et al., 1998) and increased biomass (Leadley et al., 1999; Owensby et al., 1999). Assuming no concurrent changes in nutrient availability, the accumulation of biomass under elevated CO2 dilutes concentrations of nitrogen in tissues by 15–25% (Lincoln et al., 1993; Lindroth et al., 1995), thereby increasing C : N ratios (Ceulemans & Mousseau, 1994; Wilsey, 1996; Hughes & Bazzaz, 1997) and the allocation of carbon to some carbon-rich secondary metabolites (Lindroth et al., 1995; Agrell et al., 2000). Elevated concentrations of CO2 may sometimes (Agrell et al., 2000) but not always (Thompson & Drake, 1994; Bezemer & Jones, 1998) decrease the water content of foliage and increase rates of leaf abscission and plant senescence (Paez et al., 1983; Houpis et al., 1988; Baxter et al., 1994; Sicher & Bunce, 1997). Of course, not all plant species respond identically to elevated concentrations of CO2 (Lindroth et al., 1993). For example, elevated CO2 results in reduced foliar nitrogen levels and increased condensed tannin levels in paper birch but not in white pine (Roth & Lindroth, 1994). In further studies with paper birch, quaking aspen and sugar maple (Roth et al., 1998; Agrell et al., 2000), all species show increases in foliar concentrations of condensed tannins under elevated CO2. However, the foliage of quaking aspen also expresses higher concentrations of phenolic glycosides, and sugar maple is the only species to show elevated foliar concentrations of hydrolysable tannins. In a study contrasting a C3 sedge with a C4 grass in marsh habitat, Thompson & Drake (1994) reported CO2-mediated declines in foliar nitrogen only in the sedge. The grass, in contrast, exhibited increases in foliar water concentrations and concomitant increases in fungal infection. Despite the predictions of the carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis (Chapin, 1980; Bryant et al., 1983) that all carbon-rich secondary metabolites should increase under elevated CO2, this appears not to be the case. For example, foliar concentrations of the iridoid glycosides in Plantago lanceolata are unaffected under CO2 enrichment (Fajer et al., 1989, 1991). Likewise, the volatile terpenoids of peppermint (Lincoln & Couvet, 1989), big sagebrush (Johnson & Lincoln, 1990) and loblolly pine (Williams et al., 1997a) do not vary with experimental increases in CO2. Because nitrogen concentrations in foliage are diluted by the increased C : N ratio of plant tissues under elevated CO2, there is the potential for reduced efficacy of nitrogen-based plant defences. In an interesting twist to this hypothesis, Coviella et al. (2000) reported that transgenic cotton grown under elevated CO2 expressed reduced concentrations of Bt protein. In bioassays with Spodoptera, larval performance increased under elevated CO2 because increased larval consumption in response to low nitrogen levels did not compensate for reductions in Bt protein. Before you dash out and sell your biotech stocks, it is obviously far too early to say that the use of Bt transgenes will be compromised under elevated CO2, but it certainly merits further study. The Bt-lovers amongst us may be gratified to learn that the efficacy of conventional topical applications of Bt may be enhanced under elevated CO2. Experiments suggest that increased consumption by insects to compensate for high C : N ratios results in greater exposure to Bt and higher levels of mortality (Coviella & Trumble, 2000). We are dealing with complex organisms and there will be no perfect generalities for the way that plant phenotype changes under elevated CO2. Nonetheless, in nearly every case examined to date, foliar nitrogen concentrations decline under elevated CO2 and, when present, foliar concentrations of condensed tannins increase (Fajer et al., 1989, 1991; Johnson & Lincoln, 1991; Lincoln et al., 1993; Lindroth et al., 1995). This level of generality is somewhat heartening and allows us to predict that overall decreases in foliar quality should induce at least some insect herbivores to eat more. And that prediction usually holds true. Lower levels of nitrogen and higher C : N ratios in plants under elevated CO2 have generally been associated with compensatory feeding and subsequent increases in levels of damage or defoliation (Lincoln et al., 1984, 1986; Fajer et al., 1989; Lincoln et al., 1993; Lindroth et al., 1993, 1995; Salt et al., 1995; Docherty et al., 1996; Kinney et al., 1997; Williams et al., 1997a). Leaf-chewing insects such as grasshoppers (Johnson & Lincoln, 1990, 1991) and caterpillar larvae (Lindroth et al., 1993, 1995) generally consume more leaf area when they are fed plants that have been grown under elevated CO2. Likewise, the area damaged by leaf-mining insects may also increase (Salt et al., 1995). For example, the area of leaf mines on Quercus myrtifolia increased by over 25% under elevated CO2, apparently because nitrogen concentrations fell by over 11% (Stiling et al., unpublished data). However, this is where the first complicating factor arises: simply because per capita consumption of foliage by insects increases under elevated CO2, it does not mean that plants suffer more damage overall. Two additional effects that mediate the ultimate level of damage that plants receive are CO2-induced increases in plant biomass and changes in insect density. It is well established that many plants accumulate more biomass under elevated CO2 (Leadley et al., 1999; Owensby et al., 1999) and that such direct effects of CO2 on plant growth can more than compensate for increases in defoliation (Caulfield & Bunce, 1994). For example, even though per capita rates of consumption by insects on Q. myrtifolia increase with CO2 enrichment, the proportion of leaves damaged by mining and chewing insects actually declines (Stiling et al., unpublished data). The leaf area index on Q. myrtifolia increases by 26% under elevated CO2 but this ignores the impact of reductions in damaged leaf area. Calculations suggest that undamaged leaf area actually increases by 38% when effects on insects are considered. Similarly, leaf area increases of 1.6-fold on milkweed under elevated CO2 jump to 3.6-fold increases in undamaged leaf area when the effects on herbivorous thrips are accounted for (Hughes & Bazzaz, 1997). Ultimately, the effects of increases in atmospheric CO2 on damage by insect pests will depend upon changes in insect performance at the individual and population levels. The ability of insects to compensate for CO2-mediated reductions in foliage quality is key to understanding long-term effects on herbivore population dynamics and the injury that will be inflicted upon hosts of economic importance. If eating more allows insects to compensate fully, then defoliation levels will rise while insect fitness remains constant. The question then becomes whether CO2-mediated increases in plant productivity are sufficient to offset increases in defoliation levels and which effect is more important to the part of the crop that is harvested for human use. Some insects can certainly compensate well when foliage quality declines. For example, red-headed pine sawfly larvae increase nitrogen utilization efficiency in response to CO2-mediated declines in foliar nitrogen in loblolly pine (Williams et al., 1994). The result is that their rates of nitrogen accumulation remain unchanged. Potential mechanisms by which insect herbivores may compensate for CO2-mediated changes in plant quality are diverse. For example, the activity of detoxification enzymes may be stimulated by increased concentrations of secondary metabolites in foliage (Lindroth et al., 1993). The good news, if you grow plants for a living, is that most insects appear to be unable to compensate fully for CO2-mediated reductions in plant quality. For example, buckeye butterflies on Plantago lanceolata exhibit both higher rates of mortality and increased development time when fed on plants grown under elevated CO2 (Fager et al., 1989; Fajer et al., 1991). Higher rates of insect mortality have been associated with nutritional deficiency that results from reduced foliar nitrogen concentrations under elevated CO2 (Brooks & Whittaker, 1999; Stiling et al., 1999). However, direct effects of changes in plant quality on insect performance are not always dramatic. For example, Lindroth et al. (1995) explored the performance of three species of saturniid moths feeding on paper birch under elevated CO2. Birch leaves were lower in nitrogen (23%), higher in condensed tannin (two-fold increase) and foliar C : N ratios increased from 12.7 to 28.1. Despite these significant reductions in foliage quality, survival of first-instar larvae declined only marginally, while fourth-instar larvae exhibited moderate increases in rates of consumption and decreases in rates of growth, development and food processing efficiency. Brooks & Whittaker (1998, 1999) have studied multiple generations of insects reared on plants under elevated CO2. In their first experiment (Brooks & Whittaker, 1998), Gastrophysa leaf beetles grown on Rumex plants for three consecutive generations exhibited relatively minor effects of elevated CO2 on performance, despite measurable declines in indices of foliage quality. Fecundity and egg size were reduced by the end of the second generation, which led to fewer, smaller larvae in the third generation. In the second study (Brooks & Whittaker, 1999), they reported reductions in the survival of nymphal spittlebugs in two sequential generations under elevated CO2. There were also declines in the rate of development in consecutive years. Such multigenerational studies are crucial if we are to develop any kind of realistic predictions of long-term population dynamics (Williams et al., 1997a). Perhaps more dramatic effects upon insect performance will be mediated by the third trophic level. Given that rates of insect growth also seem to decline under elevated CO2 (Fajer et al., 1989; Lindroth et al., 1995; Smith & Jones, 1998), we might expect that the risk of mortality from natural enemies will increase. However, two laboratory studies have failed to provide evidence for greater mortality imposed by natural enemies under elevated CO2 (Roth & Lindroth, 1995; Bezemer et al., 1998). For example, effects of parasitism by Cotesia melanoscela on the performance of gypsy moth larvae do not differ between ambient and elevated CO2 treatments (Roth & Lindroth, 1995). Nonetheless, field studies using open-top chamber technology have demonstrated that rates of leaf-miner parasitism increase under elevated CO2 (Stiling et al., 1999; Stiling et al., unpublished). Nitrogen concentrations in the foliage of two dominant oak species, Quercus myrtifolia and Q. geminata, decline under elevated CO2 and densities of leaf-mining insects are lower because of the combined effects of reduced foliage quality and increased rates of attack by parasitoids. Overall, death from plant effects increases by 50% and death from parasitoids by over 50% under elevated CO2. We have barely begun to study the effects of elevated CO2 on the efficacy of natural enemies and much work needs to be done. Effects of CO2 enrichment on insect–pathogen interactions have rarely been considered, although links between foliar phenolic concentration and viral infection of caterpillars are well established (Keating & Yendol, 1987; Hunter & Schultz, 1993). However, in at least one study (Lindroth et al., 1997), susceptibility of gypsy moth larvae to NPV was unaffected by CO2-mediated changes in foliar phenolics. Effects upon parasites, predators and pathogens under field conditions would appear to be a priority for future research. If declines in foliar nitrogen and increases in foliar C : N ratios are generally predictable responses of plants to elevated concentrations of CO2, there seems to be less predictability in the responses of insects. Although levels of consumption by insects usually rise under elevated CO2, additional effects upon performance appear to be somewhat idiosyncratic. For example, reductions in gypsy moth performance on aspen are associated with CO2-induced increases in phenolic glycosides (McDonald et al., 1999). Although nutrient and secondary chemistry of birch and maple are also affected by CO2, there are no parallel changes in gypsy moth performance. In other words, CO2-mediated effects on insect herbivores will depend both on the species of plant and the species of insect under study (Lindroth et al., 1995; Traw et al., 1996; Coviella & Trumble, 1999). In experiments with white marked tussock moth, Agrell et al. (2000) have shown that it is possible to rank host plants based upon their deleterious effects on insects under elevated CO2. Effects on larvae were most pronounced when fed upon quaking aspen, followed by paper birch, and least pronounced on sugar maple. Moreover, effects of elevated CO2 may vary seasonally as both leaves and herbivores age. On oaks, increases in foliar C : N ratios become more pronounced as leaves age, yet negative effects on caterpillars are more pronounced in early instars on younger foliage. Older larvae appear to be better able to compensate for reductions in foliar quality than are young larvae (Williams et al., 1998). On evergreen species such as loblolly pine, elevated concentrations of CO2 can interact with natural between-year differences in foliage quality to influence the palatability of leaf resources for insect larvae (Williams et al., 1997b). Finally, not all insects respond negatively to the changes in plant phenotype that are mediated by elevated concentrations of CO2. At least some phloem-feeding insects exhibit increases in performance when provided with plants grown under elevated CO2 (Awmack et al., 1997; Bezemer & Jones, 1998). As before, however, there appears to be qualitative variation in the responses of phloem-feeding insects to changes in plant quality. For example, the same clone of the aphid Aulacorthum solani responds differently to elevated CO2 on two different plant species (Awmack et al., 1997). On bean plants, the daily rate of nymph production increases by 16%, whereas rates of development are unaffected. In contrast, aphids on tansy exhibit faster rates of development and no change in reproductive rate. Overall, aphid responses are positive under elevated CO2 on both host plants, but the mechanisms differ between hosts. What this suggests to me is that we are a long way from being able to predict changes that may occur in the population dynamics of important crop pests under elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2. Initial laboratory studies under controlled conditions were necessary to determine the general responses of plant phenotype to elevated CO2 and their potential effects on insect herbivores. However, most laboratory studies provide grossly artificial environments in which plants are not limited by nutrient availability or light, where communities are simplified to two or three interacting species, where behavioural choices of herbivores are limited, and where stochastic fluctuations in the environment are eliminated (Lincoln et al., 1993; Arnone et al., 1995). In other words, they are free of any ecological complexity. In reality, the effects of elevated CO2 on plant phenotype, and subsequent insect responses, will be mediated by the availability of resources to plants such as water (Roth et al., 1997), light (McDonald et al., 1999) and nutrients (Arnone et al., 1995; Haettenschwiler & Schafellner, 1999) and modified by climatic and biotic variability. Interactive effects of light and CO2 on tree growth and secondary chemistry have been studied by McDonald et al. (1999). Reductions in insect performance on aspen grown under high light and elevated CO2 were dramatic. When tussock moth were reared on treatment foliage for the entire larval period, survival fell by 62% with concomitant decreases in growth rate and pupal weight. Reductions in gypsy moth performance on aspen were associated with both CO2- and light-induced increases in phenolic glycosides. The key finding of these studies is the degree to which phenotypic changes in plants under elevated CO2, and the subsequent effects on insect herbivores, depend upon the availability of light (McDonald et al., 1999; Agrell et al., 2000). This suggests that successional stage and community composition will influence the response of plants, and their insect herbivores, to elevated CO2. Nutrient availability is also likely to affect plant and insect responses to atmospheric change (Arnone et al., 1995). At the very least, nutrient limitation is likely to set limits on the gains in plant biomass that generally result from elevated CO2 environments (Johnson & Lincoln, 1991; Saxe et al., 1998). Given natural variation in nutrient availability and uptake by plants, and increasing levels of nitrogen deposition from anthropogenic sources, we should be aware of potential interactions between elevated CO2 and nutrient availability. Indeed, nitrogen deposition may mitigate the effects of elevated CO2 on insect performance. In one experimental study, Haettenschwiler & Schafellner (1999) exposed larvae of the nun moth to spruce trees grown under three levels of nitrogen deposition and three levels of CO2. The effects of the treatments on plant phenotype were generally opposite. Nitrogen deposition caused reductions in starch, condensed tannins and total phenolics and increases in sugar and nitrogen concentrations in spruce needles − the direct opposite of responses to elevated CO2. As a consequence, nitrogen deposition was able to mitigate, in part, the deleterious effects of elevated CO2 on nun moth performance. In contrast, Kinney et al. (1997) found relatively few interactions between nutrient availability and CO2 concentration in their studies of gypsy moth performance on aspen, oak and maple. Effects of the treatments were strongly host-specific rather than predictably opposing. In some systems, the consequences of nitrogen deposition may greatly outweigh those of elevated CO2. For example, Kerslake et al. (1998) have demonstrated that the defensive and nutritional phenotype of heather, Calluna vulgaris, does not change after 20 months of growth under elevated CO2. In contrast, simulated nitrogen deposition results in decreases in foliar C : N ratio and increases in shoot growth. Unlike other studies (Lindroth et al., 1995; Haettenschwiler & Schafellner, 1999; Agrell et al., 2000), neither elevated CO2 nor nitrogen deposition influenced the foliar phenolics of heather. Consistent with phenotypic changes in the plants, the performance of winter moth larvae was increased by nitrogen deposition and unaffected by elevated CO2. One dominant consequence of elevated levels of atmospheric CO2 is the predicted increase in global temperature. Yet studies that combine effects of CO2-enriched plants and elevated temperatures on insect performance are still remarkably rare. In one such study (Dury et al., 1998), a 3 °C increase in temperature reduced the nutritional quality of oak leaves by reducing foliar nitrogen concentrations and increasing foliar concentrations of condensed tannin. In other words, elevated temperature resulted in phenotypic changes in plants that were broadly similar to those mediated by elevated CO2. In combination with CO2-mediated reductions in the quality of primary and secondary leaf flushes, the elevated temperatures associated with global warming may significantly reduce the quality of plant food for insect herbivores. However, complex interactions among temperature, plant quality, insect performance and range expansion make predictions of pest problems in future global environments extremely difficult (Cannon, 1998). For example, the reduced rates of insect growth that have been observed under elevated CO2 may disappear as temperature increases in response to rising levels of atmospheric CO2 (Fajer et al., 1991). The bottom line? We need long-term, multifactorial experiments under field conditions to have any hope of predicting the interactive effects of CO2 and other ecological variables on the insect pests of crops and trees. Given this complexity, can we make any generalizations about the effects of elevated CO2 on insects that feed on plants? While there are always going to be effects that are species- and system-specific (Traw et al., 1996; Kinney et al., 1997; Roth et al., 1998; Coviella & Trumble, 1999; Agrell et al., 2000), we should not shy away from synthesis when justified (Fajer & Johnson, 1993). For example, Bezemer & Jones (1998) analysed data from 61 plant–herbivore combinations and found some compelling patterns. First, they confirmed the general decreases in foliar nitrogen concentration (15%) and increases in carbohydrate (47%) and phenolic-based secondary metabolites (31%) reported in many individual studies. Second, consumption by herbivores was related primarily to changes in nitrogen and carbohydrate levels. Third, no differences were found between CO2-mediated herbivore responses on woody and herbaceous plant species. Fourth, leaf-chewing insects generally increased their consumption of foliage (30%) under elevated CO2 to compensate for reduced nutritional quality and suffered no adverse effects upon pupal weights. Fifth, leaf-mining insects could only partially compensate by increased consumption and their pupal weights did decline. Finally, phloem-feeding and whole-cell-feeding insects responded positively to elevated CO2, with increases in population size and decreases in development time. Of course, there will be exceptions to these general patterns, but they provide a benchmark from which to develop hypotheses for future studies. To proceed further, we require more comparative studies of a large variety of plant–insect combinations in diverse ecosystems under field conditions (Saxe et al., 1998). There remain fundamental gaps in our understanding of plant and insect responses to elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2. For example, we know very little about the responses of below-ground herbivores to increases in atmospheric CO2. Although the number of studies addressing CO2-mediated changes in the dynamics of soil communities is increasing (Ball & Drake, 1997; Jones et al., 1998; Kampichler et al., 1998; Kandeler et al., 1998), effects on insects that feed on plant roots are poorly understood. In at least some cases, elevated CO2 results in increases in root growth (Day et al., 1996) and increases in root nodule production of nitrogen-fixing plants (Hungate et al., 1999). However, the quality of these resources for insects that feed below ground are generally unknown. Likewise, we know almost nothing about the effects of CO2-mediated changes in plant quality on aquatic insects. Questions of water temperature aside, many aquatic insects in heterotrophic streams depend upon litter inputs as sources of carbon to drive food web dynamics. Changes in litter quality as the result of elevated CO2 have the potential to influence decomposition processes and resource availability in streams. However, in the one study I could find to date, litter from oak and birch grown under elevated CO2 had equivalent effects on mosquito growth and reproduction, as did litter from ambient atmospheric conditions (Strand et al., 1999). We desperately need more information on CO2-mediated changes in litter quality and subsequent effects on stream food webs. In reference to forest trees, we do not really know whether the studies of seedlings and saplings that have dominated the literature reflect accurately the responses that we should expect from mature trees. The increasing availability of open-top chamber (OTC) and free-air carbon enrichment (FACE) technologies should provide us with the ability to conduct long-term experiments on mature plants and the insects that they support. Field studies that challenge insects with quasi-natural communities of plants, animals and microbes under fluctuating environmental conditions may be more likely to reveal future effects of elevated CO2 on insect distribution and abundance (Fajer & Johnson, 1993; Stiling et al., 1999). I have already mentioned how little we know about the responses of natural enemies to CO2 enrichment. OTC and FACE studies have considerable potential to address the kinds of complex multitrophic interactions that are pervasive in both natural and production ecosystems. Effects of natural enemies (Stiling et al., 1999), mutualists (Marks & Lincoln, 1996) and complex plant communities (Arnone et al., 1995) on insect behaviour and performance cannot be understood in the ecological vacuum of the laboratory. Perhaps most important of all, we need long-term studies that integrate multiple generations of both insects and plants. Such studies are prerequisites for assessing responses such as parental effects on offspring quality (Rossiter, 1994) and adaptation by herbivore species to a CO2-enriched atmosphere. Long-term studies under field conditions are, of course, expensive. But they represent a fraction of the cost that big business is willing to pay to elect the politicians who will close their eyes to unacceptable levels of CO2 emissions. I would like to thank the National Institute of Global Environmental Change and the Department of Energy for supporting our work on the ecological consequences of elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO2.",

Carabids that emerged within the plots were not removed, but spiders that ballooned into these predator‐reduction plots or that entered by climbing the fence were removed by pitfall trapping and searching the vegetation. Three unmanipulated, unfenced plots served as the control treatment. 2 Densities of spiders on soybean vegetation, and activity‐densities of spiders and carabids determined by pitfall trapping, were c . 75% lower in the spider‐carabid reduction treatment than in control plots. Despite clear differences between treatments in numbers and activity of these major generalist predators, the weight of soybeans harvested did not differ between control and spider‐carabid reduction plots. 3 Paralleling the absence of an effect of predator reduction on soybean yield was the absence of any significant difference between treatments in densities of whiteflies (Aleyrodidae), leafhoppers (Cicadellidae), thrips (Thysanoptera), Lepidoptera larvae and herbivorous Coleoptera. 4 Our experiment provides no evidence that spiders and carabid beetles at ambient densities affect soybean yield. Low populations of pest species or low predation pressure on soybean pests by spiders and carabids at the ambient densities of this experiment could be responsible for this result.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 The abundance of aphids and their honeydew are important in shaping the ecology of food web interactions and nutrient cycling in forests of Norway spruce. Here, the effects of the different environmental conditions at two study sites located at different altitudes (500 m, 765 m a.s.l.), in the Fichtelgebirge, north‐eastern Bavaria, Germany, on the abundance of Cinara pilicornis and their influence on epiphytic microorganisms on shoots of Picea abies were compared. Subsequent changes in throughfall fluxes were measured over a period of 12 weeks beneath infested and reference trees. In a laboratory experiment, the effects of ultraviolet (UV) radiation on microbial mortality and C and N concentrations in leachates were determined. 2 The warmer and drier conditions at the low altitude site favoured an early onset to aphid multiplication in spring compared with the high altitude site, where aphid numbers peaked 3 weeks later. 3 The presence of honeydew was associated with a significant increase in the total number of cultured epiphytic filamentous fungi, yeasts and bacteria in 12 of the 18 sample units, indicating better culturability or growth, whereas altitude had no significant effect on cultured cell numbers. By contrast to the reference trees, the high dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and hexose‐C fluxes beneath infested trees at the peak in aphid abundance, in June and July, resulted in a concomitant decrease in the fluxes of total inorganic nitrogen beneath infested trees (low altitude: −19.7%; high altitude: −52.3%). Fluxes of organic nitrogen were significantly higher beneath infested trees at the time of infestation. Similarly, potassium fluxes in throughfall increased 1.6–2.0‐fold in response to aphid infestation. 4 The exposure of infested and uninfested shoots of Norway spruce to UV‐A and UV‐B radiation only weakly affected epiphytic microbial mortality and did not affect the concentrations of the different nitrogen compound in leachates. However, bacteria, tended to be more active in the leachates collected from infested shoots, which resulted in the higher concentrations of aminosugar‐N. The aphids had a more pronounced effect on the concentrations of DOC in leachates, with average DOC concentrations being 4.2‐fold higher than in leachates from uninfested shoots. 5 It is suggested that, even at very low densities, aphids exert a strong influence via honeydew on the performance of microorganisms, and nutrient and energy flow, in spruce forests.",

Using the mitochondrial gene, cytochrome c oxidase I (COI), individuals collected from across the distribution of P. atomaria were investigated for haplotype diversity and levels of mitochondrial divergence. 3 Within P. atomaria , genetic distance averaged 0.5% across 23 unique haplotypes for 93 individuals, with an average of 14% difference between P. atomaria and the outgroup species, Paropsis obsoleta . Significant genetic structure was observed relative to geographical distribution, but not with respect to host plant species of origin. Greatest divergence was between the southern‐most sample site (Canberra) and northern sites in New South Wales and Queensland, indicating reduced gene flow between these regions. 4 Individuals from across eastern Australia belong to the same genetic species with population substructuring evident.

Physiological effects on the insect because of difficulties in finding a suitable oviposition site may also be important. 2. In the present study, the effects that delays in access to host plants have on lifetime fecundity on diamondback moth and leek moth were examined. The ability to postpone egg laying, fecundity and lifetime oviposition are discussed in relation to intercrop/cover crop as a strategy to reduce oviposition on crop plants. 3. When faced with host plant deprivation, the diamondback moth is relatively more dependent upon host plant stimuli for the onset of egg production. By contrast, leek moth is able to postpone egg production for a longer time. There even appeared to be a tendency for leek moth females to extend their lifetime when faced with host plant deprivation. 4. We conclude that leek moths have the ability to postpone production of eggs and lay them later in life when finally encountering host plants after a period of host plant deprivation. Therefore, the use of intercropping as a strategy to reduce oviposition is questionable. For such an insect, use of a trap crop might be a better option because the female will lay her eggs in the trap crop and not get the opportunity to lay them later in life when finally encountering crop plants.",

This information was used to generate hypotheses relating to eliciting cues for oviposition. 3 Two experiments were carried out in the absence of conspecific larvae to assess: (i) whether changes in host density at levels above those needed to sustain egg production in the females affected egg output and (ii) the effect of restricting beetles to various homogeneous prey population structures on daily egg production. 4 Changes in host density caused a significant but transient decline in egg production whereas a heterogeneous prey population elicited significantly higher levels of oviposition than homogeneous ones with similar host densities, irrespective of the growth stage of the prey. 5 Beetles were fed to satiation throughout the experiments but the data obtained suggest that cues for eliciting oviposition operated in a density‐dependent fashion.

Although selection for resistance is always strong in areas and seasons where populations are exposed to insecticides, costs of resistance, which may only be expressed in the absence of insecticide use, will shape how quickly resistance will evolve. 2 We used sperm precedence to measure the shifts in resistance to imidacloprid in a natural population during winter diapause in the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (Say) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). Because adult beetles overwinter with viable autumn sperm, but sperm from spring matings take precedence over stored sperm, we used the difference in resistance of springmated and autumn‐mated overwintered females to estimate the shift in resistance during the winter. Offspring of autumn‐mated females were 2.7‐ or 2.5‐fold more resistant compared with offspring from spring‐mated females in two replicate trials. 3 We also measured the resistance of late summer and spring emergent adults in fields treated and untreated with imidacloprid in the first year. Adults from the treated field were 13.7‐fold more resistant and adults from the untreated field were 2.6‐fold more resistant compared with the next spring’s emergers. 4 These large costs of resistance observed in the field and inferred from resistance declines during diapause help to explain the observation that imidacloprid resistance has increased only slowly over the decade of widespread use against this species, and how insecticide resistance in general can cycle annually.",

    "abstract": "The induced resistance of the subarctic mountain birch Betula pubescens ssp . czerepanovii is a well‐characterized phenomenon, whereas the induced responses of Betula nana L., one of the parental species of mountain birch, have not yet been characterized. Betula nana is more resistant to several classes of insectivorous herbivores than the mountain birch, although the mechanisms responsible for the better ability to resist herbivores are not known. The present study aimed to determine the metabolic changes that are induced by early season herbivory in B. nana leaves and to study the effects of rapidly induced resistance on the growth of Epirrita autumnata larvae. Defoliation of B. nana was accomplished by E. autumnata larvae and leaf samples for chemical analyses were collected when the defoliating larvae were at their third and fifth instar. At the same time, laboratory assays for the growth and consumption rates of E. autumnata larvae were conducted. The wounding of leaves by E. autumna larvae induced the production of ellagitannins (ETs) in B. nana . Intriguingly, the concentrations of protein‐bound amino acids were also induced by herbivory; however, an increase in proteins was not mirrored in the growth rate of larvae, which was less on the induced foliage. The decreased growth rate of larvae was apparently linked to the increased concentrations of oxidatively‐active ETs and the high concentration of ETs may explain the better resistance of this parental species compared with the hybrid mountain birch with its lower levels of ETs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the distribution of key biotic elements of forest ecosystems is essential in contemporary forest management and in planning to meet future management needs. Habitat distribution (niche) models based on known occurrences provide geographical structure for such management as the environmental factors change. Bark beetles play critical roles in coniferous forest dynamics in western North America. Among these insects, Dendroctonus rhizophagus Thomas and Bright, which occurs in the Sierra Madre Occidental in Mexico, is unique in that it attacks only immature trees ( Pinus spp.) and therefore represents a threat to forest regeneration. We developed current habitat distribution models for D. rhizophagus and its Pinus hosts and projected these to future climate scenarios. Predicted suitable habitat of D. rhizophagus currently covers approximately 119 000 km 2 of which approximately 11% is occupied, and overlap with suitable habitat for all Pinus hosts exceeds 99.5%. Some suitable habitat occurs isolated from known D. rhizophagus occurrences in Mexico and the south‐western U.S.A. Habitat distribution models were projected to four potential climate scenarios for the period 2040–2060 and this predicted the gains and losses of suitable D. rhizophagus habitat throughout the region. Areas of north‐western Mexico maintain large areas of suitable D. rhizophagus and Pinus host habitat in all scenarios. Dispersal to isolated areas of D. rhizophagus habitat appears unlikely. The results of the present study can be used to target D. rhizophagus monitoring and management activities and may serve as a model for the management of other invasive species.",

Although pheromone traps with attractants are commonly used to monitor spruce beetle populations, the relationship between the numbers of beetles caught in pheromone traps and subsequent tree mortality has not been investigated adequately. We used pheromone traps to catch spruce beetles in plots throughout the insect flight period, quantified subsequent tree mortality, and modelled spruce tree mortality as a function of spruce beetle trap catches and stand conditions. The number of beetles caught was not different between years. It was also positively associated with tree mortality, as was the amount of available host. The year of sampling was significant in all models as a result of different mortality levels between years. We conclude that, although the models had good fit, the difference in mortality between the years with a similar beetle catch negates reliable estimates of tree mortality across years. Managers and forest health specialists will be better served by continued monitoring of spruce beetle populations with pheromone traps and the use of stand variables to identify susceptible stands.",

Population genetic structure analysis found that 51% of pairwise comparisons are genetically significantly different. Because populations that contributed markedly to genetic structuring possessed very low haplotype diversity, the effect of genetic drift could be a factor driving population differentiation. Comparisons of genetic differentiation between flies from different host plant species found no evidence of isolation. However, most haplotypes are unique for each host plant species, indicating that there are some degrees of isolation.",

The highest dominance of A. ustulatus was recorded in the warmest eastern county and the species was classified as eudominant. High dominance was also observed in the western county, confirming that A. ustulatus occurs in higher population in this area. Species was subdominant where the mean air temperature was the lowest. The increase in dominance in the west could be explained by the significant positive correlation found between air temperature and dominance. The seasonal activity of the adults was from June to mid‐August, with peak flight at the end of June.",

However, why larval performance is enhanced on stressed trees remains to be determined. We examined the mechanisms that may reduce the resistance of stressed Manchurian ashes. Trees in a common garden were girdled or left untreated as controls and both treatments were inoculated with EAB eggs. Larvae and bark tissue were harvested after feeding and larval performance so that the defensive mechanisms and nutritional quality of bark tissue could be assessed. Larval survival and mass was twice as high on girdled trees, although girdling had no effect on bark phenolics. The activity of two enzymes involved in wound repair and lignification (peroxidase and cinnamic alcohol dehydrogenase) was increased by girdling in bark tissue. Starch and total protein levels declined in girdled stems, although sugar content was unchanged. Total disulphide levels, a measure of protein oxidative damage, were increased by girdling, although no difference in lipid oxidative damage in ash phloem tissue was detected. Girdling ash increased larval performance even though it elevated some wound repair mechanisms and decreased some indices of plant nutritional quality. Other tree responses to girdling also were poor predictors of larval performance. It appears that mechanisms of stress‐induced variation in resistance of Manchurian ash to EAB differ from those that may explain interspecific variation in resistance.",

Based on single‐strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, 33 distinct mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (mtCOI) haplotypes were found in three sibling species, Z. tau A, C and J, in Thailand. Genetic structure analysis of the population revealed relatively large genetic differences among these sibling species, reflecting a tendency toward speciation. The maximum likelihood tree and median‐joining network reconstructed from the mtCOI sequences of 33 haplotypes supported the separation of these three sibling species within the Z. tau complex. The three‐level hierarchical analysis of molecular variance based on geographical regions and the Mantel test for isolation‐by‐distance showed significant genetic structuring of the Z. tau complex in Thailand. However, the genetic differentiation among geographical groups was rather low, which may be reasonably explained by natural and human mediated dispersal, as well as host associated differentiation. The SSCP analysis on the population genetic structure of Z. tau species complex in the present study should benefit pest management.",

We addressed the effect of tree diversity on oak colonization and defoliation by a major specialist pest, the oak processionary moth (OPM) We quantified the number of male OPM moths captured and larval defoliation in pure stands of two oak host species ( Quercus robur and Quercus petraea ) and in mixed stands associating the two oak species or each oak species with another nonhost broadleaved species. We conducted two complementary studies to test the effect of host species and stand composition: (i) we used pheromone trapping to compare the number of males OPM captured throughout the distribution of oak hosts in France and (ii) we noted the presence of OPM nests and estimated defoliation in mature forests of north‐eastern France. Oak species and stand composition significantly influenced the number of male OPM captured and defoliation by OPM larvae. Quercus petraea was consistently more attractive to and more defoliated by OPM than Q. robur . Both oak trees were attacked more in pure stands than in mixed stands, in particular mixed stands associating oaks with another (nonhost) broadleaved species. The results of the present study support the view that mixed forests are more resistant to specialist pest insects than pure stands, and also indicate that this trend depends on forest composition. Our study provides new insights into OPM ecology and has potential implications for forest management, including the management of urban forests where OPM causes serious human health issues.",

Both species were significant pests in newly established pine plantations. A single colony can attack a substantial number of seedlings (up to 453 seedlings). Colonies with larger nests attacked more plants and ranged farther; A. crassispinus reached 59 m and A. subterraneus 87 m. After 10 years, no significant losses in plant development were seen in seedlings defoliated less than 50% at 30 days after planting.

Leaf‐cutting ant controls should be carried out in plantations of P. taeda within 30 days of planting to avoid attacks.

Female ALB produce a pheromone component, α‐longipinene, in the genitalia. However, the origin and factors, such as age, mating, adult feeding and host plant, influencing the production of this compound are unclear. Our results showed that virgin female ALB consistently produced α‐longipinene at various ages after feeding for several days post eclosion, but unfed adult females never produced this compound. Mating significantly reduced the amount of α‐longipinene in female genitalia. α‐Longipinene was the most dominant compound in the volatiles emitted by females, but not in those emitted by males or host twigs ( Acer pensylvanicum L.). The proportion of α‐longipinene among the beetle‐released sesquiterpenes that were known to be male antennally active was significantly greater than that emitted by ALB damaged, mechanically damaged or control twigs. These results suggest that ALB females probably derive α‐longipinene or a precursor from hosts via adult feeding, and release it at a significantly different ratio from that found in host volatiles. The various ratios of α‐longipinene produced by beetles and host twigs may encode information pertaining to multiple purposes such as aggregation, mate and host location.",

Intensification of agriculture and climate seasonality are known to alter honeybee pollen intake in temperate regions through changes in resource availability; however, little is known about how honeybees respond to such environmental factors in tropical regions. Pollen collected by honeybees was sampled from apiaries in a Neotropical highland region of Colombia. Pollen species were identified and the effects of landscape diversity, forest area and mean monthly precipitation on the pollen intake by honeybees were evaluated for all pollen species together and pollen species segregated according to forest and anthropic areas. Honeybees were found to be much more associated with anthropic than forest pollen species regardless of landscape structure or precipitation. However, pollen intake from all species and forest species responded positively to landscape diversity and forest area. Precipitation was found not to be related to the overall amount and overall richness of pollen collected by honeybees. Nonetheless, overall pollen diversity was negatively affected by precipitation in less diverse landscapes, whereas anthropic pollen diversity was negatively affected by precipitation in more forested landscapes.",

In present study, the disjunct distribution was interpreted by mapping the climate dimension and potential distribution using an ecological niche modelling approach. The preferred niche models were utilized to identify the relative roles of climate, human influence and vegetation with respect to the present distribution and also to extrapolate the climate dimensions suitable for the codling moth in China. The results of the present study suggest that a combination of climate suitability and human influence explain the range expansion. Undistributed areas in eastern China were found to have low to medium climate suitability. Nonetheless, these areas belong to apple-growing regions that have high propagule pressure; thus, eventual establishment appears to be possible because of host plant availability, human activity and the wide ecological flexibility of the moth.

Sirex noctilio is a xylophagous feeder and recent invader of North America that co-occurs in pines (Pinus) with a native siricid (Sirex nigricornis) and a suite of shared hymenopteran parasitoids. This insect has a long history as a destructive pest in Southern Hemisphere pine plantations. To establish explicit trophic linkages between native hymenopteran parasitoids and two species of woodwasp (Sirex) in North America, a polymerase chain reaction assay was developed to amplify mitochondrial DNA that was restriction digested with the aim of identifying species. The assay was used to identify species of Sirex from cadavers and gut contents from different parasitoid stages with the aim of establishing host–parasitoid relationships. The host woodwasp species was identified successfully from parasitoid gut contents collected from larvae, pupae and adults. Across all parasitoid life stages, woodwasp host was identified in 52.9% of ibaliid parasitoids and 78.5% of rhyssine parasitoids. Host was successfully identified from 88.1% of associated siricid cadavers. These results demonstrate the utility of molecular techniques to verify host–parasitoid associations that previously had only been inferred. Development of molecular tools is a rapid and crucial tool for establishing trophic linkages and is particularly useful in situations involving non-native species with cryptic lifestyles.",

Signs and symptoms of A . planipennis increased in abundance during the present study. Emergence of A . planipennis was greater in larger diameter trees and in subplots with more ash trees. More epicormic shoots were on the upper halves of trees in subplots with a higher percentage of ash. F raxinus nigra exhibited a higher incidence of ruptured bark than F raxinus pennsylvanica .

We investigated whether biotic and abiotic characteristics can be used to predict Diaphorina citri population abundance and assessed whether agricultural intensity explained the distribution of D. citri populations during winter dormant periods (December to March). Over two consecutive winters, we examined the abundance of D. citri in groves throughout Florida in response to four different management regimes, defined as: conventional, intermittent, unmanaged and organic. During both years, the winter abundance of D. citri in groves with intermittent management was greater than in groves with other management regimes. Latitude and row orientation both had a significant effect on psyllid density during winter. Diaphorina citri abundance was higher when more than 20% of the surrounding landscape was urbanized. These findings suggest that only conventional management of groves reduced D. citri populations during winter periods. By contrast, intermittent management was associated with higher D. citri populations. These results might be of some concern in light of the economic and environmental costs of repeated insecticide applications and the dramatic decline of citrus production in the U.S.A.",

Earlier research has demonstrated a preference for certain clones of Pinus contorta, indicating that L. occidentalis responds to chemical or physical cues. The present study aimed to test whether L. occidentalis shows clonal preference across years, and to examine whether the host cues responsible for this could be identified. Surveys were conducted in a lodgepole pine seed orchard in British Columbia in 2008 and 2009. Clones were ranked based on the proportion of their ramets on which L. occidentalis was observed. Ramets were divided into three classes: (i) preferred clones with seed bugs; (ii) preferred clones without seed bugs; and (iii) nonpreferred clones with zero or very low numbers of seed bugs. From each clone, we measured infrared radiation emitted from cones, cone monoterpenes, cone size and numbers of cones per tree. Clone preference was consistent between 2008 and 2009. Clone preference classes differed significantly in α-pinene and δ-3 carene and limonene. Leptoglossus occidentalis was found more frequently on clones with cones of greater diameter and weight. Infrared radiation did not differ between clone preference classes, indicating that it is not used in host acceptance.",

Detailed information regarding species composition of the borer larvae in the nuts and the genetic diversity of these species is not however available. Lepidoptera obtained from nuts from the KwaZulu‐Natal, Mpumalanga and Limpopo provinces were identified based on COI sequencing. Thaumatotibia batrachopa represented 95% of the larvae collected in damaged nuts across all growing regions. The population genetic diversity and structure of the dominant species were determined using a 650 bp section of the mtDNA cytochrome oxidase I gene to construct a parsimony network. Rapid diagnostic tools were developed, which included a polymerase chain reaction‐restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR‐RFLP) assay for the identification of all four species and species‐specific primers for T. batrachopa and T. leucotreta . Population studies of T. batrachopa showed a dominant COI haplotype present in all growing regions, although several unique haplotypes were also present in each region. Overall, the high haplotype diversity observed in this study is in agreement with that of a native population. The populations between the growing regions are, however, not clearly separated and might reflect recent gene flow.",

Mealybugs are serious pests of vines with Planococcus ficus (VMB) being the most problematic worldwide. Mealybugs are attended by different ant species, whose trophobiotic relationship is often considered damaging since some ant species may offer effective protection from natural enemies in exchange for honeydew. We tested whether this trophobiosis can be used as a VMB monitoring tool, developing a protocol to evaluate infestation on the plants based on ant behaviour (Ant method). We compared this new protocol with the conventional one, consisting in visual counting of VMBs on infested leaves (Leaf method). Our results demonstrated that the Ant method yielded significant advantages over the Leaf method by: (i) allowing to detect VMB infestation on individual plants much earlier; and (ii) allowing to keep track of VMB presence after pest treatments. The Ant method is proposed as a valid complementary tool for integrated pest management in vineyards and its successful achievement encourage searching for further agricultural contexts in which ants may be revaluated as a monitoring tool.",

Ten metal drums containing decomposing fruit, baited with pheromone and treated with insecticide, attracted Carpophilus spp. and appeared to reduce populations and damage to ripening fruit at distances of 200–500 m. Populations and damage were significantly greater within 200 m of the drums and may have been caused by ineffective poisoning or poor quality/overcrowding of fruit resources in the drums. 5 Suppression of Carpophilus spp. populations using synthetic aggregation pheromones and a coattractant appears to be a realistic management option in stone fruit orchards. Pheromone‐mediated diversion of beetle populations from ripening fruit may be more practical than perimeter trapping, but more research is needed on the effective range of Carpophilus pheromones and the relative merits of trapping compared to attraction to insecticide‐treated areas.",

The elimination of a sticking agent from the formulation would reduce costs, simplify application, and make it possible to apply the product without specialized equipment. 2 A test was conducted in wooded plots in Virginia during 1997 and 1998 to determine whether a sticking agent is necessary. Treatment effectiveness was assessed from the rates of male moth capture in pheromone‐baited traps and mating success of both laboratory‐reared and wild females. 3 Male moth capture was reduced 75.6 and 92.9% in plots treated with flakes without and with a sticking agent, respectively. The percentage of mated females that produced egg masses with more than 5% fertile eggs was reduced by 86.3 and 99.5% in plots treated with flakes without and with a sticking agent, respectively. 4 Moth capture and mating success of laboratory‐reared females did not differ significantly between plots treated with flakes with and without a sticking agent. However, the consistently greater reduction in mating success in both years provides strong evidence that mating disruption is less effective when flakes are applied without a sticking agent. The proportion of wild egg masses collected in 1998 with more than 5% fertile eggs was significantly higher under the no‐sticking agent treatment. 5 In special situations where the use of a sticking agent may be problematic, such as in residential areas, the data indicate that a high level of mating disruption is likely to occur even without the use of a sticking agent.",

Treatment effects on the abundance of the green spruce aphid Elatobium abietinum and honeydew production were assessed. In addition, needles were sampled for phyllosphere micro‐organisms. In a manipulative experiment, shoots were established and maintained as with or without E. abietinum infestation in order to determine the effects of infestation on needle loss and throughfall nutrient fluxes. 2 Aphid numbers were highest during the end of May and early June, with almost twice as many needles infested in the NS Acid treatment compared with the other treatments. Honeydew production was not affected by the treatments. 3 On infested shoots, increasing numbers of yellowing and dead needles were recorded above the throughfall collectors as the season progressed. The numbers of dead needles falling into the collectors were significantly higher beneath infested shoots. There were strong positive correlations between aphid numbers above the throughfall collectors, the number of yellowing and dead needles on the shoots and the number of needles in the funnels of the throughfall collectors. Litter production was more affected by aphid number than by pollutant treatment. 4 Bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi were more prolific on infested needles and treatment effects on colony forming units (CFUs) were most pronounced in the NS Acid treatment. 5 Fluxes of inorganic nitrogen beneath infested shoots were generally lower than beneath uninfested shoots. This effect was more pronounced in those treatments that supplied N i.e. N, NS Acid. The combination of aphid infestation and N‐addition exerted the strongest influence on nutrient fluxes. The fluxes of potassium and of organic carbon (DOC) were higher beneath infested shoots in all treatments, through most of the survey period.",

The needle trace method was used to determine retrospectively the temporal pattern and intensity of defoliation in a stand of Sitka spruce in Hafren Forest that had been damaged severely at the time of the sawfly outbreak. 2 An initial calibration experiment, designed to test the reliability of the needle trace method when applied to Sitka spruce, indicated that artificially induced defoliation of up to 75% was detected by the technique with an accuracy of ±7%. Higher rates of defoliation were underestimated by up to 17%. 3 For the main sample of trees, the needle trace method demonstrated that retention of needle sets (average needle retention) was reduced by up to 33–38% over a 10‐year period coincident with the G. hercyniae outbreak and the years immediately afterward when the canopy was recovering. 4 Analysis of needle loss within separate needle cohorts and age‐classes revealed that 1‐year‐old needles were the most severely defoliated. The density of 1‐year‐old needles was reduced by 51–78% in 1970–73. 5 Defoliation at the time of the G. hercyniae outbreak was associated with reductions in annual height, radial, and volume increments of 24–49%, 30–59% and 32–56%, respectively. Radial and volume increments suffered their greatest reductions 1 year later than height increments. 6 The study demonstrates that the needle trace method can be applied successfully to Sitka spruce to quantify defoliation caused by an insect outbreak occurring many years previously, and that the technique can provide data on needle loss that is valuable for interpreting reductions in tree growth.",

The highest predation (up to 95%) was found during autumn in forest stands with a dense understory vegetation. 3 Cocoon parasitism varied between year, season and forest type. The highest parasitoid attack was observed in pure pine forests with more or less barren soils, but did not exceed 24% of exposed cocoons. 4 Cocoons were exposed in small patches. Predators tended to exploit all cocoons of a patch, whereas parasitoids only attacked a few cocoons of a patch. Predation was similar on cocoons placed in the litter and those buried more deeply in the soil, whereas parasitism of soil‐buried cocoons was rare. 5 These results indicate that predators can have a remarkable potential for limiting endemic sawfly densities, if habitat conditions in a forest maintain their population and support their foraging behaviour. A notable effect of parasitoids on sawfly cocoons deposited in the litter is obviously restricted to typical pure and barren pine forests, but may play there a similar role as predation.",

Cryptophlebia peltastica also occurs as natural populations throughout the country. To analyse the population genetic structure of the two species, amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis was conducted. Patterns of genetic diversity in C. peltastica populations in the Mpumalanga province, where the species is controlled, were compared with those in the Western Cape, where populations occur under natural conditions. Gene diversity was high within T. batrachopa populations ( H = 0.2219) with significant genetic differentiation among populations ( G st = 0.358). Cluster analysis showed that geographical populations were closely related and extensive divergence was found over local scales. Similar to that of T. batrachopa , genetic diversity and population differentiation was high within both C. peltastica Mpumalanga and Western Cape populations ( H = 0.1906 and 0.1687 and G st = 0.4124 and 0.3799, respectively). It is suggested that the population genetic structure of both species is influenced by their limited ability to disperse. In addition, chemical control of C. peltastica in the Mpumalanga province has not succeeded in reducing the population size, but the C. peltastica population subdivision in the Western Cape may be influenced by the limited distribution of host plants in this region.",

Pesticide treatment increased the attractiveness of Leucaena plants, even of those deemed to be psyllid resistant. Numbers of psyllid eggs and nymphs, sampled in the field, reflect the arrival rates of adults at the three plant varieties. 3 Wavelength reflectance data of the three Leucaena varieties were not significantly different from one another, suggesting that psyllids cannot discriminate among the three plants using brightness or wavelength cues. There was a differential release of caryophyllene among the three varieties. Release of caryophyllene in L. leucocephala and the hybrid appeared to be influenced by environmental conditions. 4 Experiments demonstrated that caryophyllene (at least on its own) did not influence the behaviour of leucaena psyllids in relation to leucaena plants. 5 The results suggest that host plant volatiles cannot be dismissed as significant in the interaction between the leucaena psyllid and its Leucaena host plants.

Sufficient sample sizes are obtained by using large numbers of traps to which treatments are randomly assigned once, or by frequent collection of trap catches and subsequent re‐randomization of treatments. 3 Recently, there has been some debate about the potential for trap contamination to occur when semiochemical treatments (baits), and not trap‐treatment units (traps and baits), are re‐randomized among existing traps. Due to the volatility of many semiochemicals, small levels of contamination could potentially confound results. 4 A literature survey was conducted to determine the frequency of re‐randomizing semiochemical treatments (baits) vs. trap‐treatment units (traps and baits) in scolytid trapping bioassays. An experiment was then conducted to determine whether differences in the response of Dendroctonus brevicomis LeConte to attractant‐baited traps exist between the two methods. 5 The majority of papers examined reported use of a large number of fixed replicates (traps) rather than re‐randomization of treatments at frequent intervals. Seventy‐five percent of papers for which re‐randomization methods could be determined reported relocation of semiochemical treatments (baits) only. 6 No significant differences in trap catch were observed among multiple‐funnel traps aged with D. brevcomis baits (Phero Tech Inc., Canada) for 0, 30 and 90 days, suggesting that contamination did not influence the results. 7 It is concluded that re‐randomizing baits is a viable cost‐effective option to re‐randomizing trap and bait units.",

Because STS targets very low‐density gypsy moth populations within which it is extremely difficult to collect females or egg masses, mating success in native populations cannot be determined. Therefore, the evaluation of mating disruption treatments in field experiments such as those designed to test new formulations and application methods requires deploying and recovering laboratory‐reared female moths to determine mating success. 2 Five methods of deploying females were evaluated for cost, rates of female and egg mass recovery, and female mating success. The deployment methods tested were: modified delta trap, square barrier, single and double trunk bands, and tethered females. 3 Deployment of tethered females had the highest cost and mating success rate, but it did not yield the highest rates of female and egg mass recovery. Deployment of females in delta traps produced the lowest cost and mating success rate, but yielded the highest recovery rate. Neither of these deployment methods is recommended because of unacceptably high cost (tethered female) or low mating success (delta trap). 4 There were no significant differences in cost or mating success among the other three deployment methods. 5 The differences among the square barrier, single trunk band, and double trunk band methods in cost, female and egg mass recovery, and mating success are too small to recommend any one over the others.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 The cultivated tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum , is an economically important worldwide crop. Current pest management techniques rely heavily on pesticides but trichome‐based host‐plant resistance may reduce pesticide use. 2 A review of the literature is provided on trichomes of wild Lycopersicon species and the effects of trichome‐based host‐plant resistance on arthropods. Solvents have been used to remove glandular trichome exudates and the resulting dimminution of their effects quantified. Correlational approaches to assess the relationship between the different trichome types and effects on pests have also been used. 3 Most studies have focused on Lepidoptera and Hemiptera, although some work has included Coleoptera, Diptera and Acarina, and both antibiotic and antixenotic effects have been demonstrated. 4 Natural enemies are a cornerstone of international pest management and this review discusses how the compatibility of this approach with trichome‐based host‐plant resistance is uncertain because of the reported negative effects of trichomes on one dipteran, one hemipteran and several Hymenoptera. 5 For trichome‐based host‐plant resistance to be utilized as a pest management tool, trichomes of wild species need to be introgressed into the cultivated tomato. Hybrids between the cultivated tomato and the wild species Lycopersicon hirsutum f. glabratum , Lycopersicon pennellii and Lycopersicon cheesmanii f . minor have been produced and useful levels of resistance to Acarina, Diptera and Hemiptera pests have been exhibited, although these effects may be tempered by effects on natural enemies. 6 This review proposes that studies on genetic links between fruit quality and resistance, field studies to determine the compatibility of natural enemies and trichome‐based host‐plant resistance, and a strong focus on L. cheesmanii f. minor , are all priorities for further research that will help realize the potential of this natural defence mechanism in pest management.",

For exotic predator species that feed on herbivores, their success with invading new habitats may depend upon overcoming defences used by native prey. Whether exotic predators can alter herbivore host choice has remained unexamined. Therefore, we compared the efficacy of larval defence by Chrysomela knabi (a native beetle species) that had fed on two native willow hosts: Salix sericea (a phenolic glycoside (PG)‐rich species) and Salix eriocephala (a PG‐poor species), when attacked by exotic generalist predators. In addition, the preference and performance of C. knabi on S. sericea and S. eriocephala was examined. 2 Chrysomela knabi preferred and performed better on S. sericea. In a common garden, adult C. knabi were nine‐fold more common and oviposited five‐fold more frequently on S. sericea than on S. eriocephala . In the laboratory, adult feeding preference on leaf discs and survival rates of larvae were both greater on S. sericea , and time to pupation was shorter. 3 Chrysomela knabi larvae produced significantly more salicylaldehyde when fed S. sericea leaves than when fed S. eriocephala leaves. Additionally, those larvae with greater salicylaldehyde had reduced predation by two exotic generalist predators, Harmonia axyridis larvae and juvenile Tenodera aridifolia sinensis . 4 The results obtained in the present study suggest that selection favoured the preference of C. knabi for PG‐rich willow plants because larvae grew and survived better and that selection by common exotic generalist predators would reinforce this preference.",

In 2006, field populations surveyed along the migration path from California through Oregon were highly susceptible to Bt insecticides and, thus, showed no indication of selection for resistance among these source populations. 4 The arrival of the immigrant moths provides a potential source of susceptible individuals to dilute the levels of resistance in greenhouse populations in BC later in the summer, but this has not occurred. Thus, field populations in BC do not appear to serve as refuges to combat Bt resistance in greenhouse populations.",

However, 3 months later, there was a significant increase in the susceptibility to this insecticide (RF = 10). The formetanate resistance in the FOR7 strain showed a no significant decline during the 8 months without selection (from RF = 31 to RF = 17). 4 The field‐collected strains from sweet pepper greenhouses (PTF4, PP2 and PM5) showed a marked fall in the LC 50 to acrinathrin and methiocarb, and a slight decrease to formetanate, after being reared in the laboratory in the absence of selection pressure for 8 months. 5 In greenhouses, a significant fall in resistance to the selected insecticides was produced when insecticide pressure was withdrawn, at the end of the season, probably caused by the immigration of thrips from nearby crops or weeds, and the dilution of resistance through interbreeding with susceptible individuals. 6 Factors influencing stability or reversion of insecticide resistance are discussed.",

Temporal components of the interaction were taken into account by either introducing the weevils and the pathogen simultaneously or sequentially, with the weevils being introduced 1 month after the fungal inoculation. We measured larval mortality, development time, offspring number, sex ratio and body size of P. castaneus . Phloem phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations were also assessed. Furthermore, we tested whether: (i) emerging offspring transported propagules of the fungus; (ii) artificially‐contaminated weevils may transmit the disease to healthy trees; and (iii) field collected P. castaneus carry the fungus. The fungus enhanced weevil colonization and brood production in both seasons. During winter and spring, adults from trees where the pathogen was inoculated prior to weevil introduction emerged earlier than weevils from trees where they had been introduced simultaneously with the fungus. During winter, weevils from pre‐inoculated trees were also larger. Sex ratio and larval mortality were not affected. Leptographium serpens did not affect phloem nitrogen content but phosphorus content was greater in plants inoculated with the pathogen, which may explain the findings on weevil growth. Sixty‐five percent of the weevils that emerged from inoculated trees carried spores of L. serpens , although no successful isolation was made from field collected weevils. The fungus was recovered from 25% of the trees infested with artificially‐contaminated weevils. These results suggest that P. castaneus benefits from the presence of L. serpens and may contribute to its spread.",

At an old clearfell site where autumn-emerging weevils had overwintered, weevils were trapped as they re-emerged in the spring and tested for their ability to fly and then dissected to determine the degree of wing muscle and egg development. 2 Re-emerging weevils were most abundant in pine growing at the edge of the clearfell and, over most of the trapping period (April to June), their capacity for flight (proportion flying and wing muscle width) was more advanced than in weevils from the clearfell itself, with a similar trend in the degree of reproductive development (proportion with mature eggs and egg volume). 3 In weevils from the clearfell, flight capacity and reproductive development increased concurrently to a peak around mid-May. In weevils from pine, wing muscles were already well developed at the start of trapping, although few of them flew. Their more advanced development was attributed to the increased opportunities for maturation feeding after emergence in the previous autumn. 4 In the spring, weevils reached the canopy of trees for maturation feeding by walking and, to a lesser extent, by flight. Weevils dispersed by flight to oviposition sites in mid-May when most of them were reproductively mature. After arrival, flight ability and wing muscle size declined rapidly but egg production was maintained until most weevils had stopped flying. When wing muscles reached their minimum size, there was a marked decline in egg size, suggesting that wing muscle breakdown is important in maintaining egg production at oviposition sites. Prospects for further wing muscle and reproductive development are discussed.",

There was limited geographical structuring in the samples, although the two most common genotypes, which comprised more than half of the specimens collected, had a very wide distribution. Furthermore, we determined that these aphids, which live in very dense colonies, can consist of more than one genotype, suggesting aggregation of colonizing T. salignus .

A major obstacle to studying this pathogenic virus in nature is the difficulty of confirming and quantifying the presence of NeseNPV. In the present study, we developed real‐time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers, based on the caspid gene 39 sequence, for the specific and quantitative detection of NeseNPV. The quantitative real‐time PCR (qPCR) assay can detect virus from any substrate tested, including different insect life stages (egg, larval, adult), pine foliage, and litter or ground vegetation. The reproducible detection limit for the real‐time assay is 0.013 pg of viral DNA (0.013×10 −12 g), corresponding to 136 viral genomes or approximately one to seven virus occlusion bodies per sample. qPCR is a specific, quantitative, sensitive, reliable and flexible procedure, and is a good supplement to conventional microscopy‐ or bioassay‐based methods for detection of the virus. We have used qPCR to quantify the level of NeseNPV in samples collected in the field after aerial application of the virus, and demonstrated significantly higher virus levels in sawfly larvae from sprayed areas compared with unsprayed control areas 4 weeks after spraying. This qPCR assay can be used to determine important aspects of the biology of NeseNPV (e.g. virus levels in different insect life stages and in their microhabitats on pine foliage and in forest litter).",

In the Similkameen Valley of British Columbia, Canada, the rosy apple aphid population size varies widely between orchards and between years. To explain this variation, potential environmental correlates of aphid density were evaluated. The architecture of the alternate host was also evaluated for its effect on rosy apple aphid summer survival and reproduction. The percentage of trees infested by rosy apple aphids among orchards was in the range 8–94% for trees having at least one cluster with more than ten aphids in 2007 and in the range 0–39% in 2008. A general linear model correlating aphid densities to the environmental variables of abundance of the alternate host (plantain Plantago spp.), foliar nitrogen, tree age and planting density, and reduced by stepwise regression, indicated that foliar nitrogen and tree age explained 33% of the variation. Abundance of the summer, alternate food plant, plantain, was not related to later aphid densities on apple trees. Plantain architecture, however, influenced aphid numbers and 25‐fold more aphids were found on low‐lying plantain leaves than on more upright leaves. Experimental manipulation of leaf angle and leaf size showed that significantly more aphids occurred on low angle, large leaves. Finally, mowing that encouraged low lying plants prior to spring aphid migration was associated with a four‐fold greater number of both winged and wingless aphids on the plantain.",

One such example is the invasive Eurasian woodwasp Sirex noctilio , which inoculates pines with an obligate nutritional mutualist, the white rot fungus Amylostereum areolatum . Although S. noctilio has been previously introduced outside of its native range, its arrival in North America was the first time that it was introduced to communities hosting native Sirex species and Amylostereum strains. We conducted experiments aiming to investigate acceptance versus avoidance of native and non‐native Amylostereum strains and species during ovipositor drilling by females of S. noctilio and a native congener, Sirex nigricornis . Sirex noctilio preferred wood without prior fungal emplacement, whereas S. nigricornis preferred wood inoculated with one of the strains of Amylostereum that putatively invaded with S. noctilio . Drilling and presumed oviposition by both woodwasp species were highly aggregated. Based on the responses of these two Sirex species to the fungal strains and species included in the present study, the invasive S. noctilio would continue its present symbiont associations, whereas the native S. nigricornis would partly use the strain of fungal symbiont putatively introduced with S. noctilio .",

The present study assessed the effect of soil microarthropods on the EPN Heterorhabditis bacteriophora with respect to establishment within and infection of wax moth Galleria mellonella larvae in soil arenas. The presence of soil microarthropods at typical field densities significantly reduced the establishment of H. bacteriophora adults within G. mellonella larvae and also reduced the percentage of hosts infected in one of two replicated trials. Specifically, adult EPN establishment was negatively correlated with the abundance of mesostigmatid mites. The results of the present study indicate that soil microarthropods at natural abundances can reduce EPN establishment even within the structurally complex environment of soil, although this does not always lead to reductions in insect infection rates.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Insects with short‐lived adults must synchronize their emergence to maximize fitness. However, pre‐imaginal development time often varies among individuals as a result of exposure to varied abiotic and biotic factors; therefore, mechanisms adjusting pre‐imaginal development time are expected. Larvae of the pine processionary moth feed throughout the winter and conclude their development with characteristic processions in spring, leaving the trees to pupate in soil. The procession period can be as long as 2 months in some regions because of prior desynchronization of larval colonies, whereas the emergence period of the adults in summer remains short (less than 1 month). Through weekly sampling of larvae leaving trees to pupate in soil and subsequent rearing under field and laboratory conditions, it was observed that early prepupae waited longer than late prepupae before moulting into pupa. The differential duration of the prepupal stage was independent of temperature conditions and allowed resynchronization of colonies and overlapping emergences. The prepupal phase therefore appears to be critical for understanding the regulation of adult emergence of this important pest insect.",

European pine sawfly Neodiprion sertifer (Geoffroy) feeds on mature foliage of Scots pine Pinus sylvestris L. during a limited temporal period in early spring and is univoltine despite the continual presence of this resource throughout the growing season. Reciprocal manipulation of host and insect phenologies demonstrated that larval performance was highest in mid‐April, with the window of host susceptibility closing rapidly thereafter. As the host phenology advanced, the foliar concentration of nitrogen, amino acids and soluble carbohydrates decreased, whereas that of terpenoids increased. As the foliar quality declined, larvae ate more in an attempt to compensate, although they were less efficient at converting consumed foliage to body mass. The phenological window for larval development began to reopen late in the growing season as the quality of mature foliage started to improve until it once again supported larval development during the next spring. Neodiprion sertifer must synchronize its life cycle with an ephemeral phenological window of host suitability that closes too early and reopens too late to permit a second generation.",

Mild winters and higher spring temperatures increase E. abietinum population densities, although this positive response to warmer conditions might be over‐ridden if E. abietinum is adversely affected by exceptionally high summer temperatures. In laboratory experiments, aphids exposed to temperatures above 25 °C became more restless and were more likely to drop from the shoot, and subsequently showed a reduction in mean relative growth rate. In contrast, survival was not reduced significantly unless temperatures exceeded 35 °C. Field data from Radnor Forest in Wales indicated that E. abietinum populations in the autumn were inversely correlated with mean and maximum summer temperatures, at temperatures below those that had a negative impact in the laboratory. The greater sensitivity of populations in the field to high summer temperatures may reflect higher temperatures at the needle surface compared with the temperature of the surrounding air, or associated increases in natural enemy activity. The results from the present study indicate that high temperatures during mid‐summer have a significant impact on E. abietinum individuals and populations and, ultimately, may influence how the aphid responds to climate change.",

We selected 26 invertebrate ecosystem service providers that occur in New Zealand kiwifruit or apple orchards and produced mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase gene subunit I (cytochrome oxidase I) and/or 28S ribosomal DNA sequences for each. Specific barcode primers were designed for each invertebrate ecosystem service provider and tested, along with generic barcoding cytochrome oxidase I primers, for their ability to detect DNA from invertebrate ecosystem service providers that had been added to sterilized and unsterilized soil samples. Although the specific primers accurately detected the invertebrate ecosystem service providers in more than 96% of the samples, the generic cytochrome oxidase I primers detected only 37% of the invertebrate ecosystem service providers added to the sterilized samples and 2.5% in the unsterilized samples. In a field test, we compared metabarcoding with traditional invertebrate trapping methods to detect the invertebrate ecosystem service providers in 10 kiwifruit and 10 apple orchards. All invertebrate ecosystem service providers were collected in traps in at least one orchard, but very few were identified by metabarcoding of soil environmental DNA. Although the specific primers can be used as a tool for monitoring invertebrate ecosystem service providers in soil samples, methodological improvements are needed before metabarcoding of soil environmental DNA can be used to monitor these taxa.",

Sticky sheet traps were deployed for 8 weeks from 6 June to 2 August. 2017 in the Putah Creek Riparian Reserve, Davis, CA . Branches from host northern California black walnut, Juglans hindsii , were paired with branches from six nonhost hardwood species. The landing rate of P . juglandis (412 beetles trapped/8 weeks; 389 on host branches, 23 on nonhost branches) was significantly greater on the host branches for all nonhost hardwoods except Populus fremontii . Proportional comparisons of beetle presence also revealed a significant preference for the host branches compared with all but two nonhost species, Acer negundo and P . fremontii . Capturing P . juglandis without the use of an aggregation pheromone was a rare event, underscoring the difficulty of studying the initial phases of host selection behaviour in bark beetles. Unbaited funnel traps adjacent to selected host trees in the experiment only captured five individuals over a 19‐week period. None were captured in traps adjacent to nonhost trees. This study provided evidence that P . juglandis discriminates between host and nonhost branches while in‐flight. This directed flight behaviour is likely informed by the recognition of both host and nonhost volatile cues. This study established an ecological context for the development of a semiochemical‐based repellent system for protecting walnut trees from future attacks from this invasive bark beetle.",

    "abstract": "Rhopalosiphum padi (Linnaeus, 1758) is abundant and has a broad geographic distribution. It is one of the most important cereal pests. In Brazil, the economic losses associated with this aphid result mainly from the transmission of the barley yellow dwarf viruses. Decision‐making for the adoption of management measures must consider the initial population size, the potential for population increase, and the time when this population will reach levels at which the resulting damage is equal to the costs of control measures. Consequently, the establishment of management programmes and decision support systems should be based on models that estimate the potential population growth of this pest species. Temperature is one of the main factors that determine the growth rate of insect populations. Generally, controlled experiments are designed to examine the relationship of temperature at fixed intervals in relation to the development phases of insects. In nature, thermal regimes are not constant, and population growth is the result of a series of combined events. In this work, the effects of different thermal regimes on the population growth of R. padi were compared. An agent‐based model was used to estimate population growth, and the parameters defined in controlled regimes were compared with fluctuating temperatures under natural conditions. The temperature‐driven model presented here can serve as a tool to predict population growth and decision‐making for aphid management. The model structure and the proposed experimental design allow the addition of modules and layers of factors that can progressively affect the populations of aphids to gradually improve the model.",

The data were used to compute sampling efficiency directly and indirectly by TPL. Comparison of TPLs and efficiency plots of male and female pupae confirmed the identities linking TPL with sampling efficiency. Divergence of sex‐specific TPL plots indicated local scale density‐dependent sex ratio. Egg mass sample data confirmed the sampling efficiency and TPL identities provided the same variance and mean vectors were used to compute TPLs. Small differences in sample numbers destroy the identities but approximate efficiency estimates are still obtainable from the TPLs. Sampling efficiency of timed walks, fixed area and variable area surveys were estimated and ranked. Rescaling moth catches per trap to number per unit volume changes slope, intercept and correlation coefficient while stretching the pattern of data points. Comparison of absolute density estimates over two different time intervals showed density‐dependent variation declining with increasing sample interval. Fitting power laws by ordinary dependent regression is less efficient than fitting by geometric mean regression and produces biased regression parameters. The significance of this for the analysis and interpretation of ecological sample data generally is discussed.",

Pheromone‐baited traps have been widely recommended as a valuable tool for the monitoring and mass trapping of bark beetles. Although different suppliers offer a variety of STBB lures, their effectiveness has rarely, if ever, been evaluated under natural conditions. We evaluated the attractiveness of three commercially available and five experimental synthetic lures by comparing the numbers of STBBs captured in white, six‐funnel traps. The studies were conducted in 2017–2019 in Poland, in Scots pine‐dominated forests affected by STBB outbreaks. Our study demonstrated significant differences in the effectiveness of the lures. The experimental lure produced by the Witasek company (Austria) and the recently marketed lure Acumodor Micro from Chemipan (Poland) were the most attractive to STBB. Among the least effective were two commercial lures (Acuwit and Acumodor), hitherto used in Central Europe. The results will be useful in developing methods for the monitoring and management of STBB populations .",

We evaluated the predictive power of the model using defoliation records within the same prefecture taken from the subsequent year. The results obtained for Yamagata Prefecture were highly predictive and we conclude that practical hazard maps can be constructed based on damage records from the previous year combined with other environmental data. The predictive value of the model was improved dramatically by incorporating an immigration effect. The model used to predict damage in Yamagata Prefecture was correct for only 46.7% of the actual damage in Fukushima Prefecture. Several difficulties were identified regarding the application of the model in other prefectures.

Thus, the explanation of patterns may be facilitated by knowledge about the spatial scales where variation in patterns occurs. In the present study, the link between spatial patterns of the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa Den. & Schiff. (Lepidoptera, Notodontidae) at two different scales, as well as its population dynamics, was assessed. First, the spatial patterns of T. pityocampa population were assessed at the forest stand scale by surveying the distribution of larval colonies within the pine forest, indicative of adult dispersion. Second, egg-laying patterns across individual host-plants, indicative of female oviposition choices, were assessed, as well as their impact on the survival of immature stages. It was found that T. pityocampa presents a gregarious distribution in homogeneous pine forests, over distances of a few dozen metres. At the pine tree scale, females tend to aggregate their egg batches, whereas aggregation increases with population density. Natural enemies such as parasitoids do not appear to play an important role in regulating the population dynamics of the species. At the same time, aggregation in individual hosts leads to increased mortality in the period from hatching to the third instar, which is notable at high population densities. A patchy distribution in the landscape over short distances has a potentially positive effect on population dynamics of the species, avoiding the Allee effect, and allowing for a rapid increase in population, even where initial numbers are low, leading to localized outbreaks. At the same time, increased mortality as a result of egg-batch clumping at high population densities is a potential density-dependent mechanism of population regulation.",

Patches of the same size but longer or irregular have a higher perimeter/area relationship (P/A) than square or regular ones, which may determine the immigration, emigration and abundance of individuals in the patch. Only specialist species should be affected by plant patch shape. Those species that are more abundant in smaller patches should be more abundant in patches with higher P/A, whereas those that are more abundant in larger patches should be more abundant in patches with lower P/A. We studied the density of eggs, larvae and pupae of Pieris brassicae , Plutella xylostella and Trichoplusia ni in square (low P/A) and I‐shaped (high P/A) patches of 144 plants of Brassica oleracea . We also estimated their immigration to these patches, and the final plant weight. Plant patch shape affected the abundance, but not the distribution, of the two specialist species. Whereas P. brassicae was denser in I‐shaped patches, P. xylostella was more abundant in square patches. The generalist T. ni was not affected by patch shape. Immigration of P. brassicae was higher in I‐shaped patches, but immigration of P. xylostella and T. ni was not affected by patch shape. Plants were heavier in the centre of square patches. Our results suggest that plant patch shape affects the density of herbivorous insects and should be considered independently from other plant patch variables when studying the population dynamics of these organisms.",

Furthermore, catches of males reflected the results from the regular cocoon collections by foresters during the previous winter. 5 For N. sertifer , trap catches in endemic populations were well separated from trap catches on sites with higher sawfly densities. However, no significant correlation between trap catch and sawfly density or defoliation level could be found. These results suggest that the efficacy of the pheromone traps probably varied with biological features (sex ratio, density level, immigration) of the particular population.",

However, the relatively susceptible Salix viminalis genotypes and their hybrids dominate current high‐yielding willows. Interactions between Phratora vulgatissima and different genotypes of S. viminalis were examined under laboratory conditions to determine if these genotypes exhibit genetic differences in susceptibility to willow beetle damage. 2 Seven S. viminalis genotypes and four hybrids were tested for the feeding preference of adult P. vulgatissima , larval performance and within‐season plant response to manual defoliation (50% and 75%). 3 The feeding preference of adult beetles, the growth rate of larvae, and the weight at 33 days of larvae and pupae differed significantly between genotypes. Genotypes also differed significantly in their height and weight responses to mechanical defoliation. Two genotypes were taller, with longer internodes, after defoliation than were undamaged plants. Two hybrids and their S. viminalis parent showed no significant reduction in final dry weight between 0% and 50% defoliation treatments. 4 Susceptibility of genotypes to adult feeding was not correlated with their tolerance to defoliation in terms of weight or height responses; however, larval growth rate on genotypes was negatively correlated both with final height and number of leaves after 75% defoliation and with the susceptibility of genotype to adult feeding. 5 Salix viminalis showed genetic differences for all parameters tested. This suggests that the planting of a mixture of these genotypes would contain genetic differences with respect to host susceptibility to P. vulgatissima . Some parameters showed similarities between a hybrid and its parent, whereas others showed differences between siblings. This offers potential for effective breeding of desirable traits.",

However, more needles were lost per aphid in the low nutrient treatment and overall defoliation rates in the two nutrient treatments were similar. 5 Total aphid numbers differed significantly between Sitka spruce genotypes within nutrient treatments, but not in relation to bud‐burst or needle terpene content. Reductions in height growth caused by infestation were greater (15–44%), and related to mean aphid densities and defoliation, in the low nutrient treatment, but were smaller (11–27%) and not related to aphid density and defoliation in the high nutrient treatment. 6 Development of E. abietinum populations was similar on Norway and Sitka spruce, but Norway spruce lost fewer needles.

We then compared estimates of total abundances and proportions of males emerging from within each infestation to the estimates from three types of traps: passive sticky traps (2, 5, 10 and 20 m away from the source of beetles), multi‐funnel traps baited with pine beetle attractants (100 m away) and pine trees baited with attractants (also 100 m away). 3 We found that the proportion of males captured in traps was significantly affected by the type of trap used. 4 Within an infestation, equal proportions of males and females were marked (0.53 ± 0.02 males; mean ± SE), but the proportions captured in trap trees and passive traps were more female biased (0.42 ± 0.03 and 0.46 ± 0.01 males, respectively). On the other hand, funnel traps provided an estimate of the proportion of males that was nearly identical to the proportion from within infestations (0.51 ± 0.03). 5 Numbers of marked beetles captured in traps were uncorrelated with the numbers of marked beetles emerging from the focal infestations. This suggests that traps positioned around an infestation may not be effective at estimating relative abundances of beetles within the infestation.",

Support for the hypothesis would be established if midges originating from resistant willows and those originating from nearby susceptible willows differed in their abilities to initiate galls and complete development on resistant plants. 3 The objective of the second experiment was to explore whether there was a genetic basis to the trait for virulence in the midge population and to investigate any potential trade‐offs this trait may entail. 4 Our results indicate that there was a fine‐scaled microgeographic genetic structure to the midge population at Tälle. Midges originating from resistant plants had a heritable trait that enabled them to establish galls on resistant plants. 5 Midges able to initiate galls on the resistant genotype had longer developmental time on the susceptible genotype. This suggests that there is a physiological cost associated with being adapted to the resistant willow genotype. 6 We suggest that driving forces behind the observed host adaptation are selection imposed on the midge population by very strong willow resistance and restricted gene flow in the midge populations due to the special life history features of D. marginemtorquens .",

Significant temporal variation occurred in E. lawsoni foliar injury levels, with the highest injury ratings occurring in late June and August. Foliar injury was negatively correlated with foliar nutrient content, and higher levels of injury occurred more frequently on nonfertilized trees. The results obtained in the present study indicated that increased E. lawsoni abundance occurred on trees that did not receive fertilization.

We estimated these traps' attractive range for emerald ash borer using 98 baited dark green prism traps deployed in pairs, one trap per tree, in an urban park in Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA in summer 2020. We estimate attractive range by fitting a logistic model to trap catch data using Bayesian inferential methods and describe advantages thereof.

    "abstract": "Abstract Thrips are considered a secondary pest of soybean in Brazil, but high densities have been noticed since the last harvests (2017/18 and 2018/19), yet no study has provided an initial hypothesis regarding the causes of such events. We aimed to identify some of the factors related to Frankliniella schultzei Trybom (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) temporal dynamics in commercial soybean crops located in Tocantins (Northern Brazil). We undertook evaluations during soybean vegetative, flowering, and fruiting stages on 200 plants per field in each sampling date ( n = 22). Our results indicated that the densities of F. schultzei were similar among fields and soybean phenological stages. The density of thrips showed a significant negative relationship with rainfall, but it was not related to either air temperature, photoperiod, relative humidity, or wind speed. The predators' density was less than 170 individuals (summing all assessments), and it was not associated with thrips density. This study indicates rainfall as the leading factor associated with the temporal dynamics of F. schultzei in commercial soybean crops.",

In 2004, an incursion of Hylotrupes bajulus was discovered in P erth, W estern A ustralia. Two genes, one mitochondrial ( cytochrome oxidase subunit I ; COI ) and one nuclear ( i nternal t ranscribed s pacer 1; ITS1 ) were used to infer the origin of this incursion, as well as to test the likely dispersal pathways and dispersal distances of H. bajulus . We sequenced and examined 1003 cloned ITS1 fragments and 170 COI fragments from 14 international and 156 domestic specimens. The ITS1 fragment was extremely variable, with 94% of the sites polymorphic. To remove the variability and select only the informative polymorphisms principal component analysis was employed. This resulted in the selection of eight informative single nucleotide polymorphisms and seven microsatellites, which were converted into 119 unique ITS haplotypes. In comparison, COI was highly conserved, yielding only four haplotypes. The data suggest at least three independent incursions, of which two contained the same mitochondrial haplotype but different ITS1 sequences. The datasets were further scrutinized to estimate local dispersal distances. The results suggested that individuals were capable of dispersing &gt; 14 km, which is significantly further than previously reported.",

Mean winter low temperatures were correlated with higher levels of variation in species richness across all forest stands. Greater variation in species richness was also correlated with the occurrence of nearby harvests. Colder winters depressed species richness of forest moths across all forest stands. Unlogged stands within 100 m of patch cuts or shelterwood cuts gained and lost species at a greater rate than stands adjacent to unlogged forest. Species specialized to a single host were subject to the most significant variability and many specialists experienced ±50% change in abundance over 5 years. Timber harvest created a disturbance footprint that extended beyond the managed forest concession. Moth species with a specialized larval diet appeared to be most vulnerable to the indirect effects of timber harvest. Small logging concessions may change diversity at larger scales than presumed.",

Weed biological control host range testing methods were applied to identify those New Zealand plant species potentially at risk. Native plants tested were primarily in the Myrtaceae, the family that contains all the Australian hosts of U. lugens. 2 Experimental methods included no-choice larval feeding assays and field cage and laboratory oviposition trials. Difficulty in ascertaining reliable oviposition preference data from cage oviposition trials limited the confidence with which the invader's field host range could be predicted. 3 Field surveys of plants attacked by U. lugens in the infested area supported the initial predictions but only some of the at-risk native Myrtaceae were present in the area. 4 The risk to native New Zealand plants is presented in terms of two mechanisms: development of self-sustaining populations and temporary spill-over of solitary larvae. Development of self-sustaining populations of the pest within native forests is deemed to be highly improbable. 5 Temporary spill-over impacts are most likely in urban areas within mixed species plantings or boundaries between native/exotic forests and coinciding with the mobile larval life stages. Spill-over impacts from U. lugens have only been recorded to date on Metrosideros excelsa.",

Body size, abdominal fat and egg length of spur-throated Austracris guttulosa and Australian plague Chortoicetes terminifera locusts were related to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; a greenness indicator) to test these assumptions and quantify biological responses. 2 Cumulative rainfall was highly correlated with NDVI values of an area (25 × 25 km) surrounding the trap to which locusts were attracted. Catches of locusts were greater in hotter periods preceding rain, associated with an increase in NDVI indicative of brown (0.298) versus green (0.465) vegetation. 3 Pre-overwintering descendent A. guttulosa were larger and fattier than post-overwintering antecedents. Egg maturation of antecedents occurred coincident with increasing NDVI. Higher abdominal fat in pre-overwintering locusts was positively associated with higher NDVI. 4 Male C. terminifera of two descendent generations were larger than their antecedents but only pre-overwintering locusts were significantly fattier than their predecessors. Only pre-overwintering females were significantly larger than their predecessors and no generation was significantly fattier than any other. Fat content was negatively correlated with egg maturation and differed significantly with NDVI, although strong and consistent relationships were not obtained. 5 The findings suggest that locust–environment interactions are species- and habitat-specific. If A. guttulosa hoppers develop during periods when regional NDVI exceeds 0.4, fatter adults will arise. The elucidation of relationships between greenness, fat and egg development in C. terminifera is unlikely using NDVI values from areas comprising mixtures of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous vegetation.",

Bush crickets have been proposed as biological control agents of T. pityocampa populations, although their characteristics as generalist predators suggest that this would be possible only during the low‐density phases of the processionary population cycle. We combined observational and experimental approaches aiming to determine the role played by the bush cricket Steropleurus andalusius as a regulator of T. pityocampa . The synchrony of the phenology of T. pityocampa egg batches and the activity of bush crickets was poor, with the activity of bush crickets being longer than the period during which egg batches were available. The predation rate of bush crickets reached 23%, varied in time and space, and was independent of T. pityocampa egg‐batch density. There was no relationship between the egg‐batch densities and bush cricket abundance, and no response to experimental variations in egg‐batch density. Analysis of microhabitat selection suggests that T. pityocampa egg‐batch predation is a by‐product of the substrate selected by bush crickets for mating, and does not correspond with active searching of egg batches as food. These findings do not rule out the possibilty of bush crickets being natural regulators of T. pityocampa populations, although they impose limits with respect to their future use in biological control.",

The present study evaluated six winter host crops (hairy vetch, oats, rye, triticale, wheat and winter peas) and six summer host crops (buckwheat, brown top millet, grain sorghum, southern pea, pearl millet and sunflower) as potential trap crops for leaffooted and stink bugs in peaches from 2011 to 2013 in Alabama. Experimental plots were arranged around a mature peach orchard in a randomized complete block design, and insect densities, as well as host plant phenology, were recorded at weekly intervals from March to May and July to August each year. Wheat and oats attracted a significantly higher number of target insects than any other treatments evaluated in the winter trials. Sunflower, pearl millet and sorghum recorded a significantly higher number of insects than any other host crops evaluated in the summer. When the insects sampled were totalled across the season, leaffooted bugs (Leptoglossus phyllopus) dominated the pest complex (>70%), followed by brown stink bugs (mainly Euchistus servus Dallas). Target insects colonized the hosts mainly during the reproductive phase (including flowering and seed development) until plant senescence. The results obtained in the present study suggests that a combination of wheat and oats may be used to detect the early presence of leaffooted and stink bugs in the spring, whereas sunflower, pearl millet and sorghum could be utilized during summer to detect and attract colonizing populations away from peach orchards.",

Plant nutritional quality and resource concentration were manipulated with four levels of fertilization and the group size of trees, respectively.

Fertilization, host tree density and their interactions significantly changed the structures of galler species communities and gall morphotype assemblages.

At each site, four PPTs were hung on trees at the edge of a known C. fumipennis nest aggregation, and changed at 5.5–7.0‐week intervals. B uprestids were collected from hunting wasps once a week during their 5–6‐week activity period.

The start dates and functional development temperatures for the two species were estimated using an iterative method. The start dates were found to be 1 April for C. welensii and 15 April for P. myardi. The minimum development temperature for both species was 12 °C. The thermal constants associated with each flight percentage studied (1–99% at 10% intervals) were calculated from Gompertz curves fitting the equation CPE = exp[−exp(3.97 + 0.009DD)] (r2 = 0.955) for C. welensii and CPE = exp[−exp(6.50–0.008DD)] (r2 = 0.817) for P. myardi, where CPE is the cumulative percentage of emergence and DD is degree-days. The validation procedure revealed that the proposed models predict cumulative flight percentages with errors of 2.5–4.3 days for C. welensii and 3.2–18.2 days for P. myardi The simplicity of the proposed method for calculating thermal constants and the small errors with which they can be estimated allow the widespread use of the models for efficiently managing populations of the two xylophagous cerambycids under study.

Managers in these regions commonly monitor fall cankerworm population trends using sticky band traps and use established thresholds relating the number of individuals captured to defoliation as a decision‐making tool. For this pest, defoliation thresholds were established based on large forest tracts, although these may yield inaccurate predictions in urban and suburban landscapes. Analyses of defoliation and fall cankerworm sticky band traps in Fairfax County, Virginia, U.S.A. , indicate that trees with &gt;200 female moths have &gt;50% probability of being defoliated at moderate or greater intensity. This threshold is much larger than the threshold of 45 females previously established for large forest tracts, and a statistical model based on this established threshold proved an extremely poor fit to the data. In addition, we found little spatial correlation in fall cankerworm abundance among trap locations, in contrast to an established rule of thumb proposing that one trap per 40 ha can estimate fall cankerworm abundance for areas over 400 ha. These findings highlight the importance of the ecological context in which management recommendations are made.",

Using 10 microsatellite loci, we studied the genetic diversity and differentiation of 13 geographical populations. A total of 79 alleles were detected, with an average of 7.900 alleles per locus. The gene flow and genetic differentiation rate values at the 10 loci varied from 0.376 to 1.560 and 13.8–39.9%, with averages of 0.774% and 24.4%, respectively. Among the 13 populations, the effective number of alleles and observed heterozygosity ranged from 1.865 to 2.848 and 0.457 to 0.646, respectively. Shannon's information index ranged from 0.684 to 1.104. In all comparisons, the fixation index (FST) values ranged from 0.021 to 0.463, with a total FST value of 0.228 among the 13 populations, indicating a moderate level of genetic differentiation among these populations. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that the genetic variation within populations accounted for 67.7% of the total genetic variation. Using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean cluster analysis, 13 populations were clustered into three distinct genetic groups. The pattern of the three concentrated groups from principal component analysis showed a similar result to cluster, although some individuals interpenetrated with one another.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agricultural intensification leads to wide ranging changes in habitats along with reduction in nesting site availability and flower resources for wild pollinators. Yet, little is known about the impact of these changes on functional traits of communal ground‐nesting bees. This study assesses the abundance and body size of a common and widespread North American ground‐nesting bee, Agapostemon virescens , throughout three consecutive years at three land use types: (i) unmowed meadows, (ii) conventional pesticide use and mowed agricultural and (iii) organic pesticide‐free mowed landscapes. We found no difference in abundance among the three land use types, but body size of spring bees was smaller at farmlands than meadow sites. Body size also varied among years, and bees were smaller in years that followed warm and dry summer seasons. Spring bees were particularly small at organic farms in years following dry and warm summers. Our results suggest that the smaller size of overwintering bees at agricultural lands could compromise their long‐term survival. This study indicates that a higher frequency of dry and warm summers as a consequence of climate change can impede bee populations in the future.",

The lower delta of the Paraná River contains the main Argentine Salicaceae production, strongly attacked by Acromyrmex lundii and Acromyrmex ambiguus . Nevertheless, there is no damage quantification in willow plantations attributed to leaf‐cutting ant species. In an area without leaf‐cutting ant control, we installed 15 blocks with eight willow stakes each: four clones × two treatments; with and without leaf‐cutting ant exclusion. We used two traditional (Americano, Nigra 4) and two new (Géminis, Yaguareté) commercial clones. During 2014–2018, we measured the damaged foliage, height and diameter of each tree. Foliage was damaged intensely during the first 2 years. After 1537 days, the loss in height and diameter was greater in Americano (70%), followed by Géminis (50%–60%), Yaguareté (40%–50%) and Nigra 4 (45%–40%). Stake survival with exclusion was greater (&gt;80%) than stakes without exclusion (&lt;50%). Total loss of wood volume was 93% for Americano, followed by Géminis (77%), Yaguareté (66%) and Nigra 4 (51%). Although the new clones were heavily attacked, they produced two to three times more wood volume than Americano; replacing Americano with the new clones would help to reduce leaf‐cutting ants impact on plantations and pesticides released into the environment.",

Though the presence of these spiders in proximity to agriculture is dependent on the availability of suitable leaves for their egg deposition, their preference for different plant species and habitat types has not been fully investigated. Candy‐striped spiders were observed in leaf‐rolls during transect surveys of semi‐natural habitats (hedgerow, woodland and grassland) adjacent to oilseed rape fields at 10 sites across northeast England in August and September 2021. The local plant community was surveyed and compared against the leaves used by candy‐striped spiders via null models. Candy‐striped spiders preferentially deposited their eggs in hedgerow, demonstrating relative avoidance of woodland and grassland. They exhibited preference for bramble, common nettle and hogweed leaves, but also used those of dock, ash and blackthorn. Candy‐striped spiders appeared to preferentially use leaves with roughly equal length and width and avoided longer, narrower leaves irrespective of their total size. The leaves used by candy‐striped spiders are taxonomically broad, but share some morphological commonalities. Candy‐striped spiders exhibit some degree of generalism, regularly utilizing suboptimal leaves in sites lacking their preferences. The availability of preferred plants for these spiders in agriculturally proximate semi‐natural habitat may enhance their possible contribution to biocontrol.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Symphyta is the most basal sub‐order of the Hymenoptera and includes the woodwasps, horntails and sawflies, many of which are pests. Adults are generally short‐lived and as a result males and females experience strong selection to rapidly find a mate and females to find oviposition sites. Mate‐searching typically relies on visual and olfactory stimuli such as sexually dimorphic morphology (i.e., body parts used in signalling) and pheromones. Here we review the available literature on the chemical and visual ecology of the Symphyta with potential for use in survey and detection programmes. Stimuli reviewed include but are not limited to sex pheromones, larval defensive compounds, plant kairomones and colour preferences. Sex pheromones are known for 19 species of Symphyta and show shared evolutionary patterns in chemistry, production site and ecological role. In general, sex pheromones in the Symphyta are female‐produced, oxidized cuticular hydrocarbons and yellow traps capture more individuals than other colours, although exceptions do exist. More work is needed to expand on these and identify new patterns in the visual and chemical ecology of the Symphyta.",

We observed the parasitism rates caused by parasitoids of Atta sexdens and analysed whether there is seasonality in the occurrence of parasitism and studied the effects of climatic factors on parasitism rates. Atta sexdens foragers were collected during 24 months from an area in the Atlantic Forest and the parasitism rate was calculated. Path analysis was used to identify and quantify the direct and indirect effects between parasitism rates and climatic factors. The mean parasitism rate was 5.8%, with Apocephalus attophilus accounting for 4.2%, Eibesfeldtphora spp. 1.4% and Myrmosicarius grandicornis 0.2%. Parasitism of A. attophilus and Eibesfeldtphora spp. increased as temperature decreased. The effect of relative humidity was significant and negative on Eibesfeldtphora spp. and M. grandicornis , whereas the effect of rainfall was significant and positive on M. grandicornis . We conclude that there is a seasonal pattern in the occurrence of parasitism by A. attophilus and that temperature is the main climatic variable associated with the fluctuation of parasitism, where the peaks occur in winter, followed by spring and autumn, and the lowest rates were in the summer.",

We investigated the effects of undestroyed strips of winter cover crops in maize fields on carabid community composition, and on the distribution of three ecological traits: diet, wing status and body size. We found that the community composition and the distribution of ecological traits in the in‐field cover crop strips had commonalities with both adjacent cropped areas and field margins. Some species were recorded mostly or only in the strips indicating that strips could support carabid species and help increase local diversity from the first year of establishment. The activity‐density of Poecilus cupreus and Pterostichus melanarius was higher in the cropped proximity of the strip, and the body size was influenced by the distance from the strip. Our results suggest that carabid communities are shaped by the habitat type, but the influence of such agroecological infrastructures on communities of adjacent crops is minor beyond a distance of 10 m. However, overall species abundance was increased and thus potentially provided enhanced pest regulation.",

The aim of our study was to model the expansion of O. communa and the number of generations in the various Palearctic regions. Furthermore, our objective was to determine the effect of the prevailing wind on the direction of its spread and to ascertain the relationship between the green biomass production of ragweed and individual numbers of this leaf beetle. According to our meta‐analytical findings, the advancement of O. communa is continuous in the Palearctic areas. This phytophagous insect invades new habitats, which are occupied by A. artemisiifolia , and spreads quickly. The stable populations of O. communa seem to be strictly linked to the presence of its primary host, A. artemisiifolia . We show that the rapid spread of this insect is due to the combination of wind direction and topography features, which was reinforced by our analysis. O. communa possesses uniformly multivoltine populations in its Palearctic habitats. So, insects possessing facultative diapause are able to colonize northern areas depending on the presence of their host, which statement is based on the processing of 143 East‐ and 68 West‐Palearctic records According to our investigations, the mass appearance of this phytophagous insect coincided with the assimilation peak of its main host, common ragweed.",

(Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) over the last 80 years. Earlier studies have found differential responses to temperature between the host and its parasitoid and demonstrated the multiple ways in which the parasitoid is more susceptible to elevated temperatures. Using data from experimental studies, the modelling package CLIMEX was used to investigate the suitability of current climates for the host and its parasitoid and the effects on their potential global geographical distributions. The study was then extended to investigate possible changes to these distributions that might result under different climate change scenarios by 2080. The models predict that the global distributions of both the host and parasitoid will be reduced. These changes will not be proportionate and many areas in tropical, sub‐tropical, and temperate regions that are currently suitable for D. semiclausum are predicted to become unsuitable for the parasitoid, whereas retaining suitability for P. xylostella . The seasonal dynamics of both the host and parasitoid are also predicted to be significantly reshaped under climate change. Analysis of associations between annual P. xylostella outbreaks and weather conditions in three provinces in China with field data collected between 1995 and 2017 indicated significant effects of temperature on P. xylostella outbreaks at the beginning of the peak season in warmer provinces where P. xylostella can overwinter; such associations were not found in the colder provinces where it is unable to survive harsh winters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Korla fragrant pear ( Pyrus sinkiangensis Yü) depends on cross‐pollination by honeybees ( Apis mellifera ) but may suffer from low honeybee visitation. We assessed whether honeybee abundance and visitation frequency are enhanced by using synthetic Nasonov gland pheromone (NGP), which is naturally produced by worker bees to stimulate the aggregation of bees to food resources or nesting sites. The response of honeybees to synthetic NGP was firstly assessed using Y‐tube olfactometer tests in the laboratory, and subsequently in the field, by placing NGP lures on Korla fragrant pear trees in orchards with and without beehives. Honeybee abundance was assessed using coloured pan traps while honeybee visits were assessed by visual observations on pear flowers. Y‐tube olfactometer tests showed a significant preference of honeybees for NGP. In pear orchards with beehives, honeybee abundance was 2.5‐fold higher on trees with NGP lures than on trees without NGP, and 2.2‐fold higher in orchards in which all trees contained NGP lures than in orchards without NGP lures. Such positive effects were not observed in orchards without beehives. Flower visitation by honeybees was significantly higher in trees with NGP lures than without NGP lures, irrespective of the presence (5.7‐fold higher) or absence of beehives (27.6‐fold higher). In mixed pear‐apricot orchards, honeybee abundance was higher in pear trees with NGP lures than without lures. Our results show that NGP lures attract honeybees to flowering pear trees in monoculture pear and mixed pear‐apricot orchards, and that this effect is greatest in orchards with beehives.",

Vector‐borne pathogens are often transmitted by generalist insects that move between non‐crop and crop hosts. Insect vectors can have wide diet breadths, but it is often unknown which hosts serve as pathogen reservoirs and which non‐crop host harbours the highest density of vectors. In the Pacific Northwest USA, the pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum) is a key virus vector in pulse crops. Despite pea aphid having a large number of potential non‐crop plant hosts occuring in the region, no reservoir has yet been identified for the economically‐costly pathogen Pea Enation Mosaic Virus (PEMV). We addressed these issues by linking field surveys of an aphid vector and plant virus with statistical models to develop risk assessments for common non‐crop legumes; in 2018, we completed a 65‐site survey where aphids were surveyed in weedy legumes within and outside dry pea fields. We quantified the abundance of pea aphids on 17 hosts, and plant tissue was tested for PEMV. Relatively high densities of A. pisum were found in habitats dominated by hairy vetch (Vicia villosa), which was the only legume other than cultivated dry pea where PEMV was detected. Our results indicate that V. villosa is a key alternative host for PEMV, and that pest management practices in this region should consider the distribution and abundance of this weedy host in viral disease mitigation efforts for pulses.",

However, few studies have explored how long‐lasting this effect is and how it affects saproxylic beetles. Ten years after cutting, we investigated effects of different release cutting levels (high, medium, and no release) around 140‐year‐old retained oaks in a commercial forest with Norway spruce ( Picea abies ). We evaluated oak vitality using crown and dead wood measurements. Saproxylic beetles were caught in window traps, identified to species level, and grouped according to their association with oak and/or Norway spruce. Released oaks had more light, higher temperatures, greater crown growth, and less dead wood in the crown compared to the no‐release control. After 10 years we still found a higher abundance of oak‐associated beetles and higher overall species richness of saproxylic beetles in the released oaks. Beetle species composition significantly differed between released oaks and control. We suggest avoiding planting trees beneath retained oaks when regenerating conifer forests and to proceed with conservation management during subsequent thinning by removing regeneration under the oak crowns. We emphasize the benefits of monitoring the retained oaks to maintain tree vitality, habitat quality, and insolation.",

To establish that contact pheromones are involved in mate recognition of C. welensii , we extracted the cuticular hydrocarbons by solid phase microextraction at pre‐reproductive, beginning and ending of the reproductive period, and by solvent extraction of prothorax and elytra. The extracts were analysed by GC–MS under electron impact and chemical ionization conditions. Cuticular hydrocarbon profiles varied according to the reproductive period, although differences between sexes were not significant. Two compounds, 11/13‐methylheptacosane and 11‐methylnonacosane were more abundant in females at the beginning and ending of the reproductive periods. Compound 11/13‐methylheptacosane was also more representative in female prothorax than in males, and 2‐methyloctacosane was richer in male elytra than in females. We also studied the role of cuticular hydrocarbons in mate recognition in arena bioassays. Treatment of solvent‐washed dead females and glass dummies with one female equivalent (FE) of cuticular extract elicited mating responses in males, especially at the beginning of the reproductive period, with copulation attempts reaching 61.9% on solvent‐washed dead females and 23.8% on dummies. The successive treatment with synthetic compounds approaching a male cuticular profile inhibited male response. Our results confirm that contact pheromones mediate mate recognition in C. welensii . Knowledge of the precise role played by the major compounds 11/13‐methylheptacosane and 11‐methylnonacosane and other minor compounds representative in female prothorax may contribute to the development of novel management strategies against C. welensii .",

    "abstract": "Abstract Spring phenological synchrony can be important for tree‐insect interactions. Depending on the magnitude and direction of phenological shifts, overwintering insects could be affected in many ways, for example, facing starvation or having to contend with increased chemical or physical defences of host trees. If temperature has different influences on the phenology of trees and insects, climate change can alter spring phenological synchrony. In this experiment, we exposed tamarack seedlings and larch case bearer larvae from Minnesota, USA, to a variety of chilling and forcing temperatures and measured spring phenology (twig bud break and larval activation). We additionally measured case bearer performance on seedlings that were exposed to different forcing × chilling levels, tracking larval survivorship to adulthood. Warmer forcing enhanced larval activation and bud break, but larval development slowed down past 21°C. Higher chilling temperatures accelerated bud break, but the effect was inconclusive for larvae. There was no chilling × forcing interaction for either species. Spring activity accelerated more quickly with increases in temperature for larvae than for seedlings, resulting in increased phenological synchrony at warmer temperatures. Activation rates for overwintering larvae were highest at 27°C, while survivorship to adulthood following spring activation was highest at 21°C. At temperatures at or beyond 27°C, no larvae reached adulthood. Warmer winters and springs will likely initially increase spring synchrony between tamarack and larch case bearer, exposing larvae to younger, potentially more nutritious foliage, but extremely warm spring temperatures may decrease survivorship of larvae to adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Abstract After non‐native herbivores arrive in a novel habitat and establish, they must then disperse to new host plants to continue invading. While flight‐capable insect herbivores can expand their non‐native ranges by flying to new hosts, insects that lack wings, such as female scale insects, are often aided in their spread by wind and phoretic dispersal vectors such as birds and mammals. After being detected in 2004 in a Texas nursery, crapemyrtle bark scale (CMBS), Acanthococcus lagerstroemiae (Kuwana) (Hemiptera: Eriococcidae), has established in 15 different states across the Southeast and Middle Atlantic regions of the USA. We quantified the wind speeds leading to scale insect dislodgement and, in the laboratory and field, evaluated the willingness of CMBS nymphs to crawl onto vector proxies (bird feathers and mammal fur). Our findings demonstrate that CMBS nymphs can become dislodged from ecologically relevant substrates at low wind speeds (~7 m/s) and provided evidence that CMBS nymphs willingly, though not preferentially, crawl onto vector proxies, a final step before dispersing phoretically. Our results indicate that trees with high‐density infestations of CMBS are frequent sources of propagules, given that (i) wind speeds that shake small tree branches are likely to dislodge active crawlers and (ii) active crawlers appear willing to walk onto birds and mammals. The apparent ease of between‐tree spread by CMBS via multiple modes of dispersal presents challenges for preventing the spread of this insect, but field confirmation of these mechanisms is needed to understand their relative importance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Leaf‐cutting ants (LCAs) cause significant damage to forest plantations and are mainly managed by broad‐spectrum synthetic insecticides. In Patagonia, Pinus ponderosa (Pinales: Pinaceae) (Douglas 1836) and Pinus contorta (Pinales: Pinaceae) (Dluglas 1838) are the predominant pine species in forest plantations. Previous research has shown that dehydrated citrus pulp is an LCAs attractant, and tea tree essential oil acts as an LCAs repellent. We evaluated the use of dehydrated citrus pulp and tea tree oil to manage LCAs behaviour in a push–pull setting, using mixed pine species in small plot fields, to reduce the LCA Acromyrmex lobicornis (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) (Emery, 1888) damage in young P. ponderosa plants. We combined the treatment with attractant and repellent in a mono‐specific plantation design (three ponderosa plants surrounded with pulp and three sprayed with tea tree extract) or mixed plantation designs (three contorta plants with pulp and three ponderosa plants with tea tree). The combination of both mono‐specific and mixed plantations with push–pull stimuli delayed discovery and decreased the damage in pines sprayed with the repellent. Mono‐specific as well as mixed species designs were equally effective, reducing ant damage and increasing ~50% the survival probability of P. ponderosa when push–pull stimuli were applied. The use of a push–pull strategy with plant‐based compounds provides potential as a management tool that reduces and delays LCA damage in pine trees.",

Rice plants previously infested in the laboratory with BPH eggs were exposed to natural parasitism and predation in experimental fields for periods of 5 days. 3 Egg batches were dissected from both experimental and control plants after field exposure at seven fortnightly intervals through the rice growing season and BPH nymphs and adult parasitoids were allowed to emerge. 4 Parasitism by species of Oligosita (Hymenopera, Trichogrammatidae) and Anagrus (Hym., Mymaridae) varied between 18% and 61% in dry, and from 1% to 65% in wet, seasons. There was generally a trend from low to higher rates through wet seasons, contrasting with more uniform higher levels through dry seasons. 5 Reduction in BPH survival as a result of egg parasitism varied between 29% and 91%. Generally parasitism was density independent. 6 It is suggested that lower initial levels of parasitism in dry seasons may be due to the longer fallow period between dry and wet, than between wet and dry, resulting in lower local populations of appropriate natural enemies. 7 Unlike previous studies in Asia, little evidence was found for egg predation as an important mortality factor. 8 The conservation of egg parasitoids should form part of any rice pest management programmes in tropical Asia.",

The main damage caused by D. citri is due to sooty mould, which colonizes the sweet secretions of this pest. 2 Using Taylor’s Power Law to describe the variance–mean relationship, the dispersion of the citrus whitefly was found to be aggregated at all developmental stages. The action threshold was estimated using regression of sooty mould level on egg or larval counts. 3 Two‐stage sampling plans were constructed in different pest generations, for eggs and larval stages, on the basis of the variance between leaves on a tree and the variance between trees in a plot. 4 Fixed sample size plans were prepared, with possible numbers of trees and the numbers of leaves per tree to be sampled, in order to attain a given precision level. 5 Sequential sampling plans were also drawn up, on the basis of four leaves per tree, where trees are sampled until a decision can be reached. The maximum number of trees to be sampled was set according to the corresponding fixed sample size plan. 6 Simulation of the sequential sampling plans showed them to be highly reliable in terms of the decision reached with economy in sample size for high and low infestation levels.",

Apical growth was significantly lower in infested than in control trees 2 years following the graft. 4 Deformed apical buds were left early by mites, which dispersed in the crown and may have incurred high mortality. This is interpreted as a defensive reaction of the cypress to the mite attack, which involves costs resulting in reduced apical growth in both clones. However, mites partly overcame tree defences in the Bolgheri clone. 5 Healthy rootstock and graft material should be used to limit damage and maintain plant growth because natural infestations rarely occur. In case of attack, a pesticide should be applied as soon as possible because precocious mite infestation has a log‐lasting effect on tree growth, with considerable economic damage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It is widely known that many bark and wood‐boring beetle species use nonresistant coarse woody debris (CWD) created by disturbances; however, the ability of these secondary species to cause mortality in healthy trees following a build‐up of their populations remains unclear. We characterized the pattern of colonization by Ips pini (Say) following a major ice storm that created large amounts of CWD varying in resistance to colonization (i.e. ranging from snapped tops with no resistance to heavily damaged trees with intact root systems). A major question was how the beetles responded to the different types of storm‐damaged material and whether healthy undamaged trees were colonized and killed following increases in beetle populations. Six red pine, Pinus resinosa Ait., plantations in eastern Ontario were monitored from 1998 to 2001 inclusive: three with high storm damage (approximately 120 m 3 /ha CWD) and three with minimal damage (approximately 20 m 3 /ha CWD). Transects (200 × 2 m) were sampled yearly in each plantation to assess the type and amount of damaged pine brood material colonized by the pine engraver beetle, I. pini. Beetles preferentially infested the most nonresistant material available each year (i.e. all snapped tops in year 1, all standing snags, up‐rooted trees and many bent trees by year 2, but still less than 50% of trees blown over but with intact root systems by year 3). By years 3 and 4, the majority (approximately 75%) of severely damaged trees (with &gt; 50% crown loss) died prior to beetle colonization. The size of the beetle population tracked the abundance of available woody material from year‐to‐year within a plantation; populations were very large in the first 2 years, and declined significantly in the last 2 years. Healthy standing red pines were apparently resistant to colonization by the beetles, despite the significant build‐up in their populations. Hence, the results of the present study suggest that native bark beetle populations will not cause further tree mortality following such a disturbance in this region.",

We hypothesized that aerial spray of Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. kurstaki ( Btk ) could affect the biological performance of the surviving spruce budworm ( Choristoneura fumiferana Clem.) populations and their progenies and that Btk sublethal effects could be widened by other types of stress (i.e. temperature conditions and changes in food suitability from year to year). The results from a 3‐year field experiment indicated that Btk treatments decreased the fitness of the surviving larvae whatever the prevailing temperature and nutritional conditions. The detrimental Btk effects on the parental generation carried over to the offspring. The percent of egg hatch and first‐instar survival were negatively affected by Btk whatever other stress spruce budworm parents underwent. The present study also highlighted the fact that the effects of temperature and nutritional stress suffered by the parents could carry over to the next generation. Balsam fir flowering, which provided larvae with pollen rich in nitrogen, favoured both the parental generation and the fitness of their offspring. Spruce budworm mothers allocated to their progenies large amounts of energy reserves (triglycerides and glycogen) that greatly enhanced the survival of the early stages. Egg hatch and the survival of first‐instar larval progeny were drastically affected when their parents had reduced larval growth as a result of exposure to cool temperatures that had desynchronized insect and bud phenology. Budworm mothers submitted to negative impacts of previous defoliation allocated low amounts of energy reserves to their progeny. This lack of energy associated with unfavourable temperature conditions (i.e. high temperatures in late summer and in early fall and an extended cool period in spring) drastically reduced survival of diapausing second‐instar larvae. These results highlight the importance of considering the various sources of stress when attempting to evaluate the impact of a control agent on an insect pest population and its progenies.",

Phloem temperature and moisture were recorded over the duration of the experiment and, at the end of the field experiment, logs were dissected and galleries were measured to gauge beetle reproductive success. 3 As sunlight exposure increased, phloem temperatures increased and potentially lethal temperatures were often reached in the high‐sunlight exposure but seldom in the low‐sunlight. Smaller diameter logs had drier phloem than larger diameter logs. All logs dried with time but sunlight level did not affect desiccation rates. Ips pini preferred attacking larger logs and the bottom side of logs. Sunlight exposure had a significant effect on net reproductive success in smaller diameter logs, with very little net reproductive success in high‐sunlight exposed logs, and the highest reproductive success was found in small diameter logs in the low‐sunlight treatments. 4 Management implications of these results are discussed.",

The chrysomelid Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte is such an invasive pest. It has been the main pest of continuous maize in the U.S.A. for more than 60 years and is currently spreading throughout Europe. 2 In the area with a long history of this pest (Central and North America), scientific knowledge concerning the ecology of this pest has accumulated over the last decades. This resource is of great importance to both America and Europe and has to be gathered, shared and adapted to new situations. We therefore examined, both qualitatively and quantitatively, the scientific literature relating to D. virgifera virgifera ecology. 3 The quantitative analysis suggests that research on D. virgifera virgifera ecology is still in its infancy in Europe and suffers from geographical barriers (between Europe and North America and between linguistic areas within Europe) and that scientific communication should be strengthened both between North America and Europe and within Europe. 4 As a first solution to this problem, we introduce three companion review articles that constitute a landmark for D. virgifera virgifera research, enabling European and American scientists and decision‐makers to orient themselves and discover new opportunities for research. We also stress that international research cooperation is the most important key to successfully manage invasive species.",

Surveys carried out around 260 pheromone traps as part of the U.K. OPM control programme, however, reveal a consistent linear relationship between square‐root transformed adult males per trap and cube‐root (or log 10 ) transformed numbers of larval nests ( r 2 = 0.47; P &lt; 0.001) In 91% of cases where traps captured no adult males, there were no OPM nests within 250 m and, where nests were present, the numbers of nests were low. Traps that captured more than 10–20 males were associated with counts of ≥ 50 larval nests. Defoliation and risks to human health from OPM are more closely related to nest density (i.e. the numbers of nests per tree). Consequently, identifying trap catches that might initiate a management response also requires information on the number of oak trees in the surrounding area.",

We used three types of traps in each of 36 plots: multidirectional flight interception traps measured adult beetle flight activity within stands, trunk window traps measured visitation rates at trees and emergence traps measured beetle colonization of trees. Flight traps in nondefoliated plots allowed characterization of ‘pre‐outbreak’ beetle assemblages, which were not discernable in emergence traps because few insects colonize heathy trees. ‘Pre‐outbreak’ assemblages, characterized by a mix of polyphagous beetle species (e.g. Evodinus monticola , Dryocoetes autographus ), shifted to those dominated by Trypodendron lineatum after extensive defoliation. Two Pissodes species colonized heavily defoliated trees but not dead ones. Defoliation level, conifer basal area, basal area of dead balsam firs and the extent of recently logged areas around sampling plots were positively correlated with the abundance of T. lineatum .",

Survival rates of overwintering eonymphs exposed to different sub‐zero temperatures above the SCP (−1.6 °C and −4.0 °C for 10, 20 and 30 days and −10.5 °C for 9 days) ranged between 89.2% and 100%, suggesting that A. leucopoda is not a chill‐susceptible species. Our results suggest that low winter temperatures may not be expected to be an important limiting factor for the overwintering success of A. leucopoda .",

To date, however, little is known about why those bees can tolerate human disturbances. Here we hypothesized that wild bees living in human‐altered habitats could achieve their nesting resources and floral resources. Moreover, persistent provision of those resources could enhance their populations. The foraging areas of solitary, cavity‐nesting bees Anthophora waltoni were determined in two agricultural ecosystems with rich bee populations. The influences of seminatural habitats, nesting resources and farmlands on A. waltoni visit density were assessed by modelling bee density against landscape factors in 17 agricultural ecosystems. Moreover, temporal availabilities of those resources were measured across the last three decades. A. waltoni used vetch fields and field margins, instead of seminatural habitats, as foraging areas. The area of brick walls and the area of farmlands, as well as their temporal increases, synergistically positively influenced A. waltoni visit density on vetch flowers. The percentage of buildings and farmlands increased across the last three decades in spite of a slowdown in 5‐year growth of brick walls. The results demonstrated the synergistically positive effects of nesting resources and floral resources, as well as persistent provisions of those resources, on A. waltoni populations in agricultural ecosystems. A. waltoni could live in the human‐altered habitats because they persistently achieved their nesting resources and floral resources.",

Hemlock seedlings were manually infested with equal densities of A. tsugae and placed into artificial shade treatments (0%, 40% and 80% shade). The density of settled nymphs of the ensuing generation on shaded seedlings was three times higher than the density on unshaded seedlings. Adelges tsugae ovisacs were also attached to hydrated hemlock branches placed beneath acrylic filter treatments that selectively allowed transmission of various sunlight wavelengths. The proportion of adelgid crawlers that settled on the branch ( vs . dropping from it) was higher beneath filters that blocked the widest spectrum of solar radiation (opaque and amber filters) than beneath full sun. In the March‐April trial, exposure to full sun and the full visible spectrum only (clear‐UV filter) significantly increased the proportion of crawlers that settled on the bottom ( vs . top) side of the branch. Our results suggest that A. tsugae crawlers are negatively phototactic and/or thermotactic, with behaviour influenced more by visible light than ultraviolet light.",

We assessed the species richness, abundance, and diversity of wild bees (Apiformes), including species of various functional groups in two contrasting and differently managed landscape types. For this study, we selected 15 xerothermic or sandy grasslands or extensively managed fresh meadows located in agricultural landscapes as well as 15 old fields located in wooded landscapes. The study sites differed in area, stage of succession, and management regime. We did not detect any significant differences in total species richness, abundance, and diversity of Apiformes between the two landscape types, which suggests that both semi‐natural habitats and old fields are highly attractive to bees. The two habitat types, however, differed in species composition and proportions of functional groups. We found that in wooded landscapes, eusocial, hive‐nesting, and large‐sized species increased in abundance. The collected information on the preferences of Apiformes in respect of various habitats and landscapes makes it possible to protect and restore valuable habitats through the implementation of suitable methods of management, both locally and on the scale of landscapes.",

Although primary host plants of this native species remain unknown, these are central to testing hypotheses concerning the outbreak. We hypothesized that this species has undergone a host plant shift (i.e. a feeding association with a novel host plant). We compared δ 13 C and δ 15 N ratios of adult beetles retrieved from South African museum collections, collected between 1891 and 2016 ( n = 23; ‘pre‐outbreak’), with samples from infested fields in 2017 ( n = 9, ‘post‐outbreak’) and in 2019 ( n = 23, ‘post‐outbreak’), as well as diverse, plausible host plants ( n = 42 samples across 10 species) from infested fields and surrounding patches of indigenous and commercial forest vegetation. We used Bayesian isotope mixing models to infer the relative contribution of the different plants to the diet of C. newmannii . Pre‐outbreak, C 3 plants contributed strongly to the larval diet, whereas post‐outbreak, C 4 plants were the largest component of their diet. There was some indication of C 4 plants contributing to their diet pre‐outbreak. Our results suggest that the outbreak of this polyphagous beetle was not a dramatic host shift but rather a rapid increase in the proportion of C 4 plants already in their diet. We concluded that plants from the families Fabaceae and Poaceae are the most likely host plants of this species. Nevertheless, the drivers of this rapid outbreak on sugarcane remain poorly determined and should be the focus of future research.",

These two species are important rootstocks for the citrus industry and display differential resistance to Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), with sour orange showing elevated levels of constitutive and induced resistance associated with the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway compared with Cleopatra mandarin. P. latus infestation activated both the JA‐ and the salicylic acid‐dependent pathways in sour orange but not in Cleopatra mandarin. However, this differential activation resulted in the production of similar volatile blends (a mixture of green leaf volatiles and aromatic compounds). Contrary to T. urticae infestation, sour orange supported larger densities of P. latus than Cleopatra mandarin with similar injury levels. Therefore, sour orange may be more tolerant to P. latus than Cleopatra mandarin.",

Although planting of Milicia progenies resistant to Phytolyma attack has been identified as an opportunity for long‐term control of the pest, the absence of biomarkers for early detection of resistance has limited the selection of resistant seedlings for planting. We compared phenolic metabolites and oxidative enzymes in resistant and susceptible Milicia progenies with the aim of identifying potential biomarkers for resistance to Phytolyma ‐induced galling in seedlings. Levels of total phenolics and ortho ‐dihydroxyphenolics did not significantly differ between the susceptible and resistant saplings or among seedlings. Similarly, peroxidase activity did not differ among sapling progenies or among seedlings. Thus, no clearly defined role could be ascribed to phenolics and peroxidase in resistance of Milicia species to P. lata ‐induced galling. However, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity was over two‐fold higher in the resistant than the tolerant or susceptible progenies, suggesting that higher levels of PPO activity corresponded with an increased level of resistance to galling. With further validation, PPO activity in leaves of Milicia seedlings can be used as a biomarker of resistance to Phytolyma ‐induced galling.",

Using locations of OPM larval nests, supplied by the Forestry Commission and recorded as part of ongoing surveillance and control measures from 2006 onwards, we show that the expansion of the range of OPM in South‐East England up to 2019 was biphasic with a higher rate of expansion from 2015 onwards. The maximum rate of OPM range expansion in the United Kingdom from 2006 to 2014 was estimated as 1.66 km/year (95% CI = [1.22, 2.09]), whereas the 2015–2019 expansion rate was estimated as 6.17 km/year (95% CI = [5.49, 6.84]). This corresponds to an estimated species range distribution area of 7077 km 2 in 2019. To explain the faster expansion of OPM range from 2015 onwards, we discuss potential reasons that include: natural capability of species of both short‐ and long‐distance dispersal; external factors such as environmental heterogeneity; a reduction of active control.",

One buprestid species, not native to North America yet new to science, Agrilus sp. 9895, was discovered. The combination of new state records, new host associations and new species detections illustrates how this survey method can be effective and beneficial for detection purposes.",

Damage on a mango can reach 100% in late varieties, and on shea fruits, the average attack rate is 66.5%. Parasitoids offer natural biocontrol services, but the potential for this in Burkina Faso remains unknown. We performed a survey (2017–2019) in three plant formations (natural fallows n = 6; agroforestry parks n = 6 and mango orchards n = 6) to determine the levels of parasitism of tephritid fruit fly pests. For this purpose, fruits from cultivated and wild fruit fly host plant species were sampled in these plant formations and incubated for insects' emergence. In total, 1822 adults belonging to 7 parasitoid species were found. Fopius caudatus (Szépligeti) and Psyttalia concolor (Szépligeti) with 51.47% and 30.60% of the total of parasitoid adults emerged, respectively, were the most predominant. Parasitism rate varied according to host fruit species. Pupae recorded from Sarcocephalus latifolius and Vitellaria paradoxa were most parasitized (27.22% ± 3.96%) and (17.08% ± 2.37%), respectively, while those obtained from mangoes were the less parasitized (3.73% ± 0.91%). Mass rearing of F. caudatus and P. concolor , as well as habitat management, will contribute to the promotion of both, augmentation and conservation biological control.",

It is a traditional agronomic practice and is still prevalent in modern Chinese agricultural ecosystems. Many studies have proposed that intercropping at the crop species level can significantly contribute to pest management when properly managed. However, the performance of intercropping at the plant genotype level is still largely unknown. A multiyear field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of intraspecies Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt)/non-Bt crop mixture on nontarget arthropods. Densities of dominant pests and predators were assessed via direct visual observations. Cotton aphid population levels in monoculture Bt cotton fields were greater than that observed in non-Bt cotton, whereas the row-mixture planting of Bt and non-Bt suppressed the abundance of cotton aphids compared with that in monoculture of either genotype. Investigations also demonstrated that the intraspecies row-mixture increased whitefly abundance compared with monoculture of either genotype. However, the mixture exerted neutral effects on population sizes of mirid bugs and predators. These results suggest that crop cultivation management is insufficient to control secondary pests of Bt cotton, and thus multiple pest suppression strategies are warranted.",

Land‐use change has the potential to affect insect pest–natural enemy interactions.

Such a land‐use change raises the question of its effects on the biological control of insect pests. The proximity of varying vegetation types around agroecosystems is expected to influence species fitting differently and hence the population dynamics of insect pests and their biological control.

The present study identified a decreased density of stemborers and infestation rates on maize as a result of an increased larval/pupal parasitism in wild habitats as the amount of grasses increased in the landscape. This effect was attributed to an increased parasitoid diversity subsequent to the settlement of an abundant and diverse stemborer community in wild habitats.",

The extent to which risk in whitebark pine stands may be mitigated by predators or competitors is unknown. We compared the communities of coleopteran predators and competitors of D. ponderosae in sites of varying elevation and species composition in Montana and Wyoming, U.S.A. Sites were selected for low to moderate levels of tree mortality, where the potential of natural enemies to prevent D. ponderosae from transitioning into outbreaks would be most relevant. Insect populations were evaluated using unbaited flight‐intercept panel traps and pheromone‐baited multiple funnel traps. Only the predatory beetle species Thanasimus undatulus (Coleoptera: Cleridae) was captured in these non‐outbreak stands. Based on the pheromone‐baited traps, predator load was higher at low‐elevation stands dominated by lodgepole pine than high‐elevation stands dominated by whitebark pine. Phloeophagous insects were more prevalent in the mid‐ and higher‐elevation sites, although most of the species captured would not likely compete substantially for resources with D. ponderosae . We also observed differences in species assemblages between the Montana and Wyoming sites, as well as differing utilities of baited and unbaited traps at low versus moderate tree mortality levels.",

These results suggest that the environment substantially affects the emission of sex pheromone components from rubber septa. As a result, the demonstration of geographical biotypes of diamondback moths and other insects may be difficult.",

    "abstract": "Summary 1 Great spruce bark beetle Dendroctonus micans (Kug.) (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) has been subject to an Integrated Crop Management (ICM) regime in Great Britain since its first discovery in 1982. The elements of the ICM approach are sanitation felling of the initial infestations, restriction on movement of potentially infested conifers to prevent spread to uninfested parts of the country and biological control through rearing and release of the specific predatory beetle Rhizophagus grandis Gyll. (Coleoptera: Rhizophagidae). Such a programme carries costs that have to be evaluated against the benefits to the ICM strategy. 2 This paper presents a cost‐effectiveness analysis of three options – (i) continue with the current policy of restriction on movement of infested timber and use of the imported predator R. grandis , (ii) do nothing (i.e. drop all attempts to reduce the spread of D. micans ), or, (iii) introduce a new east–west Dendroctonus Micans Control Area (DMCA) to define the management area. Assumptions on rates of mortality and natural spread were based on research into D. micans in Britain’s spruce forests. 3 Appraisal indicated that the current policy was the most cost‐effective, even when subject to sensitivity analysis to test the limits of the assumptions included in the models. It is concluded that the current policy should remain in force.",

    "abstract": "Summary 1 This study investigated the effects of honeydew from aphids in the canopy of Norway spruce ( Picea abies (L.) Karst.) on the nitrogen chemistry of throughfall using a rainfall simulation experiment. Throughfall collected beneath infested trees was compared with that from beneath uninfested trees, while standardizing the quality and quantity of the precipitation and plant age. 2 Honeydew excreted by Cinara pilicornis (Hartig) and C . costata (Zett.) significantly increased the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and hexose‐C in throughfall. The average concentrations of nitrogenous compounds (NH 4 ‐N, NO 3 ‐N) in throughfall collected beneath infested trees were significantly lower than beneath uninfested trees. 3 Multiple regression analysis indicated that the amount of rain and NH 4 ‐N concentrations were the best predictors of the concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in throughfall. Parameters that were closely associated with the level of infestation (DOC, hexose‐C concentrations) did not have a direct relationship with DON. About 40% of the reduction in the concentration of DON in the throughfall was attributed to aphid–micro‐organism interactions. 4 Particle amino nitrogen (PAN)‐concentrations were highest under infested trees in July after aphid numbers had declined, indicating a concomitant decline in microbial biomass after honeydew becomes a limiting resource. 5 The comparison of the concentrations of different nitrogen compounds in throughfall of infested and uninfested trees indicated that aphids affect the carbon and nitrogen cycles in the phyllosphere by providing energy that fuels the metabolism of the micro‐organisms. These processes seem to occur very rapidly. 6 We discuss the significance of the results and the prospects of linking the ecology of micro‐organisms and herbivores with flows of nutrients through the canopy of trees.",

Field experiments in Java, Indonesia, are reported for 1993 and 1994. Plants previously infested with BPH eggs were put out in field cage‐enclosures, which, by means of different size mesh gauze covering, allowed either: (1) free access to all natural enemies, (2) access only to egg parasitoids, or (3) no access to any natural enemies. After one BPH generation (30 days), numbers of adults and gravid females were counted for each treatment. In addition, plants were dissected to determine the numbers of eggs laid. An additional treatment in which all natural enemies were excluded, but lycosid spiders were added, was used in 1994 experiments in an attempt to assess the effects of predators in the absence of egg parasitoids. Numbers of BPH adults and eggs laid were highest when natural enemies were excluded and lowest when they had free access. Mortality due to egg parasitoids in the absence of predators was intermediate and significantly different to the two other treatments. The effects of added predators in the absence of egg parasitoids gave variable results, but again clearly demonstrated the significance of egg parasitism in overall BPH mortality. The conservation of BPH egg parasitoids should form an important element of any rice pest management programme in tropical Asia.",

This effect was consistent among clones, and was not due to the absolute diameter of the rootstock or the scion. Trees with increased diameter‐growth at the root collar (e.g. some grafted trees) may have increased susceptibility to attack by H. warreni , or diameter‐growth at the root collar is affected by the attack.",

    "abstract": "Abstract 1 Pest management in organic systems is challenged by the paucity of options for direct interventions to control damaging populations compared with conventional agriculture. Consequently, a greater emphasis has to be placed on managing pest numbers through a rotation. In the present study, simulation modelling is used to evaluate the effects of different management options on populations of Tipula paludosa (leatherjackets) in organic rotations. 2 The growth of leatherjacket populations in grass was simulated over 5 years for different starting numbers. A significant risk of leatherjacket attack to subsequent crops can be avoided by limiting the fertility building phase of a rotation to a maximum of 2 years. 3 The effect of cultural control through additional cultivation interventions was compared in rotations comprising a grass/clover fertility building phase with host and/or nonhost crops. It is concluded that the effects are marginal and that prophylactic use cannot be recommended. 4 The prophylactic use of biological control agents in permanent grass and grass/arable rotations was investigated. Maximum population reductions in grass were achieved through annual autumn applications but the optimal economic strategy was less frequent than this. Application in the autumn preceding a spring‐sown arable crop provided the best risk reduction. 5 A model decision support system for the control of pests in organic systems using data for leatherjacket damage to spring barley is presented. Economic threshold concepts are used to define when cultural control (as additional cultivation) and biocontrol applications should be used. 6 The present study shows the potential benefits of simulation modelling for the rapid evaluation of a wide range of pest management options. Any conclusions drawn from such simulations, however, are provisional until they can be tested experimentally.",

This activity weakens the structural integrity of the tree, causing severe stem-breakage and mortality. Attacks are initiated by pioneer males that select a host tree and build short nuptial galleries to which they attract females using a sex pheromone. Volatiles emitted are composed of (+)-6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol [(+)-sulcatol], 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one (sulcatone) and 3-pentanol. Previously, we showed the potential of the strategy of pheromone-mediated mating disruption of M. mutatus in commercial poplar and hazelnut plantations in South America and Europe using polyethylene reservoir dispensers for pheromones and found that damage reduction was greater than 56% in all cases. In the present study, the polymeric reservoir dispensers were replaced by matrix dispensers made by dispersion of the pheromone in natural waxes or polyethylene glycols that act as a matrix with the addition of a filler. After treatment, the number of mating galleries was significantly higher (70%) in control than in treated areas. Using natural materials for dispensers, we confirmed that mating disruption is a viable tool for the management of M. mutatus in poplar plantations.",

    "abstract": "Expansion of biomass energy production using woody feedstocks is being accomplished through post-timber harvest removal of coarse woody debris > 10 cm. The effect of this management on forest Lepidoptera is poorly known. The present study aimed to determine whether forest lepidopteran diversity and species composition were affected by two silvicultural disturbances: timber harvest and post-logging removal of coarse woody debris > 10.0 cm in diameter. In 2014, Lepidoptera were sampled from nine forest stands subject to one of three management treatments: control (no manipulation at all), clear cut and partial retention of coarse woody debris (80% removal), and clear cut and complete removal of coarse woody debris. As expected, species richness and composition were significantly impacted by timber harvest. Subsequent removal of 80% or 100% coarse woody debris, however, did not affect specialists, detritivores and pollinators. The absence of an effect as a result of the removal of coarse woody debris could be a result of the limited number of replicate stands, small stand size and the limited range of retention treatments. We suggest, however, that retention of fine woody debris with a diameter < 10.0 cm and inclusion of unlogged stands in the forest landscape maintains some of the habitat elements necessary for Lepidoptera.",

When this occurs, the necessary switch to alternative control methods such as bait sprays and intensive fruit fly trapping will involve additional producer costs. The present study demonstrates that these costs are likely to exceed the costs of eradication using the sterile insect technique. Given this result, eradication cost sharing arrangements between government and industry are discussed that could produce mutual benefits in the long term.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Climate change affects the life cycle of many species. Yet, responses to yearly variation of weather can either help species track optimal conditions or be maladaptive. We analysed phenological data of 46,479 pine processionary moths ( Thaumetopoea pityocampa ) during 15 years along an altitudinal gradient in southern France. These larvae were sampled in situ and allowed to pupate in a common garden at lower elevation. Individuals originating from higher elevation emerged earlier than those sampled at low elevation, which suggests local adaptation. Yearly variations in temperature also affected phenology. Warm springs caused an earlier adult emergence, while autumn temperatures had an opposite effect. Environmental cues could thus induce contradictory plastic responses. Synchronization mechanisms were identified. Variability in the duration of the pupal phase is a key parameter to synchronize adult emergence in spite of different larval development rates that only marginally influenced emergence dynamics. Semivoltine individuals experiencing prolonged diapause were synchronized with univoltine individuals emerging the same year. These data highlight some contradiction in the effect of spatial versus temporal variations of the temperature on adult emergence. This suggests that phenological responses to the current climate change cannot easily be anticipated by space‐for‐time substitution designs.",

However, providing crops with nutrients can affect plant–insect interactions via bottom‐up effects. The South American tomato pinworm, Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae), is a main pest of tomato crops worldwide but little is known about the effects of macro‐elements fertilization inputs on its biological traits. 2. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of low, high and normal fertilization levels calcium, sulphur, nitrogen and potassium to tomato plants on T. absoluta development, survival and crop damage. 3. Larval mortality was lower in tomato plants fertilized with high sulphur fertilization level. The number of mines per leaf was not affected by calcium, sulphur and potassium fertilization, but low nitrogen input resulted in higher crop damage. Overall, our results indicate that nutritionally unbalanced tomato plants improve the biological performance of T. absoluta in comparison with balanced plants. 4. The results provide useful information that can be used in fertilization programmes of tomato and planning of strategies and tactics to reduce tomato suitability to T. absoluta . 5. In addition, the obtained findings provide an insight into the basic understanding of the interactions between crop fertilization and the performance T. absoluta .",

Studies highlight the importance of an experimental design that considers samples in adjacent matrix and the distance from the edge as a continuous factor. We sampled ants along edges composed by Cerrado vegetation and three types of crop matrix: sugarcane, eucalyptus and pasture. We assessed the response patterns of ant communities to edge contrast and distance using linear models. Ant richness increases linearly towards Cerrado core in edges composed by sugarcane, while it did not change along edges composed by eucalyptus. In both cases, ant composition on both sides of these edges tended to be highly different. In pasture, ant richness is higher than Cerrado, while the composition changes gradually along this edge, indicating that low contrast edges imply a smoother effect of edge influence on communities. Our results suggest that edge influence is dependent on the structural contrast between the habitats that compose the edges. We highlight the importance of the two‐sided approach on edge studies and the use of more than a single biodiversity dimension to provide an accurate picture of edge influence on insect communities.",

The thermal limits tolerated by insects vary depending on the species which can have important consequences for their voltinism in a climate‐changing world. This study used a multicriteria approach to select the best among six nonlinear models to describe the temperature‐dependent development rate of Anticarsia gemmatalis and Spodoptera cosmioides , two important soybean pests. The best models for each species were employed to estimate their voltinism under current and future climate conditions predicted for southern Brazil. According to the selected models, A. gemmatalis showed high upper lethal threshold (42.4°C) than S. cosmioides (32.3°C). Such disparity in the tolerance to high temperatures resulted in pronounced differences in the species' voltinism in southern Brazil, especially under future climate conditions. While an increase in the voltinism of A. gemmatalis of up to 32.3% was predicted in the entire study area, a decrease in the voltinism of S. cosmioides of up to 33.1% was predicted in warmer regions where temperatures more often exceeded the species' optimum. The species, location, and interaction between these two factors explained 96.0% of the total variation observed in the voltinism. Our findings suggest that disparity among species in their tolerance to high temperatures may differently influence their voltinism and population growth, leading to potential changes in their status as a pest in some regions due to climate change.",

In agroecosystems, the Coleoptera community may be influenced by the surrounding landscape, which can provide living resources, like food or shelter, during different seasons, originating spillover movements between different environments. The present study aimed to evaluate the response of the Coleoptera community to the landscape surrounding vineyards at different buffers. For that, Coleoptera were sampled in six wine protected designation of origin (PDO) regions of Portugal (35 vineyards), and landscape configuration and composition metrics were calculated at buffers of 500, 750, 1000, 1500 and 2000 m radii around the vineyards. In total, 2954 Coleoptera individuals belonging to 36 families were collected. The most abundant families were Chrysomelidae, Coccinellidae and Latridiidae. Results indicated that intermediate habitat fragmentation levels, particularly in semi‐natural areas and vineyards, favoured Coleoptera biodiversity in vine‐producing regions. Moreover, the range of activity of Coleoptera seems to be larger than 1000 m. This work constitutes an important contribution to understanding the response of the Coleoptera community to the landscape context in vineyards in Portugal and contributes to the theoretical framework about the influence of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity.",

We quantified sugars and tannins as possible predictors of nymphal abundance. 3. Canopy leaves hosted double the number of nymphs as understorey leaves. Variation among individual trees (understorey and canopy) was the most important source of heterogeneity explaining psyllid abundance, although relative leaf age significantly influenced oviposition on canopy leaves. The diversity of foliar sugars was higher among canopy leaves than among understorey leaves. There was significant between‐tree diversity in total hydrolysable tannins (HTs) and total condensed tannins (CTs) among understorey trees but not among canopy trees. Heterogeneity among understorey and canopy trees was explained by greater diversity of ellagitannins (HTs) than of CTs. 4. Shading is detrimental to the survival of nymphs on both host types, but sugars are unlikely to explain variation in suitability. Vescalagin (an ellagitannin) was negatively correlated with the abundance of nymphs on both host types.",

Environmental disturbances favour the colony dispersal of both species, particularly those with an anthropogenic origin. However, the frequencies of the species can vary according to the amount of anthropogenic disturbances. Crops near native vegetation fragments is a common landscape in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Here, we analyse if there is influence of native vegetation cover on the occurrence of these fire ants and their molecular diversity in crops. Our hypothesis is that these species are antagonistic in terms of occurrence and molecular diversity when compared in the same habitat. We selected crops near fragments with around 50% of native vegetation cover, a percentage informative enough to detect biological responses from insects belonging to a same order. Nests were collected and the species were identified using external morphology, and mtDNA COI sequences. We reject our hypothesis, which suggest that the species colonize the vegetation patches around crops in a similar way. Solenopsis invicta is not limited by vegetation cover, and has a high haplotype diversity when compared to S. saevissima , particularly when the vegetation cover is greater than 50%. Additionally, the vegetation cover seems to not have influence in the total number of haplotypes, but the species have haplotypes that are exclusive to each landscape. Our findings suggest that S. invicta is expanding to native vegetation areas that it has not occupied before, as S. saevissima was dominant there.",

It causes severe damage throughout its range and can devastate the entire fruit harvest in unprotected orchards. In 2007, B. dorsalis was detected in Mayotte, where it now ranks ninth on the list of fruit fly species of economic importance. This tropical island is a good study area to analyse the host range of B. dorsalis and its interactions with other resident fruit fly species. Two field campaigns were carried out from 2012 to 2014 and from 2019 to 2021. We collected fruit from all over the island in cultivated and non‐cultivated areas and compared the infestation rates between the two periods. We detected six fruit fly species, including the common species Dacus ciliatus, Neoceratitis cyanescens, Ceratitis capitata, B. dorsalis and two rarer species, Dacus etiennellus and Trirhithrum nigerrimum. The most surprising result was the low occurrence of B. dorsalis, with only seven host plant species identified out of a total of 84 plant species. Infestation rates were low for these host plant species, even in the case of mango (11.71 flies/kg) and Indian almond (0.97 fly/kg), which are considered to be major host plants of B. dorsalis . Bactrocera dorsalis seems to have a lower impact in Mayotte than in other parts of the world. We discuss the possible causes of the weak infestation rates observed, which could provide the key to regulating the species on the island.",

Here, we examine a diet‐mediated tri‐trophic interaction between an outbreaking forest defoliator, forest tent caterpillar (FTC) Malacosoma disstria Hübner and Nosema sp. microsporidia. We conducted two experiments where diet quality was manipulated by incorporating lyophilized aspen ( Populus tremuloides Michaux) foliage into an artificial diet, which was compared to a standard artificial diet. Diet quantity varied between fully fed and partially starved conditions, simulating an outbreak scenario. Microsporidia infection occurred naturally or was induced via experimental inoculation. We assessed FTC survival, microsporidia infection and load, and sublethal effects of treatments on FTC traits. Plant secondary metabolite concentrations in aspen‐augmented diets varied between experiments. In Experiment 1, the aspen‐augmented diet contained lyophilized aspen foliage with low concentrations of secondary metabolites, which increased FTC survival and reduced microsporidia infection. Diet quality and infection load also interactively influenced adult wing traits in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, the aspen‐augmented diet contained lyophilized aspen foliage with higher concentrations of secondary metabolites, which negatively affected FTC. No diet‐mediated interactions with microsporidia were observed in Experiment 2. Diet quality (Experiments 1 and 2), diet quantity (Experiment 2) and microsporidia infection (Experiments 1 and 2) directly influenced FTC survival and/or had sublethal effects on FTC that may have cascading effects on population dynamics and dispersal. We demonstrated that diet quality can mediate interactions between FTC and microsporidia, but these interactions depend on the defensive chemistry of the FTC diet. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report diet‐mediated interactions between an outbreaking forest pest and microsporidia and one of only a few studies to examine this tri‐trophic interaction among Lepidoptera.",

Its introduction and consequent spread across North America may now make it the most widely distributed Agrilus species, globally. No evidence reviewed indicated A. cuprescens was present in North America long before it was first reported on Rosa in New Jersey, USA, in 1913. The species incrementally progressed westward, reaching the Pacific coast in Washington, USA, 101 years later. Future spread is most likely within the northern Canadian prairies and the Pacific Northwest regions. Its presence in the latter region poses a contemporary threat to epicentres of Rubus production in both the United States and Canada. As of 2022, confirmed spread within the region extended nearly to the Canadian border in Washington and the southern Willamette Valley in Oregon. The most comprehensive, foundational investigations of A. cuprescens in North America were conducted in the late 1930s and early 1940s in New York, USA, and in Utah, USA, during the late 1950s and early 1960s following damaging outbreaks on Rubus . Ongoing research in the Pacific Northwest is attempting to refine information on this pest as it progresses towards naturalization within a new North American ecological and agricultural context. This review aggregates and clarifies the geographical progression, biological understandings and management of this species in North America, which has been fraught with a convoluted history of misidentifications, and varying degrees of consideration given to it as a pest of concern.",

Effective commercial lures are available for that insect but attract non‐target species, particularly beneficial Thanasimus species. Our study aimed to develop an equally effective M . galloprovincialis lure less attractive to beneficial predatory insects. We used electroantennography to test several compounds occurring in the pheromones, hindgut extracts or headspace emissions of non‐ Ips bark beetles. The compounds that caused the strongest antennal responses were used along with α ‐pinene (host‐tree volatile) and monochamol (2‐undecyloxy‐1‐ethanol, a male‐produced aggregation pheromone of M. galloprovincialis ) to prepare the lures for olfactometric and field testing. In the field experiments, the lure containing (+)‐ α ‐pinene, monochamol, (1 R )‐(−)‐myrtenal and ( S )‐(−)‐ trans ‐verbenol was equally effective as the commercial lure Galloprotect Pack. It attracted significantly less Thanasimus formicarius and T. femoralis beetles.

After adult emergence, the logs and branches were debarked, and the infestation density of bark beetles was analysed. The results indicate that shading, log diameter and top/bottom parts of log had a significant effect on infestation density of I. cembrae on logs. The infestation density of I. cembrae was higher on logs felled between December and June than on logs felled between July and November. Shading of branches was the most significant variable affecting the bark beetle species composition on branches. All four of the bark beetle species recorded were affected by diameter of the branches. Ips cembrae primarily infested sunlit branches while Cryphalus intermedius preferred shaded branches. In contrast, the infestation densities of Pityogenes chalcographus and Pityophthorus pityographus seemed to be affected primarily by moisture content of the branches.",

Further development of the software and hardware should enable higher levels of accuracy, especially in terms of the direction of movement of reproductive individuals. This innovative tool holds immense potential for advancing ecological and behavioural research by providing researchers with rapid and easily accessible data. Understanding the activity patterns of individual wasps within the colony can yield valuable insights into factors influencing their growth, foraging patterns and the behaviour of reproductive individuals.

    "abstract": "Abstract Longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) are a very diverse group whose species vary greatly in morphology and behaviour, particularly in diel activity. The type genus Cerambyx includes two large oak‐ling sympatric species ( Cerambyx cerdo and Cerambyx welensii ) that exhibit a crepuscular/nocturnal (dim‐light) lifestyle, but their actual diel activity remains largely unclear. We used phototraps in the wild to assess if diel activity depended on either species, sex or annual meteorology. Phototraps were highly effective, and the imaged activities were representative of beetles' life, including interactions with some vertebrate species. Both longhorns exhibited roughly similar crepuscular/nocturnal behaviour, with daytime activity being usually residual or erratic. Diel activity increased sharply just before dusk, peaked between dusk and early dark night (23:00–2:00 h), and then dropped progressively until disappearing at dawn. Diel activity was sexually dimorphic in C. welensii, as in some years females tended to be active earlier than males. Distinctly, in 2022, the warmest and driest year recorded in the study area, diel activity curves were flatter and wider, with C. cerdo activity increasing in the late afternoon (19:00–21:30 h) and C. welensii in the second half of the night (3:00–6:00 h). Furthermore, both species boosted daytime activity (diurnality) by more than three times, and diurnality also increased over the season that year. We finally hypothesise that, under the current climate change scenario, extreme droughts impact diel activity in these species, particularly boosting diurnality, in an attempt to locate water/food sources to counteract body dehydration.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Declining natural pollinator populations are a potential threat to global food supplies. Mass flowering summer annual oilseeds can provide much needed crop diversity and floral resources to support pollinator communities. We evaluated how managing planting date affects floral phenology, floral accumulation (flower coverage time × flower area), pollinator visitation, pollinator diversity and yield of nine oilseed crops. Borage ( Borago officinalis L.), calendula ( Calendula officinalis L.), crambe ( Crambe abyssinica Hochst), cuphea ( Cuphea viscosissima Jacq. × Cuphea lanceolata W. T. Aiton), echium ( Echium plantagineum L.), flax ( Linum usitatissimum L.), spring camelina ( Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz), spring canola ( Brassica napus L.) and sunflower [ Helianthus annuus L.] were grown in Morris, Minnesota during the summers of 2013 and 2014. Each crop was planted on a “standard” planting date of mid‐May and additional planting dates of early May, early June and early July. Shifting planting dates affected flowering phenology, floral accumulation, pollinator visitation and crop yield. Later planting dates led to later onset of flowering for all crops and affected total floral accumulation for crambe, cuphea and echium. Pollinator visitations changed with planting date and were generally greater with the later planting dates. At least two of the four planting dates supported high yield for each crop. The ability to maintain high crop yield across a window of planting dates affords growers management options for their fields and can be used to design complementary resource pairing and improve pollinator health through crop diversification and management.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Potential biodiversity maps (PBMs) allow the identification of areas with different potential for conservation, to support political decisions about the management and protection of biodiversity. As these maps are seldom constructed for inconspicuous species, we proposed to develop PBMs for species belonging to the Geadephaga (Coleoptera), which is a group of beetles that contributes as predators for pest suppression and other ecosystem services in forest ecosystems. Given that human activities are reducing forest integrity, we consider that it is crucial to recognize how diversity patterns of Geadephaga are related to degraded forests. We developed these maps for the Geadephaga associated with subantarctic forests considering diversity measures of species richness, specificity, and rarity to establish spatial relationships between each diversity measure and different levels of forest integrity, and to identify potential hotspots and suggest conservation priorities. Results showed a latitudinal pattern of decrease in scores on richness and specificity from north to south, but a patchy pattern of species rarity across the region. Outcomes also show that areas with high scores of diversity measures are overlapped with degraded forest, and that hotspots have a low spatial overlap between them. In this work, we provide for the first time regional PBMs at a relatively high spatial resolution of three different diversity measures for Geadephaga that inhabit subantarctic forest. These maps constitute tools that allow not only to recognize potential diversity patterns of these insects, but also to offer valuable information to be used in conservation decision‐making.",

(Lepidoptera: Plutellidae) oviposition and larval host choice. We also compare the effect of presence of intact predators, predators without mandibles, confined predators and a no predator control treatment on P. xylostella larval growth, survival and herbivory. Host plant nutrition influenced the host choice of adult female P. xylostella ; no interaction was observed between bottom‐up host plant nutrition and the presence of C. septempunctata adults or larvae on oviposition or larval host choice by P. xylostella . Predator presence impacted larval feeding and weight gain. The presence of free‐moving C. septempunctata adults without mandibles that could not predate P. xylostella reduced mean leaf consumption by P. xylostella larvae to 1.88 ± 0.21 cm 2 and reduced weight gain to 2.12 ± 0.16 mg. Despite differences in leaf damage and larval weight gain, survival remained consistent across the non‐consumptive treatments. Intact C. septempunctata larvae reduced leaf damage and subsequent P. xylostella larval weight gain. The presence of larval predators across the non‐consumptive treatments, however, had no effect on feeding damage or weight gain. Results of our investigation indicate that C. septempunctata causes some non‐consumptive effects on P. xylostella that depend on predator life stage, level of confinement and prey life stage. It is likely that P. xylostella responds to multi‐modal cues in predator detection.",

To estimate the potential biomass consumption by LCA on Salicaceae plantations in the lower delta of the Paraná River, we studied the foraging activity and harvesting patterns of Acromyrmex lundii (Guérin‐Méneville, 1838) and Acromyrmex ambiguus (Emery, 1888) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in a 14‐year‐old poplar plantation in Argentina. Foraging activity (workers/time), harvested vegetal biomass (dry weight/time) and climatic conditions (temperature and relative humidity) were monitored daily and seasonally in nests from autumn 2016 to summer 2017. The two sympatric species harvested a similar quantity of dry biomass throughout the year (4.9–6.0 kg/colony). Although both species were active in all seasons, their foraging activity was higher in spring and summer, but they avoided extreme temperatures. The accumulated biomass harvested for both species was higher in summer (28.8 and 25.7 g/colony/day, for Ac. ambiguus and Ac. lundii , respectively). However, Ac. lundii harvested three times more biomass than Ac. ambiguus in spring (30.3 and 13.1 g/colony/day, respectively). Although the highest consumption on the vegetation occurred in summer, control tasks should be started during spring (sprouting phase), the most vulnerable period for Salicaceaes. The consumption of new leaves in spring is critical for tree growth, survival and wood production, especially by Ac. lundii , the most detrimental species during this season.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Describing the genetic structure and diversity of invasive insect pest populations is essential to better understand a species' invasion history and success throughout its distribution range. Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) (Lepidoptera, Gelechiidae) is a destructive pest of tomato and many other solanaceous crops, with very high economic impacts. Its invasion threatens food security in a large part of the globe, in areas such as sub‐Saharan Africa where the agricultural resilience has already been weakened by rapid human‐induced changes due in particular to population growth, increased trade and global change. This work aimed to investigate the diversity and genetic structure of 60 populations of T. absoluta using microsatellite markers, with a particular focus on sub‐Saharan Africa. Our results revealed distinct differentiation and diversity patterns between T. absoluta native versus invaded areas, and high genetic homogeneity among the African populations sampled. However, for the first time, two weakly differentiated but distinct genetic clusters in Africa were identified. The results suggest few introduction events of the species in Africa or multiple introductions from genetically close areas, significant gene flow between outbreaks and seem to indicate the existence of two distinct clusters in Africa. This new data enable us to formulate hypotheses on the species' invasion patterns and the dynamics of its invasive populations. These hypotheses must be verified with more extensive sampling over the whole range of T. absoluta , especially in its presumed native area.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cover crops are multifunctional tools that mitigate environmental impacts of agriculture, enhance resilience to weather extremes and suppress weeds and arthropod pests. Cover crops provide non‐crop food and habitat resources that attract natural enemies of pests, but their outcomes for pest management are less clear in regions where keystone mutualisms between red imported fire ants and aphids dominate. Here, we manipulate ant exclusion treatments and cover crop treatments (living mulches and terminated cover crops) that vary in food/habitat resources and examine responses of ants, aphids, other herbivores and predators in a cotton agroecosystem. Living mulches reduced both ants and aphids in the crop canopy by 97% and 93%, respectively, relative to bare soil treatments, and terminated cover crops reduced them as well by a lesser degree (~50%). Non‐aphid herbivores occurred in low densities system‐wide and increased in living mulches, whilst native predators had variable responses to cover crops and ant exclusion. Cover crops had no effect on prey removal in the crop canopy, but living mulches tripled rates of weed seed biocontrol, relative to bare soils. Cover crops elicited a shift in fire ant foraging from cotton foliage downward to the soil‐surface, preventing competitive exclusion by keystone ant/aphid mutualists that dominate crop monocultures. Cover crops altered the system‐wide impacts of fire ants: reducing ecosystem disservices (i.e. aphid tending) and enhancing ecosystem services (i.e. weed seed biocontrol). These results provide incentives for cover crop adoption as a regenerative practice in large‐scale commercial agriculture.",

We developed an ensemble species distribution model using three algorithms to assess the potential geographic range of L. delicatula under current and future climate conditions. We reviewed the literature to evaluate its host repertoire and identified host species present in Europe. Current climate conditions are highly suitable for L. delicatula across much of Europe. Climate change is expected to only slightly alter climate suitability by 2060. Numerous known host plants are also widely distributed throughout Europe. We conclude that neither climate conditions nor the availability of compatible host plants pose a barrier to the establishment of L. delicatula in Europe.

Due to their lifestyle, these weevils cause hidden damage within the stems. Our non‐invasive computer tomography‐based study aimed to compare the damage characteristics of three species within this genus: C. pallidactylus (Marsham), C. napi (Gyll.), and C. picitarsis (Gyll.), in oilseed rape stems. During the CT analysis of the plant samples from axial, coronal, and sagittal approaches at different points, we measured the length of the damaging larvae, their number per plant, their distance from each other, the volume of the formed cavity, and the diameter of the damaged plant stems. Additionally, we investigated the closeness of the connections between these forms of damage. Our study found that damage to plant samples during the period of interest was species‐specific. Significant differences were observed in the longitudinal size dimensions of the larvae, the volume of the formed cavities, and the diameters of the stems of the attacked plants among the species causing the damage. The Pearson correlation results confirmed a strong correlation between the volumes of the formed cavities and the values of larval length (l) and stem diameter (⌀), as well as between stem diameter and larval length data for each species (C. pallidactylus : l = 6.903 ± 1.332 mm, ⌀ = 11.43 ± 0.707 mm; C. napi : l = 9.868 ± 0.617 mm, ⌀ = 23.11 ± 2.813 mm; C. picitarsis : l = 3.772 ± 0.967 mm, ⌀ = 11.16 ± 0.365 mm).

To assess assay performance, diagnostic sensitivity, which was 91%, and specificity, which was 75%, are used alongside limit of detection (600 pg).

In this study, we developed a species distribution model of S. frugiperda and identified the key influencing environmental factors under current and future climatic conditions in Ethiopia via the MaxEnt program. The results showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the simulated model was 0.856 (±0.010), confirming the good predictive ability of the model. The isothermality and precipitation of the driest month are the most dominant bioclimatic variables with a percentage contribution of 39.4% and 11.6%, respectively, in the model. The percentages of very highly suitable, highly suitable, moderately suitable, low‐suitable, and unsuitable areas were 21.24%, 21.17%, 28.22%, 16.34% and 13.03%, respectively, of the total Ethiopian land mass. From the present to the 2070s, the areas of highly suitable and very highly suitable habitats for S. frugiperda will increase due to global warming.

In a natural spruce stand in Northern Italy it was possible to detect the presence of some species of web‐spinning sawflies ( Cephalcia spp.) at endemic density. This was done over a 3‐year period by using trapping devices for both adults and larvae, including a trap which intercepted adult females climbing the trunk. Traps were operated on eight sample trees with signs of defoliation of the previous year (focal trees) and on 14 trees lacking signs of larval feeding (neighbour trees). 2 Trunk traps on focal trees caught a higher number of adult females than traps on neighbour trees in each of the 3 years considered. The distribution pattern of catches was not spatially autocorrelated at any of the distance bands considered. Focal trees produced more mature larvae per adult female of C. abietis than neighbour trees, indicating that insect performance was higher on focal trees. 3 The endemic population density of C. abietis was similar to that observed in other forests and the relationships between yellow trap catches and prepupal density fitted adequately with the predictive model validated for C. arvensis . The endemic density of the spruce web‐spinning sawflies seems to he higher than that of pine diprionids, and outbreak‐prone species of Cephalcia seem to be more abundant than non‐outbreak species even at very low population level.",

The progeny trial comprised 14 open‐pollinated families originating from a clonal seed orchard that had been established using mature spruce trees selected for aphid resistance. 2 Previous investigations had demonstrated that resistance was inherited by the offspring, and that differences in resistance between progenies of the individual orchard clones were highly significant. 3 Susceptibility to aphid attack was recorded as the percentage loss of previous year's needles. Differences in susceptibility recorded between the juvenile trees were found to persist after the trees had developed into the closed‐canopy, sexually reproducing stage. Needle loss of the families was significantly less than that of the reference population of Sitka spruce. 4 Hybrids between Sitka spruce and white spruce were defoliated more heavily than pure Sitka spruce, and the difference increased with age. 5 Family heritability of resistance was estimated as 0.60 compared to 0.73 when the trees were assessed in the juvenile stage. The genetic correlation based on family means between damage in the juvenile and sexually reproducing stand was high (0.83), indicating a high consistency of resistance to the aphid over years and ontogenetic stages. 6 A skewed distribution of defoliation indicated that major genes are involved in the expression of resistance, and that the genetics behind resistance has a nonadditive component.",

Furthermore, whether swarming Melolontha males were cross‐attracted to heterospecific females, and whether males could discriminate olfactorily between conspecific and heterospecific females, was tested in the field. 4 Males of both species preferred females when given the choice between females and males of the other species. However, they preferred conspecific females when females from both species were offered simultaneously. 5 The results suggest that species‐specific pheromone blends contribute to precopulatory reproductive isolation in sympatric populations of M. melolontha and M. hippocastani , but are not mutually exclusive or indispensable prerequisites for mate finding as in other insects.",

The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of larval and adult feeding on different host plants on subsequent reproductive fitness. 2 Hylobius abietis larvae were reared on logs of four host species known to vary in suitability for development; Pinus nigra ssp. laricio , Picea sitchensis , Larix kaempferi and Pseudotsuga menziesii . Adult females were collected on emergence and allocated to complete maturation feeding on one of four seedling conifer species, P. nigra spp. laricio , P. sitchensis , P. menziesii and Larix × marschlinsii . It was assumed that variation in both larval and adult host plant quality had the potential to influence subsequent reproductive behaviour. 3 The time taken for females to attain reproductive maturity was assessed, and reproductive output was measured over an average period of 17 days. 4 The best predictor of the time to attain reproductive maturity was found to be the initial adult body weight. This was strongly related to the larval host species, with the largest adults emerging from P. nigra ssp. laricio. The time taken to begin oviposition was in the range 10–49 days (mean 23 days). The subsequent mean rate of oviposition for individual females was in the range 0.1–3.7 eggs per day. Egg volumes varied between and within individual females, in the range 0.241–1.079 mm 3 . 5 The species of seedling provided for maturation feeding had no significant impact on reproductive behaviour over the course of the experiment. It is possible, however, that the quality of the adult diet might exert a greater influence on behaviour over a longer period because H. abietis is a relatively long‐lived species.",

Synchrony between paired sampling sites separated by increasing distances was estimated using a nonparametric covariance function. 3 A significant difference was found between the spatial synchrony of the species studied. Delphacodes kuscheli individuals collected at 6 m above the ground showed consistent spatial synchrony over long distances with correlation values declining by 40%. Population dynamics showed declining synchrony as site separation increased. Toya propinqua populations did not show this pattern. This species had a lower mean regional synchrony at at 6 m above the ground, but their ground height synchrony was greater than that observed for D. kuscheli. 4 One possible synchronizing mechanism is seasonality and the dispersal strategies of each species. The main host plants of D. kuscheli are winter cereals sown as pasture for cattle grazing and the synchrony of the crop may affect the general pattern of dispersing individuals of this species. The lack of synchrony observed in T. propinqua populations was probably due to the wider host range of this species.",

The barriers erected around the crop were of insect‐proof cloth fences (&lt;50 mesh), 1.5 m in height, in the first experiment with a deltamethrin‐treated, insect‐attracting strip facing inwards, and, in the second, with the barrier but no insecticide‐treated strip. 2 A mathematical model of epidemic development was fitted to the symptom data from the treated and control (unprotected) tomato plots. There were two viruses present, tomato yellow leaf curl and potato yellow mosaic; specific detection confirmed that symptoms gave an accurate indication of infection and that the two virus diseases had similar progress curves. 3 Parameter estimates obtained by model‐fitting suggested that the barriers reduced vector immigration by approximately 12‐fold but that B. tabaci retention within the plots was also increased slightly despite the mortality caused by the insecticide‐treated strips. Disease establishment was delayed by approximately 2 weeks. The results obtained in the second experiment involving barriers deployed without insecticide‐treated strips could be explained by a large increase in B. tabaci retention within the barriers resulting in more rapid virus disease progress than in controls. The results of mathematical modelling indicate that partial insect barriers can be worse than none because sufficient whiteflies can enter to establish a population and, at the same time, large numbers are retained in the barrier plot, with the net effect being a more rapid population increase than in the absence of barriers.",

These tests did not demonstrate any significant preference for either resistant or susceptible open‐pollinated material indicating that adult host preference for susceptible trees was not a likely cause of differential defoliation. 3 Quantification and analysis of growth and development parameters for all larval stages of P. atomaria showed that feeding on genetic material identified as resistant resulted in a significant reduction of relative growth rate of first instar larvae and an alteration to normal feeding behaviour. There was also a trend towards increased larval mortality on resistant E. grandis . 4 We argue that although the magnitude of these effects was minor, interactions with additional biotic and abiotic sources of mortality in the field have the potential, when magnified over successive generations, to result in significant variation in defoliation of host genotypes in the field.",

The study was conducted in a remnant of primary upland forest, in which were distributed 10 plots (0.5 ha each). All individuals of G. argenteum with diameters greater than 5 cm at a height of 1.3 m were inventoried. Two trees per plot were selected to assess the total production of fruit. Collectors were installed under the canopy projection of each tree. The fruits were counted and weighed in the field and were transported to the laboratory, to determine the dry mass. Samples of fruits were collected to investigate their infestation by fruit flies and percentage of parasitism. A total of 394 specimens of G. argenteum were identified in the 5 ha investigated area, of which only 126 produced fruits during the 12 months of the assessment. Production ranged from 59 to 2478 fruits per plant (0.59 and 19.73 kg of fresh mass, respectively). Fifty‐nine fruit samples were collected from 44 plants, from which 7703 puparia were obtained. Only Anastrepha atrigona Hendel emerged from the puparia. The mean infestation rate was 554.9 puparia/kg of fruit (0.4–1628.6 puparia/kg). Four species of parasitoids were obtained, with mean percentage of parasitism of 2.27% (0.23–9.01%). Our results show that G. argenteum is a reservoir of fruit fly parasitoids, highlighting the importance of its conservation in native habitats, as well as its multiplication in areas close to commercial orchards.",

A willow nursery field trial was established to evaluate the aphid populations, and the survival and growth of young plants of several willow species and hybrids, during two growing seasons from planting.

    "abstract": "Abstract Central European forests experience a substantial loss of open‐forest organisms due to forest management and increasing nitrogen deposition. However, management strategies, removing different levels of nitrogen, have been rarely evaluated simultaneously. We tested the additive effects of coppicing and topsoil removal on communities of dung‐inhabiting beetles compared to closed forests. We sampled 57 021 beetles, using baited pitfall traps exposed on 27 plots. Experimental treatments resulted in significantly different communities by promoting open‐habitat species. While alpha diversity did not differ among treatments, gamma diversity of Geotrupidae and Scarabaeidae and beta diversity of Staphylinidae were higher in coppice than in forest. Functional diversity of rove beetles was higher in both, coppice and topsoil‐removed plots, compared to control plots. This was likely driven by higher habitat heterogeneity in established forest openings. Five dung beetle species and four rove beetle species benefitted from coppicing, one red‐listed dung beetle and two rove beetle species benefitted from topsoil removal. Our results demonstrate that dung‐inhabiting beetles related to open forest patches can be promoted by both, coppicing and additional topsoil removal. A mosaic of coppice and bare‐soil‐rich patches can hence promote landscape‐level gamma diversity of dung and rove beetles within forests.",

These sites are typically well‐concealed cracks and crevices within the environment. Such cocooning behaviour is also observed in larvae of the codling moth (CM) Cydia pomonella (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), which aggregate prior to pupation in response to a pheromone blend produced by cocoon‐spinning conspecific larvae. 2 In laboratory experiments, we tested whether cocoon‐spinning OFM and IMM larvae produce aggregation pheromones and whether CM larvae are cross‐attracted to closely‐related OFM larvae. 3 Fifth‐instar OFM and IMM larvae were not attracted to, or arrested by, cocoon‐spinning conspecifics. Moreover, fifth‐instar CM larvae were not cross‐attracted to either cocoon‐spinning OFM or IMM larvae. 4 Analyses of volatiles released from cocoon‐spinning OFM and IMM larvae revealed that both OFM and IMM lack components that are present in the aggregation pheromone of CM larvae. This information may help explain why CM larvae are not cross‐attracted to cocooning OFM or IMM larvae.",

However, it may not always be possible to perform rigorous, long‐term studies on invaders to determine the factors that influence their population dynamics, particularly when time and resources are limited. We applied a novel approach to determine factors associated with mortality in larvae of the sawfly Profenusa thomsoni Konow, a leafminer of birch, and a relatively recent invader of urban and rural birch forests in Alaska. Classification tree analysis was applied to reveal relationships between qualitative and quantitative predictor variables and categorical response variables in a large data set of larval mortality observations. We determined the state (living or dead) of sawfly larvae in samples of individual leaves. Each leaf was scored for variables reflecting the intensity of intra‐specific competition and leaf quality for leafminers, year of collection and degree‐days accumulated were recorded for each sample. We explored the association of these variables with larval state using classification tree analysis. Leafminer mortality was best explained by a combination of competition and resource exhaustion and our analysis revealed a possible advantage to group feeding in young larvae that may explain previously observed patterns of resource overexploitation in this species. Dead larvae were disproportionately found in smaller leaves, which highlights the potential effect of competition on mortality and suggests that smaller‐leaved species of birch will better able to resist leafminer damage. We show that classification tree analysis may be useful in situations where urgency and/or limited resources prohibit traditional life‐table studies.",

Girdling by larval feeding causes significant mortality on young trees. The insect poses considerable challenges to reforestation. Adult weevils feed on all life stages of a variety of coniferous hosts prior to oviposition. Their relative feeding preferences, however, have not been quantified. Moreover, it is not known whether host bark influences oviposition behaviour. Feeding preferences of adult weevils were tested in both choice and no‐choice laboratory bioassays using small branches from three conifers (lodgepole pine Pinus contorta var. latifolia , interior hybrid spruce Picea glauca × engelmannii , and Douglas‐fir Pseudotsuga menziesii ) and one deciduous tree (trembling aspen Populus tremuloides ). Measurements included the surface area of bark consumed, rate of consumption, the number of days of feeding, and, in the no‐choice assay, the number of eggs oviposited. Bark consumption was greatest on pine and Douglas‐fir, followed by spruce. Little to no feeding occurred on aspen. Consumption did not vary between male versus female insects for any of the feeding metrics quantified. The presence of aspen branches did not inhibit feeding on any of the other species in the choice bioassays. The number of eggs laid by female insects did not differ significantly among tree species in the no‐choice assay. Eggs were laid indiscriminately in the presence of all four host types. Results and opportunities for future research are discussed in the context of formulating new integrated pest management strategies for this insect, which is increasingly important in the period of reforestation subsequent to the mountain pine beetle epidemic in western Canada.",

Laboratory and field data suggested that winterform female C . bidens maintain some characteristics of reproductive diapause. By manipulating photoperiod and temperature during psylla development, we showed a major role for photoperiod in the induction of a reproductive diapause‐like state. However, as observed under natural conditions, the timing of the decrease in ovarian development and mating was highly dependent on the decrease in temperature. The fact that the initiation of reproductive activity was synchronous and highly predictable is very significant for the design of phenologically based management for this pest.",

Nymphs and adults are present in orchards from M arch to N ovember; their winter absence suggests either migration to other hosts or embryonic dormancy on pear trees to overcome the adverse period. In addition, it has been hypothesized that aestivation takes place to cope with extreme summer conditions. The present study aimed to investigate the reproductive strategy of P. gallicus to overcome unfavourable periods. Accordingly, (i) its population dynamics were followed during several years and (ii) females were sampled in three different seasons to study the condition (diapausing or nondiapausing) of the laying. The results obtained show that nymphs were always the first mobile instar to show up in pear orchards and the presence of adults was delayed, indicating egg overwintering. Nondiapausing eggs prevailed in spring and summer, whereas the autumn eggs were mainly diapausing. Aestivation was rejected. Worthy of note are: (i) the presence of diapausing eggs under favourable conditions and (ii) the existence of females laying both diapausing and nondiapausing eggs; thus, ‘not laying all the eggs in one basket’. The reproductive strategy of P. gallicus is considered as bet‐hedging for the short‐ and long‐term survival of the species.",

Switchgrass intercropping likely alters vegetation characteristics within a stand by increasing herbaceous vegetation cover and thus influences insect communities positively. However, its effect may vary with stand age, which often determines canopy closure and vegetation structure within a stand: effects of switchgrass intercropping may be stronger in old pine stands with a closed canopy than in young pine stands with an open canopy. We examined how switchgrass intercropping and stand age, namely 3–4‐year‐old pine ( YP ine) and 8–9‐year‐old pine ( OP ine), influenced insect abundance and diversity in loblolly pine ( Pinus taeda ) stands in M ississippi, U.S.A., during M ay to A ugust 2013–2014. We captured insects at 36 locations throughout 12 stands (three stands per each of four treatments; intercropping and non‐intercropping treatment in YP ine and OP ine stands), using pan traps. Abundance and family level richness were greater in YP ine stands and S hannon– W iener diversity and evenness at family level was higher in OP ine stands both years. However, insect abundance and diversity did not differ between intercropping and non‐intercropping treatments. Community composition was also influenced by stand age, which explained &gt; 90% of constrained inertia, rather than switchgrass intercropping. Our findings suggest that switchgrass intercropping is unlikely to significantly affect insect communities in managed pine stands, whereas stand age, as well as associated successional changes, can be a main factor affecting insects, as often observed in other animal taxa in managed pine landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Invertebrates are important providers of ecosystem services to orchards and the orchards may benefit where there is greater biodiversity. Previous research has shown that apple orchards using organic or integrated pest management support different invertebrate communities, as can different orchards within the same management system. In the present study, we examined the potential for agrichemical usage to explain inter‐orchard invertebrate community differences in 10 New Zealand apple orchards under integrated pest management. Multiple regression models were used to examine relationships between spray diary data and invertebrates collected by branch tapping, pitfall and sticky traps in 2011/2012. Insecticides, fungicides, plant growth regulators and fertilizers were used as explanatory variables in these models and the most parsimonious models were identified. Plant growth regulators were significant in most of the models for inter‐orchard variability in total invertebrate diversity. Insecticides featured strongly in models explaining pest assemblages, although not so strongly for models for their natural enemies. Fungicide and fertilizer use featured in models explaining communities of decomposers and fungivores. The results generated several hypotheses about the impacts of specific agrichemicals on invertebrate biodiversity, which, if tested, could establish the feasibility of customizing spray schedules to meet both biodiversity and production goals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Homogeneous tree crop plantations can adversely impact wild pollinator communities by limiting the temporal continuity of food and the availability of nesting sites. Identifying how structural differences between plantations and natural vegetation influence pollinator communities is necessary for ecological management of agroecosystems. Communities of potential wild pollinators (native bees, wasps, flies) were compared between monoculture almond plantations and native vegetation in a semi‐arid region of southern Australia, before, during and after the late winter almond flowering period. Abundance and richness of each insect group were related to site heterogeneity and keystone structural resources at each site, focusing on food and nesting resources. Relationships with site heterogeneity varied between taxa and across months. Native bee abundance and richness were strongly associated with specific keystone resources, despite showing no association with site heterogeneity. The present study highlights the value of focusing on biologically meaningful resources when investigating relationships between insects and habitat, rather than on generalized heterogeneity metrics. The results suggest that maintaining keystone resources in agroecosystems can support the conservation of insects and ecosystem services, especially in areas where homogeneous agricultural systems overlap dynamic natural ecosystems.",

These studies are critically reviewed and complemented with a new simulation study. The reasons for the different reports are elucidated and can be classified as additional (but hidden) replication, selection of favourable endpoints with low variation, and reporting at an unusual scale. A new simulation study was performed to investigate the relationship between statistical power and replication under a variety of data-generating and analysis methods. Approximately 60 replications should be sufficient to detect a 50% (two-fold) decrease in taxon numbers, provided that the coefficient of variation in the counts does not exceed 100%. Replication can be accomplished not only by using multiple blocks in a single trial, but also by repeating the experiment in multiple years and/or at different sites. With other (e.g. agronomic) treatment factors in the field trial, without interaction with variety, the effective replication can be increased by investigating the main variety effect summed over the other treatment factors. Repeated measures may also increase the power if the expected difference is equal over time and the time points are sufficiently spaced.",

The present study investigated whether forest management affects the infestation of European beech trees by the beech scale Cryptococcus fagisuga. We assessed the densities of C. fagisuga on a total of 520 trees (Fagus sylvatica) at 104 forest sites, representing three main types of beech forest management intensity across three regions in Germany. The infestation rates on beech trees were 16% in the South-West, 20% in the Centre and 35% in the North-East of Germany, although the rates per plot did not differ significantly among regions. No significant differences between unmanaged beech, managed even-aged beech and managed uneven-aged beech forests were found because of high variability in beech scale infestation observed among forest sites and within forest management types. Highest infestation rates occurred on widely dispersed mature trees within thickets with shelterwood stage and lowest infestation rates occurred on young beech trees in the thicket stage. The results of the present study suggest that the infestation rates of C. fagisuga on beech depend on tree age and canopy openness rather than on management intensity.",

The widespread adoption of transgenic insect-resistant cotton expressing insecticidal toxins Cry1A from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) has caused a dramatic shift in agricultural landscapes over the last 15 years, thus raising concerns about the potential impacts of Bt crops on nontarget organisms worldwide. The potential effect of crop composition shift as a result of the increasing acreage of Bt cotton on an arthropod community was assessed at three levels (0%, 75% and 100%) of Bt dominance in a 2-year field trial in northern China. Three findings confirmed that the arthropod assemblage of a certain field was influenced by crop composition and its developmental stage: (i) the proportion of Bt cotton in the crop mixture consistently affected the abundance of pests, natural enemies and total arthropods; (ii) bootstrap methods demonstrated significant effects of Bt cotton on species richness, diversity and evenness; and (iii) non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis showed that the arthropod community of a certain agricultural ecosystem varied with crop composition and plant developmental stage. The findings of the present study may have significant implications for cotton pest management with respect to transgenic Bt cotton, highlighting the potential of conservation biological control via the combination of an appropriate crop genetic ratio and timely chemical control.",

We observed the dispersal of normal and irradiated weevils for 21 days after their release in a sweet potato field during all four seasons, and estimated their survival using the Weibull function. Normal weevils generally moved further than irradiated weevils, and all weevils had greater dispersal distances in the summer than in the winter, with spring and autumn intermediate between these two extremes (summer: 0.23 m/day versus 0.29 m/day; winter: 0.15 m/day versus 0.07 m/day; spring: 0.20 m/day versus 0.17 m/day; autumn: 0.20 m/day versus 0.15 m/day, respectively).

    "abstract": "Abstract Conspecific plant density and heterospecific frequency are key drivers of herbivore damage. However, most studies have investigated their effects separately and for single (rather than multiple) focal plant species. We conducted an experiment involving three tree species, namely: Cordia dodecandra (Boraginaceae), Manilkara zapota (Zapotaceae), and Piscidia piscipula (Fabaceae). We manipulated understory densities of M. zapota and C. dodecandra (focal species) and their frequency relative to P. piscipula. Three months after planting, we surveyed insect leaf chewer and sucking damage on the former two. Because these species are attacked by different herbivores, we predicted a negative effect of heterospecific frequency on herbivory. Density and frequency varied in the direction and function of their effects on herbivory depending on the plant species and attacking herbivore. As expected, Piscidia piscipula frequency had a negative linear effect on M. zapota leaf‐chewer damage, whereas conspecific density did not affect chewer damage on this species. In contrast, density and frequency had non‐linear effects on C. dodecandra chewer damage, namely positive (hump‐shaped) and negative (U‐shaped) relationships, respectively. In addition, density and frequency had positive linear effects on C. dondecandra damage by leafhoppers. These findings call for more work jointly assessing plant inter‐specific variation in density‐ and frequency‐dependent variation in herbivory and its underlying drivers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Phorid flies are important natural enemies of leaf‐cutting ants. Female phorids lay eggs in the worker ants' bodies and the parasitoid larvae feed on the host's internal tissues. Here we investigated the parasitism rates by four species of phorids when attacking individual Atta laevigata colonies at three different field sites in order to further understand the host‐parasitoid relationship. There were distinct variations in parasitism rates when comparing phorid species attacking individual colonies. In 13 of the colonies sampled, parasitism by Apocephalus attophilus or Eibesfeldtphora erthali was predominant. However, in four of the colonies, Myrmosicarius grandicornis and Apocephalus vicosae were the predominant species. Variations in parasitism rates by the four phorid species were investigated in relation to the size of the potential hosts that had been collected from the foraging trails of each colony. When correlating the size of potential hosts to phorid species, ants with head capsule widths of &gt;2 mm were predominantly parasitized by A. vicosae and E. erthali . Smaller ants, with head capsule widths of 2 mm or less, were predominantly parasitized by A. attophilus and M. grandicornis . The highest parasitism rates by E. erthali were observed in individual colonies that had the highest proportions of large workers on the trails. Although almost half the size of E. erthali , A. attophilus parasitized both large (head capsule width &gt; 2 mm) and small workers (&lt;2 mm). This was related to the fact that between 1 and 16 larvae can develop within an individual host, depending on host size. M. grandicornis parasitized smaller workers (mean head capsule width = 2 mm) as these phorids are themselves small and only one larva develops within each host. This study demonstrated that the parasitism profiles of individual A. laevigata colonies were related to the size of foragers on the trails.",

In Europe, the gram‐negative bacterium Xylella fastidiosa is one of the most important and severe insect‐borne plant pathogens associated with the infraorder Cicadomorpha. Therefore, the knowledge of the abundance and diversity of native Cicadomorpha insect vectors related to the different agroecosystems is essential to design and implementing specific measures to control insect‐borne plant pathogens. In this work, in two consecutive years (2018 and 2019), five almond orchards, five vineyards, five olive orchards, and five scrublands distributed in the North of Portugal were sampled in three different periods (early summer, summer and autumn) to investigate species composition, richness, and diversity of the Cicadomorpha community. Also, in 2019, five lemon orchards were sampled. A total of 6056 individuals were collected (2322 in 2018 and 3734 in 2019), belonging to 71 species of three families. Observing several considered pests or vectors of vicious pathogens within these species was possible. The confirmed vectors of X. fastidiosa ( Philaenus spumarius (Linnaeus, 1758) and Neophilaenus campestris (Fallen, 1805)) were captured in all agroecosystems and, in general, with more abundance in autumn. The highest abundance, richness, and diversity of Cicadomorpha were observed in vineyards. However, these parameters (abundance, richness and diversity) significantly differed between the agroecosystem and sampling period. Further research on how the composition of the vegetation cover shapes the Cicadomorpha community is essential to implement strategies to reduce the spread of insect‐borne pathogens if they are introduced into agroecosystems.",

The beetles were sampled using sticky traps attached to the tree trunk at three tree parts (i.e., the trunk base, middle part of the trunk, and trunk in crown). Each tree part was sampled using two sticky traps facing opposite cardinal directions (north and south). In total, 4063 individuals representing 169 taxa of saproxylic beetles were yielded in the 1405 obtained samples. Remarkable interstrata diversification of saproxylic beetle assemblages reflecting distribution of breeding substrates in the forest stand was observed. Overall, species richness decreased considerably from the trunk base to the crown, with intermediate values for the middle part of the trunk. However, the abundance of mycetophages and saproxylophages decreased from the trunk base to the crown, with xylophages being the most abundant in the tree crown. The cardinal direction exhibited overall weak effects on abundance, species richness, and composition, but the occurrence of a few particular species was significantly associated with the south (13 species) or north (3 species) facing part of the trunk. Our results suggest that primary attraction and random landing strategies are combined during the substrate selection by many species. High variability in the importance of the studied explanatory variables was observed among taxa, which shows how the species composition recorded in any study might alter its general outcomes.",

The modified Nordlander trap is suitable for potential H. abietis mass trapping as an instrument of integrated pest management. Two field trials testing different attractant compositions showed that a simple attractant combination of (−)‐α‐pinene and ethanol is as effective as other more complex combinations and thus preferable for mass trapping efforts. The addition of the monoterpenes camphene, Δ‐3‐carene, ocimene and terpinolene to the combination of (−)‐α‐pinene and ethanol did not increase trapping numbers significantly. Trapping numbers of H. abietis indicate that a reduction of the local H. abietis population by trapping is possible, though further research about the influence of mass trapping on regeneration damage is recommended.",

We found a strong positive relationship between the densities of flea beetles of the genus Phyllotreta in the summer and autumn activity period of the previous year and crop feeding injury caused by flea beetles in spring oilseed rape the following year. Autumn weather or the total cover of spring oilseed rape in the study region did not improve the prediction further.

Understanding the effects of elevation and other forest characteristics on saproxylic and non‐saproxylic Coleoptera is a step towards predicting the future of taxonomic and functional group biodiversity at the tree‐line and on mountains. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of elevation and other forest characteristics on the biodiversity of montane Coleoptera at the tree‐line using both taxonomic and functional feeding guild classifications. Our results suggest that abundance of saprotrophs is closely linked to the density of large trees rather than the volume of wood. Edge effects and elevation seem to drive abundance patterns of some species and also influence taxonomic and functional guild community patterns differently. Finally, we discuss the implications of climate change and land abandonment to future Coleoptera community structure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The ambrosia beetle Platypus quercivorus is a vector of a pathogenic fungus that causes Japanese oak wilt. Its host is Fagaceae trees; however, these beetles also erroneously bore into unsuitable, non‐host tree species, which can be affected by neighbouring host tree species and the size of the non‐host. We attached sticky sheets to the host and non‐host tree species of P. quercivorus and counted the number of beetles that landed weekly, in a season of beetle dispersal. We quantified the density of the host canopy above, the basal area of surrounding hosts and the diameter at breast height (DBH) of each non‐host tree. The host canopy density affected the probability of beetles landing on non‐hosts, and the host basal area and non‐host DBH affected the number of beetles landing on non‐hosts. Thus, P. quercivorus is probably initially attracted to a dense host canopy, secondly attracted to the high density of the host and thereafter aggregate onto thick trees, including non‐host species. The number of beetles landing on the surrounding host also affected beetle landing on the non‐hosts, suggesting that landing on non‐hosts is an error that occurs in high frequency during the seasons when many beetles land on the hosts.",

Cashew orchards are managed under irrigated and unirrigated conditions, and pesticides are applied manually (hand sprayer) or by a tractor‐powered sprayer. The chestnut moth Anacampsis phytomiella (Lepidoptera: Gelechiidae) is the primary pest that attacks cashew chestnuts, causing losses of up to 53% in yield in the orchards. Sampling plans and economic injury levels ( EILs ) are part of the decision‐making systems of integrated pest management ( IPM ) programmes. The EIL varies according to the method of insecticide spraying (hand sprayer or tractor) and in irrigated and unirrigated cashew orchards. This study aimed to determine the EIL and a sequential sampling plan for A. phytomiella in cashew orchards. Decision‐making systems were determined using data collected from 44 orchards over 3 years. EILs ranged from 0.53 to 1.53 for chestnuts attacked by the pest in bunches with 10 chestnuts, depending on irrigation and insecticide spray methods. The sequential sampling plan was validated using field‐collected data (providing correct decisions in 100% of the fields and an average time saving of 83.65%), operational characteristic ( OC ) and average sample number curves. In conclusion, determined decision‐making systems can be incorporated into IPM programmes for A. phytomiella in cashew orchards, as they enable correct, rapid and cost‐effective pest control decisions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Increasing plant diversity in agroecosystems is well‐known to strengthen natural pest suppression, yet reliably predicting which non‐crop management practices best support natural enemies remains a challenge. Farmers often supplement diversity with managed flower patches or by allowing weedy non‐crop plant growth, both of which may support diverse, abundant and balanced communities of insect predators that provide biocontrol. At the same time, evenness among predators and effectiveness of biocontrol may be compromised by dominant arthropod invaders that co‐benefit from non‐crop diversity. We examined whether floral resources or adjacent weeds had stronger effects on the evenness and abundance of natural enemies by surveying plants and insects on zucchini crops at 37 organic farms. Neither flower richness nor weed richness affected insect predator evenness. Instead, the abundance of an invasive predator, the red imported fire ant ( Solenopsis invicta Buren), increased with floral resource diversity, which negatively predicted the evenness and abundance of non‐invasive predators. These results suggest that floral diversity might be a less reliable predictor of natural enemy diversity when invasive predators interfere. Habitat management recommendations for bolstering biocontrol services should consider and potentially mitigate unintended consequences of floral resource provisions on farms where invasive predators dominate.",

Propagation of trees resistant to EAB must be explored as a tool to maintain the North American ash resource. Interactions between the root and shoot of a tree may be critical to its ability to resist attack by insects and pathogens because many secondary metabolites critical to plant defence are synthesized in the roots. In the present study, we determined the extent to which grafting susceptible green ash ( Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marshall) and resistant Manchurian ash ( Fraxinus mandshurica Rupr.) affects EAB resistance in ash trees. We measured adult EAB survivorship, herbivory, fecundity and morphological tree characteristics on grafted and nongrafted green and Manchurian ash. Among grafted trees, beetles caged on grafted green ash lived four days longer and laid at least three times more eggs than beetles caged on trees with a Manchurian ash scion or rootstock. Herbivory was unaffected by graft combination. Our findings suggest that grafted trees with Manchurian ash rootstocks or scions will be more resistant to EAB than nongrafted green ash trees.",

Based on ethological and reproductive biological approaches, the mating and reproductive performances of A. aeneociliella were investigated.

Both females and males were able to mate twice. The duration of copulation decreased substantially with male mating frequency, whereas, when a previously mated female was paired with a virgin male, fecundity significantly increased.

However, the control of this wood‐boring pest with traditional methods is difficult as a result of its cryptic feeding habit. We proposed that developing host‐plant resistance is a more effective way of controlling this insect with long‐term benefits. One way of improving host‐plant resistance is to identify plant traits related to host‐plant preference of targeted insects. In the present study, we investigated the differences in feeding and oviposition preferences of B. horsfieldi on four J. regia cultivars in the field and tested whether such preferences are associated with structural and chemical traits in plant branches. The results obtained showed that the host‐plant resistance of J. regia cultivars to B. horsfieldi was related to increased wood density, higher amounts of cellulose and lignin, and higher contents of tannins, total flavonoids and total phenolics, whereas the susceptible cultivars were characterized by thicker bark, higher contents of water, sugar and soluble protein. The identified traits involved in host‐plant preference can subsequently contribute to the selection and breeding of resistant J. regia cultivars to B. horsfieldi .",

Management of this insect currently relies on seed treatment with neonicotinoids and spraying with chlorpyrifos and pyrethroid insecticides. These practices can generate severe external costs, including human health, the environment and biodiversity. Trap cropping is one alternative option to protect brassica seedlings from N. huttoni . Trap crop species evaluated in field cage experiments were: alyssum ( Lobularia maritima L. Desvauxcv. Benthamii White), wheat ( Triticum aestivum L. cv. Morph), coriander ( Coriandrum sativum L. cv. Santo) and clover ( Trifolium repens L. cv. Nomad). These were compared with kale ( Brassica oleracea L. cv. Kestrel).

All of these were compared to kale ( B. oleracea ). Alyssum and wheat were the most favoured potential trap plants for N. huttoni . Results indicated that two treatments: alyssum (used as a single trap crop) or ‘alyssum plus wheat’ (a multiple trap crop), may be useful in brassica fields to protect the seedlings from N. huttoni damage. Such a trap cropping protocol potentially reduces pesticide use in forage brassicas and can also deliver multiple ecosystem services such as biological control of insect pests.",

To better understand the ecological requirements of this species, a detailed observational study was conducted at a site in the west of Ireland possessing naturally occurring T. elata populations. Comparison of local patches where T. elata were recovered revealed no association with plant community composition. Taller dead vegetation was associated with T. elata presence throughout the site. Within the area of greatest T. elata aggregation, there was a significantly greater percentage cover of dead vegetation where T. elata occurred. Abundance of T. elata was also significantly correlated to hedgerow proximity.

We used an aerial lift platform to sample a temperate floodplain forest canopy during two seasons. We aimed to describe patterns of aphid density and diversity in terms of vertical canopy stratification within a 0.2 ha forest plot. Vertical gradient affected both the density and diversity of aphids. There was no general pattern in aphid distribution that applied to the eight tree species included in our survey. The aphid taxocoenosis was stratified differently on particular tree species and changed during the season. Species composition was better explained by aboveground absolute position (in m), while aphid density was better explained by relative height in the tree (position in the crown). Considering that these factors were significant but that the same statistical models excluding any influence of relative or absolute position provided more robust explanations, we concluded that aphid spatial distribution in temperate forests is difficult to simplify. This likely depends on environmental factors, such as wind direction and strength, that affect aphid flight and landing.",

One hour after inoculation, we detected an enrichment of BCA in the flowers of the receiver trees and this for each tested pipfruit. The distribution of BCA from treated to untreated flowers was homogenous between the receiver trees for ‘Svatava’, while significantly different loads were detected for both ‘Conference’ and ‘Jonagold’, which might be due to differences in environmental factors, and/or bee characteristics. More research is needed to understand the distribution dynamics of BCAs by pollinators in field conditions, such as in commercial orchards or crop fields, and how this could result in an efficient control.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Leptocybe invasa is native to Australia and induces galls on various species of Eucalyptus . Two genetically distinct lineages of this wasp have been detected outside its native range, namely, Leptocybe Lineage A and Leptocybe Lineage B. The parasitoid Selitrichodes neseri was released in South Africa as a biological control agent against L. invasa . Another parasitoid of L. invasa , Quadrastichus mendeli , as well as Megastigmus zebrinus (parasitoid) and Megastigmus pretorianensis (role unknown), have also been recorded emerging from L. invasa galls. The objective of this study was to investigate the interactions between the different hymenopterans associated with L. invasa galls in South Africa. L. invasa galls were dissected and species‐specific primers and restriction enzymes were used to identify the larvae where interactions were noted. S. neseri , Q. mendeli and M. zebrinus were confirmed to parasitize Leptocybe Lineage A, and S. neseri was confirmed to parasitize Leptocybe Lineage B. Furthermore, there were direct interactions between these parasitoids, where parasitoids were found parasitising each other. The gall forming experiment confirmed that M. pretorianensis is not a gall former, but other potential roles remain uncertain.",

    "abstract": "The giant willow aphid Tuberolachnus salignus is an invasive pest in New Zealand, attacking over 50 species and hybrids of willow. The aphids produce copious amounts of honeydew, which is used by other insects as a food source. When foraged by honeybees, T. salignus honeydew causes honey to crystallize in the comb and affects bee health; these effects are associated with the elevated melezitose content in the honeydew. The impact of host plant‐related factors on T. salignus honeydew melezitose content remains unknown. This study investigated the effect of willow cultivar and plant age on the melezitose content (and that of other sugars) of T. salignus honeydew. To do so, we conducted high‐performance liquid chromatography analyses of honeydew samples from 13 willow clones collected in the same season (autumn) from 1‐ and 2‐year old plants under field conditions. Melezitose was the most abundant of the measured sugars in most samples, but its content did not vary significantly with willow cultivar or plant age. By contrast, sucrose was significantly affected by both factors. Fructose and glucose were significantly impacted by willow plant age and cultivar, respectively. A significant cultivar*age interaction was observed for all sugars. We recommend the selection of resistant willow cultivars and further research on potential biocontrol agents to lessen melezitose‐related problems in apiculture industries.",

Although unstable, this pheromone may have utility for monitoring the seasonal abundance and flight phenology of adult P. marginata , as well as for developing control tactics, such as disorienting mate‐seeking males. Experiments conducted in raspberry and blackberry crops tested the effect of lure and trap attributes on captures of male P. marginata . Increasing lure loads (10, 100 or 1000 µg) of E 3, Z 13‐18:Ald significantly increased trap captures. Freshly prepared lures were significantly more attractive than lures aged for 2–10 days at room temperature. White wing traps and white delta traps were more effective than green delta or green bucket traps. Trap height in the crop canopy had no effect on the capture of males. When sex pheromone components of three other sesiid moth species were added to E 3, Z 13‐18: A ld, the attraction of male P. marginata was reduced and, thus, these components were identified as pheromone antagonists. Pheromone‐based mass trapping with 25 wing traps per hectare reduced captures of males in traps baited with a low‐dose (10 µg) pheromone lure by 67–87% in 2011.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Natural control of apple blossom weevil, Anthonomus pomorum (L.), deserves attention, as the pest is regaining importance with the declining use of non‐selective pesticides in apple and pear orchards. In this study the biology of Centistes delusorius (Förster), a specific parasitoid of adult apple blossom weevil, is investigated. The parasitoid hibernates as young larva in an adult weevil, and juvenile development is resumed in early spring. The fully grown parasitoid larvae leave their hosts during full bloom at the end of April and early May, to pupate. The adults emerging in May oviposit into the newly emerged weevils, which initially feed on apple leaves. Centistes delusorius was detected in six out of 15 host‐weevil infested orchards, but was only common in two with larger apple trees standing in grass. There, parasitism levels of around 30% were usual in hosts taken from treebands in winter. The delicate larva is vulnerable, and the thin cocoon provides little protection against either desiccation or drowning on a weedless orchard floor. Observations indicate that successful pupation of C. delusorius demands stable humid conditions and some shelter, such as that found in grass or woodland soils. Parasitoid females, provided with honey, lived for a mean of 6.3 ± 2.1 days under outdoor conditions in June. Their life span was similar whether they had access to and oviposited in hosts, or not. The species is pro‐ovigenic, and potential fecundity is about 40 eggs. Oviposition usually takes a few seconds. Parasitized female hosts do not reproduce. Up to 95% of the parasitoid eggs laid in May develop into a second generation, the adults of which appear in July, when the host has entered aestivation. Older (British) records of C. delusorius outside orchards suggest that some parasitized hosts, like the healthy ones, leave the orchard prior to aestivo‐hibernation, so that the latter do not escape parasitoid attack in July. A trapping sample in late June, when most non‐parasitized weevils have gone into aestivo‐hibernation, is probably the most efficient method to detect parasitized weevils. The (near‐)absence of C. delusorius in many orchards is probably due not only to pesticide side‐effects, or scarcity of its host, but also to the absence of suitable pupation sites for the wasp.",

The survival of the overwintering stage of M. ochroptera and post‐ emergence longevity and fecundity of adults in sesbania fallows in eastern Zambia were quantified. 2 Only adult M. ochroptera survived during the winter (May–August) and the dry season (September–October) hidden under weeds, plant litter, in soil cracks and under rocks. During these periods, some beetles were occasionally found feeding on S. sesban , particularly in natural stands in humid areas. The adults were parasitized by the braconid Perilitus larvicida van Achterberg at a rate of 8.5–16.4%. The beetles stayed in the winter refuges for up to 210 days and emerged with the first heavy rains in October–November. The effective survival of beetles overwintering in an insectary was 18.1% in 1998 and 37.7% in 1999, and that of beetles overwintering in the field was estimated at 0.4 and 2.8% in 1998 and 1999, respectively. 3 The post‐emergence longevity and oviposition period of females in the insectary was 14–31 days and 5–29 days, respectively. The post‐emergence fecundity varied from 87 to 783. 4 It is concluded that the serious M. ochroptera infestation observed every year following the rains is due to synchronous emergence of overwintered resident adult populations and their high capacity for reproduction on many species of Sesbania . Recommendations for pest management in sesbania planted‐fallows are given.",

However, little is known about LCA response in grassland biome. Agriculture and commercial forestry typically introduce closed habitats and displace pioneer vegetation when occurring in grasslands. The aim of this study was to assess the response of LCA to different land use types developed in a grassland biome. Semi‐natural grassland remnants, soybean crops, cattle pastures and young and mature eucalypt plantations were sampled in Entre Ríos, Argentina. LCA nest abundance and occurrence of workers was obtained by hand sampling and baited pitfall traps. LCA nest abundance significantly decreased in most land use types when compared with the grassland sites. All habitat types were characterized by the presence of different LCA species, which showed different associations with temperature, vegetation and soil structure. Our results suggest that LCA response to human disturbance depends on the biome where it occurs; contrary to what was observed in forests, the LCA assemblage was negatively associated to human disturbance in grasslands. The response of the whole assemblage masked different responses of LCA species, possibly indicating differences in their ecological niche.",

Here, we examined the genetic diversity of this important pest using specimens intercepted by Beijing Customs District P. R. in China from 41 countries and regions. We used segments of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and the nuclear gene elongation factor 1‐alpha to examine population genetic structure in this species. Our results showed that genetic diversity is low in S. mangiferae , with a mean genetic distance of 0.095–0.14%. Other population genetic parameters also indicated a low level of genetic diversity among samples from a large geographic range. Analysis of molecular variance revealed little population genetic structure, and mismatch distribution analyses provided evidence of a population expansion, although other demographic metrics of population expansion were nonsignificant. We suggest that the observed low level of genetic diversity and population genetic structure in S. mangiferae supports the hypothesis that the population genetics of this species has been impacted by anthropogenic transportation of mangoes and weevils.",

Weaver ant colonies provide well‐protected and resource‐rich environments for many associated trophobionts, thereby boosting their establishment on host plants. There is very little published literature on O. longinoda , their hosts plants and their associated trophobionts in West Africa. These tri‐trophic interactions were studied over a period of four consecutive years (2010–2013) from south to north Benin. Our fieldwork revealed that all O. longinoda colonies were consistently associated with trophobionts . Oecophylla longinoda nests were recorded on 82 plant species belonging to 30 families, with 35 associated trophobiont species representing 11 families. Among cultivated plants, Mangifera indica was the most common species hosting O. longinoda , while Sarcocephalus latifolius the most frequent native one. Among trophobionts, Parasaissetia nigra , Udinia catori , Udinia farquharsoni (Coccidae) and Stictococcus sjostedti (Stictococcidae) were the most common hemipterans associated with O. longinoda . We identified a wide range of host plants that could be preserved (or planted) to promote the establishment of weaver ants to control different insect pests in fruit plantations in sub‐Saharan Africa. When planted around fruit plantations with their nests and tended hemipterans, these host plants could facilitate biocontrol of mango fruit flies (Tephritidae) and cashew bugs (Coreidae, Miridae), by O. longinoda in the fruit plantations.",

We placed flight intercept traps in the canopy and understory areas of three climatically different forest types across a large elevation gradient and focussed on two important wood‐boring beetles, longhorn and bark beetles, in Yunnan, Southwest China. 3. The results showed that species richness and abundance of two selected wood‐boring beetles between the canopy and understory areas had different patterns across the climatically different forest vegetation types. Bark and longhorn beetles tended to stay in understory and canopy areas, respectively, based on the recorded abundance data. However, richness data showed different responses to the climatically different forest types for both longhorn and bark beetles assemblages. Bark beetles species richness did not significantly differ between the canopy and understory areas across all three forest types in the present study. Longhorn beetles had significantly higher richness values in the canopy areas of tropical and subtropical forests but lower in temperate forest. 4. The community compositions of both the longhorn and bark beetles varied greatly among forest vegetation types but relatively little between the canopy and understory areas across the vegetation types. Thus, considering different heights and positions in different forests during trap deployment is necessary and needed to optimize wood‐boring pest control strategies when various forest types and pests are targeted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Climate change is facilitating a novel range expansion of southern pine beetle (SPB) into globally rare north‐eastern pitch pine barrens. By assessing stand conditions present in SPB‐infested and uninfested pitch pine stands on Long Island, NY, USA, we developed a regionally‐calibrated hazard rating model that predicts stand‐level SPB susceptibility. The model indicates that a stand's SPB susceptibility increases with (1) increasing pitch pine basal area, (2) increasing instances of previous year SPB spots nearby, and (3) sandy soil texture. The model informs adaptation strategies to a novel pest dynamic by supporting the identification and prioritization of high hazard stands for prevention management. An alignment between treatments effective in reducing SPB vulnerability and conserving pine barrens communities indicates that pine barrens can be managed both to improve resilience to future threats and preserve historic ecological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Apple growers have pursued the use of exclusion netting to reduce pesticide inputs and maintain control of codling moth. It is uncertain if these nets provide a physical or behavioural behaviour, and if they prevent codling moth establishment. To address this, we conducted field trials testing the ability of commercial netting to exclude codling moth using small (3 trees) and large (48 trees) cages. Experiments were conducted to evaluate both the permeability by releasing marked sterile moths either inside or outside the small cages, and the establishment of wild codling moth in the large cages. Results from the small cage study showed that netting reduced codling moth movement out of the netted plots, but virtually prevented codling moth dispersal into the plots. Codling moth capture inside the large cage plots was significantly less than in uncaged plots, but no differences were found in codling moth damage at harvest. These results indicate that the netting is physically permeable to codling moth adults; however, it acts as a behavioural barrier to moth immigration. These outcomes agree with existing literature that net enclosures can provide a non‐insecticidal tool to improve codling moth management, although it may not be a stand‐alone technique.",

    "abstract": "We are pleased to present the first issue of Agricultural and Forest Entomology. This journal joins the other entomological journals of the Royal Entomological Society published by Blackwell Science, namely Ecological Entomology, Medical and Veterinary Entomology, Physiological Entomology, Insect Molecular Biology and Systematic Entomology. We look forward to working with a large international Editorial Board and Blackwell Science to produce Agricultural and Forest Entomology. Why launch a journal devoted to Agricultural and Forest Entomology? The problems caused by insect pests to agriculture and forestry have been with us as long as crops have been grown, but as both human populations and the consequential demand for food, timber and other products rise, the potentially damaging impact of pests has never been greater. Our ability to deal with insect pests has also increased as research on insect biology, systematics, physiology and ecology has provided a basis for managing them. The development, amongst other things, of insecticides, resistant crop varieties and biological control techniques has also led to dramatic improvements in the management of insect pests. However, insect pests are still a major obstacle to the harvesting of natural resources. This is partly due to the emergence of new pests, particularly as a result of the growth of non-native crops and the accidental introduction of non-native insects. There are many well-known cases of the latter problem, such as the gypsy moth (discussed here by Sharov et al. ) and the winter moth in North America. These and many other insect pests have been introduced from Europe. Less commonly, native insects become pests of non-native crop species but the result can be just as devastating, as illustrated by the damage caused by the pine beauty moth to lodgepole pine (a North American conifer) in the UK. Although new pest problems are constantly appearing, many ‘old’ pests continue to damage agricultural and forest crops. Papers on two of these pests appear in this issue: spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana (Cappuccino, Houle & Stein) and mahogany shoot borer Hypsipyla grandella (Newton et al. ). Despite considerable research aimed at managing these insects, the spruce budworm is still perhaps the most destructive forest pest in North America (Cappuccino et al. ), and mahogany shoot borers (Hypsipyla spp.) are arguably the most serious pests of tropical timber tree species. The continual threat posed by insect pests means that research on Agricultural and Forest Entomology has never been more important. Clearly there is a need for research on the biology of novel pests (e.g. Sage et al. ) and their impact (e.g. Stadler & Michalzik). To avoid the mistakes of the past and develop sound management of pests in the future, we need to know more about the ecology of most pest species. Research on both novel approaches to controlling pests and the possible side-effects of different methods of pest control (e.g. Thomas & Meats) is required. Agricultural and Forest Entomology will publish the best papers on these topics. Agricultural and Forest Entomology will publish papers relevant to the control of insect and other arthropod pests, including papers on biology, ecology, impact and management of pests of forest, agricultural and horticultural pests. Papers on the management of insect pests will include the development and use of techniques such as plant resistance, pheromones, biological control, the economics of pest control, and the use of silvicultural and crop management techniques for managing pests. Papers on the biology and ecology of insect pests (and their natural enemies) underpinning the development of pest management will also be published in Agricultural and Forest Entomology (e.g. Dickens; Smits & Larsson; Way et al. ). Papers relating to insect pests and their management in agricultural and forest crops in all parts of the world, including the tropics, will be welcome. We sincerely invite you to submit manuscripts to Agricultural and Forest Entomology. Scientific reports, short critical comments and longer reviews will all be considered (but please consult the Editors before submitting a longer review). If you have any comments, queries or suggestions please do not hesitate to contact the Editors or a member of the Editorial Board.",

The genetic variation between sites within a population was continuous and appeared to be in good agreement with geographical distances. 3 In the eastern population the variation was greater between sites than within sites, whereas in the western population the pattern of variation appeared to be the opposite. This overall greater genetic variation in the eastern population could be due to its having been colonized earlier than the western one. 4 The study also demonstrated a close relationship between the green spruce aphid in Iceland and aphids from Denmark, which agrees with their assumed origin. The differences in introduction time, adaptation and competitiveness between the two Icelandic populations are discussed.",

    "abstract": "With the publication of the first issue of Volume Two, the time is right to look back over the first year of Agricultural and Forest Entomology. Papers in the four issues of the first volume of AFE focused on a wide variety of arthropod pests, a diversity of cropping systems, and a range of options for pest management. Studies relating to both agricultural and forest crops were reported, including potato, wheat, soybean, rice, hops, olives and citrus crops, and a range of timber species including spruces, pines, Eucalyptus and Iroko (Milicia excelsa). A paper in this issue also considers insects in managed natural forest (Shapiro & Pickering, pp. 39–47). A wide range of pest taxa was considered, including locusts, grasshoppers, aphids, psyllids, planthoppers, leafminers, coneworms, weevils, bark beetles and spider mites. We are particularly pleased that the first volume included papers on major agricultural pests such as the Mediterranean fruit fly, Ceratitis capitata, the diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, and the rice brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, and major forest pests such as the spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana and the mahogany shoot borer Hypsipyla grandella. Studies pertinent to a wide range of pest management strategies were included such as plant resistance, the use of sex pheromones, biological control by predators, parasitoids and pathogens (see also Long et al. pp. 11–17, 25–38), and the use of plant species mixtures in both agricultural and forest cropping systems. Papers considered the biology, genetics and ecology of pest species. Several papers on insect ecology dealt with studies on interactions between pests and their host plants, pests and their natural enemies, and interactions involving all three trophic levels. The latter included a paper on the olfactory responses of generalist and specialist predators of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, to host plant volatiles and, in this issue, a study of the effect of resistant cabbage cultivars on the susceptibility of the diamondback moth to Bacillus thuringiensis (Schuler & Van Embden, pp. 19–24). Several papers in the first volume of AFE focused on developing pest problems such as the spread of gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar, in the U.S.A. and the recent invasion of the green spruce aphid, Elatobium abietinum, to Iceland. Many papers, unsurprisingly, considered long-established pests but they frequently focused on novel approaches to their study and management. For example, papers considered the use of modelling to assess the value of intercropping and trap cropping, host thermal biology as a key to understanding microbial pest control (see also Blanford et al. pp. 3–10), the control of Colorado potato beetle by pheromone-mediated augmentation of predation and the ‘vaccination’ of trees against attack by bark beetles. AFE also included papers on the possible indirect impacts of agricultural and silvicultural practices on arthropods found in agroecosystems and forests. These included studies on the possible impact on non-target insects of parasitoids introduced to control pest species, and the effects of insecticides on ground-dwelling arthropods in orchards. Thus, in its first year, AFE covered important studies on the full range of agricultural and forest entomology, from the biology of pests to the economic evaluation of different management options, and the side-effects of the way agricultural crops and forests are managed. Moreover, it has done so by frequently focusing on the most exciting new developments in this field of entomology. We therefore believe that Agricultural and Forest Entomology has already become an important new journal for the rapid publication of good papers on research on agricultural and forest entomology. This view is supported by the response of the scientific community, with papers appearing in the early issues of AFE already being cited in manuscripts published in a variety of journals. Against a background of ever increasing numbers of high quality manuscripts being submitted to the journal each month, AFE is becoming the natural home for the leading research papers in the field. We hope to continue to receive manuscripts on some of your best research and to ensure that it reaches a wide and appreciative audience.",

The phenological timing of the insect life stages very closely tracks the phenological phases of its host plant, primarily focusing on the most nutritious host stage in terms of larval performance.",

Phytobia betulae Kangas (Diptera: Agromyzidae), a miner of differentiating xylem, infests birch ( Betula pendula Roth and Betula pubescens Ehrh.) trees. 2 In a field experiment we measured successful ovipositions in the long shoots of eight 5‐year‐old‐birch genotypes. Later in the growing season, in the same experiment, we counted the number of larvae from the same birch genotypes (different replicates). 3 We attempted to determine where Phytobia females lay their eggs in the birch canopy, what kind of shoots Phytobia utilize, whether birch genotypes differ in their susceptibility to Phytobia , and which tree characteristics correlate with successful utilization of birch for oviposition and larval development. 4 The ovipositions were concentrated in fast growing shoots and only 5% of the available shoots were utilized. Usually a shoot contained only one oviposition (80% of the cases). However, oviposition pattern resulted in significant aggregations (two to four ovipositions per shoot): 11% of shoots selected for oviposition contained more than one Phytobia and 22% of larvae shared their shoot with at least one other larva. Although birch shoots were much more abundant than Phytobia , there may be intraspecific competition for host resources among Phytobia . 5 Birch genotypes differed in the number of ovipositions but not in the number of larvae, although in general the number of larvae was correlated positively with the number of ovipositions. There were more ovipositions in the faster growing genotypes.",

Although gypsy moths are invasive in North America, several native predators, such as white‐footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ), other small mammals and invertebrates, help keep gypsy moth populations at nondestructive levels. The present study investigated whether the small mammal community and gypsy moth predation rates were affected by the type of mechanical forest thinning method (bulldozer, masticator, shear cutter) used during an oak savanna restoration at two sites in Michigan within the suppression zone in 2010 and 2011. Predation rates on gypsy moth pupae were higher in bulldozer and shear cutter thinned compared with control plots at both sites in 2010. White‐footed mice relative abundance was significantly higher in thinned compared with control plots at one site in 2010 and 2011. Thinning maintained or promoted white‐footed mice abundance, which will maintain or enhance predation on gypsy moth pupae during oak savanna restoration.",

The fresh weight of adults and the number of eggs laid by S. japonicum were highest for cucumber and lowest for tobacco. The egg hatch rate was lowest for tobacco and highest for tomato.

Previous studies have shown deer browse on non‐crop plants affects insect density and insect‐mediated leaf damage, which together reduce plant reproductive output. In soybeans, reproductive output is influenced by direct and indirect interactions of different herbivores. Here, we quantified indirect interactions between two groups of herbivores (mammals and insects) and their effects on soybean growth and yield. We examined responses of insect pest communities along a gradient of deer herbivory (29% to 49% browsed stems) in soybean monocultures. Structural equation models showed that deer browse had direct negative effects on soybean plant height and yield. Deer browse indirectly decreased insect‐mediated leaf damage by reducing plant height. Deer browse also indirectly increased pest insect abundance through reductions in plant height. Similarly, deer herbivory had an indirect positive effect on leaf carbon: nitrogen ratios through changes in plant height, thereby decreasing leaf nutrition. These results suggest that pest insect abundance may be greater on soybean plants in areas of higher deer browse, but deer browse may reduce insect herbivory through reduced leaf nutrition.",

Therefore, in the present study, the influence of partial cutting on hemlock looper Lambdina fiscellaria (Guenée) (Lepidoptera: Geometridae) parasitism is studied by comparing two cutting intensities (25% and 40% reduction of stand basal area) against controls. Laboratory reared hemlock looper pupae are periodically exposed in each plot to determine parasitism rates for a period of 3 years after partial cutting treatments. Two and three years after partial cutting, wild hemlock looper larvae are also collected in the same plots. Malaise traps and meteorological data loggers are installed to measure the influence of partial cutting on parasitoid abundance and microclimate. Parasitism of hemlock looper pupae is significantly lower in plots with the higher partial cutting intensity compared with control plots. Also temperature and humidity, as well as the number of Apechthis ontario (Cresson) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) females in plots, are significantly influenced by partial cutting. However, only mean and minimum temperature can significantly explain parasitism of hemlock looper pupae. To sustain parasitism rates in forest stands vulnerable to hemlock looper defoliation at naturally high levels, it is recommended to refrain from partial cutting or to conduct this treatment at intensities lower than 40%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The jack pine budworm C horistoneura pinus pinus is a defoliator distributed throughout the range of jack pine P inus banksiana in N orth A merica. Jack pine budworm feeds primarily on jack pine. More than 2400 hectares of defoliation of red pine P inus resinosa were noted during an outbreak of C . pinus pinus from 2004–2008 in M innesota and W isconsin, U.S.A . Defoliation of red pine across thousands of hectares, detectable during aerial surveys, is a significant deviation from historical records. Fifty‐six study plots were established across 15 counties of M innesota and W isconsin to quantify densities and impacts of jack pine budworm in locations showing defoliation of both red pine and jack pine. Populations of jack pine budworm on red pine behaved similarly to those on jack pine, consuming pollen cones and vegetative shoots. The mean number of egg masses per branch and per site was greater on red pine than on jack pine at study sites in M innesota and W isconsin, respectively. It is not known what led to the outbreak of jack pine budworm on red pine, nor is it clear whether landscape‐scale defoliation of this magnitude represents an isolated incident or a shift in relative host use. Hypotheses regarding the mechanisms behind this alternative host use by jack pine budworm are discussed.",

However, there are numerous discrepancies in their efficacy against pests and, more interestingly, in their side effects on natural enemies. In the present study, we used the citrus key pest Aonidiella aurantii Maskell (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) and its main parasitoid Aphytis melinus DeBach (Hymenoptera: Aphelinedae) as models to evaluate both the lethal and sublethal effects of four commercial PDSO on different instars of the herbivore, as well as on the adult and immature stages of the parasitoid. The four PDSOs displayed similarly high mortalities against young instars of A. aurantii. However, most adult females survived all PDSO applications, and the fecundity of the surviving females was not altered. PDSOs were harmless to the parasitoid A. melinus because the survival (acute toxicity), longevity and fecundity of the surviving adults (sublethal effects) were not affected. Similarly, immature emergence was not affected by any of the four PDSOs after spraying the parasitized hosts. Overall, the results of the present study confirm the environmental-friendly profile of PDSOs against natural enemies and demonstrate a similar performance for PDSOs when they were correctly sprayed under the same conditions.",

    "abstract": "Summary 1 The accidental introduction of the Asian strain of gypsy moth (AGM) Lymantria dispar (L.) to New Zealand poses a major threat to New Zealand's forestry industry. To aid eradication and control decisions in the event of its establishment, a model was developed for the effect of nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) as biological control for AGM in New Zealand. 2 The model simulates within‐ and between‐season gypsy moth population dynamics, including temperature‐dependent development, density dependence through predation and resource limitation, and interactions with NPV. 3 Following its introduction to New Zealand, AGM is predicted to increase more quickly and have more severe outbreaks than the European strain. In the absence of predators, the model predicts initial outbreaks then damped oscillations to an equilibrium. 4 In the model, a single application of NPV (2500 GPIB ha −1 ) at the time of maximum larval density gave up to 80% suppression of peak larval densities in the following year. The same level of suppression was achieved in the absence of predators. 5 In the long term, the model predicted that spraying when an outbreak was just beginning gave best results (a 50–70% reduction of the following two outbreaks). Simulation of threshold spraying resulted in NPV application, on average, every 7 years and suppression of outbreak densities by 40–70%. Following a single application, NPV was maintained in the population as a classical biological control agent, giving approximately a 20% reduction in outbreak densities. 6 Eradication of AGM using NPV was possible if larval densities were very low.",

Many species in the Heliothinae subfamily have developed resistance to insecticides and insecticidal proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Managing resistance to these control tactics in H. gelotopoeon is of high importance and dependant on knowledge of population genetics of this species. The objective of this study was to evaluate the genetic variability and structure of H. gelotopoeon populations from different host plants and geographic regions of Argentina. Towards this goal, six microsatellite loci were screened across 196 individuals. The results obtained revealed high genetic diversity and lack of clear structure among the populations of H. gelotopoeon studied. This genetic homogeneity between populations from different geographical regions and hosts could be attributed to the long‐range migratory capacity of Heliothinae and the generalist behaviour of H. gelotopoeon .",

We investigated the damage caused by these weevils feeding on seedlings of seven tree species planted in clear‐cuts and under shelterwoods with three densities (control, dense, and sparse). 2 There were no pronounced differences in damage caused by short‐snouted weevils in the various shelterwood densities. Most feeding occurred in the clear‐cuts during the first year, whereas more seedlings were damaged in the shelterwoods of all densities in the second year. In the third year, virtually no feeding occurred in either the clear‐cuts or shelterwoods. We cannot explain this pattern of damage, but a fallow period of 2 years seems to prevent short‐snouted weevil damage. 3 We determined the general feeding preferences for short‐snouted weevils to be cherry, lime &gt; beech, oak, spruce &gt; maple, ash. However, although Strophosoma mellanogrammum [Correction added after online publication 8 December 2008: Strophosoma melanogrammum corrected to Strophosoma mellanogrammum ] was observed feeding on seedlings, no full short‐snouted weevil inventory was conducted, so caution must be exercised when drawing conclusions from this study regarding weevil damage patterns and feeding preferences. 4 Short‐snouted weevils can sometimes occur in large numbers and may destroy entire reforestation projects, but in our study their influence on seedling growth and survival was minor.",

    "abstract": "We are celebrating 10 years of Agricultural and Forest Entomology by selecting a few of the papers that demonstrate the breadth of entomological science published in the journal. In the last 10 years, Agricultural and Forest Entomology has published papers on a wide range of agricultural and forest pests, such as the Colorado beetle (Dickens, 1999), Myzus persicae (Cocu et al., 2005), Hylobius abietis (Rose et al., 2005) and the spruce bark beetle (Schroeder, 2007). With a major focus on pests and their management, the journal has, for example, considered ways of monitoring pests (Cocu et al., 2005), the behavioural and genetic adaptation to insecticides (Rose et al., 2005; Kazachkova et al., 2007) and the development of biological control (Van Mele, 2008). Many studies published over the past decade involve the natural enemies of pests, including parasitoids (Irvin et al., 2006) and predators (Shah et al., 2003). The latter have also included studies on olfactory adaptations of different types of predator (Dickens, 1999) and their response to the outbreaks of pests (Schroeder, 2007). Agricultural and Forest Entomology also considers the relationships between pests and their host plants, including the development of methods for studying hitherto difficult groups, such as root-feeding insects (Johnson et al., 2007) and the impact of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide on plant–insect interactions (Hunter, 2001). In the years since Agricultural and Forest Entomology was launched, there has been a growing awareness of the loss of biodiversity, the importance of agroecosystems and forests in its conservation (Jacobs et al., 2007) and the value of enhancing biodiversity for managing pests (Irvin et al., 2006). There have also been changes in the ways that crops are grown and forests are managed: Agricultural and Forest Entomology has considered, for example, the impact of organic crops for the management of pests (Shah et al., 2003). In the 11th year of Agricultural and Forest Entomology, there is a rising concern about the ability of our crops to supply the food, fuel and other services that we depend upon. Insect pests have always threatened our crops but the appearance of new pests (Smith et al., 2007), exacerbated by a changing climate (Hunter, 2001), the potential environmental and health risks associated with some control options (Kazachkova et al., 2007) and our failure to fully capitalise on other options (Van Mele, 2008), highlights the undeniable fact that agricultural and forest entomology has never been so important. We thank the many authors and reviewers who have contributed to Agricultural and Forest Entomology over the last 10 years and look forward to your continued support.",

No significant variations were recorded in terms of preoviposition period, oviposition period, oviposition rate, total eggs, hatching success, larval survival and adult emergence when M . boninensis was reared on both hosts. However, all larval instars and pupal development time, as well as adult longevity, were significantly shorter when M . boninesis was reared on H . theivora . We also provide the first report on the predatory potential of M . boninensis against H . theivora . The feeding efficiency of M . boninensis increased with the advancement of each developmental stage. The third‐instar larvae of M . boninensis consumed more H . theivora individuals (28.4 ± 1.50) than the first (7 ± 1.11) and second (24.2 ± 1.81) instars over its entire duration. The artificial diet produced significantly superior results in terms of fecundity, hatching success, larval survival and adult emergence when M . boninensis was reared on it compared with when it was reared on H . theivora and O . coffeae . The findings of the present study indicate that M . boninensis can be effectively utilized in integrated pest management programmes for controlling some major arthropod pests of tea by suitably mass rearing them followed by augmentative release.",

Parasitoids were reared from Pissodes ‐infested Pinus radiata D . D on and Pinus patula S chiede ex S chltdl. &amp; C ham logs collected from major Pinus ‐growing regions. The identity of parasitoids was confirmed using morphological and molecular techniques. Parasitism was confirmed by analyzing gut content sequences of parasitoids. Pycnetron pix was found parasitizing Pissodes sp. throughout major Pinus ‐growing provinces of the country. Another native parasitoid, Cratocnema sp., is reported for the first time as a parasitoid of Pissodes sp. Rhopalicus tutela ( W alker), a known parasitoid of Pissodes spp. in their native range, was also detected and confirmed to be of E uropean origin. Although characterized by an erratic distribution and a low parasitism rate, an accruing suite of natural enemies was documented, suggesting that there is potential for augmentative biological control of Pissodes sp. in S outh A frica.",

Populations of all three species decreased substantially; however, the endemic Planotortrix octo and Ctenopseustis obliquana declined to a much greater extent than did the introduced Epiphyas postvittana . The two endemic species dominated in the 1970s, whereas they are now rarely found on fruit crops. Epiphyas postvittana has now become the principal leafroller species. Leafrollers damaged over 20% of apples receiving no insecticides during the 1980s but, subsequent to 2000, damage has been below 2%. Between 1994–1999 and 2008–2011, the numbers of immature leafrollers in searches on fruit crop and noncrop hosts decreased by 55%. We attribute reduced leafroller populations to increased biological control and changes to insecticide programmes. Several parasitoids were introduced around 1980 and parasitism increased by 19% between 1994–1999 and 2008–2011. Replacing broad‐spectrum insecticides with selective insecticides in the mid‐1990s likely enhanced this trend. Leafrollers were formerly major pests, whereas their status has now changed to being minor pests. Today, they are uncommon on managed and unmanaged fruit crops and noncrop host plants on orchards and vineyards in Hawke's Bay.",

The nature of this co‐occurrence and potential impacts on either of the species is unknown. Using structured sampling, we investigated the pattern and degree of co‐occurrence of S. noctilio and Pissodes sp. in six sites in P. patula plantations in South Africa aiming to better understand the potential for interactions and population‐level feedbacks. We compared density, adult body size and within‐tree distribution of both insect species in trees where they co‐occurred or occurred singly. Sirex noctilio and Pissodes sp. co‐occurred on 68.0 ± 3.8% of infested trees (range 55–80%). Both insect species were more abundant in trees where they occurred alone relative to co‐inhabited trees. The within‐tree distribution of S. noctilio did not differ in the presence of Pissodes sp.; however, in the presence of S. noctilio , Pissodes sp. were more frequent in the bottom than the middle tree section where S. noctilio was at higher density and this could be an indication of resource partitioning. Body size of S. noctilio and Pissodes sp. was not influenced by co‐occurrence. The results obtained in the present study suggest a broad overlap for both insects in preference for stressed trees in similar states of decline, as well as moderate antagonism between the species leading to lower emergence of both species in shared trees. The influence of S. noctilio on Pissodes sp. population densities may still be a net positive at a landscape scale because Pissodes sp. prefers declining or recently dead trees that are readily created by S. noctilio via attacks on healthy trees.",

Unlike processing tomatoes, deficit irrigation of fresh market tomatoes is not currently practiced. Deficit irrigation could have negative trade‐offs for yield and pest populations by changing plant nutritional values and the microenvironment. The present study compared crop response and insect populations at two field locations: an on‐farm trial with 0%, 15% and 30% water deficit treatments, and a research station trial with 0%, 10%, 20% and 30% water deficit treatments. At the on‐farm trial, water deficits of 30% affected fruit yield, leaf relative water content (RWC) and leaf δ 13 C, whereas, in the research station trial, water deficits only affected leaf RWC. Treatments did not change the abundance of any insect groups. Sap‐feeding insects such as silverleaf whitefly ( Bemisia tabaci ) increased with plant traits indicating hydration such as canopy temperature depression (CTD) and RWC. Furthermore, CTD influenced the composition of insect communities. Sap‐feeding insect abundance may vary with traits indicating hydration because of turgor pressure required for feeding, as well as a more suitable microenvironment.",

We used male gypsy moths collected from pheromone traps at intervals through the flight season to assess phenological change in wing length. Consistent with a previous study conducted at our reference site, we found that wing length declines seasonally, likely resulting from phenological reduction in host foliage quality. This pattern was evident at our reference site over 8 years, and at our experimental sites with low‐density populations in 3 years. We assessed forest quality using two unique metrics, basal area of red oak (Quercus rubra), a high quality host tree, and a composite value generated from a published ranking of tree species quality for gypsy moth. We did not find a relationship between these metrics and wing length, although we found that the mean size of males was larger in stands with oak. Mean wing length in outbreak populations was significantly smaller reflecting density related processes such as intraspecific competition, although there was no significant seasonal effect on wing length.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Body size correlates with several factors such as reproductive fitness, environmental changes, the quality and quantity of food during critical development stages, and the feeding season. For the Palearctic moths of the genus Thaumetopoea (Lepidoptera; Notodontidae), the larval development is crucial and differs between species according to their feeding season; larvae of the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea pityocampa (Denis &amp; Schiffermüller 1775) feed during winter while larvae of its congeneric cedar processionary moth Thaumetopoea bonjeani (Powell 1922) develop during summer in North Africa. This discrepancy in lifecycles leads to different reproductive traits such as egg batch length, number of eggs per batch, eggs protection mechanisms and female body size. According to Darwin's fecundity advantage hypothesis (1871), female body size should have a positive influence on reproductive fitness, since larger females supposedly have higher fecundity. The universal allometric scaling phenomenon rule proposed by Rensch (1950) predicts that the degree of sexual size dimorphism tends to decrease with the increase of female body size. Here, two morphometrical parameters that is, body size and scale size, estimated from body measurements of individuals of both species, feeding on the same host Atlantic cedar Cedrus atlantica (Manetti &amp; Carrière 1855) (Pinales; Pinaceae) in Algeria were proposed. The aim was to find out traits that might rule the competition for food and space, in particularly fecundity and body size. Results of the present study highlight a female‐biased sexual size dimorphism in both species. The positive correlation between female body size and fecundity shown in this study weakly supports Darwin's hypothesis. Finally, the intrageneric test performed leads to conclude that Rensch's rule does not hold in the considered species.",

We hypothesized that recent temperature increases may have contributed to the emergence and subsequent northward expansion of outbreaks in France. We reared P. passerinii at four temperatures to estimate its thermal requirements. We used experimental data to parametrize a mechanistic and temperature‐driven physiologically‐based demographic model. The model was used to simulate the effect of temperature on aphid dynamics and to assess the role of climate warming on the spatiotemporal dynamics of outbreaks. The lower developmental threshold was estimated at 6.4 °C and the development degree‐days at 171. Our model supports the hypothesis that recent warming may have promoted outbreaks in northern France. During recent exceptionally warm years, more than 70% of the northern poplar area was favourable for outbreaks. Our model suggests that climate warming is not the sole factor involved. The dominance of resistant poplar genotypes such as ‘Robusta’ or ‘Beaupré’ may have preserved plantations from outbreaks before 1996 in southern France and until 2000 in the central part. Other factors, including biological characteristics, biotic interactions, or precipitation should be investigated.",

Numerous bark beetle species in both Europe and North America have already responded to a warming climate by significantly expanding their geographical ranges. The aim of the current study was to investigate how populations of bark beetles within stands of Sitka spruce, a widely planted non‐native commercial plantation tree species in the U.K., were likely to respond to a warming climate. Experimental plots were established in stands of Sitka spruce over elevational gradients in two commercial forest plantations, and the abundance and emergence times of key bark beetle species were assessed over a 3‐year period using flight interception traps. The air temperature difference between the lowest and highest experimental plot in each forest was consistently &gt;1°C throughout the 3‐year period. In general, the abundance of the most dominant bark beetle species ( e.g. Trypodendron , Dryocoetes , Hylastes spp.) was higher, and emergence times tended to be earlier in the year at the lower elevation plots, where temperatures were higher, although not all bark beetle species responded in the same manner. The results of the study indicated that, under the projected future climate warming scenarios, monoculture Sitka spruce stands at low elevations may potentially be more vulnerable to significant outbreak events from existing or invasive bark beetle species. Hence, consideration of establishing more resilient forests of Sitka spruce by diversifying the species composition and structure of Sitka spruce stands is discussed.",

Flies were associated with forest canopies adjacent to colonized fields. Flies were captured up to 6 m high (limited by trap placement height) and may occur at greater tree heights. Fly abundance relative to tree species was highest in red oak. Releases of marked flies from tree canopies showed that release height had no effect on distance into the field that flies dispersed. This is important because the main fly control tactic is the application of a 25‐ to 30‐m‐wide swath of insecticide along field perimeters. In the laboratory, flies preferred leaves and leaf extracts of red oak compared to other leaf tree and shrub species, including blueberry. Electroantennographs demonstrated that the female antennae consistently responded to compounds extracted from red oak leaves. Mass spectra and gas chromatograph retention times of five antenna‐active compounds matched those of (i) trans ‐β‐ocimene, (ii) linalool, (iii) 4,8‐dimethyl‐1,3,7‐nonatriene, (iv) indole, and (v) trans ‐nerolidol. We speculate flies recruit to trees before movement into blueberry fields primarily for food, as supported by their arrestment response to leaf extracts.",

Outbreaks of spruce budworm occur every 30–40 years, causing high tree mortality. Researchers have established that higher proportions of hardwood trees within stands (higher hardwood content) may reduce the defoliation and mortality of balsam fir and spruces during spruce budworm outbreaks. One mechanism posited to explain these patterns is that hardwood trees positively impact the parasitoids of spruce budworm. Indeed, parasitism of spruce budworm by parasitoids has been found to be impacted by hardwood content. However, more research is needed to understand how hardwood content impacts the parasitoid community as a whole. In this study, we trialled the use of two analyses, phylogenetic community structure and stable isotope analysis, to examine how hardwood content influenced the parasitoid community associated with spruce budworm. We found that phylogenetic community structure differed between forest stands with different hardwood content. Furthermore, the trophic relationships between several parasitoids and caterpillars on balsam fir or hardwood trees changed within and between years. Our study highlights the potential of these two analyses for understanding how hardwood content influences the parasitoid community associated with spruce budworm.",

We used the COI barcode region as an alternative diagnostic method to confirm species identification of all three stages, that is, larvae, pupae and adults. Specimens were collected using various methods, including pheromone traps and direct removal of larvae from a range of fruits such as taun, cocoa and rambutan. The surveys took place in 2008–2009 in Papua New Guinea, Malaysia and Indonesia. Three Molecular Operational Taxonomic Units were detected: two Conopomorpha (Gracillaridae) species (one being CPB) and one undetermined Stathmopodidae. DNA analysis confirmed the presence of CPB at all sites, regardless of the collection method. Seven distinct haplotypes of CPB were found in total with haplotype CPB_COI_A representing 95% of the CPB samples. The remaining haplotypes diverged from CPB_COI_A by less than 0.3% and were found in cocoa and rambutan. The undetermined Conopomorpha species could not be identified using this approach due to this species not having reference DNA sequences represented in public DNA databases.

We investigated whether targeted spectral modifications to cladding materials could reduce numbers of F. occidentalis , in strawberry flowers. Five UV‐attenuating plastic‐film materials were tested in three, 6‐week, semi‐field tunnel experiments containing strawberry plants. F. occidentalis were introduced into tunnels from a laboratory culture and subsequent numbers that developed in strawberry flowers were recorded. Limiting UV‐A radiation to the crop significantly reduced the numbers of adult and larval F. occidentalis in strawberry flowers.

Therefore, we assessed O 2 consumption and the supercooling point (SCP) of P . flammea in late November, mid‐February, and mid‐March and the influence of soil humidity under fluctuating temperatures and with brief exposures to two increased temperature regimes (10 and 20°C). The respiration pattern indicated diapause termination in mid‐February. A threshold of 0.169 μl O 2 h −1 mg −1 fresh weight indicated potentially activated pre‐emerging moths. Drought increased respiration rates. The SCP was lowest in mid‐February (−22.2°C) and was negatively correlated with pupal mass. The frost tolerance tended to increase with low substrate humidity, especially at the end of the overwintering period. Our results indicate that P . flammea requires more energy during dry and mild winters than in wet and cold winters. Winter diapause termination and post‐diapause development may therefore be accelerated as environmental warming and drought increase.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A blend of longhorn beetle pheromones was tested as a generic attractant in a Central European oak forest. Overall, 20 cerambycid species totalling 1250 specimens were captured using two trap types. More adults of Phymatodes testaceus and Leiopus nebulosus nebulosus were attracted to pheromone‐baited traps compared to solvent controls. Significant numbers of four other species were caught by panel traps but not funnel traps. For the cerambycine Pyrrhidium sanguineum , significantly more beetles were caught in treatment traps than controls. For the cerambycine Anaglyptus mysticus , lepturines Cortodera humeralis and Rhagium sycophanta , the numbers of beetles caught in treatment or control traps were similar, indicating no attraction to the lure blend. Adults of a predatory clerid beetle Clerus mutillarius were caught in significantly larger numbers by both baited trap types in comparison to controls, totalling 1514 specimens. Antennae of both sexes of C. mutillarius showed responses to 3‐hydroxyhexan‐2‐one and 2‐methylbutan‐1‐ol, and males also responded to syn ‐2,3‐hexanediol. Strong attraction of C. mutillarius suggests eavesdropping on the pheromones of cerambycids and that such attractant baits, without traps, might be used to manipulate the local population density of predators in a push‐pull biological control program.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In insect‐resistant populations, adaptive fitness is intimately related to the physiological responses of males and females to different stressors. By using laboratory‐selected imidacloprid‐resistant individuals of the Neotropical brown stink bug Euschistus heros , one of the most prevalent pests in soybean fields in the Neotropical region, we evaluated whether resistance to imidacloprid (synergized by piperonyl butoxide—PBO) would differentially affect the longevity, body mass and respiratory responses of E. heros males and females. We used an imidacloprid‐susceptible E. heros strain ( ImiSusc ), whose individuals were reared under controlled and imidacloprid‐free conditions for over a decade, to select the PBO‐synergized imidacloprid‐resistant strain ( ImiPBOSel ). After eight generations using PBO‐synergized imidacloprid, our results revealed that resistant individuals exposed only to dry residues of imidacloprid (tarsal contact) could survive at concentrations as high as 168 μg a.i./cm 2 , which is equivalent to 40‐fold the label recommendation for field applications. Furthermore, ImiPBOSel males and females exhibited higher longevity, higher body mass and elevated respiratory activity than ImiSusc individuals. Altogether, the findings described here showed that imidacloprid resistance can select E. heros individuals with better metabolic capacities, which can complicate the management of this pest under field conditions.",

Recently, it was found that S. coloratum is an alternative host for the egg parasitoid Ooencyrtus pityocampae Mercet, an important natural enemy of the pine processionary moth Thaumetopoea wilkinsoni Tams, a major pest of pines. This discovery, coupled with the general lack of knowledge of S. coloratum, prompted the present study, which focused on seasonal activity of S. coloratum in Israeli pine forests, bidirectional interactions between the bug and its host the caper plant Capparis spp., and parasitism of its eggs. Stenozygum coloratum activity lasted mainly from May to October, and was followed by an adult winter diapause. Individuals formed large aggregations, causing early withering of plants and a shortening their annual growth periods. Reproductive activity peaked in August and ended in September. Egg parasitism rates increased throughout this period. Several Ooencyrtus spp., including known natural enemies of various pests, parasitized the eggs of S. coloratum and other associated pentatomids found on the caper plants. Thus, capers probably serve as a refuge for these potentially important egg parasitoids. The potential of caper plants and their fauna for biological control programmes is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sanitation harvesting for the removal, processing and killing of spruce beetle in infested trees the year after attack is often only partially effective because a significant percentage of beetles emerge from standing trees in the autumn and drop down to the root collar to hibernate under the bark below the duff line. When trees are harvested, these beetles are left behind in stump root collars. We hypothesized that falling of spruce beetle‐infested standing trees, in the second summer (before pre‐hibernation emergence of beetles), can increase the window of opportunity for sanitation harvesting and extract more beetles from the forest. Thirty E ngelmann spruce that had been successfully infested by spruce beetle on a 2‐year life cycle in 1995 were selected at each of two locations in the central interior of B ritish C olumbia in 1996. At each site, 10 replicates of three treatments were randomly applied. Ten spruce were felled from 29 M ay to 10 J une (early treatment), 10 were felled on 8 A ugust (late treatment) and the remaining 10 were left standing. In mid‐ A ugust, a pair of nylon screening emergence traps were attached to all trees to capture any immature adults emerging for hibernation. Emergence traps and underlying phloem were collected in late S eptember to early O ctober and revealed that 48–62% of immature adults emerged for hibernation from standing trees, whereas significantly fewer (7–17%) emerged from felled trees. We conclude that, if sanitation harvesting of 2‐year cycle spruce beetle‐infested spruce cannot occur until the second winter, pre‐harvest felling of these trees in the second year can reduce emergence for hibernation by 69–88% and allow the extraction of more beetles over a longer period.",

The present study aimed to determine both preference and performance of G . occidentalis on pubescent and glabrous surfaces. Choice tests were conducted on two apple cultivars: ‘ O regon S pur D elicious’ – pubescent and ‘ G olden D elicious’ – glabrous, as well as by adding simulated trichomes to a bean leaf disk. No‐choice tests measured oviposition and prey consumption on the two apple cultivars. G alendromus occidentalis consumed more prey on the ‘ O regon S pur D elicious’ side of arenas, although only when arenas were constructed without including the leaf midrib. When the midrib was included, G . occidentalis preferred to oviposit on the ‘ O regon S pur D elicious’ side. The preference of G . occidentalis for simulated trichomes did not lead to a performance difference between cultivars. In the no‐choice test, G . occidentalis did not differ in performance between cultivars. These studies indicate that G . occidentalis may have a slight preference for more pubescent surfaces, although this preference is not sufficiently strong to alter its biocontrol performance. As a specialist, G . occidentalis may be more adapted to tracking populations of its prey than locating ‘ideal’ host plants.",

Since then, GAB has subsequently been found infesting numerous tree species in the Auckland region. Flight intercept traps baited with ethanol lures were deployed from October 2019 to May 2021 at three sites in the Auckland region to ascertain the phenology of GAB in New Zealand. Two distinct peak flight periods were identified in early and late summer, while a smaller and inconsistent third peak was detected in early autumn. Logistical analysis of GAB captures in the ethanol‐lured traps and degree‐day (DD) accumulation indicated that 90% of flight activity is completed by 800 DD. To assess monitoring tactics, flight intercept traps were baited with three different ethanol lures with varying release rates or ethanol‐soaked or non‐soaked wood bolts from three species of trees. A lure releasing 2 g ethanol per day was most effective at capturing GAB. Ethanol‐soaked bolts were less effective than the lures. Xylosandrus crassiusculus represents a significant risk for shrubs and trees native to New Zealand, as well as commercial horticultural and forestry trees. We recommend using ethanol‐lured panel traps for monitoring purposes.",

The Chinese parasitoid wasp Torymus sinensis Kamijo (Hymenoptera: Torymidae) was initially released in Europe in Italy to control biologically the Asian chestnut gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae), and reduce the damage induced on sweet chestnut ( Castanea sativa Miller). In the following years, T. sinensis was then released in numerous other European countries as a biological control agent of D. kuriphilus . Its presence has also been reported beyond the countries of release due to rapid natural dispersal. To assess the post‐release genetic diversity of D. kuriphilus , we screened T. sinensis populations from six European countries and tested the possibility of these populations suffering from frequently observed genetic effects that could threaten its successful establishment in Europe. Our results exhibit that T. sinensis populations have suffered neither from the Allee effect nor from genetic bottleneck after their release and establishment in Europe, something that increases the possibility to effectively control D. kuriphilus in Europe.",

Our results showed that the phenology of A. fabae varied throughout the season with maximal numbers observed at the beginning of summer. In addition, the production of alate morphs and the proportion of parasitism were positively correlated to an increase in aphid densities. Six parasitoid species were recorded attacking A. fabae in the field, with Lysiphlebus fabarum and Binodoxys angelicae (Hymenoptera: Aphidiinae) being the most abundant parasitoids. Field characteristics and availability of host plants in the surroundings affected A. fabae density.

Faba bean, Vicia faba var minor (Linneaus), is a widely grown crop globally that can benefit from pollinator visitation, but only from species that are morphologically compatible with the plant's long‐corollae flowers. Here, we rank insect pollinators in terms of their potential importance to faba bean pollination and quantify the economic value of pollination for Irish faba beans. Our findings demonstrate that bee pollination contributes significantly to the pod set of faba beans, and, consequently, the crop's production value. We find that pollination services account for almost half of Ireland's total faba bean market value, with the pollinator contribution estimated at almost €4,000,000 per year. We estimate that, relative to other pollinators, wild bumblebees contribute to approximately 70% of the economic value of pollination services in faba bean fields, driven mainly by the contributions of a long‐tongued bumblebee species, Bombus hortorum (Linneaus; Hymenoptera: Apidae). Based on these results, we suggest that B. hortorum populations be encouraged on farmland through appropriate management to ensure the continued delivery of pollination services to Irish faba beans.",

The effect of water stress on insect oviposition preference that is key determinant for their fitness has received less attention. Here, we examined how water stress may affect oviposition selection of Ostrinia furnacalis for maize plants in the greenhouse, and tested difference in volatile compounds emitted from treated maize, and electronantennogram and bioassay responses of O. furnacalis to the volatile profiles in maize plants. Ostrinia furnacalis were more prone to lay eggs on the well‐watered maize. Most plant volatile compounds differed significantly among the three water treatments, including increased emissions of β‐caryophyllene, ( E )‐2‐hexenal, and linalool, and decreased emission of ( Z )‐3‐hexen‐1‐ol when subjected to increasing intensity of drought. Varied volatile profiles of maize may drive oviposition decision of O. furnacalis , because O. furnacalis showed a clear oviposition preference for ( Z )‐3‐hexen‐1‐ol, while not for β‐caryophyllene, ( E )‐2‐hexenal, and linalool, at the concentration of 1000 ppm. This study advances understanding of drought effects on plant–insect interactions through volatile profiles.

Defoliating insects are widely considered to be major forest disturbance agents, and these can include the sawflies (Symphyta), which are well known to reach high population densities that can cause significant outbreak events, leading to tree mortality or impacts on growth. The aim of the current study was to investigate the abundance and diversity of sawflies within stands of Sitka spruce over an elevation range and to evaluate whether there were any potentially important species present. Experimental plots were established in two commercial forest plantations in mid‐Wales, and the adult sawfly community was assessed over a 3‐year period using yellow pan traps. Sixty species of sawfly were caught over the 3‐year period, which accounted for &gt;11% of all known British sawfly species. Results indicated that there were generally greater abundance and diversity of sawflies at lower elevational plots, where temperatures were higher. The most abundant sawfly species captured in the study was the notable defoliator species, the mountain spruce sawfly ( Epicenematus montanus ), which was found in particularly high numbers in the low‐elevation plot in Hafren forest. A further seven spruce‐associated sawfly species were also caught across the experimental plots. The study highlighted the presence of a number of notable spruce‐associated sawfly species ( E. montanus and Pristiphora spp.), some of which have caused significant defoliation of spruce ( Picea ) species in Europe. The generally higher abundance of these sawflies at lower elevations indicated that Sitka spruce may potentially become more vulnerable to defoliation events caused by sawfly outbreaks in the future, especially when considering current projected climate change predictions.",

In 2020, we employed three techniques to collect EAB at a North Carolina (NC) site located at 35.64° N (purple prism traps [PPTs], log emergence, Cerceris fumipennis biosurveillance). The study was repeated in 2021, but with green funnel traps replacing log emergence. EAB collected by C. fumipennis in three altitudinally disparate regions of NC were also measured. Overall, EAB collected in 2020 averaged 12.02 mm, with those emerged from logs significantly smaller than those from PPTs. Length of females collected from C. fumipennis at three elevations was not significantly different and averaged 12.01 mm. In 2021, females collected from funnel traps, PPTs and C. fumipennis were not significantly different and larger ( = 12.41 mm) than in 2020; eliminating the smaller log‐emerged EAB from the 2020 data set did not change the outcome. Mean EAB size in NC never reached the reported 12.6 mm at 37° N, regardless of the technique or altitude tested. Our expansion of the latitudinal range in which EAB body size has been studied may shift the proposed converse Bergmann's cline to that of a sawtooth or other non‐linear model, likely associated with a transition in EAB voltinism at or near NC latitudes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Identifying areas at high risk of invasion is considered an important step for prioritization of phytosanitary measures to prevent biological invasions. Because climate change is likely to affect species' habitat suitability, ideally this should be considered in invasion risk assessments. We evaluated whether climate change affects habitat suitability and invasion risk of eight potentially invasive Eucalyptus pests in Brazil: Eucalyptolyma maideni , Mnesampela privata , Ophelimus maskelli , Orgyia postica , Paropsis atomaria , Paropsisterna beata , Paropsisterna cloelia and Trachymela sloanei . The shifts in the distribution range varied depending on the species, year and climate change scenario. While a decrease in the distribution range was predicted for four species, an increase was predicted for two species. Moreover, a decrease and/or increase in distribution depending on the climate change scenario was predicted for two species. Increases in invasion risk were predicted in major Eucalyptus ‐producing areas near international airports and high cargo volume seaports. Our study provides an important contribution to knowledge on the effects of climate change on the distribution of eight potentially invasive Eucalyptus pests and reinforces the need to consider the changes in species' habitat suitability in invasion risk assessments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L., has an indeterminate growth habit. Therefore, the plant growing season leads to crops with a large amount of immature vegetative and reproductive structures, thus requiring the use of defoliants to promote the abscission of these structures and enable mechanical harvesting. However, the use of defoliants can negatively affect the development of immature fruits. This study examined the influence of defoliants, applied alone or in combination with each other, on the formation of dry and malformed reproductive structures of cotton, known as dry bolls, used as shelter by the boll weevil Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman during cotton fallow periods. We investigated the influence of defoliants, applied alone, or combined with each other or with insecticide, on boll weevil mortality. In addition, we tested the susceptibility of boll weevils inside dry bolls to the action of insecticide. The results indicate that the defoliants can increase the number of dry bolls by up to 3.4 times, in relation to the control, 20 days after its application. The studied defoliants did not exert toxic effects on boll weevil when applied separately, nor synergistic effects of toxicity when combined with each other or with insecticides. At the end of the insecticide spraying experiments, the number of live boll weevils was 8.4 times greater when the insect was housed in dry capsules than when not housed. Defoliants can increase the formation of dry bolls, which can reduce boll weevil mortality due to insecticide application and hamper pest management.",

    "abstract": "Accurate detection and monitoring methods are the foundation for the successful management of forest pests and for the preservation and restoration of forest biodiversity. The increased threats posed by climate change, invasive species and intensification of forest management further increase the need for such methods. In addition to direct short-term management applications, monitoring data also play an important role for generating new knowledge about the dynamics of individual species and species assemblages. The development of standardized trap-based detection and monitoring methods for insects requires knowledge about optimal trap designs, attractants, trap positions and sampling efforts. For the detection of pest insect pathogens, molecular methods provide an interesting possibility as a result of their sensitivity. The present themed issue on the detection and monitoring of forest insects includes four papers covering these issues. Williams et al. (2013) evaluate the influence of pheromone lure source, trap design and trapping height above ground on catches of the invasive oak processionary moth Thaumetopoea processionea. The oak processionary moth may contribute to oak decline and the larvae also pose a risk to human animal health as a result of defensive hairs causing allergic skin reactions. A monitoring system can be used for early detection in new areas, as well as to determine range expansion and population increase. Such information is vital for successful eradication or containment that aims to slow the spread of invasive species such as the oak processionary moth. Krokene et al. (2013) present a molecular method for the detection and quantification of the host-specific virus of the European pine sawfly Neodiprion sertifer in forest litter, pine foliage and different developmental stages of the insect. The European pine sawfly is an important defoliator of pines. The method described opens new possibilities for research on the most important reservoirs of virus during non-outbreak periods and on pathways for infecting larvae. It can also be used for management decisions about whether spraying with virus should be conducted, as well as for quantification of virus amounts on pine foliage and in sawfly larvae after spraying. Schroeder (2013) evaluates the influence of trapping site characteristics and the composition of the surrounding landscape on catches of the European spruce bark beetles Ips typographus and the bark beetle Pityogenes chalcographus in pheromone-baited traps. The European spruce bark beetle is the most important insect pest of mature spruce forest in Europe. The results demonstrate that several trapping sites are needed for accurate estimates of population size at the landscape scale and that it is important to standardize both trapping sites and how the trapping sites are distributed in relation to the distribution of the host trees in the adjacent landscape. Parmain et al. (2013) present data on how changes in sampling effort influence estimates of species richness and species composition of saproxylic beetles (dependent on dead wood) based on catches in window-traps. Species richness of saproxylic beetles is often used as an indicator of forest biodiversity and as a tool for estimating the efficiency of conservation measures. The study demonstrates that, at the plot level, both an additional trap and an additional year of trapping strongly increase the number of species detected, resulting in a different estimated composition of the assemblages. Notably, the detection of rare species increases with increased sampling effort. With accumulating knowledge about pheromones and other attractants, the number of species for which it is possible to develop efficient detection and monitoring systems will increase. Some interesting future directions include the identification of pheromones for rare or threatened insect species and the development of generic baits that attract many different species. It is extremely difficult to obtain reliable data on population trends for many rare species, although pheromone-baited traps will facilitate this (Larsson & Svensson, 2009). Generic baits, composed of several pheromones, would be very useful for the early detection of invasive species, as well as for monitoring several rare species simultaneously (Hanks & Millar, 2013).",

    "abstract": "Many non-entomologists will be familiar with the idea that plants exploit insect vision and olfactory senses to attract not just any pollinators, but specific ones (Fenster et al., 2004). For nonpollinators, the volatiles that plants produce are more important in determining what settles on them or does not (Visser, 1986). Carnivorous plants, for example, attract their prey by scent rather than by visual means (Jürgens et al., 2009; Bertol et al., 2015). By contrast, it is advantageous to noncarnivorous plants to keep a low profile or to actively deter their insect predators. As a result of the pioneering work carried out by Ian Baldwin, Rex Cates, Erkki Haukioja, David Rhoades and Jack Schultz, we know that not only do plants have an induced response to herbivory (Haukioja & Niemelä, 1976; Rhoades & Cates, 1976; Haukioja & Hanhimäki, 1984), but also they can warn their neighbours of the attacks and prepare themselves to fight off potential attacks (Baldwin & Schultz, 1983; Rhoades, 1983). In those early days, the very idea of inter-plant communication was scorned by the establishment (Fowler & Lawton, 1984, 1985). It is now a very well-documented phenomenon with a fully-explained mechanism (Heil & Ton, 2008). In terms of developing pest management strategies, the use of resistant varieties has been around a long time (Painter, 1958), as has the idea of integrated pest management (Stern et al., 1959). The use of host plant resistance as a pest management strategy is attractive, albeit with the proviso that a certain amount of direct yield and possibly flavour must be sacrificed (Quisenberry & Schotzko, 1994; Chen et al., 2015). The possibility of using a resistance mechanism that is only ‘turned on’ when needed (i.e. induced resistance), rather than one that is ‘on’ all the time (i.e. constitutive resistance), could mean a less costly use of a plant's limited resources (Pastor et al., 2013). If the same system also attracted natural enemies, as has been shown previously (Heil, 2008), we would have an excellent ‘organic’ pest management system. Given the way in which plant genomes can now be manipulated, such a future is definitely now achievable (Birkett & Pickett, 2014). There may, however, be even less costly ways by which insects could be fooled into avoiding attacking plants, mimicry. Back in the 1980s, I was a forest entomologist working for the UK Forestry Commission at their Northern Research Station based just outside Edinburgh. I was working on two important pests of Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), the pine beauty moth Panolis flammea and the European pine saw fly Neodiprion sertifer, and, as a result of the work on induced defences that was appearing at that time, particularly that coming from the Haukioja group in Finland (Haukioja & Niemela, 1976) and from the University of Southampton (Edwards & Wratten, 1983, 1985), I became interested and intrigued by the possibility of insect-induced defences occurring in conifer crops being attacked by insect defoliators. Subsequently, with the help of colleagues, we were able to demonstrate that this phenomenon did occur in at least one conifer, Pinus contorta (Leather et al., 1987; Watt et al., 1991; Trewhella et al., 1997). The pine beauty moth lays its eggs in short rows on the upper surface of pine needles in late spring/early summer. They are pale yellow when first laid and gradually darken as they mature, becoming a deep violet colour just before they hatch. The eggs of Neodiprion sertifer are also laid on the upper part of the pine needles but are ‘injected’ just under the cuticle of the needle. After a few days, a small necrotic patch develops at the oviposition site. Spring field work for me and my colleagues, one of whom is now Editor-in-Chief of this journal, was the rather tedious job of egg counting and I noticed that some of the needles had little flecks or balls of resin on them, which were quite easy to confuse with pine beauty moth eggs, especially on gloomy days in the depths of the forest. Other needles had discoloured areas that looked like pine sawfly eggs or also a bit like pine beauty moth eggs, depending on how they were arranged (Fig. 1). Long days working alone in a forest allow time for contemplation and at one point it occurred to me that if I was being fooled by these ‘pseudo eggs’ then perhaps egg-laying pine beauty moths and pine sawflies might also become confused and avoid laying eggs on these apparently already infested needles. I considered whether there was any evidence to support my seemingly far-fetched hypothesis and, to my delight, found a paper (Williams & Gilbert, 1981) demonstrating quite convincingly that passion-fruit vines produce structures resembling eggs of Heliconius butterflies and that these deter the butterflies from laying eggs on them (Fig. 2). Other Lepidoptera (Rothschild & Schoonhoven, 1977; Rausher, 1979; Nomakuchi et al., 2001) and beetles (Mappes & Mäkelä, 1993) are able to discriminate between leaves that have already have eggs laid on them and avoid laying more eggs on them, thus reducing larval competition. Further evidence to support the idea of insect mimicry in plants has been highlighted by Lev-Yadun and Inbar (2002) who convincingly argue, with photographic evidence, that Xanthium trumarium mimics ant swarms, presumably to deter herbivores from landing on them; the grass Paspalum papaloides has anthers that resemble aphids; the bristly hollyhock Alcea setosa has stems that appear to be infested with aphids; and many wild legume species have pods that can be construed as mimicking lepidopteran caterpillars. There is of course an alternative hypothesis, which arose during a discussion of the idea with Mark Fellowes from the University of Reading, neatly illustrating the difference in viewpoints for someone like me, whose early research was influenced by the bottom-up view of the world, and someone like Mark, who comes from a strong top-down research background (Hassell et al., 1998). Rather than deterring herbivores, perhaps the insect mimics could be acting as signals to natural enemies, encouraging them to forage in and around those plants, thus preventing or reducing herbivore infestation levels: a type of neighbourhood watch in action. Be that as it may, I feel that, in terms of plant defence against insect herbivory, the costs imposed by external pigmentation are likely to be less than those imposed by chemical defences, although this would of course need to be quantified before it became part of a plant breeding programme to enhance the integrated pest management armoury. To return to my original musings on the likelihood of pines mimicking eggs of their needle feeding herbivores, although I never formally checked this idea, I was under the impression that needles bearing ‘egg mimics’ had fewer pine beauty moth eggs or pine sawfly eggs laid on them than those without. This is something that could easily be quantified. Another question that could easily be addressed is whether pine trees in areas that have experienced outbreaks have more speckled needles than those in non-outbreak areas. I always meant to carry out some formal sampling and experiments to support my assumptions, although I never found the time to do so. I am now very certainly never going to achieve this, although I would like to know whether this is another example of a plant mimicking insect eggs. I would be very happy indeed if anyone would consider testing my hypothesis, and look forward to seeing the results in print. I am grateful for the helpful comments provided by two anonymous reviewers.",

As stand age increased following timber harvest, the number of macromoths captured in ultraviolet light traps increased and the relative abundance of dietary generalists declined, but sample size‐corrected estimates of species richness and diversity did not vary. Macromoth community composition of the youngest stands (&lt;10 years post‐harvest) differed markedly from each other but converged soon thereafter.

None of the 188 species we sampled were old growth specialists.

    "abstract": "The northern subspecies of desert locust Schistocerca gregaria gregaria has recently expanded into western Asia. It poses a serious threat to food security in areas that are already socially and politically unstable. Its further expansion into other parts of southwestern Asia is an issue of great concern (e.g., China). We assembled S. g. gregaria occurrence records that were accumulated by the Food and Agriculture Organization and environmental variables that summarized aspects of climate, soil condition and vegetation. We predicted the potential distribution of S. g. gregaria via the fine‐tuned Maxent model and ensemble ecological niche model approaches. The models predicted that India and other southwestern Asian countries face high risk of S. g. gregaria invasion because of the presence of suitable habitats and the absence of natural barriers that would prevent S. g. gregaria dispersal into these areas. By contrast, the risk of S. g. gregaria invasion in China is low because the suitability values were very low. Moreover, the Tianshan Mountains, the Kunlun Mountains and the Himalaya Mountains may act as natural barriers against S. g. gregaria dispersal. Responses of S. g. gregaria to these environmental variables were modelled using fine‐tuned Maxent models.",

Seven treatments were used: Bioisca® ( Palicourea marcgravii (Rubiaceae) + Tephrosia candida (Fabaceae)), with 5, 10, 15 and 20 g; Blitz® (fipronil), Atta Mex‐S® (sulfluramid) baits with 6 g/m 2 of ant nest loose soil and the control, without ant baits. It took 7 days for the first colony to have its activity stopped using the Blitz® treatment. It happened only at 30 days when treated with Bioisca® and Atta‐Mex‐S® . The mortality of nests treated with Bioisca® was very low with only one controlled out of 20 that received this bait. Bioisca® does not control the nests of A. laevigata in eucalyptus plantations.",

The empirical data necessary to account for these interactions are scarce. Our objective is to test the top‐down effects of predation and bottom‐up effects of plant traits to understand what drives patterns of herbivory in managed systems. We established single‐ and multiple‐variety willow field plots with up to four varieties, to study herbivory and predation, and greenhouse experiments to investigate the effects on insect preference and performance. Herbivore damage in the field was higher in single‐ as opposed to multiple‐variety plots for the two most prevalent insect types in one of the 3 years. Predation was higher in multiple‐variety plots than in pure plots during 2016 but the opposite occurred in 2018. Predation on leaf beetle eggs was higher in multiple‐variety plots, but the result was related to specific variety mixtures rather than increased numbers of varieties. Leaf beetle feeding choice and egg‐laying were influenced to some extent by plant diversity. Our results give insights into the links between plant diversity, composition and levels of herbivore damage. They also spark questions about how temporal aspects influence these links.",

Genetic diversity within Eucalyptus camaldulensis Dehnh. could confer resistance to L. invasa via variation in plant specialized metabolites or plant responses detrimental to insect herbivores. Moreover, optimal defence theory proposes that plants will invest more constitutive resistance in parts that are vulnerable to herbivore attack, such as immature leaves and apical buds, which are prone to galling. We investigated constitutive resistance of subspecies and genotypes of E. camaldulensis to L. invasa while controlling for differences among growing conditions characteristic of their autochthonous Australian habitats using common nursery and garden arboreta plantings. Data on galling intensity, gall size, leaf phenolics and leaf physical attributes were used to investigate differences in susceptibility. We show that E. camaldulensis exhibits both constitutive and induced resistance to L. invasa . Intraspecific variability in galling was pronounced and correlated with concentrations of quinic acid derivatives and hypersensitive abscission of leaves. Whether these metabolites directly affect the survival of eggs or larvae remains to be determined. Hypersensitive leaf abscission in subspecies of E. camaldulensis in response to injury by a galling insect has not been reported previously and warrants investigation.",

We hypothesized that clear‐cutting and subsequent ploughing would increase species diversity and the abundance of beetles, and also would encourage the immediate appearance of early‐successional beetle species replacing late successional species in the clear‐cuts. We did not confirm a hypothesis regarding increase in the number of species and abundance of beetles in clear‐cuts. Our hypothesis regarding the immediate appearance of early successional species and disappearance of late‐successional species in clear‐cuts was confirmed. We also revealed that subsequent soil ploughing in clear‐cuts did not accelerate this process, which was linked to the possibility of late successional species surviving in the undisturbed spaces between the strips of ploughed soil. The present study shows that late‐successional forest litter‐dwelling coleopteran species of old pine forests have a better chance of survival in a ploughed clear‐cut, at least in northern Europe, than has been reported in other studies.",

Until the early 1990s, L. nootkatensis was free from any significant arthropod herbivory in Iceland, whereas, after 1991, many outbreaks of native insect species, primarily Ceramica pisi and Eupithecia satyrata , have been recorded. These outbreaks have caused repeated total defoliation of extensive areas of L. nootkatensis , although the effects on its development are mostly unknown. We studied the effect of: (i) reduced herbivory; (ii) increased herbivory; and (iii) simulated increased herbivory, compared with (iv) unmanipulated herbivory, on defoliation and seed production of L. nootkatensis in a 3‐year field study within two sites at contrasting ages and successional stages. The results obtained showed that: (i) seed production across all treatments was negatively related to defoliation; (ii) reduced herbivory had a positive effect on the number of flowering stems and seed yield; and (iii) these effects depended on age and/or the successional stage because they were only significant in the older L. nootkatensis site. These findings indicate that arthropod herbivory may affect the invasiveness of L. nootkatensis in Iceland by reducing the seed production and the spatial distribution rate of late successional lupin communities.",

A single female beetle typically infests one coffee berry, which her offspring consume over the course of development. Offspring then engage in sib‐mating before daughters fly off to infest new berries. We assessed infestation rates across different locations in Jamaica and found a strong positive correlation between double infestation and overall infestation rate, suggesting that females prefer to breed alone but will tolerate sharing a berry under resource constraints. Using an artificial habitat to study productivity and behaviour in the laboratory, we found that single females produced significantly more offspring per capita than two females, suggesting that co‐habitation is costly. Accordingly, co‐habiting females spent a significant proportion of their time engaged in antagonistic interactive behaviours such as pushing. When daughter beetles were given the opportunity to stay with their mothers or to infest a new berry, they tended to leave. In contrast to some related beetle species, which exhibit gregariousness and even cooperative behaviour, beneficial social interactions in the CBB appear to be limited to parental care.",

Effective management of such species requires early detection of colonising individuals, but this is often hampered by biological or economic constraints. Trachymela sloanei (Blackburn, 1896), an Australian Eucalyptus defoliator beetle, is an invasive alien species that has spread to the Americas, Asia and most recently Europe. We analyse the expansion of T. sloanei in the Iberian Peninsula both at regional and local scales, study its phenology and relative abundance, and explore the use of nest boxes for early detection. The species is spreading steadily, and the area potentially affected has increased dramatically in a few years. Both adults and larvae were observed between June and November, suggesting the occurrence of several overlapping generations. More than 300 individuals were found aggregated behind single nest boxes. We conclude that the installation and monitoring of nest boxes or similar structures (e.g., cork boards) can facilitate early detection of this species.",

This study examined the effects of crop type and production method on functional traits of butterfly, bumblebee and carabid beetle communities using species abundance data from 78 fields in Southern Finland. Surrounding landscape composition was also accounted for. The studied traits were associated with dispersal capacity, habitat or diet specialization and phenology—the key determinants modifying species responses to agricultural disturbances and land use changes. Butterfly habitat breadth was narrowest and wingspan shortest in long‐term fallows. Fallows also supported the highest share of butterflies overwintering in early development stages and bumblebees with late‐emerging queens. The tongue length of bumblebees was longest in organic oat fields, probably due to flowering weeds with long corolla. For carabid beetles, the proportion of poor flyers and carnivores was highest in perennial crops and fallows. Carabid beetles overwintering as adults were relatively more abundant in organic than in conventional production, probably due to more intensive tillage in organic fields. In all insect groups, poor dispersers and/or specialists decreased with increasing arable land cover in the surrounding landscape. Increasing the area of long‐term fallows and perennial crops and enhancing within‐field plant diversity while maintaining landscape heterogeneity would promote insect species sensitive to agricultural disturbances and land use changes and their associated ecosystem services in boreal farmland.",

For effective mealybug control, it is imperative to understand their ecology in relation to banana growth stages and climate‐induced seasonal variations. Therefore, the influence of climatic variables and banana growth stages on a spatio‐temporal distribution of mealybugs in Esuke and Benoe banana plantations of the Cameroon Development Corporation in Tiko was assessed. A 60‐ha area was mapped in each plantation and divided into 12 plots of 5 ha each, which were further sub‐divided into four quadrants of 1.25 ha. A total of 10 banana suckers, 10 pre‐flowering, 10 flowering and 10 bunchy plants were sampled per quadrant. Monthly mealybug population dynamics were assessed across 2 years in 2021 and 2022 on lower or upper pseudostem, leaves and banana bunches. Significant yearly and monthly mealybug population variation on banana plants were observed, with more mealybugs in 2022 than 2021, and two monthly mealybug peaks in February and November ( p &lt; 0.001). Mealybug population was higher on banana bunches and lower or upper pseudostem than on leaves ( p &lt; 0.001). Mealybugs preferred bunchy plants than suckers or pre‐flowering and flowering plants, and exhibited clumped distribution with Taylor aggregation index (b) greater than one ( p &lt; 0.001). A simple linear regression revealed strong positive effects of high temperature on mealybug population ecology, while relative humidity and rainfall had inverse effects on the population of mealybug. These highlight the dynamics of banana mealybug population ecology under variable climatic conditions and banana growth stages, which provides valuable baseline information to facilitate developing effective control strategies for mealybugs in banana plantations.",

Integrated pest management (IPM) of HWA combines chemical applications with the release of biological control agents on untreated trees within the same stand. Laricobius spp., Rosenhauer (Coleoptera: Derodontidae), have been used as biological control agents of HWA since 2003 and have subterranean and arboreal life phases that are synchronous with HWA's lifecycle. When utilizing IPM tactics, there is potential for Laricobius spp. to settle below an insecticide‐treated tree for its subterranean phase. 3. Field investigations assessed the impact of historical (five years post treatment in 2017) and recent imidacloprid soil treatments (via soil injection, soil drench, and tablet in November 2020) on the subterranean survivorship of Laricobius spp. by quantifying concentrations of imidacloprid and its metabolites to determine its potential impact on percent adult emergence from the soil. 4. We observed a significant treatment effect on mean soil concentration among application methods at the recent treatment site, but not the historical treatment site. Additionally, at the more recently treated site, significantly lower mean percent emergence was observed from soil drench and tablet imidacloprid applications after one year (2021), but by the following year (2022), that effect was no longer present. 5. This study supports recent recommendations to delay releases of Laricobius spp. for one‐year post‐treatment with imidacloprid. Furthermore, these data suggest when applying imidacloprid to a stand established with Laricobius spp., soil injection techniques pose the least risk to their subterranean survivorship.",

Using them, we studied, for the first time, the origin and population structure of the alien Cydia pomonella in Africa, a major apple pest. We sequenced a fragment of the mitochondrial gene Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) from C. pomonella caterpillars collected in northern Algeria and compared them with DNA barcodes from the rest of the world available at public repositories. The phylogeny built upon that COI database supports the European origin of the species: haplotypes at the base of the phylogeny were registered in this continent. In Algeria, the results suggest that this pest could have been introduced from Europe, with two unique African mutations probably favoured by C. pomonella multivoltinism and large population sizes. Population genetic analyses at three Algerian localities showed neither structure nor founder effects. However, to confirm the underlying process of the observed population patterns, it is necessary to perform analyses using genes with higher mutation rates. Compared to higher resolution markers, mitochondrial DNA barcodes are still a cost‐effective tool for taxonomic determination of unknown specimens and, sometimes, may also allow a preliminary tracing of its origin. This is crucial to detect and stop the spread of invasive pests (i.e., borders). We encourage further studies including functional genes to assess whether any mutations are promoting C. pomonella adaptation to the Northern Africa environment.",

In an attempt to minimize this loss, Brazilian legislation requires farmers to conserve a proportion of farmland as a Legal Reserve. 3. In this study, we investigated the decay of similarity in beetle communities of soybean monocultures compared to Legal Reserves. 4. To do this, we studied 77 sample points distributed across the transition zone between the Amazon and Cerrado biomes, with a maximum distance of 625 km between the farthest points. 5. Our results show that the transformation of forest areas into monocultures causes a drastic decrease in beta diversity for both herbivores and predators. 6. This pattern is not observed in Legal Reserves, where the communities are, for the most part, different in a short geographic space. 7. We noted an increase in beta diversity between sites at a shorter distance (200 km) compared with soybean monoculture areas (350 km). 8. In these environments, many species are generalist pests that benefit from the simplified landscape. 9. To verify the relationship between species dissimilarity and geographic distances, we used the Chord‐Normalized Expected Species Shared dissimilarity index, replacing Bray–Curtis due to its robustness in dealing with small samples or subsampling. 10. We reinforce the importance of Legal Reserves in conserving beetle biodiversity, emphasizing the need for preserved areas distributed throughout the landscape as they play a crucial role in maintaining beta diversity and preserving ecosystem services in anthropized landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ips typographus is the most important tree‐killing bark beetle in Europe. In the north, it overwinters either in the bark of its host tree or in the ground, while in central Europe, overwintering in trees is most common. Few studies have estimated winter mortality of I. typographus in northern Europe. Mortality of I. typographus adults overwintering in killed trees was estimated by comparing densities per m 2 bark of live (one winter) and dead adults (five winters), and proportion of dead adults (one winter), in bark samples collected before and after winter in Sweden. Densities of live and dead larvae of predatory Medetera spp. (Dolichopodidae) were recorded in the bark samples (one winter), as was the amount of bark removed by woodpeckers from I. typographus ‐killed trees during winter foraging (five winters). Mortality of I. typographus adults overwintering in the ground was estimated by spring sampling of soil (three winters). The density of I. typographus live adults in trees was 3% lower after winter, while densities of dead adults was 6% higher and 5% lower respectively during two different outbreaks (differences after vs. before winters were non‐significant). The proportion of dead adults was 4% higher after winter (significant). Winter mortality of adults overwintering in the ground was on average 58%. The density of Medetera was 6% and 8% lower after winter for live and dead larvae, respectively (non‐significant). The amount of remaining bark on standing killed trees was on average 8% lower after than before winter (significant).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Bell peppers ( Capsicum annuum ) play a key role in food production, commerce, and society, with smallholder farmers being the 36 primary cultivators. However, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) poses a significant threat to bell pepper crops. Traditional control methods rely heavily on the application of insecticides, resulting in increased production costs and ecological concerns. To address this issue, the establishment of decision‐making systems, starting with effective sampling plans, is crucial. This study aimed to develop a practical sampling strategy for assessing B. tabaci populations at different growth stages of bell pepper crops, including vegetative, flowering, and fruiting stages. Over a 4‐year period, commercial bell pepper fields were monitored to determine the optimal sampling technique and sample size. Results indicated that sampling the apical third of the plant's leaves and shaking the plants onto a white plastic tray yielded the most accurate samples. Pest densities followed a negative binomial distribution pattern, with a consistent aggregation parameter (Kc = 0.3339) across all fields. Therefore, assessing 78 plants per field was deemed necessary. The sampling procedure incurred a cost of up to $1.12 per hectare and required approximately 24 min. The simplicity, ease of execution, and low cost of the developed sampling strategy make it suitable for integration into comprehensive pest management programs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Simplification of agricultural environments is linked to declines in biodiversity. Improving the floral diversity within and around these areas may result in more robust and diverse ecosystems. We investigated how floral resource abundance, diversity, and species composition in a cranberry agricultural system correlated to the abundance and overall invertebrate diversity and to the abundance and diversity of specific invertebrate groups of agricultural importance (e.g. parasitoids, phytophagous taxa, pollinators and predators). This study focused on habitats immediately surrounding cranberry production and included grassy dikes under a managed system (‘dike’), and semi‐natural areas growing on the surrounding support land (‘semi‐natural’). Floral resource availability and diversity tended to be similar between habitats, while invertebrate richness, diversity and composition differed. As the availability of floral resources increased, invertebrate abundance increased but diversity decreased. Overall invertebrate community composition differed with the specific species and availability of floral resources. The habitat type and floral resource composition impacted some agriculturally important groups, as pollinator abundance was higher in the semi‐natural habitat, and parasitoid abundance varied with floral resource composition across both habitats. These results suggest that managing the structural and floral resource diversity associated with agroecosystems can help support local biodiversity. However, these systems may disproportionately benefit more common taxonomic groups. The difference in responses of individual taxonomic groups also highlights the potential tradeoffs of focusing on only a subset of biodiversity aspects.",

While some studies have investigated disturbance gradients, there is a lack of monitoring studies showing trends over time evaluating changes in management posited to improve soil health. We investigated the status of a soil in an arable rotation following conversion to no‐till. The response in abundance of Collembola ecomorphological groups, along with soil physicochemical properties, was monitored over 2 years, in two field experiments established on different soil types within the same field. The treatments were standard practice and green manure (GM) in both Experiments 1 and 2, and farmyard manure (FYM) in Experiment‐1 only. Significant responses to treatments were mostly observed with euedaphic Collembola during the first year, but treatment effects were no longer evident in the second year. A decline in epiedaphic abundance was recorded in Year‐2 in the GM treatment. A negative association was observed with total soil nitrogen and pH, while a positive association was observed between gravimetric water content and euedaphic Collembola abundance. This study demonstrated that euedaphic Collembola quickly responded to changes in management practice, but the impact of treatments was transient. The abundance of Collembola ecomorphological groups discriminated between short‐term impacts but were an ineffective bioindicator of treatment effects over a two‐year period suggesting that they may be best applied for monitoring short‐term effects in response to intermittent inputs.",

With their rich biodiversity and diverse ecological functions, saproxylic species provide unique ecological services and interactions that are closely linked to specific dead wood types. Given the distinctive roles and diversity of saproxylic beetles, forest loss and management practices that reduce dead wood amount and quality pose a risk of greater biodiversity loss. This highlights the critical need for comprehensive research into saproxylic beetle diversity and community structures from various perspectives to support sustainable forest management strategies. We sampled 60 Quercus logs in a temperate mixed forest during both winter and summer, and reared saproxylic beetles using emergence traps. Consequently, we collected a total of 1793 saproxylic beetles from 27 families and 75 species across three decay classes. Season was a key environmental variable, clearly distinguishing saproxylic beetle assemblages between winter and summer. While decay class did not clearly differentiate the beetle assemblages in summer, it distinctly separated the assemblages in winter. Our findings indicate that saproxylic beetles are influenced by changing resource availability and microclimate, driven by environmental variables such as season. This variability reveals the overlooked biodiversity potential, emphasizing the need for continuous and comprehensive research to achieve conservation goals and improve understanding of saproxylic organisms.",

    "abstract": "Species of the genus Otiorhynchus, notably the vine weevil (Otiorhychus sulcatus (Fabricius)) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Otiorhynchinae), are important pests of European horticultural crops (e.g. Balachowsky, 1963; Alford, 1984, 1991); species of Otiorhynchus are also significant forestry pests (Schwenke, 1974). Owing to the particular importance of vine weevil, both in Europe and elsewhere, an international workshop on this pest was held in the UK in 1991, at the University of Southampton. At this meeting, aspects of vine weevil biology, and ongoing work on chemical and biological control were highlighted. Current work at that time centred around the development of a slow-release formulation of chlorpyrifos, and the evaluation of entomopathogenic nematodes (Heterorhabditis and Steinernema) and entomopathogenic fungi (Metarhizium). Physical barriers to prevent the invasion of adult vine weevils into plant beds and plant containers (using, for example, grease bands and painted-on strips of fluon) were also being investigated, and were similarly reported. Aspects of the biology and control of vine weevil were subsequently reviewed by Moorhouse et al. (1992). The response from the first meeting was such that, in 1996, a second international workshop on vine weevil was held in Braunschweig, Germany. With the backing of BCPC and the Deutsche Phytomedizinische Gesellshaft (DPG), it was possible to produce formal proceedings in which papers presented at the meeting were published (Alford & Backhaus, 1996). These proceedings included contributions on biology, behaviour, phenology, and biological and chemical control, including novel approaches such as studies on the effects on larval growth of mycorrhizal fungi (Gange, 1996). Work on semiochemicals, confirming that adult vine weevils produce an aggregation pheromone or other attractants, was also reported (Pickett et al., 1996). In 1999, a third international workshop on vine weevil was held in Angers, France. At this meeting, current research work on species of Otiorhynchus other than O. sulcatus was also introduced (Anon, 1999). This was an important development, and included presentations on strawberry weevil (Otiorhynchus ovatus (L.)) and clay-coloured weevil (Otiorhynchus singularis (L.)). Work on the effect of ectomycorrhiza on the incidence of Otiorhynchus (mainly O. nodosus) larval damage to seedlings of Russian larch trees (Larix sukaczewii) in Iceland was also reported (Halldorsson et al., 1999). In 2003, a fourth international workshop was held in Wageningen, the Netherlands. At this meeting the scope was extended to include not only contributions on Otiorhynchus spp. but also information on other Otiorhynchinae and related root weevils. Topics discussed at the meeting included the behaviour, bionomics, chemical and non-chemical control, genetics, host-plant relationships, phenology and reproduction of root weevils. This dedicated section of Agricultural and Forest Entomology brings together a selection of the papers presented at the 2003 Workshop in Wageningen and, it is hoped, will widen knowledge and stimulate further studies on root weevils as crop pests throughout the world.",

Natural enemies, climatic elements and host plants are among the most important factors affecting pest dynamics. Tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ) is the second most consumed vegetable worldwide. The pea leaf miner Liriomyza huidobrensis (Diptera: Agromyzidae) is a major pest to the tomato in Brazil. This study aimed to determine the main natural factors that regulate L. huidobrensis populations in tomato fields in Brazil. Liriomyza huidobrensis densities were evaluated by directly counting the number of active mines on the basal leaf of the middle section of the plant canopy, and predators and parasitoids were assessed using the leaf‐beating‐against‐a‐tray technique. Eight commercial tomato fields were assessed over two years. The phenological growth stages of the tomato plants (vegetative and reproductive) were noted during the assessments. Liriomyza huidobrensis populations peaked between the middle and end of the planting season. Opius sp. (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) was the main natural enemy of L. huidobrensis . Our results suggest that phenological growth stage and Opius sp. are associated with population dynamics of L. huidobrensis in tomato fields. Therefore, integrated pest management programmes should aim to preserve populations of the parasitoid Opius sp.",

In this study, we compared the performance measured as host plant induced mortality, cocoon weight, and predation mortality of the European pine sawfly Neodiprion sertifer (Geoffroy) (Hymenoptera, Diprionidae) in mixed and monoculture forest stands. We did not observe a difference in host plant induced mortality, cocoon weight, or predation mortality between mixed and monoculture forest stands. We did find an effect of local conditions around each experimental tree on pine sawfly performance. For example, the nitrogen content of pine needles is negatively affected by the proportion of pine around the experimental tree, which in turn increases the survival of sawfly larvae. The results suggest that local conditions around individual trees are more important for the performance of the European pine sawfly than stand type, i.e. mixed or monoculture plant stands. We conclude that the ongoing trend for diversification within commercial forestry calls for more research where the effects of both bottom‐up and top‐down effects are studied at several spatial scales.",

The assay was conducted over 7 days (22 May to 29 May 2017) and compared landing rates on branches of six nonhost species paired with northern California black walnut, Juglans hindsii (the host). A total of 2242/1192 WTB were collected on branches of host/nonhost pairs, and more WTB landed on J. hindsii than on nonhosts in 42 of 58 instances. Female landing rate generally exceeded male landing rate, which underscores the influence of the male‐produced synthetic pheromone in this system. Landing rates of WTB males, females, and the combined sexes on boxelder, Acer negundo , and valley oak, Quercus lobata , did not differ significantly from the landing rates on J. hindsii , suggesting that these two nonhost riparian hardwoods do not repel WTB (in the context of the aggregation pheromone). Significantly fewer WTB landed on Oregon ash, Fraxinus latifolia , river red gum, Eucalyptus camaldulensis , Fremont cottonwood, Populus fremontii , and red willow, Salix laevigata , than on J. hindsii , which suggests that these four nonhosts may repel one or both sexes of WTB in the context of the aggregation pheromone.

Yellowjackets are important predators of a wide range of arthropods, acting as natural population control in many ecosystems. This study seeks to explore how Vespinae community structure shifts with increasing land development in a temperate North American environment. Yellowjackets were sampled from May to September 2019 using heptyl butyrate and acetic acid plus isobutanol traps. Sampling sites represented a gradient of developed landscapes, from fully forested to entirely developed. Seven species from the genera Dolichovespula and Vespula were trapped during the study. Yellowjacket community structure was found to be significantly affected by the amount of land development. These results were driven by the replacement of Vespula consobrina with Vespula germanica in urban landscapes. A high level of development, greater than 75%, reduced species abundance relative to the fully forested landscapes, primarily due to the loss of Vespula pensylvanica and V. consobrina . Our results highlight that the replacement of forested areas with urban development causes a shift in yellowjacket community composition, favouring generalist scavengers (e.g. V. germanica ) and threatening the abundance of forest specialists such as V. consobrina .",

Lacewing responses to both uninfested plant parts and infested with D. citri were measured. Results showed that C. carnea discriminated between the volatiles emitted by plant parts and citrus psyllid. In all tested combinations (I‐V), both in the absence and presence of citrus psyllid, all first, second and three C. carnea preferred the volatiles of fresh leaves and old leaves over other plant parts. Moreover, all three instars of the predator significantly preferred the area having volatile of citrus psyllid. Volatiles of fresh leaves and old leaves can be used in the management of citrus psyllid. Moreover, this tritrophic interaction could play a vital role in developing IPM strategies for the management of citrus psylla.",

Two subspecies of Douglas‐fir beetle are recognized: D . pseudotsugae pseudotsugae , which inhabits southwestern Canada and western United States, and Dendroctonus pseudotsugae barragani , which occurs in northern Mexico. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of 3‐methylcylohex‐2‐en‐1‐one (MCH) in reducing aggregation of D . pseudotsugae barragani , and corresponding Douglas‐fir mortality by this insect. Two field experiments were conducted: the first consisted of three doses of MCH in bubble caps (plus a control treatment) applied within 16 0.5 ha plots. The second consisted of three doses of MCH disrupt micro‐flakes (plus a control treatment) applied within 16 1.0 ha plots. MCH bubble caps at 28.8 and 44.0 g AI/ha and MCH disrupt micro‐flakes at 185.3 and 741 g AI/ha significantly reduced the aggregation of D . pseudotsugae barragani . When applying MCH as bubble caps, only the highest dose (44.0 g AI/ha) significantly reduced the number of successfully attacked trees. However, MCH micro‐flake doses of 185.3 and 741 g AI/ha reduced the number of successfully attacked trees to zero.",

In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that a North American × Asian hybrid ash could serve as a refuge for North American arthropods in a common garden experiment by comparing beetle communities and herbivory on North American green and black ash, the Asian Manchurian ash, and the black × Manchurian hybrid ‘Northern Treasure’ ash. We found that ash specialists were rare among trees in the common garden. Species richness and composition of herbivorous beetles, as well as levels of herbivory, were similar among ash taxa, and these patterns were driven by native generalists. The lack of ash specialists collected suggests that regions that have experienced late stages of EAB‐induced ash mortality may have missed the opportunity to conserve populations of native specialist herbivores with EAB‐resistant ash genotypes. To maximize the potential for conserving native arthropod biodiversity of ash, it may be necessary to plant resistant ash prior to widespread EAB‐induced ash mortality, prioritizing efforts on the leading edge of expanding distribution of EAB.",

To learn about its biology, distribution, natural enemies, and potential impact, we conducted a prairie‐wide survey in western Canada and field studies using emergence cages and plant dissections between 2017 and 2019. Results of a transect‐based survey conducted in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba indicated that C. brassicola is widely distributed in western Canada. Two species of parasitic wasp were reared from C. brassicola larvae collected during the survey. We found that C. brassicola can have multiple generations per year, with the first peak of adult emergence occurring in early July with the onset of the susceptible crop stage. Adult midge and larvae may be found from June until early autumn. Midge larvae appear capable of extended diapause over multiple years. During this study, we found that C. brassicola damage was restricted to developing flowers. In the vast majority of fields surveyed, C. brassicola occurred in low population densities and was unlikely to impact yield in those fields.",

A growing body of research is demonstrating that, through various exposure routes, neonicotinoids can impact a suite of nontarget organisms including beneficial insects such as bees. However, to date, only a few studies have examined the effects of neonicotinoids in field settings. We assessed the relationship between agricultural crop soil neonicotinoid levels and wild bee abundance and diversity at 16 agricultural sites representing different soil neonicotinoid levels. We detected clothianidin at 11 sites, thiamethoxam at three sites; imidacloprid was not detected. Hedgerow and crop soils were consistent in terms of where clothianidin was detected; thiamethoxan was not detected in hedgerow soils. Based on model outcomes, fields with higher levels of soil neonicotinoids exhibited significantly lower wild bee abundance and diversity than those with low or no neonicotinoids detected. Crop soil neonicotinoid level, hedgerow floral resource abundance and crop type were consistent predictors of bee abundance across models; only neonicotinoid level and crop type were significant predictors of diversity. Our results are consistent with recent findings in the midwestern US, and underscore the potential risk of soil neonicotinoids to wild bee populations across regions and crop systems.",

Chewing insects (flea beetles and diamondback moth larvae) were also unaffected by the treatments. However, parasitism rates of aphids were higher on plants treated with the bacteria.

Flight intercept traps were used to collect specimens of saproxylic beetles in each stand at 2, 3 and 4 years post‐harvest. The richness and abundance of saproxylic beetles were higher in MT and HT than in CK. Twelve of the 15 indicator species were significantly associated with MT or HT, whereas only three species were significantly associated with CK. We found that moderate and high intensity harvesting affected the composition and increased beetle abundance and richness of saproxylic beetles, and light intensity harvesting had no effect on the beetle community in years 2, 3 and 4 post‐harvest. There was no difference in the beetle community composition between moderate and high harvest stands.",

We conducted this study in quarantine to provide insight into the impact and distribution of the root‐feeding flea beetle Heikertingerella sp. (Chrysomelidae), released in early 2023 against the invasive tree Tecoma stans (L.) (Bignoniaceae) in South Africa. We studied the effects of low and high beetle densities on plant growth and biomass, and F 1 progeny production by the beetle. There were significant reductions in plant growth and biomass accumulation in the beetle‐exposed plants, relative to the controls. P 1 adults damaged significantly more leaflets, with significantly higher F 1 progeny production, at high beetle densities. The MaxEnt model predictions suggested that most of South Africa is climatically highly suitable for Heikertingerella sp., particularly along the southern and eastern coasts where the weed is most prevalent. Only the inland regions of the Northern Cape Province, depicting the driest and hottest part of the country where the weed does not occur, were predicted to be unsuitable for Heikertingerella sp. The beetle's thermal physiology, as determined by its critical thermal minimum and maximum temperatures and lower and upper lethal temperatures (LT 50 ), suggests tolerance to temperature extremes in at least four of the eight provinces that fall within the range of T. stans in South Africa. Our results further justify the release of Heikertingerella sp. in areas predicted as suitable in South Africa.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Herbivore dung quality (physical and chemical parameters) varies between animal species and animal diet which is influenced by seasonal fluctuations and farm management practices. Subsequently, this influences the reproductive success of dung beetles. In Australian pasture systems, how the introduced dung beetle assemblage interacts in the field with cattle dung derived from different resources is unknown. This study quantifies the colonization by dung beetles (abundance, species richness and evenness) and removal of cattle dung derived from three common temperate pasture systems (improved native, forage oat and rye/clover pasture, henceforth dung type) over 24 h for 12 months. From the three dung types, 13 species of dung beetle were captured. Abundance and species richness were influenced by month and transect, with weak evidence for differences between dung types influencing overall abundance: Onthophagus binodis (49.7%), Aphodius fimetarius (24.4%) and Labarrus lividus (17.1%) were the most abundant species. Dung removal (organic matter) was influenced by month and dung type, with more dung buried in improved native (23.9 g) and rye/clover (24.7 g) derived dung compared with forage oat (12.3 g) dung. Dung beetle abundance was positively correlated with removal of all dung types, with O. binodis biomass significantly influencing dung removal. This study showed that diet of bovine animals weakly influences the abundance of a local dung beetle assemblage, warranting further investigation on the influence of other dung types in different regions. Improvements to reporting of pasture species and growth stage is recommended for comparisons between dung derived sources.",

On the resistant genotype gall initiation is delayed. 2 The relation between infestation and galling incidence showed considerable variation between the two generations. Galling symptoms produced by the second midge generation were weak on the resistant as compared with the susceptible blackcurrant. 3 Because larval development of that generation coincided with a period of dry and warm weather, it is possible that larvae on the resistant genotype suffered desiccation to a greater extent than larvae on the susceptible genotype where gall development was stronger. 4 The possible interaction of relative humidity and expression of resistance was investigated in controlled environment experiments. The resistant ‘Storklas’ and a susceptible (‘7801–31’) currant genotype were studied at two constant relative humidities, 30 and 70%. 5 Larvae of D. tetensi suffered from higher mortality and reduced growth rate on both genotypes in the low humidity environment. 6 There was also a significant plant genotype by humidity interaction on larval performance; no galls were produced and no larvae completed development on the resistant currant at low humidity. 7 There was a trend for a positive correlation between larval length and larval density on a plant at low humidity but not at high humidity.",

    "abstract": "Although much research has been carried out to develop taxa resistant to Dutch elm disease (DED), newly occurring pests represent a new challenge for the protection of elms (Ulmacae). The invasive zigzag elm sawfly ( Aproceros leucopoda ) is a recent invader of Asian origin in Europe defoliating elm trees that are otherwise often characterized with major resistance to DED. The range expansion of this pest poses a major threat to elms. The aim of this study was to identify the susceptibility of Ulmus crassifolia , Hemiptelea davidii and Zelkova serrata to this pest by using three different methods (oviposition trials with cut shoots and with plants in pots, and larval feeding trials with plants in pots) to define the performance of A. leucopoda on potential hosts. The fact is that A. leucopoda was unable to complete its development on either of these three taxa of Ulmaceae, whereas Ulmus pumila (the reference during the trials) was again confirmed as a true host of the pest clearly indicating that the host plant range of A. leucopoda is probably limited not only to Ulmus but also within this genus. Our results may be considered in future resistance breeding programmes, pest risk assessments, and for the selection of Ulmaceae species.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hughes and Madden's binary power law was used to analyse sample data of three life stages of gypsy moth ( Lymantria dispar ) and adult emerald ash borer ( Agrilus planipennis ), both important invasive forest pests in North America. Tally thresholds were used to convert quantitative gypsy moth data to binomial, presence–absence data for binary power law analysis. Presence–absence data from two emerald ash borer surveys were analysed, an initial highly intensive and expensive survey expanding out from the point of introduction in Michigan and a second extensive survey designed to detect and track the leading edge of the beetle's expanding range. Emerald ash borer was found to be moderately aggregated in the initial survey data, but very near to random in the leading edge survey. The latter result is consistent with other findings that spatial distribution is less aggregated at range edges than near the centre of the range. Estimates of the proportion of positive observations in the initial intensive survey were found to be more precise than those obtained in the leading edge survey. Comparisons of binomial power law estimates and Taylor's power law estimates of the gypsy moth data suggest the possibility of a fundamental connection between the two power laws. A possible connection, the effect of tally thresholds and their relationship with sampling efficiency are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Pine‐tree lappet moth ( Dendrolimus pini L.) larvae can be serious defoliators of pine in several countries within mainland Europe. A breeding population of pine‐tree lappet moth was confirmed near Inverness, Scotland in 2009, prior to which the species had only been observed in the United Kingdom as an occasional nonbreeding migrant to southern England. To investigate whether a geographic pattern of DNA variation exists that could elucidate whether the population is native or introduced, we analysed nuclear (ITS2) and mitochondrial (NAD and COI) sequence data from D. pini from across a broad geographic range. Additionally, microsatellite marker data were used to examine neutral genetic diversity and to look for evidence of a recent population bottleneck in the Scottish population. ITS2 sequence analysis confirmed that the Scottish population was D. pini and identified a distinct Western European group of D. pini samples. Analysis of the mitochondrial sequences grouped the haplotypes into two main phylogenetic groups (A and B) and a well‐supported Western European sub‐group (b1). A high number of unique haplotypes were recorded, highlighting the haplotype diversity across the species range. The Scottish haplotype did not have an exact match but grouped with haplotypes from group B. The microsatellite markers highlighted low genetic diversity in the Scottish population but there was no evidence of a recent population bottleneck. Evidence to distinguish between a native versus a recent introduction origin of the Scottish population is equivocal. Further sampling to increase haplotype coverage may help to clarify this question.",

Shading was applied between either GS 31 and 39 (1st node detectable → flag leaf ligule just visible) or GS 39 and 55 (flag leaf just visible → 50% of inflorescence emerged). 3 Sitobion avenae populations were initiated at GS 55 and highest populations were subsequently observed on plants shaded between GS 31 and 39. 4 Individual aphids confined within clip cages were observed to measure development from birth to adult moult, adult lifespan and fecundity. Results indicated that adult lifespan was shortest on plants shaded between GS31 and 39, whilst there were no differences in development time or fecundity. 5 Possible explanations for these observations are discussed.",

This species attacks all the cultivated pine species in Patagonia Argentina causing wood damage and tree death. The objectives of this work were to describe the host preference behaviour of P. castaneus and the influence of wood damage by conspecifics on its host selection. In two‐choice bioassays, P. castaneus showed a feeding preference for Pinus contorta over P. ponderosa . However, percent weight gain when feeding on either species was similar. In other bioassays, P. castaneus spent more time in areas with twigs on which other conspecifics had recently fed, although they were able to successfully feed on twigs without previous damage. These results show that while P. castaneus can successfully colonize different pine species, P. contorta may be more susceptible to attack than P. ponderosa . Silvicultural management should be prioritized considering the weevil's preference for attacking damaged hosts.",

It is reported to be polyphagous in its native range, but hosts have not been screened in its introduced range in the United States. We conducted choice and no‐choice host experiments. For choice assays, gravid T. campestris oviposited freely on cut branches of four tree species: Juglans nigra , Malus domestica , Acer saccharum , and Pinus strobus . We investigated oviposition between apple branches with and without cankers. Half of the choice trials underwent winter temperatures. For no‐choice assays, eggs were placed on cut branches of these same four species. Half of these branches were later dissected to measure larval development. The rest were exposed to winter temperatures and T. campestris emergence was quantified. Overall, Trichoferus campestris oviposition and development occur more readily on J. nigra and M. domestica than on A. saccharum or P. strobus . The insect oviposited more on cankered than uncankered apple wood. Cold exposure during an overwintering period benefitted insect development in adults. The insect's high degree of polyphagy and ability to reproduce in dry wood has likely facilitated its establishment in multiple locales around the world.",

These organisms defoliate plants and contaminate the harvest, leading to reduced crop yield and marketability. Losses caused by molluscs have escalated in recent years in Brazil. We aimed to determine the seasonal activity of gastropods in brassica fields and unravel the environmental variables associated with these dynamics. Gastropod abundance, assemblage and within‐plant distribution were also compared among Brassica oleracea cultivars (broccoli, cabbage and cauliflower). Mild temperatures and rainy periods were found to coincide with gastropod peaks. Regression analyses confirmed a positive association of rainfall and humidity with gastropod abundance, whereas gastropod abundance increased with decreasing temperature. Deroceras laeve (Müller) (Agriolimacidae) and Bradybaena similaris (Férussac) (Bradybaenidae) were the most constant species. Mollusc abundance and assemblage differed amid B. oleracea cultivar; cabbage had the highest abundance and its species composition differed from broccoli and cauliflower. Slugs and snails were more concentrated on lower plant portions, regardless of the cultivar. Management efforts should be reinforced in mild‐temperature and rainy periods to reduce damage by gastropods, and cabbage should be monitored more closely than other cultivars.",

Monitoring efforts for WTB rely on pheromone‐baited traps, but lures are likely effective at attracting beetles only over short distances. Fungal‐derived kairomones may increase the efficacy of current lures, while additional volatiles may repel beetles from valuable trees. The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which fungal, host and non‐host volatiles modify the attraction of WTB to pheromone‐baited traps. A trapping study that combined fungal, host‐associated and non‐host compounds with WTB‐pheromone lures was conducted over three years in black walnut plantations experiencing a TCD outbreak in Walla Walla, WA. Traps baited with pheromone and G. morbida volatiles (i.e., isoamyl and isobutyl alcohol) consistently attracted more WTB, while other fungal volatiles inconsistently increased attraction compared to those baited with pheromone lure alone. This is the first field study that demonstrates fungal volatiles can increase the attraction of a bark beetle to its pheromone in a hardwood system. One fungal (benzyl alcohol) and two additional volatiles (limonene, piperitone) repelled WTB from pheromone‐baited traps. Although limonene is known to repel WTB, this is the first demonstration that benzyl alcohol and piperitone repel a bark beetle. Fungal volatiles may increase the efficacy of monitoring efforts and may play an important role in management tactics for WTB, especially in detecting the introduction and establishment of nascent populations and protecting trees from colonizing beetles.",

The DNA sequence comparisons of 1837 base pairs of the control region revealed 60 haplotypes determined by a total of 108 variable sites. The observed total haplotype diversity (Hd) value was 0.99, and the nucleotide diversity was 0.00423 and 0.00571 according to π and θ W , respectively. The high haplotype diversity and low nucleotide diversity, as well as both neutrality tests and unimodal mismatch distributions, suggested a recent expansion in the populations of N. viridula from Argentina. The expansion of the populations of this insect is probably due to the recent agricultural expansion and intensification of soybean cultivation in this country. No significant levels of genetic differentiation were detected, suggesting that gene flow predominates over genetic drift. In addition, the Bayesian individual assignment analysis revealed that all populations share ancestry. It is probable that the growth in the area cultivated with soybean has generated stable and continuous habitats that allow gene flow among populations of N. viridula . The results of demographic history analysis suggest that the direction of migration of N. viridula would be associated with the growth pattern of soybean crops in Argentina.",

The moth was reared on B. hyrcana at 25 ± 1°C, 65 ± 10% RH and 16 h:8 h (L:D), and the data obtained were used to build a life table, adjusted to allow for the evaluation of the stage duration, for both males and females.

Newly emerged females had a life expectancy ( e xj ) of 14 days and males 19 days. The intrinsic rate of increase for the population was 0.05 ± 0.00 days −1 , and the net reproductive rate was 24.05 ± 3.95 offspring/female.

The production of hybrid seeds is however limited by pollination challenges, with these systems commonly associated with unattractive and low‐quality floral resources, isolated growing environments and frequent insecticide applications. Here, we utilise commercial carrot seed crops to investigate the impact of hybrid pollination on the behaviour of the honey bee ( Apis mellifera ). Six full‐strength bee colonies were equipped with solar powered radio frequency identification systems and over 900 tagged bees per season. These colonies were deployed to commercial hybrid seed crops over two consecutive seasons. The colonies were allocated to either an on‐crop or off‐crop group. Individual bees were autonomously monitored for the pollination period to assess key parameters such as survival, age at foraging and the number and duration of orientation and foraging trips. Hybrid carrots were found to have a significant impact on bee foraging behaviour. Bees situated on the carrot crop undertook less frequent yet longer foraging trips, resulting in less total time outside of the colony compared to off‐crop bees. However, bees placed in carrot fields survived to an older age, orientated successfully, became foragers later and collected more pollen by weight, despite only 2% originating from carrot. We hope that the improved behavioural understanding can be utilised to enhance both pollinator health and hybrid seed production globally.",

Sap‐feeding citrus mealybugs Planococcus citri are an interesting example of obligate nutritional symbiosis, harbouring a pair of symbionts: Tremblaya princeps and Moranella endobia . Hosts can often vary in the densities of their symbionts and symbiont cells will inevitably carry some cost to the hosts, and so it would be predicted that a higher symbiont density will have some form of benefit to the host to outweigh this cost. In the present study, we examine whether populations of citrus mealybugs, with heritably different symbiont densities, differed in their ability to exploit multiple plant species or to tolerate the stress from insecticide exposure. Plant species were found to significantly impact mealybug fitness, but higher symbiont densities did not hold any evident compensation for reduced host‐plant suitability and did not correlate with mealybug susceptibility to insecticide treatment. Planococcus citri harbour variable symbiont densities but this did not correlate with the fitness of the host. This apparently sub‐optimum symbiont density regulation in an otherwise intricate and tightly‐knit tripartite symbiosis could be an evolutionary artefact of previous conflicts of interest.",

Winter temperatures have increased more than summer temperatures in Iceland and, in the present study, the hypothesis was that the winter warming has facilitated the range shift of C. pisi . Winter survival of pupae in Iceland was studied in the laboratory. Pupae were collected in the autumn of 2012 at five separate locations, then weighed and placed at temperatures from −6 to −18 °C. One month after the sub‐zero treatments, the pupae were placed at room temperature and pupal emergence was recorded. No significant effect of sub‐zero treatments on the survival of C. pisi pupae was found. The primary hypothesis of the present study was therefore rejected. The major factor affecting low temperature survival of C. pisi pupae, however, was their autumn weight. The response was sigmoid and the 5%, 50% and 95% likelihoods for winter survival were at 157, 274 and 393 mg autumn pupal mass, respectively. This finding indicates that factors other than winter temperature, such as summer available thermal budget for larval growth, may be a limiting factor to the spread of C. pisi in Iceland.",

Eggs hatched in 7–9 days and 50.1% developed to adults. Female longevity ranged from 150 and 160 days at 15 °C to 60 days at 22 and 25 °C. At 20 °C, both sexes had a similar life span of approximately 90 days but, at 15 °C, males had a significantly longer life span (189 days) than females (150 days). The development rate ( y ) was related to temperature ( x ) by the function y = 0.0016 × −0. 013 ( r 2 = 0.921), the lower developmental threshold was 8.1 °C and 625 degree‐days were required for completing development. Based on this model, three or four generations per year were predicted in Central Portugal, although only the first‐ and second‐generation larvae develop during the main cropping season. By predicting the emergence of first‐generation adults, the model provides a tool for improving the pest management strategy.",

The damage rate in the fourth summer was approximately the same on burned and unburned sites. 3 Pine weevil feeding was the major cause of mortality of freshly planted pine seedlings on unburned sites. On burned sites, mortality was higher than the rate of severe feeding damage, particularly in the second summer after burning, possibly owing to fungal attack and abiotic factors. 4 At a retention tree level of 50 m 3 , feeding damage to the seedlings was lower than on clearcuts and at a 10 m 3 retention tree level. Furthermore, on sites with 50 m 3 of retention trees, scarification of the soil was found to decrease feeding damage more effectively than on clearcuts and 10 m 3 sites. If the seedlings were situated in the centre of scarified patches, scarification alone was as effective as insecticide treatment on unscarified soil for decreasing feeding damage and mortality. 5 The results suggest that when burning is applied as silvicultural treatment after clear‐cuts, retention of trees is recommended to reduce the damages caused by pine weevils on pine seedlings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Scots pine Pinus sylvestris was originally introduced to Iceland in the beginning of the 20th Century. Extensive plantings started in the late 1940s and, in total, 2–3 million Scots pine seedlings were planted, mainly originating from two counties in northern Norway. Part of this plant material was imported as seedlings. Pine woolly aphid Pineus pini was introduced to Iceland before 1940, most likely on imported seedlings in 1937. High mortality of Scots pine, concurrent with high infestation of the pine woolly aphid, was observed in Iceland during the late 1950s and 1960s and planting was discontinued. Provenance trials with Scots pine were established in Iceland in 2004–2006. They consisted of 15 provenances from Norway, four from Finland, four from Scotland, one from Russia, one from the Austrian Alps and three first generation Scots pine provenances from Iceland, collected from survivors of the epidemic in the 1950s and 1960s. In total, there were 28 provenances. The Icelandic provenances had significantly lower P. pini infestation than all the provenances of non‐Icelandic origin, which indicates that natural selection in Scots pine in Iceland has occurred in favour of individuals less susceptible to P. pini .",

Indeed, there are already some modelling studies published which almost exclusively use life cycle data based on temperature rather than humidity to predict D. suzukii population dynamics or geographical distribution. However, there are still considerable research gaps mentioned in the literature, e.g. the effect of cold hardening, humidity, host phenology, and natural enemies on D. suzukii population dynamics.",

The proportion of A. tsugae crawlers settling on hemlock branches (vs. dropping from them) was highest beneath acrylic filters that blocked the widest spectrum of solar radiation (opaque and amber filters). Our results suggest that A. tsugae crawler behaviour is directly affected by solar radiation via negative phototaxis and/or thermotaxis, with behaviour influenced more by visible light than ultraviolet light.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Genetic variation among host plants can influence herbivore behaviour and consequently their abundance, performance and environmental impact. In the Andean‐Patagonian forest, the arboreal vegetation is dominated by species of genus Nothofagus . Previous studies of Nothofagus alpina demonstrated differences in genetic diversity among and within its populations. The native caterpillar Perzelia arda feeds on various Nothofagus sp. Our aim was to evaluate host selection behaviour of P. arda larvae towards different genetic pools of N. alpina trees. We collected leaf samples from trees growing in a common garden field trial and evaluated, by paired comparisons, not only differences among provenances but also variation between and within open pollinated families. Our results demonstrated that P. arda performed a choice between the leaves of the host plants offered. This larva was able to choose specific provenances, open pollinated families and genotypes of N. alpina . In conclusion, the larva is guided by characteristics of individuals and host plant species. These innovative results in insect–plant interaction studies demonstrate that it is important to evaluate discrimination between intra‐specific hosts. Further study is required to fully understand the use of resources by this native insect, as well as the ecological consequences.",

About 132 tritrophic ant-aphid-host plant interactions including 85 tritrophic interactions of ants–aphids–host plants in cultivated, 27 tritrophic interactions in uncultivated and 20 tritrophic interactions in urban areas were revealed.

We studied whether intrinsic differences in stable‐isotopic ratios of C and N from an artificial C 4 (sugar‐cane) or C 3 (muti‐flower honey) diet could help mark and track predators that feed on them. Two aphid predators solely feeding on sugar resources as adults were used: the green lacewing Chrysoperla carnea s.l., and the parasitic wasp Aphidius colemani . δ 13 C and δ1 5 N values from wild individuals helped distinguish them from marked ones and determine the habitat resources they used. Green lacewings fed on C 4 showed significantly higher δ 13 C values than those on C3 and wild individuals. However, parasitoid values were unaffected, with no mark acquired. Logistic regression was fitted to assess the probability of green lacewings having either diet with a probability of 0.93. Marks were acquired after 5 days and were detectable 20 days after switching diets with a probability of 0.67. Similar δ 15 N values for both wild populations indicated both predators had similar prey, but different vegetal resources (different δ 13 C values). Sugar‐cane honey is a natural and reliable marker for tracking lacewing populations in the field, but not for parasitoids.",

    "abstract": "The Portuguese millipede, Ommatoiulus moreleti (Lucas, 1860), is increasingly a pest of grains crops in Australian agricultural ecosystems. With the rapid uptake of minimum‐tillage practices, habitat quality has been enhanced for several species of soil dwelling invertebrates, in particular O. moreleti . To understand the population dynamics of O. moreleti in Australian grains crops, populations were sampled at multiple sites for more than 2 years using pitfall traps and cardboard roll traps. Specimens were dissected to investigate reproductive status and developmental stage. Millipede trapping rates varied between sites and across the year, and tended to be lower when soil water content (m 3 /m 3 ) was high. Both sexes were active year round, however females were relatively more abundant when ground temperatures were higher. Males in a copulatory state and females with mature eggs were collected year round although females lacking mature eggs were more common when ground temperatures were higher and the soil was drier, and female egg load was higher under cooler conditions. Females at a stadium 9 or later carried mature eggs and copulatory males tended to be from stadium 8 or later. Different developmental stages could be recovered at all times of the year. These findings indicate persistent populations of O. moreleti across fields throughout the year, with a key breeding period in autumn but likely opportunistic breeding all year. Control of millipedes will need to focus on increasing the impact of biological agents, decreasing suitable habitat for millipede breeding and intensive control at susceptible crop periods.",

    "abstract": "Short-rotation coppices shift carabid communities towards forest species assemblages, while decreasing species numbers and abundances of open habitat species. This leads to a decline in gamma diversity. We identified shrub cover and temperature as main environmental drivers for changes in species numbers, abundances and rarefied richness. Herb cover showed only marginal effects. We conclude that gap implementation increases gamma diversity, due to the co-existence of open habitat and closed habitat specialists. However, continuous management of gaps (e.g. removal of herb layer) might be necessary to uphold those initial positive effects.",

Flies prefer leaves and leaf extracts of red oak compared to leaves of other trees and shrubs, including blueberry. Female antennae responded to compounds extracted from red oak leaves. We speculate flies recruit to trees before movement into blueberry fields primarily for food, as supported by their arrestment response to leaf extracts.",

Subterranean trapping revealed below-ground movements of carabids that may be missed with standard pitfall trapping alone. Trap type accounted for the most variance observed in carabid community composition. Subterranean traps were more efficient in trapping carabid larvae. For predaceous larvae standard pitfalls showed lowest abundances in under-sown barley, yet subterranean traps revealed highest abundances in this crop.",
