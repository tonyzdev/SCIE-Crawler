    "abstract": "Although auditory distance perception is a critical component of spatial hearing, it has received substantially less scienti.c attention than the directional aspects of auditory localization. Here we summarize current knowledge on auditory distance perception, with special emphasis on recent research results. The summary will be structured around three central questions. 1. How accurately can humans estimate the distances of stationary sound sources? We show that this psychophysical relationship is well approximated by a compressive power function, which suggests that listeners systematically underestimate distances to faraway sound sources. 2. What determines perceived sound source distance? We examine the various acoustical and non-acoustical factors thought to contribute to source distance percepts, and summarize the psychophysical literature relevant to each factor. 3. What are the neural correlates to perceived sound source distance? Recent evidence points to the role of areas within right temporal cortex in auditory distance perception, as well as in other spatial tasks in different sensory modalities.",

    "abstract": "According to guidelines proposed in Sweden, at least 80% of the visitors in quiet areas should perceive the sound environment as This was the starting point for a questionnaire study on in four suburban green areas and in four city parks. The soundscapes in the suburban areas were completely dominated by sounds from nature (e.g., bird song and sounds from water), whereas traffic noise was a main component of the city-park soundscapes. Measured equivalent sound levels (from all sources) ranged from 42 to 50 dBA in the suburban green areas, and from 49 to 60 dBA in the city parks (L Aeq,15min ). Soundscape was assessed by a five-point bipolar category scale. Among the respondents, 84-100% in the suburban green areas and 53-65% in the city parks assessed the soundscape as Good or Very good. Thus, all suburban green areas but none of the city parks reached the stipulated goal (at least 80%). The soundcape quality was confirmed by attribute profiling using a set of 12 adjectives. Based on the visitor's responses, it is concluded that good soundscape quality can only be achieved if the traffic noise exposure in suburban green areas and city parks during day time is below 50 dBA.",

In the present paper, far field boundary conditions are developed for a 3-D geometry. Two validation test cases involving respectively an acoustic pulse and an axisymmetric ring vortex in a uniform mean flow are also proposed. The solutions from linearized Euler equations show that the far field boundary conditions allow the exit of acoustic waves without generating significant spurious waves. The exit of vortical disturbances is more difficult to treat with efficiency because of their high magnitude. For this case, the implementation of a sponge zone is presented to decrease the amplitude of acoustic reflections.",

    "abstract": "The sounds that are elicited when we touch or use many everyday objects typically convey potentially useful information regarding the nature of the stimuli with which we are interacting. Here we review the rapidly-growing literature demonstrating the influence of auditory cues (such as overall sound level and the spectral distribution of the sounds) on multisensory product perception. The results of a number of studies now show that the modulation of the auditory cues elicited by our contact or interaction with different surfaces (such as abrasive sandpapers or even our own skin) and products (including electric toothbrushes, aerosol sprays, food mixers, and cars) can dramatically change the way in which they are perceived, despite the fact that we are often unaware of the influence of such auditory cues on our perception. The auditory cues generated by products can also be modified in order to change people's perception of the quality/efficiency of those products. The principles of sound design have also been used recently to alter people's perception of a variety of foodstuffs. Findings such as these demonstrate the automatic and obligatory nature of multisensory integration, and show how the cues available in one sensory modality can modulate people's perception of stimuli in other sensory modalities (despite the fact that they may not be aware of the importance of such crossmodal influences). We also highlight evidence showing that auditory cues can influence product perception at a more semantic level, as demonstrated by research on signature sounds and emotional product sound design.",

The soundscape of this environment may add to the restorative and appealing power of the area. In European directives and policy intentions of many countries, the preservation and management of quiet areas has been subscribed. Nevertheless there is little scientific knowledge on how to characterize such areas and possibly grant quality labels. In this manuscript the quiet rural soundscape is studied within its specific context: non-acoustical environment, use... Several indicators for its characterization are derived from a theoretical point of view. These indicators are tested on usability in a particular case study. This leads us to proposing a multi-criteria assessment of quality labels for the quiet rural soundscape.",

We suggest a definition as well as an experimental operationalization for plausibility, referring to the perceived agreement with the listener’s expectation towards an equivalent real acoustic event. A listening test methodology for the criterion-free assessment of the deviation from this non-explicit, inner reference is proposed. It requires the rating of corresponding real and simulated stimuli in a Yes/No test paradigm, and the analysis of the results according to signal detection theory. The specification of minimum effect hypotheses allows the testing of plausibility with any desired strictness. The approach is demonstrated with the perceptual evaluation of a system for dynamic binaural synthesis in two different development stages.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare different sounds which can be used in open-plan offices to mask distracting speech. Fifty-four subjects were tested in seven sound conditions: speech, silence and five masked speech conditions. The five masking sounds were filtered pink noise, ventilation noise, instrumental music, vocal music and the sound of spring water. They were superimposed on speech. The masked speech conditions corresponded to an acoustically excellent open-plan office in respect to the Speech Transmission Index (STI 0.38). The speech condition (STI 0.62) corresponded to the STI obtained between nearby workstations in an acoustically poor open-plan office. Silent condition (STI 0.00) corresponded to the STI measured between two nearby private office rooms. In each of the seven sound conditions, the subjects performed a short-term memory task, a proofreading task and a creative thinking task and completed a questionnaire on acoustic comfort. Compared to silence condition, short-term memory performance deteriorated in speech condition and in most masked speech conditions. Compared to speech condition, performance improved when speech was masked with spring water sound. Ratings of acoustic satisfaction and subjective workload showed that masked speech conditions subjectively improved the working conditions compared to speech condition. Overall, the performance results and subjective perceptions showed that the spring water sound was the most optimal speech masker whereas vocal music produced negative effects similar to those of speech. The use of constant masking sounds should be preferred in open-plan offices instead of instrumental or vocal music.",

Three experiments were carried out to explore the ecological validity of reproduction systems. The reference study consisted of interviews conducted in actual environments, which were also recorded simultaneously. The recordings were used for two listening tests, the first one using stereophonic reproduction and the second one using multichannel reproduction. The comparison of the verbal data collected in the different contexts sketches some theoretical and methodological issues concerning the reproduction of everyday life scenes in laboratory conditions. The linguistic analyses indicate that the “same” acoustic phenomenon gives rise to different cognitive representations, depending on the spatial presentatio no ft he stimuli. It follows that the quality of the reproduction system must be adapted to specific properties of mental representations (here, spatial immersion vs. source identification). On methodological grounds, the analysis of spontaneous language representations gives access to cognitive representations elaborated in real life situations and in experimental conditions. The comparison of the linguistic exploration can then be used as a psycholinguistic measure of the ecological validity of experimental settings.",

    "abstract": "On a tool for measuring in urban residential areas An attribute-profiling tool, customized for 106 residents’ structured listening walks, was developed for measuring soundscape quality in 24 kinds of listening places representing four urban residential areas exposed to road-traffic noise. The tool’s 12 attributes were matched to the on a scale from 0 to 100%. The attributes were: soothing, pleasant, light, dull, eventful, exciting, stressful, hard intrusive, annoying, noisy and loud. In total, the of 636 unique 30-s soundscapes was measured. For good (pleasant and soothing) to predominate outdoors, the overall sound level of soundscapes had to be below ca. 50 dB LAeq,30s. Indoor soundscapes (closed windows) at exposed sides of buildings were found to be of inferior compared to outdoor soundscapes at shielded sides. This was true although the former soundscapes were 14 dB LAeq,30s lower than the latter. A PCA analysis of the 12-attribute profiles of the 24 kinds of listening places shoed that residents actually perceived signature of linked to the origin of the soundscapes, whether indoor or outdoors. All soundscapes at shielded sides indoors with closed windows clustered together with the indoor and outdoor soundscapes in the low road-traffic noise exposed residential area. Conversely, at buildings ides with high traffic-noise exposure, all soundscapes, outdoors or indoors with open window, clustered together with their outdoor soundscapes at the shielded d sides. The new attribute-profiling tool is promising because it measures beyond unwanted sounds and mere sound level of predominant noise.",

Distraction and speech privacy can be estimated objectively by determining speech intelligibility between workstations. Previously used measurement methods have focused on two neighbouring workstations. However, noise complaints are not restricted to the nearest workstation. The aim of this paper is to suggest a new method to measure and characterize the acoustical conditions of the whole office space, including both short and long distances from the speaker. The method should result in compact and expedient single-number quantities to improve the utilization of the method in building design. The measurement is carried out between workstations along a line consisting of at least 4 workstations. Measurements are made for background noise level, spatial reduction of Speech Transmission Index, STI, and spatial reduction of the SPL of normal effort speech. An omni-directional loudspeaker is used. The acoustic performance of offices could be logically described by three single number quantities: distraction distance, r D , spatial attenuation rate of A-weighted SPL of speech, DL 2 , and SPL of speech at a distance of 4 metres, L p.S,4m . The method has been validated in 16 offices which varied significantly in room geometry, furniture and absorption. The differences between offices were unexpectedly large. Recommendations are presented for new target values which are already adopted in two Finnish guidelines.",

    "abstract": "The revision of the French method for road traffic noise prediction (NMPB-Routes-2008) is now published. The major principles of NMPB-Routes-2008 are outlined. The most important modifications regarding the source are the reduction of its height and the introduction of two different spectra. In this complete revision, the main change is the replacement of the ISO 9613-2-based ground attenuation formula in downward-refraction conditions by the formula for ground attenuation in homogeneous conditions of NMPB-Routes-1996 with corrected heights in order to take into account the mean curvature of rays (refraction) and its scattering (turbulence). NMPB-Routes-2008 adds an attenuation term for an occasional cutting embankment. Regarding diffraction the dif formula is now more suitable for low height barriers. The validation of NMPB-Routes-2008 with respect to experiment is presented. It is based on measurement campaigns on 6 sites with complex geometries and shows that the predicted noise levels obtained from NMPB-Routes-2008 are significantly closer to experimental results than in the case of the original method.

Since its estimation requires the sound pressure on a surrounding surface of the radiating object, the sound power value is mostly computed under high numerical costs due to the acoustic field that has to be modeled. Therefore, approximations of the sound pressure are widely popular. In this article three common methods namely the equivalent radiated power, the lumped parameter model and an approximation based on the volume velocity are investigated. It is the goal of this paper to test these methods on realistic examples. The radiated sound power functions of the floor panel of a car and the radiation of a diesel engine under realistic load cases are estimated.",

    "abstract": "Summary In modeling the acoustical behavior of porous materials, the determination of the physical parameters (that are airflow resistivity, open porosity, tortuosity and viscous and thermal characteristic lengths) is a fundamental issue. As an alternative to measuring some of these quantities directly, it is possible to use inverse strategies to calculate them once some of the acoustical parameters are experimentally known. In this work both analytical and minimization-based methods will be investigated to determine the physical parameters of porous materials. Among the analytical approaches (that are derived from dynamic density and bulk modulus expressions governing viscous and thermal dissipation of sound waves in rigid-framed porous media), several formulae have been proposed in literature and some will also be considered in the proposed analysis. In this paper only the procedures that are able to provide a complete set of physical data from acoustical tests will be investigated. The results will be compared with theoretical and experimental data and details related to the accuracy and reliability of the inversely determined parameters will also be reported and discussed.",

Our results indicate that this robust tracking in older adults does not arise merely from having the same responses as younger adults but with larger amplitudes; instead, they recruit additional regions, inferior to core auditory cortex, with a short latency of ~30 ms relative to the acoustic signal.",

This paper presents the analysis of the Cremer impedance model, i.e., the high frequency asymptotic results proposed by Tester for uniform mean flow (JSV 28(2), 1973) [2] are extended to lower frequencies. It is shown that significantly larger attenuation per unit length can be obtained using the exact instead of the asymptotic solution. However, for sufficiently low frequencies the Cremer solution and optimum attenuation is requiring a wall impedance with a negative real part, i.e. an active boundary. In addition, the effect of a finite length on the resulting attenuation is studied using a finite element method for solving the convected wave equation. Finally, it is demonstrated how a silencer can be built that realize the optimum Cremer impedance at a given frequency by using a micro-perforated panel and locally reacting cavities. The performance of the optimized silencer is determined experimentally and the results are compared to the prediction of the finite element model.",

    "abstract": "We propose a two-mass model for the vocal folds. The aerodynamic force resulting from the air flow through the glottis is distributed over both masses, as opposed to some earlier models in which the force is allocated to the upstream mass only. This allows the choice of a symmetrical vocal-fold structure, with two identical mass-spring systems. The number of mechanical parameters is thus reduced. Their choice is inspired upon analysis of the eigenmodes of the actual vocal folds. The new aerodynamic force distribution allows acoustic feedback from vocal tract and trachea to be considered; sub- and supra-glottal systems are modelled as transmission lines. The flow model includes a simple flow-separation description. Parameter values are based on physiological measurements and calculations reported in literature. However, as in any vocal-fold model it is inevitable that parameters also partly make up for simplifications in the model. The model predictions are shown to compare well to in-vivo experimental data from literature concerning acoustic feedback. The two-mass model is applied to study the effect of size and position of a vocal-fold prosthesis on its performance. We indicate how the model should be modified to provide order-of-magnitude estimates of the effect of flow inertia and fluid viscosity. The described improvement of the flow model is not of predictive value within the framework of the simplified mechanical model we propose.",

By only relying on sound pressure levels averaged over long time periods and by suppressing all aspects of quality, the specific acoustic properties of environmental noise situations cannot be identified. Because annoyance caused by environmental noise has a broader linkage with various acoustical properties such as frequency spectrum, duration, impulsive, tonal and low-frequency components, etc. than only with SPL [1]. In many cases these acoustical properties a ect the quality of life. The human cognitive signal processing pays attention to further factors than only to the averaged intensity of the acoustical stimulus. Therefore, it appears inevitable to use further hearing-related parameters to improve the description and evaluation of environmental noise. A first step regarding the adequate description of environmental noise would be the extended application of existing measurement tools, as for example level meter with variable integration time and third octave analyzer, which o er valuable clues to disturbing patterns. Moreover, the use of psychoacoustics will allow the improved capturing of soundscape qualities.",

    "abstract": "Finite element (FE) models open up new possibilities in simulating and understanding production of human voice and speech. This study presents FE models of the human vocal tract for the Czech vowels /a:/, /e:/, /i:/, /o:/, /u:/ which were created from magnetic resonance images of an adult male subject. The high number of elements in the FE models was reduced by introducing acoustic superelements. A novel algorithm for parameterization of the FE models was derived to allow modifying and tuning the model shape according to prescribed acoustic characteristics (formants) of the vocal tract. The sound radiation losses at the lips and sound absorption at the vocal tract walls were taken into account. The frequency modal characteristics of the three-dimensional (3D) and one-dimensional (1D) vocal tract models were compared. The results showed that the ID models can closely replicate the behavior of the 3D vocal tract up to 3000 Hz. At higher frequencies transverse modes occurred in the 3D model which were not present in the ID model. The developed FE models can be useful for studying the influence of vocal tract alterations (e.g. such as cleft palate or tonsillectomy) on acoustic voice quality.",

    "abstract": "Ambisonics with height is a three-dimensional sound field reproduction technique for spherical loudspeaker arrangements surrounding the reproduction area. It employs spherical harmonics up to a given order to expand incident sound fields with a limited angular resolution. The expansion coefficients describe the spatial sound scene. For reproduction, these coefficients are decoded to a set of surrounding loudspeakers. Common decoding approaches either sample the spherical harmonic excitation at the loudspeaker positions or match the excitation modes of a continuous sound field to those of the loudspeakers. For well-designed spherical loudspeaker arrays, both decoding approaches achieve good perceptual localization of virtual sound sources. However, both approaches perform unsatisfactorily with non-uniformly arranged arrays. Sounds from directions with only sparse loudspeaker coverage appear with altered loudness levels. This distracting effect results from variations in the decoded energy. The present article demonstrates an improved decoding technique, which preserves the decoded energy. Using available objective estimators, the localization qualities of these energy-preserving decoders are shown to lie between both common decoding approaches.",

    "abstract": "Everyday listening environments are characterized by far more complex spatial, spectral and temporal sound field distributions than the acoustic stimuli that are typically employed in controlled laboratory settings. As such, the reproduction of acoustic listening environments has become important for several research avenues related to sound perception, such as hearing loss rehabilitation, soundscapes, speech communication, auditory scene analysis, automatic scene classification, and room acoustics. However, the recordings of acoustic environments that are used as test material in these research areas are usually designed specifically for one study, or are provided in custom databases that cannot be universally adapted, beyond their original application. In this work we present the Ambisonic Recordings of Typical Environments (ARTE) database, which addresses several research needs simultaneously: realistic audio recordings that can be reproduced in 3D, 2D, or binaurally, with known acoustic properties, including absolute level and room impulse response. Multichannel higher-order ambisonic recordings of 13 realistic typical environments (e.g., office, cafè, dinner party, train station) were processed, acoustically analyzed, and subjectively evaluated to determine their perceived identity. The recordings are delivered in a generic format that may be reproduced with different hardware setups, and may also be used in binaural, or single-channel setups. Room impulse responses, as well as detailed acoustic analyses, of all environments supplement the recordings. The database is made open to the research community with the explicit intention to expand it in the future and include more scenes.",

Furthermore the Microflown is used in the professional audio as a low frequency add on microphone for pressure gradient microphones (figure of eight; directional microphones). Due to its small dimensions and silicon based production method the Microflown is very suitable for mobile applications like mobile telephones or smartcards. Nowadays sound-energy determination, array applications and three-dimensional impulse response are under investigation.

In this paper, the rural and urban soundscape is assumed the voice of a complex system. Self-organized criticality is shown to occur at different levels in this underlying system. The power spectral density of loudness and pitch in recordings of rural and urban soundscapes indeed often follows quite closely to the typical 1/f frequency dependence in many cases. Looking in detail at the data, a breaking point is observed in many of the curves around 0.2 Hz, which corresponds to a period of 5 seconds. It seems logical to associate this to within event and between event sound dynamics. Indicators based on this analysis could be useful for cataloguing soundscape dynamics. By extension of the earlier finding that 1/f noise is quite common in music, labels such as “boring / dull ”o r “too chaotic / too unpredictable” may even be borrowed to describe soundscape dynamics.",

The surface is reconstructed by utilizing this structure, and subsequently simplified by merging coplanar regions. The results of the method are verified by extracting room acoustical attributes from the original and reduced models with the ODEON room acoustics prediction software.

Ring-shaped lined ducts are a common form of silencers; bent ducts with absorbing walls are favorite constructions as turning vanes for the flow in the corners of wind tunnels. The modal analysis of the sound fields in both types of ducts proceeds in parallel over wide parts. The most significant differences are found in the determination of the mode wave numbers. Whereas in the ring-shaped duct the arguments of the cylindrical functions are sought as radial wave numbers for given (mostly integer) orders of these functions, their (complex) orders are to be determined as azimuthal wave numbers in the curved duct, in which the arguments of the cylindrical functions can be supposed as known quantities, because their determination then is a rather simple standard task. If more than just the first-order approximation is required to the attenuation in a duct system containing a ring-shaped or a bent duct section (for that approximation the knowledge of the least attenuated mode would be sufficient) a set of mode wave numbers must be evaluated. This difficult sub-task of the modal analysis in both types of ducts is the principal topic of the present paper. The present part I of the paper is mainly concerned with curved ducts.",

Underlying dimensions that constitute the skeleton of these spaces are revealed by auditory experiments, following two different paradigms of judgment: a) Similarity-scaling, and b) Attribute-scaling (Semantic Differential) with subsequent a) Multidimensional Scaling, and b) Principal Component Analysis of a diverse set of stimuli. Similar configurations are obtained which are unequivocally interpretable. Three common dimensions, valid for both the narrowband and the wideband scenario can be identified: Discontinuity, Noisiness, and Coloration. In addition, the wideband space is extended by a further, wideband-specific dimension. Integral listening-quality can well be modeled by means of these dimensions. In both scenarios, Discontinuity represents the most important quality feature. The presented work forms the basis for instrumental diagnostic quality measures.",

One of the main achievements has been the provision of advanced hearing screening tests by telephone and Internet. Next to that it was aimed to harmonize hearing diagnostic tests for European languages. For this the concept of an Auditory Profile was defined on which a number of diagnostic hearing tests were developed in several languages. As hearing problems are also a result of adverse acoustical circumstances such as for room acoustics and telecom systems, these effects have been studied, modelled and evaluated for hearing impaired persons. In the area of rehabilitation a large scale comparison study was performed on signal enhancement techniques for hearing devices. Both objective and subjective benefits were found for specific listening conditions in relation to a chosen signal processing method. As modern technology may assist on hearing and communication it was studied how the use of automatic speech transcription or the use of handheld communication devices may help people with hearing problems. It is shown that communication benefits can be obtained, but that the benefit is limited in practice as processing power of today's handheld devices is still insufficient. An overview is given on the HearCom portal with sections for screening diagnostics, hearing information for the public and professionals, and a new HearCompanion service that provides step-by-step support for the hearing rehabilitation process. © S.

    "abstract": "In this paper low-voltage high-energy spark discharges in water and associated bubble oscillations are studied experimentally. Pressure waves emitted during spark discharges and during following bubble oscillations have been recorded and analyzed to determine the radiated acoustic energy and potential energy of the bubbles. These energies are then used to determine the efficiency of energy conversion. For example, it has been found out that only 2% to 8% of electrical energy stored in the capacitor bank is converted into the potential energy of the bubble at its first maximum volume and only about 30% of this potential energy is radiated as acoustic energy in the first bubble pulse. Due to specific features of the low-voltage apparatus used, bubbles of different sizes have been generated and these bubbles were found to oscillate with different intensities. To explain this great diversity in the generated bubbles, the electrical circuit of the apparatus and the early stages of the spark discharge are analyzed. While it is confirmed that the bubble size grows with the energy used for discharge, the relation between the intensity of bubble oscillations and the circuit parameters is more complex. To explain this relation, two hypotheses, partly supported by the data available, are presented. The first hypothesis concerns the rate of electrical energy delivery into the discharge channel, and the second hypothesis concerns the efficiency of electrical energy conversion into heat in the discharge channel.",

    "abstract": "Summary A number of masking phenomena can be modeled in terms of a linear auditory filter bank followed by a temporal integrator and a simple decision device based on the signal-to-masker ratio. Other aspects require the inclusion of a nonlinearity following linear filtering. The present article concentrates on aspects of non-simultaneous, or “temporal”, masking that cannot be explained by either modeling approach. A more realistic nonlinear model of cochlear processing is explored, and it is shown that most aspects of temporal masking can be accounted for with this model, in conjunction with a linear temporal integrator (temporal window) and the simple decision criterion. An earlier version of the model with a static nonlinearity following linear filtering can account for “on-frequency” nonlinearities in masking such as the growth of forward masking, the effects of forward masker duration, and the nonlinear additivity of forward and backward masking. The new model can account, in addition, for frequency-dependent nonlinearities in masking such as the upward spread of forward masking and certain aspects of two-tone suppression.",

Variations in frequency characteristics were found in the impact ball sounds and these were classified into three frequency groups. An auditory experiment was carried out to investigate the relationship between various level indices and subjective responses to floor impact sounds. It was found that sound quality ratings (LL z and N max ) as well as instrumental metrics (L Aeq , L Amax and L m,1/1(63―500) ) showed good correlation with impact sound annoyance. Among them, L Amax was suggested as a practical descriptor of the auditory sensation of impact ball sounds on the basis of measurement and calculation procedures. Additional auditory experiments were conducted to characterize the classified impact sound groups and to evaluate the annoyance of impact ball sounds through paired comparison and semantic differential tests. The results show that the impact ball sound with a dominant sound pressure level at 250 Hz was most annoying. Sound Quality (SQ) metrics were used to explain the annoyance level of heavy-weight floor impact sounds. The annoyance obtained from the paired comparison test correlated well with loudness and fluctuation strength. In the semantic differential test, it was found that the adjectives describing loudness had a dominant effect on the subjects' annoyance levels.",

The acoustical treatment of interior surfaces, the sound insulation of surrounding constructions, the vocal capacity of the teacher, student activity noise, children's abilities to hear and concentrate and the educational circumstances, are among the many factors in the complex mechanism of speech understanding. Managing the rich variety of measures for optimising classroom acoustics demands a multidisciplinary approach. In this article we propose a predictive model for speech intelligibility, as expressed with the parameter U50, based on objective acoustical values, i.e. the reverberation time RT, signal-to-noise ratio SN, and the relative proportions of sound arriving early and late at the listener. The present article introduces the model and derives guidelines for architectural design. The model is illustrated using a typical Dutch classroom as an example. Architectural guidelines are derived for maximum RT values, and compared with existing recommendations. The possible additional need for minimum RT values is also investigated in relation to the phenomenon of 'overdamping' in classrooms.",

The effect on uncertainty by including low frequencies is discussed. Many comparisons between 'old' and 'new' single-number values for building products are presented.

    "abstract": "Birds are common species in urban ecosystems and birdsong is an important element of many urban sound environments.Perceptions of birdsong loudness, based on a case study in Warnemünde, a coastal area in Germany, were analysed in terms of its role in urban sound environment, the relationships with other sounds, spatiotemporal characteristics, as well as the relationships with underlying landscape characteristics.An important and positive role of birdsong in urban soundscape perception in the study area was recognised.The analysis of the relationships between birdsong perception and other sounds suggested that, although birds could adjust their songs with continual urban traffic sounds, they are still sensitive to excessive sounds related to human appearance (adult voice, child voice and footstep) or human activities (construction sounds, music).The spatiotemporal patterns of perceived loudness of birdsong suggested the adapted patterns of bird species in urban areas.Perceived loudness of birdsong showed close relationships with the underlying landscape characteristics indicated by a series of landscape spatial pattern indices.Positive relationships were found with construction density, road density, vegetation density, as well as fragmentation status indicated by patch density, largest patch index, landscape shape index, fractal dimension and contagion.",

    "abstract": "In the development process of modern hearing aids, test scenarios that reproduce natural acoustic scenes have become increasingly important in recent years for the evaluation of new signal processing algorithms.To achieve high ecological validity, such scenarios should include components like reverberation, background noise, and multiple interfering talkers.Loudspeaker-based sound field reproduction techniques, such as higher-order Ambisonics, allow for the simulation of such complex sound environments and can be used for realistic listening experiments with hearing aids.However, to successfully employ such systems, it is crucial to know how experimental results from a virtual environment translate to the corresponding real environment.In this study, speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were measured with normal-hearing listeners wearing hearing aids, both in a real room and in a simulation of that room auralized via a spherical array of 29 loudspeakers, using either Ambisonics or a nearest loudspeaker method.The benefit from a static beamforming algorithm was considered in comparison to a hearing aid setting with omnidirectional microphones.The measured SRTs were about 2-4 dB higher, and the benefit from the beamformer setting was, on average, about 1.5 dB smaller in the virtual room than in the real room.These differences resulted from a more diffuse sound field in the virtual room as indicated by differences in measured directivity patterns for the hearing aids and interaural cross-correlation coefficients.Overall, the considered VSE system may represent a valuable tool for testing the effects of hearing-aid signal processing on physical and behavioural outcome measures in realistic acoustic environments.",

In-depth interviews with a heterogeneous group of 14 participants were conducted, and the acquired data were analysed to develop a conceptual model for describing perception and reaction to floor impact noise. It was found that floor impact noise had diverse sources, with the majority originating from footsteps. The participants negatively perceived the noise as annoying and disturbing, and sleep disturbance was reported the most frequently. Cognitive and avoidant coping strategies were initially adopted, and complaints were only thereafter registered if the noise persisted. It was also observed that exposure to the noise led to self-reported health problems and concerns. The developed conceptual model highlights potential intervention measures for controlling noise perception and reactions to floor impact noise.",

In this paper, the important effect of wind on noise barrier performance and the effect of rows of trees to improve wind profiles around noise barriers are modelled. A finite-difference time-domain simulation model is adapted for sound propagation outdoors in a complex, non-uniform background flow. The simulation of a typical traffic noise situation, where at either side of a line source a noise barrier is present, needs appropriate, non-reflecting boundary conditions like Perfectly Matched Layers (PML) to limit the simulation domain. The PML method is extended for sound propagation in background flow. The numerical model is validated based on two wind tunnel experiments at scale. These show that the model can be used successfully to simulate both the screen-induced refraction of sound and the effect of windscreens to improve downwind noise barrier performance. The influence of parameters involved like the porosity of the canopy of the trees, wind speed and distance between source and noise barrier were studied. Global effects of different configurations of windscreen for typical traffic noise are evaluated in an area of interest behind the downwind noise barrier, exceeding the study region in the wind tunnel experiments.",

In particular, it has been difficult to achieve an accurate description of the road and rolling tyre contact, which is crucial for the estimation of tyre/road noise. In this paper, a three-dimensional contact model for the tyre/road interaction in rolling conditions is described, validated and illustrated by means of calculations. The contact model is formulated in the time domain for non-linearity reasons. It calculates the dynamic radial contact forces, the local deformation due to roughness indenting, and the normal forced vibrations of the tyre structure. The contact problem is solved using an elastic half-space, the road is assumed rigid. The tyre response is described by Greens functions calculated with a tyre model, a pre-tensioned orthotropic Kirchhoffs plate on a stiffness bedding. Measured acceleration signals of the tyre structure and calculated ones were compared. Results show that the agreement was good for the studied case.",

    "abstract": "Urban noise mapping traditionally involves the use of a traffic simulation model, which is often based on the estimation of macroscopic traffic flows. However, intersections and other local traffic management measures are not always modeled correctly. It is well known that the specific deceleration and acceleration dynamics of traffic at junctions can influence local noise emission. Finding the best strategy for using traffic modeling results in noise mapping is a current topic of research in the IMAGINE project. In this paper, a case study is presented, consisting of a large set of microscopic traffic simulations and associated noise emission calculations, which provides some insight into the specific dynamics of the noise emission near different types of intersections. It will be shown that it is possible to refine current traffic noise prediction models, based on macroscopic traffic simulation, using a correction on the average vehicle emission, aggregated in lane segments. A spatial approach should be used, in which inbound and outbound lanes are divided into deceleration, queuing, stopline and acceleration zones. Results from regression analysis on the numerical simulations indicate that meaningful relations between noise corrections and traffic flow parameters such as traffic intensity and composition can be deduced.",

    "abstract": "Sound sources for measurements in room acoustics are of omni-directional type, in general. With respect to auralization applications, an omni-directionally measured room impulse response may not be the ideal choice since it does not represent the real life situation playing an instrument in the room. To achieve the directivity of a real source (like a musical instrument or human voice) with a technical sound source (like a loudspeaker) requires either to copy the entire body and the sound radiation (i.e. the surface velocity) of that particular source or to reproduce the directional pattern of the radiation using a multiple source configuration like a dodecahedron or icosahedron loudspeaker array with independent excitation of each transducer. The advantage of the latter method is obvious since one single source is able to provide a large variety of different directivities by simply changing the excitation profile. To maintain the appropriate excitation of each individual transducer, different approaches can be made. In this paper a method is described using a discretely measured target radiation pattern to calculate the frequency dependent excitation signals for each transducer. Hereby, the directivity pattern of the source transducers and a phase optimization of the energy averaged radiation of musical instruments are used. The advantage of this method is a very flexible computation that is able to match the radiation pattern at the points of measurement very well.

The Entropy Wave Generator (EWG) experiment is best suited for validating the proposed approach and for investigating the acoustic sources of entropy noise. The EWG involves a non-reactive tube flow, where entropy modes are imposed to an incoming air flow by using a heating module. The generated temperature non-uniformities are accelerated with the mean flow downstream in a convergent divergent nozzle, thus producing entropy noise. Simulation results of pressure fluctuations and their spectra for a defined standard configuration as well as for diff erent operating points of the EWG agree very well with the respective experimental data. Additionally, an analysis of the acoustic sources was performed. For this purpose the acoustic sources caused by the acceleration of density inhomogeneities were calculated. For the first time, a numerical method is introduced for the localization of the acoustic sources of entropy noise in acceleration/deceleration regions.",

A physics-based model was used to generate synthetic clarinet tones by varying the main control parameters of the model (related to the blowing pressure and lip pressure on the reed). 16 participants had to rate the dissimilarities between pairs of different tones and describe the factors on which they based their judgments in a questionnaire. The collected data were subjected to various statistical analyses (multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering) in order to obtain a low-dimensional spatial configuration (timbre space) which best represents the dissimilarity ratings. The structure of the clarinet timbre space was interpreted both in terms of control parameters and acoustical descriptors. The analyses revealed a 3-dimensional timbre space, whose dimensions were well correlated to the Attack Time, the Spectral Centroid, and the Odd/Even Ratio. Comparisons of natural and synthetic clarinet tones showed that the Odd/Even Ratio appears to be a good predictor of the beating reed situation, specific to single-reed instruments.",

In this paper, we investigate the advantages that spherical microphone arrays provide for blind separation of convolutive mixtures using independent component analysis. We demonstrate that applying a standard, linear independent component analysis model in the phase-mode domain enables one to both localize the sources and resolve the permutation problem that plagues most implementations of independent component analysis. As well, we show that the standard linear independent component analysis model can be incorporated into beamforming approaches for source localization and source separation. Simulation results indicate that this approach works in realistic scenarios that include room reverberation.",

The porcelain sample was measured while increasing the temperature up to 1000 C/5 C/min. Thermodilatometry was performed to determine the actual dimensions of the sample in the same temperature regime. We assessed the influence of the repeatability of the directly measured values, the accuracy of the used measurers and di erent exceptions from the ideal experimental arrangement on the Young’s modulus measurement uncertainties of types A and B. We found that the majority of the total uncertainty (80%) is determined at the room temperature. The remaining sources of uncertainty can be attributed to thermal expansion of the sample and inhomogeneity of the temperature field. The relative expanded uncertainty of the Young’s modulus at the elevated temperatures was 0.9%.",

The sound field reproduction problem is formulated as an inverse problem, in which the reproduction of the target sound field is attempted in the interior of a bounded control region surrounded by a continuous distribution of secondary sources. The determination of the secondary source strength is an ill-posed problem. A general formula for the solution is derived (assuming its existence) and it is shown that nonuniqueness arises when the wavenumber is one of the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the control region. It is shown that, when this is not the case, the solution of the problem is unique. Some strategies are presented that enable the nonuniqueness to be overcome. The case is also studied of the wavenumber being one of the Dirichlet eigenvalues of the region bounded by the secondary source distribution, which contains but generally does not coincide with the control region. The results derived are illustrated for a two dimensional problem with a finite number of secondary sources.",

    "abstract": "The sound of a solid body electric guitar comes from the loudspeaker transducing into sound the string velocity. Because of mechanical string-structure coupling, the string vibration, and therefore the sound, substantially depends on the lutherie parameters. This study focuses on the comparison between ebony-fingerboard and rosewood-fingerboard guitars: is a change in the fingerboard wood perceived by the guitar players? In order to test the hypothesis that it is actually perceived, a psychological investigation is carried out. Two experimental methods are used: a free sorting task with recorded stimuli from the guitars (listening test) and a free verbalisation task where the guitarists play the guitars. In the listening test, the guitarists perceive differences between guitars, but the resulting clusters do not show an ebony/rosewood dichotomy. A linguistic analysis of the verbalisations exhibits psychological descriptors that are relevant for the discrimination of the wood of the fingerboard: PRECISION (referring to how each note stands out from others), and to a lesser extent ATTACK (referring to the guitar's response to musician's gesture) and BALANCE (referring to the frequency content). This study is part of a broader project aiming at establishing an explicite relation between mechanics, perception, and lutherie. A physical interpretation of the psychologically-relevant descriptors is eventually proposed in order to use them as hypotheses in a further hypothetico-deductive approach starting from physics and using psychophysical methods.",

The CUEX algorithm uses a combination of traditional methods to segment the audio stream into tones based on fundamental frequency contour and sound level envelope. From the resulting onset and offset positions, the different tone parameters are computed. CUEX has been evaluated using both synthesized performances and recordings of human performances. For the synthesized performances, tone recognition of 98.7% was obtained in average. The onset and offset precision was 8 ms and 20 ms, respectively, and the sound level precision about 1 dB.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the perception of speech quality over telephone channels with time-varying transmission characteristics for simulated conversational structures. The aim is to establish a relationship between subjective quality associated with short speech samples (5―6 seconds) and quality associated with overall conversations (1― 2 minutes). Two two-part experiments were conducted. In the first part of each experiment, dialog-final ratings within the temporal structure of a telephone conversation were assessed. Varying transmission characteristics were realized with ten different degradation profiles of preprocessed speech samples obtained mainly from real mobile channels to ensure authentic types of degradation. The second part was carried out to obtain separate short-term ratings of the speech samples used in the first part. Experiments 1 and 2 tested different conversation durations (1 and 2 minutes). The results demonstrate that dialog-final ratings vary with respect to the degradation profile, revealing a recency effect and a strong impact of individual bad samples. Two related models which implement these findings are presented. With these models, dialog-final quality ratings can be estimated significantly better than by plain averaging of short sample ratings (about 10% absolute improvement). They also perform better than two algorithms taken from literature. Both models can be applied to the instrumental method described in ITU-T Rec. P.862 [1], resulting in about 13% absolute improvement. They were evaluated with the results of two different experiments, which were performed independently but on the basis of our test procedure. In these experiments similar profiles but a different type of quality degradation, different sample durations, and different speech material were used. The models proved to be valid and reliable for the time span investigated (1―2 minutes) and for the profiles used. One of them is now being recommended by the ETSI STQ mobile group.",

    "abstract": "In 1873 Lord Rayleigh defined the General Reciprocity Theorem for stable, finite, lumped, passive, linear dynamical systems which only contain reversible (bilateral) elements. In spite of Rayleigh's authority, there have been a number of papers expressing doubts about the validity of the theorem for certain acoustical and mechano-acoustical systems. It can be shown however, that these papers are either based on too primitive experiments or on too simple theoretical models. On the other hand there are many publications showing the validity of the theorem. It can be concluded that Rayleigh's theorem is correct. Flow disturbs reciprocity because it introduces non-reversible elements. Nevertheless, in many systems with flow, the disturbing effect is limited and reciprocity can still be applied. The most straightforward application of reciprocity is the measurement of transfer functions. Second in order, because it requires two measurements instead of one, is the measurement of acoustical or mechanical source strength by reciprocal substitution. Third in order, because it needs three measurements, is the reciprocity calibration of microphones and hydrophones. Until 1970, only the latter application was known. In the period between 1970 and 1988 the author of this paper and his colleagues developed a number of methods for the reciprocal measurement of transfer functions and source strength in mechano-acoustical and acoustical systems. It was shown that the reciprocal measurement of transfer functions and of source strength has often great advantages over the direct alternatives. Since 1985, others joined the efforts. Particularly J. W. Verheij, F. J. Fahy and I. L. Ver have done very much for the further development and dissemination of the methods. Nowadays they are widely applied in the automotive industry and in the shipbuilding industry, where they are used for transfer path analysis, data gathering for prediction methods, source identification, source characterisation and for radiation measurements. The methods are also applied to aircraft, trains and buildings, but the dissemination of the methods for those systems is less than for cars, trucks and ships. Further applications concern the development of quiet gearboxes, the development of quiet fans, the prediction of the effects of sonic booms and the design of musical instruments.",

    "abstract": "This work concerns the theoretical analysis and synthesis of sound fields by a compact spherical loudspeaker array. Such an electroacoustic device consists of several transducers mounted on a sphere-like structure, which are driven independently in order to achieve non-uniform directivity patterns. The control strategy usually adopted is to provide the array with some preprogrammed basic directivities corresponding to spherical harmonic functions. Thus, an arbitrary radiation pattern can be approximately achieved by changing the gains associated with these basic directivities. Here, a different approach based on the acoustic radiation modes of the array is proposed. Unlike spherical harmonics, radiation modes constitute a finite set of vectors that spans a subspace on which any radiation pattern the array is able to reproduce can be projected. Furthermore, radiation modes radiate sound energy independently. Since the eigenvalue analysis that must be carried out in order to obtain the modes leads also to their radiation efficiencies, the low frequency constraint in the directivity synthesis by a spherical array is naturally evaluated. Finally, it is useless to drive inefficient radiation modes. Therefore, the radiation mode approach leads to a reduced number of active channels, and to minimum source voltages for a given target directivity pattern.",

The main scope of this model is to provide a proper foundation for a wide number of room acoustic simulation models, in order to establish and unify their principles. It is shown that this room acoustic modeling technique establishes the basis of two recently proposed algorithms, the acoustic diffusion equation and the room acoustic rendering equation.

For such an application, the absorber should fulfil a twofold requirement: provide absorption in a frequency band ranging from 500 up to 14000 Hz, and the face in contact with the air vein must be free of porous material. The equations for calculating the absorption coefficient at normal incidence allows to predict the performance of such a system as a function of its constitutive parameters. A prototype providing average absorption of 94% in the frequency band (500, 14000) Hz is finally built and validated experimentally in both an impedance tube and a wind tunnel.",

    "abstract": "This work investigates the effects of diffusive surfaces on concert hall acoustics using scale models with regard to hall shape and diffuser location. Two simple 1:50 scale models (shoebox and fan-shaped) were produced to measure the RT and SPL, which were decreased by wall diffusers in both hall shapes. In the shoebox hall, SPL was increased especially in the frontal area but was decreased in the rear area due to redirection of the second reflections by the opposite lateral walls, whereas SPL was decreased in both the frontal and rear area in the fan-shaped hall. For in-depth investigation of diffuser location and profile, three shoebox model halls were reproduced: a 1:50 symphony hall, a 1:25 chamber hall and a 1:25 theater. Minimal reductions in RT and LL and decreased spatial deviation in acoustical parameters were established as criteria to determine the effective diffuser location. The halves of the lateral walls closest to the stage were found to be the most effective areas for diffuser installation. Additionally, large and sparse diffuser profiles usually provided better acoustical results.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade, acoustic pots inserted into the walls and roofs of medieval and modern churches havebeen the focus of renewed scientiﬁc curiosity after a long time of relative silence. Traditionally, authors fromthe Middle Ages to the present time considered that Vitruvius established the relation between the “vasa aerea”(bronze vessels) in ancient Greek theatres and the “ﬁctilibus doliis” (earthen vessels). Vitruvius’s text and phi-losophy is analysed with regards to acoustics, and his recommendations are compared with medieval, modernand contemporary texts about acoustic pots. Most of them hints at an acoustical purpose for the pots. Therefore,the literature survey is supplemented with an acoustical survey of 25 French churches where pots still remain.Recent measurements and observations in some those churches, completed with recent data from foreign studies,are consistent with an acoustical purpose of the pots to decrease the reverberation time at frequencies stronglyexcited by the spoken voice.",

    "abstract": "Room surfaces have been extensively modeled as locally reacting in room acoustic predictions although such modeling could yield significant errors under certain conditions. Therefore, this study aims to propose a guideline for adopting the local reaction assumption by comparing predicted random incidence acoustical characteristics of typical building elements made of porous materials assuming extended and local reaction. For each surface reaction, five well-established wave propagation models, the Delany-Bazley, Miki, Beranek, Allard-Champoux, and Biot model, are employed. Effects of the flow resistivity and the absorber thickness on the difference between the two surface reaction models are examined and discussed. For a porous absorber backed by a rigid surface, the assumption of local reaction always underestimates the random incidence absorption coefficient and the local reaction models give errors of less than 10% if the thickness exceeds 120 mm for a flow resistivity of 5000 Nm –4 s. As the flow resistivity doubles, a decrease in the required thickness by 25 mm is observed to achieve the same amount of error. For an absorber backed by an air gap, the thickness ratio between the material and air cavity is important, since the thicker the cavity, the more extendedly reacting the absorber. If the absorber thickness is approximately 40% of the cavity depth, the local reaction models give errors below 10% even for a low flow resistivity case.",

Comparative results are shown for some key quantities. Damping trends with frequency are shown to have unexpectedly different forms for violins and for guitars. Linear averaging to estimate the direct field component gives a simple and clear visualisation of any local resonance behaviour near the bridge, such as the bridge and reveals some violins that show a double hill, while viols show only weak hills, and guitars none at all. © S.

The location is needed, for example, in room acoustic studies, auralization, inference of room geometry, or when estimating the acoustic properties of surfaces. This article studies the localization of acoustic reflections from spatial impulse responses. The contribution of this article is threefold. First, the article proposes a new method for localization that takes advantage of the time of arrival (TOA) estimation. Secondly, it is proposed that TOA and time diff erence of arrival (TDOA) information, present in the spatial room impulse responses, are combined in two novel ways. Thirdly, the performance of the proposed localization methods is compared to the existing state-of-the-art localization methods in the acoustic reflection localization task. Theoretical performance is investigated and experiments using real and simulated data are conducted. The TOA-based methods are found to achieve reasonably good performance in the reflection localization task. When TOA and TDOA information is combined the performance clearly improves.",

The mechanisms of buffeting noise are examined by considering a model cavity. Extensive experiments are performed to validate the computational scheme developed in the present study. This computational scheme is used for designing generic deflectors for reducing buffeting noise. Experimental and computational results show that the traditional generic deflector is unable to reduce the buffeting noise when the flow velocity is sufficiently high. However, a vented deflector allows the effective control of the buffeting noise at relatively high flow speeds.",

This is\r\nsatisfactory as long as the wavelength is longer than the largest transverse dimension of the vocal tract. For shorter\r\nwavelengths, higher order acoustical modes can propagate and the particle velocity field in the mouth exit plane\r\ncan be nonuniform. As a consequence, the plane piston assumption does not hold and a more accurate description\r\nof the particle velocity distribution at the mouth exit is necessary. This can be achieved using the multimodal\r\ntheory which allows one to account for higher order mode propagation. In order to study the influence of higher\r\norder modes on the sound radiated from the mouth, four approximations of the vocal tract shape for the vowel [A]\r\nare studied. The eccentricity of the junctions between the different portions of these geometries is used to control\r\nthe propagation of a higher order mode. The radiated sound is simulated and compared with the measurements\r\nperformed on mechanical replicas at various angles in the horizontal plane. It is observed that the propagation\r\nof a higher order mode can strongly modify the directivity. Varying the degree of eccentricity of the junction\r\nbetween the different sections shows that a very small eccentricity can induce the propagation of a higher order\r\nmode. Reducing the size of the open end shows that higher order modes can affect the radiated sound even if the\r\nradiating surface is small compared to the largest transverse dimension of the geometry.",

    "abstract": "Since the invention of sound diffusers three decades ago a substantial effort has been made to predict the acoustic behaviour of these structures, for auralisation and prediction purposes as well as in response to the large costs inherent in anechoic measurements. Volumetric methods such as Finite Element Methods (FEM) or the Finite Difference Time Domain method (FDTD) are not often used, due to their large computational cost. However Near Field to Far Field Transformations (NFFFT) can overcome that problem. The main advantages of the FDTD method are that a single calculation is sufficient to study a wide frequency band, and that the time domain behaviour of the reflected sound can be directly inspected. In this paper we present a comparison between the prediction techniques commented above in the context of sound diffusers, paying special attention to the FDTD method. Having demonstrated that the FDTD method can generate results comparable to more established techniques, early results concerning the modelled performance of diffusers in the time domain (‘time spreading’) are reported, opening a new field of research.",

    "abstract": "Numerous practical applications ― such as non destructive evaluation of industrial structures, acoustic characterization of musical instruments, and acoustic mapping of sound sources in a known propagation medium ― involve source detection and characterization. In the past, this problem has been investigated using different beamforming and backpropagation methods. In this work, a new technique, based on the time reversal sink concept, is used to detect active sound sources with a limited number of measurement points. The theory and application of super-resolution focusing of sound and vibration using a time-reversal sink (TRS) have been studied, both in ultrasonic regime and in audible range. A high-resolution imaging technique based on a numerical time reversal sink has recently been developed by the authors for vibrational imaging of active sources in a dispersive medium. In this paper, the numerical time reversal sink imaging technique is adapted to the case of high-resolution acoustic imaging of active sound sources in a three-dimensional free field. This technique allows high-resolution imaging and provides a new method of characterization and detection of sound sources. All results show the high resolution imaging capabilities of this new technique when compared with classical time-reversal (TR) backpropagation. More than simply detecting the position of the acoustic source, this technique allows to detect the size of the active sources. This technique provides an alternative to other imaging and source detection techniques, such as three-dimensional acoustic holography and beamforming.",

A statistical analysis of head, torso, and pinna dimensions of subjects including children and adults of all ages has been conducted for the first time to create a detailed database. Spatial cues are derived from CAD 1 models of the head using the Boundary Element Method (BEM) with a basic simplified model. Anthropometric parameters for the head and torso (height, breadth, length, and the distance from the ear to the shoulder) and for the pinna (height, breadth, and rotation angle, and cavum concha height, depth, and breadth) are analyzed and their effects are discussed. Varying each parameter individually makes it possible to isolate the effect of this parameter on the HRTF and on the spatial cues. The same approach is taken for various incidence angles. As far as the future construction of artificial heads for specific groups of population, including various ages, is concerned, the results presented here show where larger tolerances are acceptable regarding the different dimensions and where the dimensions should be chosen more accurately.",

In the second part of this series, we analyze, from a physical and psychoacoustical point of view, the sounds produced by hand clapping and finger snapping. One additional sound is studied: a loud sound made by clapping one finger against the vacuum space between fingers near the knuckles. The results of our experiments show that these sounds are fairly good for echolocation. The best one is the knuckle vacuum pulse, due to its extraordinary acoustical properties. This sound has many of the good characteristics of palatal clicks with an even richer content in the high frequency part of the spectrum. Besides, this sound exhibits an interesting symmetry in the ultrasound range, which palatal clicks do not have. Experimenters noticed that, in spite of their sound quality, hand and finger produced pulses were inferior to palatal clicks, mainly due to difficulties in the relative orientation between the head and the hands, without sight clues, lack of reproducibility and muscle fatigue during long sessions. Some people with basic echolocation skills, however, found these sounds useful for distant sources, because they were able to make such pulses louder than palatal clicks.",

To overcome this limitation, an alternative finite element formulation for poroelastic materials modelled with the Biot-Allard theory is first presented. This formulation is based on the solid and total displacement fields of the porous medium. Three resolution methods (one semi-analytical and two numerical) based on normal modes are proposed secondly. These methods take benefit from the decoupling properties of normal modes. The semi-analytical method is associated with problems in which the shear wave can be neglected. The numerical methods are a direct and an iterative scheme. The direct method allows a reduction by 2 of the number of degrees without making any approximation. The iterative method provides an approximation corresponding to a controlled tolerance. The finite element formulation is validated by comparison with an analytical model in two mono-dimensional configurations corresponding to a single and a multilayered problem. The efficiency of the two numerical resolution methods is also illustrated in term of computation time in comparison with classical formulations, such as the mixed displacement-pressure formulation.",

    "abstract": "Thanks to the rapidly increasing computational power of contemporary computer systems, acoustic finite element (FE) applications are nowadays widely used to predict the modal behaviour of airborne and structure-borne sound waves in enclosed cavities. In room acoustics it is by now mostly possible to simulate the whole frequency range below the Schroeder frequency using FEM in reasonable simulation times, thus making it a promising contender for extending the validity of typically ray-based room acoustic simulations to lower frequencies. However, while contemporary CAD and meshing tools facilitate the design of high quality geometric models with regular and sufficiently fine meshes, the Achilles' heel of room acoustic FEM simulations appears to be the realistic representation of the room boundaries. The present study investigates the influence of different boundary representations of porous absorbers on the simulated sound field in small rooms. Therefore measurements and FE simulations of the sound field in a scale model room with a well defined geometry and variable boundary conditions are conducted. Two different approaches are followed to model the porous absorbers on the room boundaries. Firstly the absorber layers are modelled with their exact 3D dimensions using an 'equivalent homogeneous fluid' (EHF) model. Secondly the acoustic characteristics of a porous absorber are modelled by an acoustic surface impedance for either normal or field/diffuse incidence, which is determined by measurement or model calculation. The paper clearly points out the limitations of the applied boundary models and also brings out the differences between these models. As a conclusion the paper shows that by using field incidence impedances instead of normal incidence impedances the quality of room acoustic FE simulation results can in some cases be increased considerably and comparable results to those obtained with a 3D absorber model can be achieved even for non-locally reacting materials.",

Because acoustic wavelength and boundary layer thicknesses have very different length scales, anisotropic and adaptive meshing is used to optimize the node distribution on the mesh. When combined, the Finite Element Method using degrees of freedom for particle velocity and temperature variation and anisotropic, adaptive meshing technique give the opportunity for accurate numerical solutions at reasonable computational cost. In order to show the potential of the method, this numerical procedure is applied to axisymmetrical and bidimensional models, illustrating the ability to compute, for complete devices, both propagation and diffusion processes.

A six-month field experiment at an industrial site near a residential area includes regular on-line annoyance reports, continuous 1/3-octave band noise level registrations, periodic sound recordings, data on electricity production per minute and meteorological observations. Here the risk of high annoyance does not only depend on the angular blade velocity, but also on the wind turbines' nacelle position relative to the location of the dwellings, i.e. the wind direction. This directivity effect can be captured when noise parameters such as the background noise level caused by other sources and a so-called fluctuation-indicator are introduced, the latter calculated from the 1/3-octave band spectra to quantify the periodic part of wind turbine noise. In addition, the calculated turbine's specific emission levels are closely related to the angular blade velocity, and an important parameter to predict the risk of high annoyance. Finally, these results suggest that operational restrictions based on wind direction together with the angular blade velocity might help to reduce noise annoyance while preserving cost-effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of deterministic Green's functions from cross-correlation of ambient noise is the physical basis for a number of passive remote sensing techniques. The data-accumulation time necessary for the Green's function emergence is of critical significance for the feasibility and implementation of the passive techniques. This paper re-examines calculation of the necessary data-accumulation times. Previously published estimates are extended to more general ambient noise fields and source-receiver geometries. The emergence time calculation is performed for arbitrary anisotropy of the noise field generated by random acoustic noise sources located on a surface or on a curve. The results apply to a general case of an inhomogeneous, moving or motionless medium with time-independent parameters. It is shown that in certain situations the emergence time estimates are influenced by the geometry (dimensionality) of the noise sources' layout, and not necessarily by the dimensionality of the propagation medium. A simpler technique using basic statistical principles is suggested for calculating the emergence time under rather general assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Stonehenge is the largest and most complex ancient stone circle known to mankind. In its original form, the concentric shape of stone rings would have surrounded an individual, both visually and aurally. It is an outdoor space and most archaeological evidence suggests it did not have a roof. However, its large, semi-enclosed structure, with many reflecting surfaces, would have reflected and diffracted sound within the space creating an unusual acoustic field for the Neolithic Man.\r\nThe work presented here reports the reconstruction of the acoustic sound field of Stonehenge based on measurements taken at a full size replica in Maryhill, USA. Acoustic measurements were carried out using state-of-the-art techniques and the response collected in both mono and B-Format at various source-receiver positions within the space. A brief overview of Energy Time Curves and Reverberation Time together with a comparison to a recent measurement in the current Stonehenge site is provided.\r\nThe auralisation process presented uses a hybrid Ambisonic and Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) system. In the electro-acoustic rendering system, sound sources are created as focussed sources using Wave Field Synthesis whilst their reverberant counterpart is rendered using Ambisonic principles. Using this novel approach, a realistic acoustic sound field, as it is believed to have existed in the original Stonehenge monument, can be experienced by listeners. The approach presented, not only provides a valuable insight into the acoustic response of an important archaeological site but also demonstrates the development of a useful tool in the archaeological interpretation of important buildings and heritage sites.",

To validate the model, measurements are carried out using an artificial blowing machine. The construction of the machine, including a sensor-equipped reed and mouthpiece as well as an automated artificial tongue and lip, is described in detail. By adjusting the motion of the tongue, the blowing machine can generate audio signals corresponding to portato and staccato articulation. These signals are resynthesised following an inverse modelling approach based on the presented physical model, during which model parameters are estimated. All estimated parameters lie in a physically feasible range and may be used for sound synthesis and sound analysis applications.",

    "abstract": "The impulse noise produced by personal weapons (guns, rifles, shotguns) during military activity, and while people engage in sport, training and hunting, is a threat to the auditory systems of soldiers, civilians, policemen, hunters, forest officers, sportspeople and bystanders not actively engaged in professional or recreational firing. An overview of noise levels generated by different types of weapon is provided, and potential short-term and long-term consequences for the human auditory system are described. The mean values of LC, peak sound pressure level during the shot, at the shooter's ears, for various types of weapons are approximately 160 dB SPL. These are levels that can cause permanent, irreversible negative effects on hearing (hearing loss, tinnitus, etc.) even as a result of a single shot being fired. One of the largest groups of weapon users in Poland (about 120 thousand) are hunters and field masters. They are not obligated by any regulations to protect their auditory systems from impulse noise. This means that this group of firearm users is at particularly high risk of hearing damage. On the basis of the literature review, it is shown that hearing exposure to high-level impulse noise such as a gunshot can result in such consequences as damage to the middle ear and destruction of the outer/inner hair cells in the cochlea. Especially difficult to diagnose is 'hidden hearing loss', i.e. damage to the synaptic connections between the hair cells of the inner ear and the auditory nerve fibres, which is not reflected in the results of basic audiometric testing and can cause hearing problems many years after impulse noise exposure. The wide range of negative consequences of gunfire noise clearly indicates the need for the hearing of the shooters to be protected.",

    "abstract": "A set of 55 clarinet reeds is observed by holography, collecting 2 series of measurements made under 2 different moisture contents, from which the resonance frequencies of the 15 first modes are deduced. A statistical analysis of the results reveals good correlations, but also significant differences between both series. Within a given series, flexural modes are not strongly correlated. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) shows that the measurements of each series can be described with 3 factors capturing more than $90\\%$ of the variance: the first is linked with transverse modes, the second with flexural modes of high order and the third with the first flexural mode. A forth factor is necessary to take into account the individual sensitivity to moisture content. Numerical 3D simulations are conducted by Finite Element Method, based on a given reed shape and an orthotropic model. A sensitivity analysis revels that, besides the density, the theoretical frequencies depend mainly on 2 parameters: $E_L$ and $G_{LT}$. An approximate analytical formula is proposed to calculate the resonance frequencies as a function of these 2 parameters. The discrepancy between the observed frequencies and those calculated with the analytical formula suggests that the elastic moduli of the measured reeds are frequency dependent. A viscoelastic model is then developed, whose parameters are computed as a linear combination from 4 orthogonal components, using a standard least squares fitting procedure and leading to an objective characterization of the material properties of the cane \\textit{Arundo donax}.",

The reed impact is modeled by a nonlinear stiffness and damping activated by contact with the lay. The impact model is compared with the \"ghost reed\" simplification, where the reed moves through the lay unimpeded. Bifurcation diagrams in both cases are compared, in terms of amplitude of the oscillations and location of the bifurcations, on the solution branches corresponding to the first and second register. The ghost reed simplification has limited influence at low values of the blowing pressure parameter: the diagrams are similar. This is true even for \"beating reed\" regimes, in which the reed coincides with the lay. The most noticeable discrepancies occur near the extinction of the oscillations, at high blowing pressure.",

It is demonstrated using simplified theoretical models that this feature arises from a combination of an in-plane resonance of the bridge and an averaged version of the response of the violin body at the bridgefoot positions. Using a technique from statistical vibration analysis, it is possible to extract the “skeleton” of the bridge hill in a very clear form. Parameter studies are the np resented which reveal how the bridge hill is affected, in some cases with great sensitivity, by the properties of the bridge and body. The results seem to account for behaviour seen in earlier experimental studies, and they have direct relevance to violin makers for guiding the adjustment of bridges to achieve desired tonal quality.

    "abstract": "We report three experiments designed to investigate interference effects in an auditory analog of Eriksen's visual flanker interference task (e.g. [1, 2]). In Experiment 1, participants made speeded auditory 'bat' versus 'bed' discrimination responses to a series of target words presented from a central loudspeaker while simultaneously trying to ignore auditory flanker words ('bat' or 'bed') presented from two loudspeakers positioned 30 degrees to either side of fixation. Participants responded more slowly on trials where the flankers were incongruent with the target than when they were congruent. Experiment 2 revealed that the magnitude of this auditory congruency effect was relatively unaffected by increasing the azimuthal separation between the target and flanker stimuli from 30 to 90 degrees. In Experiment 3, the flanker words were always different from the target word, no matter whether they were congruent or incongruent with the target response. Despite the fact that any energetic masking effects from congruent and incongruent flankers should have been normalized under such conditions, a congruency effect was still reported, supporting an informational masking account of the flanker effect. Our results therefore provide the first empirical demonstration of an auditory analog of Eriksen's visual flanker interference effect.",

The predictions are compared with reference data from the literature, and with new experimental results. In most cases the models agree very well, but in some cases the predictions deviate significantly from each other. There are many similarities between the approximations used in the two models, but some parts of the modelling methods are clearly different.

    "abstract": "Reverberation time is an important objective parameter for the acoustics of enclosed spaces. Blind estimation of the reverberation time from naturally occurring sound sources alleviates the logistical constraints of traditional measurement methods, and hence enables non-invasive, in-situ measurements in occupied spaces. A maximum likelihood method using a simple exponential decay model was recently developed. It demonstrated the potential of this approach, but the decay model hinders its accuracy and usefulness in the presence of more complex decays. This paper proposes a new maximum likelihood approach that allows for the multiple decay rates found in real spaces to be more correctly modelled, and thus improves the accuracy of the estimations. Envelopes of received sound signals are segmented and suitable decay phases automatically selected. A maximum likelihood estimation is performed using a multi-decay model whose function adapts to yield the most likely reverberation parameters and decay curve estimates. Simulation, validation and real room tests confirm the improved accuracy; the estimation errors are typically below perceptual difference limens. Thus a new method for blind estimation of reverberation parameters from naturally occurring sound sources, including speech and orchestra music, is achieved.",

This paper reports the results of a study that set out to validate and further develop a ‘Tranquillity Rating Predication Tool’, previously proposed by the authors [Pheasant et al. JASA 123(3), 1446‐1457 (2008)], which utilises the percentage of natural features contained within a scene and either of the noise indices LAmax or LAeq, as the key components. The results of the validation study show that when responding to combined audio-visual stimuli the A-weighted sound pressure level LAeq is most significantly related to the Tranquillity Rating. It is suggested that a modified measure of the visual composition of a scene incorporating contextual aspects is required. The findings of this work should be of particular interest to those charged with landscape management, such as the National Park Authorities, Regional Councils, and other agencies concerned with providing and maintaining public amenity.",

This paper proposes to investigate the temporal distribution of arrivals and the estimation of mixing time.

This paper describes functional count-comparison models of two brainstem nuclei, medial superior olive (MSO) and lateral superior olive (LSO), both of which exist in both hemispheres. The topology of the organs and the connections between them as presented in the current neuroanatomical studies are imitated in the functional model. The parameters of the functional models are selected to fit existing neurophysiological and psychoacoustical data. It is shown that the proposed MSO and LSO models are sensitive to interaural differences in time and level in a way that accounts for some known psychoacoustical phenomena.",

Even though this methodology always overestimates the effects caused by noise, this estimation is accurate enough for detached or semidetached houses in urban areas. However, for large and tall buildings in urban configuration, this estimation could be confusing and even very vague. In fact, differences regarding the percentage of people affected by noise taken from an exact calculation and from European Directive criterion could be unacceptable. When facade noise map calculation is not possible, either due to being too time consuming or unavailability of software resources, estimating people affected by noise based on the nearest grid point approximation criterion is clearly preferable to the European Directive approach.",

    "abstract": "Noise from wind turbines is of concern in the planning process of new wind farms, and accurate estimations of immission noise levels at residents nearby are required. Sound propagation from wind turbine to receiver could be modelled by a simplified standard model assuming constant meteorological conditions, by an engineering method taking atmospheric and ground propagation conditions into account, or by a more exact model. Epidemiological studies have found a higher frequency of annoyance due to wind turbine noise than to other community noise sources at equal noise levels, indicating that the often used simplified model is not sufficient. This paper evaluates the variation of immission sound levels under the influence of meteorological variation and explores if the prediction of levels could be improved by taking the effect of wind speed on sound propagation into account. Long-term sound recordings and measurements at a distance of 530 m from a wind turbine show that the simplified standard model predicts the average sound pressure levels satisfactorily under downwind conditions, and that a more complex propagation model might not be needed for wind turbine noise at a relatively short distance. Large variations of sound immission levels at the same wind speed were however present. Statistical analysis revealed that these variations were influenced by meteorological parameters, such as temperature, static pressure and deviation from ideal downwind direction. The overall results indicate that meteorological factors influence the noise generated by the wind turbine rather than the sound propagation.",

    "abstract": "Absorption coefficients measured in reverberation chambers, Sabine absorption coefficients, suffer from two major problems. Firstly, they sometimes exceed unity. Secondly, the reproducibility of the Sabine absorption coefficients is quite poor, meaning that the Sabine absorption coefficients vary largely depending on the test room. Several conversion methods for porous absorbers from the Sabine absorption coefficient to the random incidence absorption coefficient were suggested by considering the finite size of a test specimen and non-uniformly incident energy onto the specimen, which turned out to be successful in terms of the trueness. However, the reproducibility of the converted random incidence absorption coefficients has not been investigated. The present study mainly focuses on the reproducibility of the random incidence absorption coefficients that are converted from the Sabine absorption coefficients measured in 13 different chambers in a recent round-robin test, revealing that the reproducibility of the converted random incidence absorption coefficient is improved significantly compared to that of the Sabine absorption coefficient. Between the two optimization methods used, the flow resistivity optimization outperforms the surface impedance optimization in terms of the reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "In the development process of modern telecommunication systems, such as mobile phones, it is common practice to use computer models to objectively evaluate the transmission quality of the system, instead of time-consuming perceptual listening tests. Such models have typically focused on the quality of the transmitted speech, while little or no attention has been provided to speech intelligibility. The present study investigated to what extent three state-of-the art speech intelligibility models could predict the intelligibility of noisy speech transmitted through mobile phones. Sentences from the Danish Dantale II speech material were mixed with three different kinds of background noise, transmitted through three different mobile phones, and recorded at the receiver via a local network simulator. The speech intelligibility of the transmitted sentences was assessed by six normal-hearing listeners and model predictions were compared to the perceptual data. Statistically significant differences between the intelligibility of the three phones were found in stationary speech-shaped noise. A good correspondence between the measured data and the predictions from one of the three models was found in all the considered conditions. Overall, the results suggest that speech intelligibility models inspired by auditory signal processing can be useful for the objective evaluation of speech transmission through mobile phones",

The system description employs a spatial transform technique, making use of the periodicity of the floor structure with the aid of Poisson's sum rule. The radiated power is calculated using numerical integration in the wave-number domain, the radiated power enabling the impact sound level to be calculated. Comparisons are made between measurements found in the literature and the proposed prediction model, the effects of different excitation models being discussed. A relatively close agreement is achieved, especially if an elaborate excitation model is employed. (Less)",

    "abstract": "Tibetan bowls have been traditionally used for ceremonial and meditation purposes, but are also increasingly being used in contemporary music-making. They are handcrafted using alloys of several metals and produce different tones, depending on the alloy composition, their shape, size and weight. Most important is the sound-producing technique used - either impacting or rubbing, or both simultaneously - as well as the excitation location, the hardness and friction characteristics of the exciting stick (called puja). Recently, researchers became interested in the physical modelling of singing bowls, using waveguide synthesis techniques for performing numerical simulations. Their efforts aimed particularly at achieving real-time synthesis and, as a consequence, several aspects of the physics of these instruments do not appear to be clarified in the published numerical formulations and results. In the present paper, we extend to axi-symmetrical shells - subjected to impact and friction-induced excitations - our modal techniques of physical modelling, which were already used in previous papers concerning plucked and bowed strings as well as impacted and bowed bars. We start by an experimental modal identification of three different Tibetan bowls, and then develop a modelling approach for these systems. Extensive nonlinear numerical simulations were performed, for both impacted and rubbed bowls, which in particular highlight important aspects concerning the spatial patterns of the friction-induced bowl vibrations. Our results are in good agreement with preliminary qualitative experiments.",

    "abstract": "An exact treatment based on the two-dimensional elasticity theory, is employed to investigate sound transmission through an arbitrarily thick isotropic functionally graded infinite plate subjected to an oblique plane acoustic incident wave. The mechanical properties of the graded plate are assumed to vary smoothly and continuously with the change of volume concentrations of the constituting materials across the thickness of the plate according to a power law distribution. The original inhomogeneous structure is approximated by a laminate model, for which the solution is expected to gradually approach the exact one as the number of layers increases. The T-matrix solution technique, which involves a system global transfer matrix formed as the product of the individual transfer matrices by applying continuity of the displacement and stress components at the interfaces of neighboring layers along with the pertinent boundary conditions at the upper and lower interfaces of the plate with the surrounding acoustic fluid (air) are employed to solve for the unknown plane wave reflection and transmission coefficients. The analytical results are illustrated with numerical examples in which three frequently used metal-ceramic FGM panels with distinct compositional gradient profiles are subjected to plane incident waves at selected angles of incidence. Furthermore, a Gaussian weighting function for describing the directional distribution of incident energy is adopted for predicting the sound transmission loss along with the weighted sound reduction index, R w (as specified in ISO 717-1), of the FGM panels subjected to a perfectly diffuse sound field. Primary attention is focused on the effects of material compositional gradient profiles on the sound insulation characteristics of the panels. Limiting cases are considered and good agreements with the solutions available in the literature are obtained.",

Such machines nearly always are installed in contact with heavyweight homogeneous structural floors and walls, or floating floor systems, or stiffened cavity constructions. Manufacturers require a laboratory-based measurement procedure, which will yield single values of source strength in a form transferable to a prediction of the sound power generated in the installed condition, and thence the sound pressure in rooms removed from the source. A novel reception plate method is proposed which yields the source activity in the form of the sum of the squared free velocities, over the contact points. In addition, the source mobility is obtained separately as the average of the magnitude of the effective mobility, over the contact points. Both quantities can be used to estimate the installed power for the range of receiver mobilities likely to be encountered in buildings. It is demonstrated that the installed power can be estimated by reference to a high source mobility condition, a low source mobility condition, or to a matched mobility condition.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the modeling of sound fields in fitted rooms - i.e. rooms containing many obstacles which scatter sound. A novel approach is proposed to predict the sound-level distribution, as well as the sound decay, in such rooms. The model is derived by coupling two approaches based on a diffusion analogy. The first was initially derived for modeling the scattering of sound by obstacles in a room with specularly-reflecting surfaces. The second was proposed for modeling the reverberant field in empty rooms with diffuse surface reflections. The approach is first applied to a cubic room and to a flat enclosure, and compared to a ray-tracing model (the Rayscat model), with very good agreement. A comparison with experimental data obtained in a real fitted room is also presented, and gives very good agreement, both with the diffusion model and with the Rayscat model. In order to include mixed specular-diffuse reflections in the diffusion model, an empirical approach is also presented. The main advantage of such a technique is that it gives accurate predictions with much lower calculation times than Monte-Carlo-based numerical techniques such as ray-tracing.",

However, the notation of soundscape, in other words, the way how we can record, describe or express the soundscape, still need to be studied furthermore. Soundscape is the concept of an environment of sound (sonic environment) with emphasis on the way how it is perceived and understood by individual, or by a society, and thus it depends on the relationship between individual and any such environment. Therefore, the notation of soundscape should put emphasis on not only the physical characteristics but also the perception of the people, as well as the relationship between them. In this paper, firstly the notation of soundscape was reviewed with the concept of soundscapegraphy, which was composed of objective information, subjective information, environmental information and analysis information. Then, the methodology of making soundscapegraphy was discussed from the stage of data collection, data processing, mapping to analysis, and in the data processing GIS technique was applied. Next, with the case study of Saga urban areas, the analysis of urban soundscape was performed by means of soundscapegraphy. Finally, the applications of soundscapegraphy and the prospect for future research were discussed. Soundscapegraphy can be a proper and applicable method for the notation and analysis of soundscape.",

    "abstract": "In room acoustics as well as in noise immission prognosis, ray tracing methods are efficient and widely used. Nevertheless, as is well recognised, these energetic methods assuming incoherent superposition fail when diffraction becomes important. The aim is to solve this main deficiency, but the energetic model shall be retained. However, since random emitted particles never pass edges exactly, analytical edge diffraction approaches may not be applied. These and other general problems of combining diffractions with the numerical methods of geometrical room acoustics are discussed in the first part of the paper. To introduce diffraction but preserve the algorithmic advantage of ray tracing, the author had proposed a sound particle diffraction model based on Heisenbergs uncertainty relation (UR) introducing the concept of a 'diffraction angle probability' and an 'edge diffraction strength' (the closer the by-pass-distance the stronger the diffraction effect'). This model, already presented in 1986, demonstrated very good agreements with the expected transfer functions of the basic reference cases of a half-infinite screen and a slit in far field. It has now for the first time been embedded in a full ray tracing program enabling also finite source and receiver distances. The results have also been compared with the exact wave-theoretical results of Svenssont's secondary edge source model. For most cases of the screen and the slit the agreements are very good (less than 1 dB). Also - not self evident - the reciprocity principle seems fulfilled. Exploiting the UR seems to be a useful approach not only for light - as has been published in the field of optical ray tracing - but also for sound. However, whether the method works also with higher order diffraction and with other structures has not yet been investigated for sound. A very difficult practical problem remains the explosion of computing time which may be solved by the re-unification -algorithm provided by Quantized Pyramidal Beam Tracing.",

    "abstract": "The constrained-layer damping treatment is widely used to control the resonant response of vibrating structures, particularly in the automotive and aerospace industries. This technique requires design tools in order to select the best location, type and thickness of the damping and constraining-layer materials for optimum damping while minimizing the total weight of the damping treatments. In this study, a numerical tool is presented to analyze the vibration response of plates partially or fully covered with a constrained viscoelastic damping material. This tool is based on a finite element approach. The undamped plate structure is modeled using a discrete Kirchhoff theory (DKT) element. However, a sandwich plate element is specially derived to model the damped plate structure. This element is formulated in such a way that it is compatible with the DKT element. The natural frequencies and modal loss factors are derived from the modal strain energy method. The proposed approach is validated by comparing predictions with the results of various examples published in the literature. Hence, this approach is shown to predict accurately the damping characteristics of arbitrarily shaped sandwich plates, with different material properties and boundary conditions, fully or partially covered with constrained viscoelastic layers. The influence of the damping patch locations and the viscoelastic material's shear modulus on the vibration and damping characteristics is investigated. To damp the plate effectively using partial coverage, the damping patches must be distributed appropriately. To select the best damping patch locations, an indicator based on the energy dissipated through the viscoelastic layer is proposed.",

Several acoustic parameters such as acoustic impedance, isothermal compressibility, molar sound velocity, molar adiabatic compressibility, internal pressure, free volume, van der Waals constants, molar cohesive energy and relaxation time have been explored. Thermo-dynamical parameters viz.: available volume, intermolecular free length, relative association, surface tension, pseudo-Gruneisen parameter, Debye temperature, diff usion constant, coefficient of thermal conductivity and latent heat of melting have been evaluated. Several thermo- elastic parameters such as Young modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus and Poisson's ratio are also determined. Excess parameters are computed to study the relative molecular interactions and strength of interaction between the constituents of the polymer mixture. The volume expansivity data is used to evaluate Moelwyn-Hughes parameter, reduced volume, reduced isothermal bulk modulus, Sharma's constants, Huggins parameter, isobaric, isochoric, and isothermal lattice Gruneisen parameters, fractional free volume, repulsive exponent, Bayer's non-linear parameter, cohesive energy density and characteristic temperature. Schaaff 's collision factor theory, Jacobson's free length theory, Nomoto's relation, Van Dael-Vangeel relation, impedance dependence relation, Junjie relation and ideal mixing relation have been used to evaluate ultrasonic velocities in the system under study. The obtained results have been compared with earlier experimental results. The non-ideal behaviour of the mixture has been explained in terms of its composition and variation of its acoustical and thermo-dynamical parameters.",

Geometrical model was also employed and its results were compared with those of neural networks. The main acoustic features and reverberation times were determined in the studied workrooms. Different structures of networks were developed and finally, the networks with one hidden layer along with five neurons were found to be the best model for predicting reverberation time (RMSE = 0.17(s) and R2 = 0.77). The relative errors of the networks and the geometrical models for a new case of workroom were 6 and 4.7, respectively. Although networks are empirical in nature, the results confirmed the potential of this approach for minimizing the uncertainties in acoustics' modeling. The developed model gives professionals the opportunity to have an optimum decision about the effectiveness of acoustic treatment scenarios in embroidery workrooms. © S. Hirzel Verlag • EAA.",

The aim of this paper, limited to materials with rigid skeleton considered as equivalent fluids, is to compare the descriptions by Johnson-Allard ($JA$%) as well as by Pride-Lafarge ($PL$) with i) some analytical, approximate formulas, based upon asymptotic high frequency expansion ; ii) the exact formula by Zwikker and Kosten for the case of cylindrical pores. The paper starts with a short summary of the statement of the different general full frequency models ($JA$ and $PL).$ The Green function in the time domain is shown to exhibit interesting properties of materials. In particular the maximum response depends on one dimensionless parameter only, which is denoted $\\xi $ and is the ratio of the travelled distance to the product of the \\textquotedblleft frozen\\textquotedblright\\ sound speed and a characteristic viscous relaxation time. The distance $\\xi $ is related to a time domain Stokes number. The numerical computation of the Green function is done by FFT, with some precautions, because of the importance of the higher frequencies on the response shape. The $PL$ description is shown to be the best full frequency general model, but some discrepancies with the exact model appear at short times or short distances. When the distance $\\xi $ increases from zero, the asymptotic expansion shows that the maximum of the Green function decreases first as $1/\\xi ^{2}$, then exponentially.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a concept of sensorless electroacoustic absorber for damping the low-frequency modes in a cavity such as a duct or a room. Taking advantage of the reciprocity of the voice coil transducer, it is shown that a synthetic electrical admittance can be designed so that the loudspeaker diaphragm is matched to a target specific acoustic impedance. This electroacoustic device provides a relatively broadband sound absorption that can be used to dampen room modes regardless of the sound field in which the loudspeaker is located. A digital filter is used to replicate the frequency response of the synthetic load, and a voltage-controlled current source is needed so that the filter is seen as an electrical admittance. Unlike previous attempts to implement the synthetic load using an electrical network, greater flexibility and accuracy can be obtained. Experimental results confirmed the validity of this sensorless electroacoustic absorber (SEA) in a 1D sound field, showing that the dynamic range of the sound pressure level in a duct can be reduced by 15 dB from 50 Hz to 300 Hz compared to a hard surface panel. A discussion on the strengths and limitations of this concept is provided, in particular with a view to employing SEAs for modal equalization in actual listening rooms.",

Measurements at a location with and without a row of trees behind a noise barrier were compared. This continuously monitoring lasted from the middle of the summer till the middle of fall. It is shown that for downwind sound propagation for an orthogonal incident wind, the efficiency of the noise barrier with trees becomes increasingly better compared to the noise barrier without trees, with increasing wind speed. The improvement by the trees is only slightly affected if the wind direction is not perfectly orthogonal to the barrier. Upwind sound propagation is affected only to a small degree by placing trees. Diffraction on the canopy of trees does not result in an increased total A-weighted sound pressure level due to the typical low-frequency spectrum of traffic noise. The contribution of wind-induced vegetation noise to the recorded noise levels can be neglected for highways with common dense traffic.",

    "abstract": "Summary The potential of probabilistic choice models (the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, or preference trees) in scaling the perceived unpleasantness of sounds was evaluated. To that effect, 74 subjects made pair-wise comparisons of the unpleasantness of twelve binaurally-recorded, environmental sounds presented over headphones. The stimuli varied in their psychoacoustic characteristics and half of them were of technical, half of natural origin. A more sophisticated model than previously tested, namely a preference tree, was identified to account well for the structure underlying the data, indicating (1) that subjects changed criteria, when evaluating different sound pairs, and that (2) these criterion changes combined in a lawful way, so that it was possible to measure unpleasantness on a ratio-scale level across the entire set of sounds investigated. Contrary to expectation, sound origin (technical or natural) did not influence the unpleasantness judgments. Instead, the sounds could be grouped according to their (non-acoustical) intrusiveness, and loudness. A subsequent multiple-regression analysis showed that in the sub-groups of soft and loud sounds, a combination of sharpness ( )a nd roughness ( ), the latter differing in magnitude for the two groups, explained the unpleasantness-scale values very well ( ). Direct magnitude estimates of unknown scale type, collected from the same listeners covered a much smaller range of ratios, and were roughly linear with the logarithm of the ratio scale derived from the preference tree. Th ea dvantage of the choice-theory modeling in providing information on the structure underlying the judgments is discussed.",

Though it is simple enough to write down a nonlinear equation for the motion of such a string, the construction of numerical methods, such as finite difference schemes, becomes a much more delicate problem, in particular because of the number of possible discretization approaches, and the lack of spectral analysis tools which are often used to determine stability bounds in the linear case. For this reason, we turn towards more general techniques, which are based around energetic principles, sometimes known collectively as the energy method. Indeed, it is possible to transfer the complete energetic behavior of the nonlinear string to discrete time in such a way that a discrete analogue of the energy is preserved. This leads, in turn, to an energy-based stability guarantee. Such techniques rely in no way on spectral analysis. Various other issues, such as parasitic oscillations, boundary termination, loss modelling and implicit difference schemes are also discussed. Simulations are presented.",

One result of general importance is that measurements are indeed possible in real-scale reverberation rooms with turntables of 3 m diameter. There are only small differences between the real-scale and model-scale results. Some variations of the standard procedure were tested and the uncertainties identified: mounting of the sample, connection or sealing between sample and base plate, way of rotating the sample, air absorption and time variances.

The TDBC gives the pressure as the sum of two terms involving the particle velocity normal to the surface of the material: one term is directly proportional to the particle velocity at the present time, whereas the other involves a convolution of the particle velocity with a slowly decaying response function.

We use a 3D model to represent the geometry of the environment explicitly, and we subdivide it into a series of coupled spaces connected by portals. Off-line geometrical-acoustics techniques are used to precompute transport operators, which encode pressure decay characteristics within each space and between coupling interfaces. At run-time, during an interactive simulation, we traverse the adjacency graph corresponding to the spatial subdivision of the environment. We combine transport operators along different sound propagation routes to estimate the pressure decay envelopes from sources to the listener. Our approach compares well with off-line geometrical techniques, but computes reverberation decay envelopes at interactive rates, ranging from 12 to 100 Hz. We propose a scalable artificial reverberator that uses these decay envelopes to auralize reverberation effects, including room coupling.

We show that voiced solfege syllables whose fundamental frequencies and harmonic structures are digitally shifted to precisely map onto a mismatched musical note can selectively interfere with pitch identification by some but not other AP musicians. Interference diminishes as the stimulus spectrum is increasingly lowpass filtered to remove its broadband speech features. Time reversal of mismatched pitch-syllable hybrids, which distorts their phase spectra but leaves their amplitude spectra intact, also substantially reduces interference.

    "abstract": "Summary While the e ects of various socio-economic factors on sound evaluation have been investigated in numerous previous studies, the aim of this study is to study the relationships between environmental noise levels and socioeconomic factors, using Greater London as a case study city. The environmental noise levels are obtained from calculated noise maps, through a series of data processing, and 78 socio-economic factors from various GIS databases are considered at micro- and macro-scales, namely at neighbourhood and borough levels. It is shown that the noise levels of neighbourhoods and boroughs in London have close relationships with a number of socioeconomic factors. At the neighbourhood level, generally speaking, an area with a higher noise level tends to be among the more deprived in England, especially in terms of health, barriers to housing and services, and living environment. There are more people with bad health status, and less people looking after home or family. It is interesting to note that the neighbourhood noise levels are not significantly correlated with the percentages of various religious communities, total number of benefits claimants, and with resident population and male/female resident ratio. As expected, non-domestic building and roads are more likely to be found in noisier neighbourhoods. More students live in noisier neighbourhoods, whereas residents who work part-time may tend to live in quieter areas. At the borough level, with a higher noise level, more adults aged 20‐44, and less children and teenagers might tend to live there, and the income level is generally higher. Environmental noise levels have positive relationships with the population density and total population change, and negative correlations with the total fertility rate and death rate. The correlations between noise levels and academic attainments of school children are not significant. While the noise levels might be related to the labour market to a certain extent, for the employment and unemployment rates, no significant correlation has been shown with the borough noise levels.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the control of virtual instruments or sound-synthesis processes by natural gestures has become an important research field, both for building new audio-visual tools and for exploring gesture-sound relationships.Such multimodal and interactive tools typically present two advantages, on the one hand they provide realistic virtual instruments whose response can be compared to existing musical instruments, and on the other hand they give the possibility to vary characteristics of natural gestures, while ensuring a certain coherence between gesture and sound parameters.In this paper, we present and evaluate a new framework for explicitly expressing the characteristics of natural percussion gestures used for modeling, controlling and finally synthesizing new percussion gestures.A preliminary analysis of pre-recorded gestures leads to the identification of significant parameters, and their evaluation using a classification approach.This analysis shows that a reduced-dimension representation of captured motion can be used to control a virtual character.Furthermore, the simulated gestures provide dynamical variables that can be used to control sound synthesis through a mapping-interaction process.",

Several parameters have been studied, among which, the diffusion pattern, the relative surface on the facades, the arrangement and the size of diffusors. In addition, the combined effect of absorption and diffusion by diffusors has also been investigated. The numerical results show that a significant noise reduction can be observed on the sound attenuation as well as on the sound decay in a street, by considering diffusors creating uniform diffusion, with a relative surface larger than 20 %, and if possible locating on the lower part of the facades. Lastly, and as expected, by adding sound absorption on diffusors, it increases the noise reduction.",

    "abstract": "In order to select the most cost-effective noise control solution, the influence of the noise control measures on noise level should be reliably predicted. Reasonably accurate commercial ray-tracing, image source and finite element method modeling programs are available. However, the creation of a model and sometimes the calculations are time-consuming and their use in preliminary room acoustic design is not always cost-effective. These sophisticated room acoustic modeling programs demand special expertise which limits their use in practice. Several simple room acoustic models have been developed for noise control but information on their usability and prediction accuracy is rather hard to find. The purpose of this study was to examine simple room acoustic models developed for predicting noise levels and reverberation times in octave bands. Seven simple sound pressure level models, seven simple reverberation time models and a validated ray-tracing program (ODEON 3.1) were tested in four industrial workplaces, in which major noise control measures were implemented. The prediction results were compared to measurement results which were performed using an omni-directional sound source before and after the implementation of noise control measures. Accuracies of predicted sound pressure levels were determined as differences between measured and predicted sound pressure levels in octave bands of 125―4000 Hz. Accuracies of predicted reverberation times were similarly determined. The accuracy of the ray-tracing model was the most acceptable, as expected. The accuracy of simple sound pressure level models developed by Kuttruff, Osipov et al., and Thompson et al. was comparable to the accuracy of the ray-tracing models. The accuracy of the simple reverberation time model developed by Heerema and Hodgson was almost comparable to the accuracy of the ray-tracing model. The above-mentioned simple sound pressure level models provided sufficient accuracy for predicting average insertion loss, e.g. by using acoustic tiles or sound-absorbing materials. For more detailed or complex room acoustic design, sophisticated room acoustic modeling programs are recommended.",

An extensive set of numerical simulations using a cone-tracing software has first been carried out, in order to highlight the impact of the scattering coefficient on the diffusion process in rooms, in terms of sound pressure levels. An iterative method is then proposed to identify, for a given value of the wall's scattering coefficient, the diffusion constant that allows the stationary sound field to be governed by a diffusion process, regardless of the room's geometry. Using this method, an empirical law can be proposed between the diffusion constant and the scattering coefficient. The empirical diffusion model is then compared to scale model experiments, as well as to other models from the literature, with a satisfactory agreement for the sound pressure level. However, the empirical diffusion model fails to predict the sound decay for rooms with perfectly specularly reflecting surfaces, due to the inherent concept of a diffusion process.",

In practical realization, this method requires the use of regularization functions. This study analyzes the impact of two existing and a new proposed regularization function on the reproduced sound fields and on the main auditory cue for nearby sound sources outside the median plane, i.e, low-frequencies interaural level differences (ILDs). The proposed regularization function led to a better reproduction of point source sound fields compared to existing regularization functions for NFC-HOA. Measurements in realistic playback environments showed that, for very close sources, significant ILDs for frequencies above about 250 Hz can be reproduced with NFC-HOA and the proposed regularization function whereas the existing regularization functions failed to provide ILDs below 500 Hz. A listening test showed that these lower-frequency ILDs provided by the proposed regularization function lead to a significantly improved distance perception performance. This test also showed that the distance of virtual sources are perceived less accurately than corresponding physical sources when amplitude cues are not available. © S. Hirzel Verlag · EAA.",

There is a growing interest to measure stage acoustic parameters at various source to receiver distances. In this paper the influence of perceptual and architectural parameters, synchronicity, source to receiver relationship and the measurement system on stage acoustic parameters is discussed. Based on existing and new insights an optimization and extension of the ST parameters is proposed such that they can be measured at any distance between source and receiver using the most appropriate time interval limits.

    "abstract": "Acoustic travel-time tomography in the atmosphere is based on travel-time measurements of sound signals propagating along different known ray paths through a medium. Because the speed of sound mainly depends on temperature and flow properties, an inversion of these travel times allows an estimation of temperature and wind velocity fields. The main reconstruction techniques for solving such inverse problems are least-squares methods and stochastic inversion algorithms. In this study, five representatives belonging to these types of inverse approaches are evaluated by reconstructions of two-dimensional temperature distributions from synthetically generated and experimental data. The comparison of the reconstruction results reveals several differences between the algorithms concerning spatial resolution of the reconstructed image, accuracy, and computational efficiency. The stochastic approach provides accurate reconstructions of spatially highly resolved temperature fields when the turbulence characteristic is chosen carefully. Nevertheless, the choice of suitable turbulence parameters, the determination of measurement errors prior to an experiment as well as comparatively high memory requirements of this method are unfavorable for real-time analysis of measured data although possible. In contrast, fast and simple on-site interpretations of temperature fields with acceptable accuracy are feasible with least-squares methods.",

The purpose of the current study was to assess the effects of exposure to high-intensity ultrasound on a range of measures of hearing function, which included audiometric thresholds, as well as subclinical measures of hearing deficits: speech-in-noise understanding, supra-threshold auditory brainstem response wave I amplitude and latency, and frequency following response levels to amplitude modulated (AM) tones. Changes in these measures were assessed before and after exposure of the left ear to high-intensity ultrasound in a group of nine young listeners. These changes were compared to those observed in a control group of nine young listeners. Exposure consisted in the presentation of a 40-kHz AM tone at levels of 105, 110, 115, and 120 dB SPL for 10 minutes at each level, plus an exposure to a 40-kHz unmodulated tone during an ultrasound detection task, for a total duration of 50 seconds. None of the measures of hearing function was found to change significantly more for the left compared to the right ear, for participants of the exposure group compared to control participants. Electroencephalographic recordings obtained during exposure to the AM tone did not show significant phase-locked activity at the modulation frequency or at low-frequency subharmonics of the ultrasound tone. One out of nine participants was able to perform the ultrasound detection task above chance level, although due to limitations of the experimental setup the mechanism by which she could detect the presentation of the tone remains unclear.",

Example measurements of string vibration under controlled bowing conditions are shown, including a Schelleng diagram and a set of Guettler diagrams, for the open D string of a cello. For some results a rosin-coated rod was used in place of a conventional bow, to provide quantitative data for comparison with theoretical predictions. The results show qualitative consistency with the predictions of Schelleng and Guettler, but details are revealed that go beyond the limitations of existing models. © S. Hirzel Verlag · EAA.",

    "abstract": "The problem of scattering of harmonic plane acoustic waves by fluid spheroids (prolate and oblate) is addressed from an analytical approach. Mathematically, it consists in solving the Helmholtz equation in an unbounded domain with Sommerfeld radiation condition at infinity. The domain where propagation takes place is characterised by density and sound speed values $\\rho_0$ and $c_0$, respectively, while $\\rho_1$ and $c_1$ are the corresponding density and sound speed values of an immersed object that is responsible of the scattered field. Since Helmholtz equation is separable in prolate/oblate spheroidal coordinates, its exact solution for the scattered field can be expressed as an expansion on prolate/oblate spheroidal functions multiplied by coefficients whose values depend upon the boundary conditions verified at the medium-immersed fluid obstacle interface. The general case ($c_0 \\neq c_1$) is cumbersome because it requires to solve successive matrix systems that are ill-conditioned when $c_1/c_0$ is far from unity. In this paper, a numerical implementation of the general exact solution that is valid for any range of eccentricity values and for $c_0 \\neq c_1$, is provided. The high level solver code has been written in the Julia programming language while a software package recently released in the literature has been used to compute the spheroidal functions. Several limit cases (Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions, spheroid tending to sphere) have been satisfactorily verified using the implemented code. The corresponding example scripts can be downloaded from the authors' web (GitHub) site. Additionally, the new code has been used to extend results reported in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Results from two previous studies that involved free-playing evaluative tasks showed that players are self-consistent in their preference for violins and tend to agree of what particular qualities they look for in an instrument (in this case, ``richness'' and ``dynamic range''). However, a significant lack of agreement between violinists was observed, likely because different players evaluate the same perceptual attributes in different ways. The present study thus investigated whether there will be more inter-player agreement if musicians evaluate violin richness and dynamic range by playing only certain notes in certain registers. Results showed that the more focused the task, the more self-consistent violinists are and the more they agree with each other. We further examined the evaluation of richness from playing versus listening tasks and observed that players were better able to discriminate between violins in the former than in the latter. Finally, the potential correlation of spectral centroid and tristimulus with violin richness were examined. Results showed that the perception of richness is likely associated with the relative amount of low- and mid-frequency partials in a given sound (i.e., low spectral centroid and high tristimulus 1 and 2), though more exploration would be necessary before drawing any conclusions.",

While the loudness increase due to body conducted sounds requires an assessment by psychoacoustic methods, the ratio of sound pressure inside the ear canal with occluded versus open ear canal for the same internally generated signal can be measured physically. This paper aims at better understanding the occlusion effect from a physical viewpoint and at determining the influence of different physical factors on the own voice perception, introducing a simple and intuitively understandable model for this phenomenon. Based on this model, the dependency of the occlusion effect on (i) the geometries of the individual ear canal and the vent, (ii) the insertion depth of the occluding object and (iii) vocalization are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Sound propagation in complex non-uniform mean flows is an important feature of turbofan exhaust noise radiation.The Linearised Euler Equations are able to represent the strong shear layer refraction effects on the sound field, as well as multiple length scales.Frequency domain solvers are suitable for tonal noise and considered a way to avoid linear instabilities, which may occur with time domain solvers.However, the classical Finite Element Method suffers from dispersion error and high memory requirements.These shortcomings are particularly critical for high frequencies and for the Linearised Euler Equations, which involve up to five unknowns.In this paper, a high-order Finite Element Method is used to solve the Linearised Euler Equations in the frequency domain in order to overcome those issues.The model involves high-order polynomial shape functions, unstructured triangular meshes, numerical stabilisation and Perfectly Matched Layers.The acoustic radiation from a straight circular semi-infinite hard-wall duct with several mean flow configurations is computed.Comparisons with analytic solutions demonstrate the method accuracy.The acoustic and vorticity waves are well represented, as well as the refraction of the sound field across the jet shear layer.The high-order approach allows to use coarse meshes, while maintaining a sufficient accuracy.The benefits in terms of memory requirements are significant when compared to standard low-order Finite Element Method.",

Listening experiments designed to validate the quality of the reproduction method compared with a fixed directivity representation have showed that there is a clear improvement in the timbral quality of the reproduced sound. The improvement represented by the system regarding the spaciousness of sound did not prove to be significant. Further applications of the method are considered for ensembles within room auralizations as well as in the field of studio recording techniques for large instruments.

    "abstract": "In an ideal reverberant room, the energy of the impulse responses decays smoothly, at a constant rate of dB/s, so that gradually-decaying tails are added at the ends of sounds. Conversely, a single echo gives a flat energy-decay up to the echo's arrival time, which then drops abruptly, so that sounds with only echoes lack the decaying-tail feature of reverberation. The perceptual effects of these types of reflection pattern were measured with test-words from a continuum of steps between sir and stir, which were each embedded in a carrier phrase. When the proportion of reflected sound in test-words is increased, to a level above the amount in the carrier, the test words sound more like sir. However, when the proportion of reflected sound in the carrier is also increased, to match the amount in the test word, there can be a perceptual compensation where test words sound more like stir again. A reference condition used real-room reverberation from recordings at different source to receiver distances. In a synthetic-reverberation condition, the reflection pattern was from a colorless impulse response, comprising exponentially-decaying reflections that were spaced at intervals. In a synthetic-echo condition, the reflection pattern was obtained from the synthetic reverberation by removing the intervals between reflections before delaying the resulting cluster relative to the direct sound. Compensation occurred in the reference condition and in different types of synthetic reverberation, but not in synthetic-echo conditions. This result indicates that the presence of tails from reverberation informs the compensation mechanism.",

Generally speaking, vocal cues of disordered voices are numeric descriptors or measurements that are clinically relevant and that summarize properties of speech signals or other signals that are obtained non-invasively, and which report on a speaker's phonation in general and voice in particular. One known difficulty is the existence of a large variety of published experimental procedures and data. The diversity is indeed impressive with regard to the vocal pathologies or handicaps that have been studied, the vocal symptoms that have been described, the tasks speakers have been asked to carry out and the linguistic, paralinguistic and extralinguistic performances that have been examined, the sensors that have been used and the speech material that has been recorded, as well as the non-acoustic levels of description acoustic cues have been correlated with.

    "abstract": "The paper describes the determination of vertical profiles of the effective sound speed from meteorological measurements at only one height above ground. The vertical profiles are needed for the prediction of long-term sound levels under the consideration of atmospheric refraction. The study is based on the results of field campaigns which were performed during the European project HARMONOISE. In a first step different theoretical-empirical approaches were tested to derive vertical effective sound speed profiles from measured turbulent fluxes of momentum and heat. The results of the profile generation were compared with sound speed profiles derived from profile measurements at a meteorological tower. It was found that a two-parameter logarithmic-linear approach is sufficiently accurate to generate vertical sound speed profiles. In a second step profiles generated on the basis of local flux measurements were compared with those based on conventional data of a nearby routine weather station. If local measurements are not available the representativeness of nearby weather stations has to be carefully checked, above all in topographically structured terrain.",

    "abstract": "Planar Near-field Acoustic Holography (PNAH) is an acoustic imaging method based on the inverse solution of the wave equation. Wavenumber domain low-pass filtering is an essential operation in the PNAH process. An increasingly higher wavenumber filter cut-off results in a blow-up of the inverse solution, which is a characteristic of an ill-posed problem. On the other hand, lower cut-off wavenumbers result in spatial acoustic data at very low resolution, where highly detailed information is discarded. Thus, an optimal solution for the cut-off wavenumber somewhere in between is needed. This paper introduces two modified filter functions, namely a modified exponential and a modified Tikhonov filter, that are specifically designed for application in PNAH and compares them with a number of more general applied filter functions. Regularization methods are introduced that exploit the k-space to obtain near-optimal low-pass filter parameter selection at high computational efficiency. These filter functions are discussed and their parameters are selected by k-space application of L-curve, Generalised Cross-Validation and the newly introduced and well-applicable Cut-Off and Slope iteration. Simulations of various sources show that the optimal regularization method is highly dependent on the type of source, the spatial distribution and measurement noise. Finally, a robust regularization strategy is proposed which automatically produces high quality results for a wide range of practical conditions.",

These acoustical methods have been coupled with a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of the turbulent flow, which simulates the flow and combustion processes in a source region in the vicinity of the flame. Among the hybrid methods which are being used to predict the sound produced by turbulent flow, the ESM and BEM have the advantage that only one acoustic variable must be known at a surface surrounding the source zone (fewer data has to be processed) and that the far field can be directly computed. The sound power generated from two open diffusion flames have been calculated with both the ESM and the BEM, using the velocity distribution over cylindrical control surfaces, which enclose the source region. The results of the calculations are presented and compared with the measured sound power of the same flames. For one configuration good agreement between measurement and simulation at low and middle frequencies is obtained. Possible reasons for the differences for the other configuration will be discussed.",

Data produced by an experienced and a novice flautist are collected, analyzed and compared. Subjects are studied under normal musical playing conditions, playing phrases made out of simple musical intervals with subjective dynamics. Images of performer's lips are taken together with measurements of the blowing pressure and the sound radiated by the instrument. Data analysis shows remarkable differences between the two subjects. The optimized coordination of several parameters in order to obtain a desired musical response, coupling between performer's mouth and the instrument, as well as the efficient use of the available resources are some of the differences observed.",

This article will analyze different auditory distance perception cues of moving sound sources. In psychoacoustic experiments, the subjects were presented with dichotic and diotic stimuli of a set of real-life recordings taken from a passing passenger car and then asked to determine the velocity of the object and its minimal distance from the listener. The results of the listening experiments allow us to separate monaural distance perception cues from binaural ones, and thus show that binaural cues contribute significantly to the perception of velocity. For short distances and high velocities, the presentation of binaural cues causes a decrease in the perceived velocity while for long distances and low velocities this causes a clear increase. By estimating the minimal distance from the passing object, one observes a significant difference between dichotic and diotic presentation, which can be explained by an increased loudness of dichotic stimuli due to the binaural masking level difference (BMLD). Furthermore, it is shown that the main parameter for distance determination is the maximum sound pressure level at the listener's position. However, dynamic cues (change of sound pressure level over time, Doppler shift) are of considerable importance for the plausibility of the auditory scene.",

To reconcile the model with the loudness data, three different mechanisms accentuating temporal onsets of sounds were tested: (i) adaptive compression, (ii) adaptive auditory filters and (iii) bandwidth-dependent integration. A comparison between simulations and experimental data indicated that, in principle, all mechanisms lead to increased spectral loudness summation for short noise bursts, but bandwidth-dependent integration may be the most realistic approach. Such a modified model also predicts the spectral loudness summation of repeated noise bursts as a function of repetition rate.",

Considering that inner hair cell transduction equals half-wave rectification, activity of low-frequency auditory nerve fibres may be indistinguishable whether elicited by LF sound that is amplitude-modulated at an infrasonic rate, or LF sound that is superimposed onto infrasound that biases the basilar membrane position. We tested whether listeners are able to distinguish a 63-Hz carrier tone, amplitude modulated at 8 Hz, from a 63-Hz pure tone that was perceptually loudness-modulated by an 8-Hz biasing tone. Using a maximum-likelihood procedure, 12 participants first adjusted the intensity of the 8-Hz tone so that the perceived modulation of the pure tone matched a reference amplitude-modulated tone. Both stimuli types were then presented in random order, and participants had to identify presentations which contained the infrasound tone. About half the participants performed close to chance. The best had 81% correct. Experiments with a 125-Hz carrier tone gave similar results. Although performance may improve in a 2-interval discrimination task, this would not be representative of real listening conditions. Results suggest that slowly amplitude-modulated LF sounds may underlie complaints about environmental infrasound, where measured infrasound levels are well below sensation threshold.",

    "abstract": "A characteristic of woodwind instruments is the cutoff frequency of their tone-hole lattice.Benade proposed a practical definition using the measurement of the input impedance, for which at least two frequency bands appear.The first one is a stop band, while the second one is a pass band.The value of this frequency, which is a global quantity, depends on the whole geometry of the instrument, but is rather independent of the fingering.This seems to justify the consideration of a woodwind with several open holes as a periodic lattice.However the holes on a clarinet are very irregular.The paper investigates the question of the acoustical regularity: an acoustically regular lattice of tone holes is defined as a lattice built with T-shaped cells of equal eigenfrequencies.Then the paper discusses the possibility of division of a real lattice into cells of equal eigenfrequencies.It is shown that it is not straightforward but possible, explaining the apparent paradox of Benade's theory.When considering the open holes from the input of the instrument to its output, the spacings between holes are enlarged together with their radii: this explains the relative constancy of the eigenfrequencies.",

    "abstract": "Two planar ultrasound projectors having identical rectangular apertures were placed side by side. Both projectors radiated bifrequency primary waves in air. The frequencies were 26 and 28 kHz, and the initial phases were different. Two driving modes were considered, namely, conventional in-phase driving and phase-inversion driving. The spatial profiles of sound pressure fields were measured along and across the sound beam axis for the primary waves and for the difference frequency wave of 2 kHz. The second and third harmonic components of the difference frequency waves were also measured. The pressure levels of the primary waves were considerably suppressed near the beam axis owing to phase cancellation when the driving signals were phase-inversed, i.e., 180 degrees out of phase. The beam pattern of the difference frequency was, however, almost the same as that for the case in which the signals were in phase. Interestingly, the harmonic pressure amplitudes of the difference frequency were reduced by more than 10 dB. The validity of the experimental results were confirmed based on their good agreement with the theoretical predictions based on the Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov equation.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing and rating the impact sound isolation of floors and of building structures are important issues in building acoustics.In all standardized test procedures a floor specimen is excited structurally with a standardized impact source and the sound pressure level due to the impact is measured in an adjacent room.Existing standards define several impact sources that should simulate the excitation due to persons walking or jumping on the floor and hence exert only normal forces to the structure.However, the excitation spectrum of the most commonly used lightweight tapping machine according to ISO 140-7 differs significantly from the heavy impact sources according to JIS A 1418-2 (the \"rubber ball\" and the \"bang machine\" that are dropped from a defined height to the floor).In order to accurately predict the impact sound isolation of floor assemblies, the excitation mechanism due to impacts from these heavy sources has to be understood and implemented in prediction models.This paper presents a simple analytical model for the \"rubber ball\" heavy impact source and the suitability of the model is gauged by comparing the predicted blocked force with experiment.",

    "abstract": "The influence of initial aperture and mechanical properties on the onset pressure thresholds and oscillation frequencies is experimentally assessed on a deformable vocal fold replica in case of strong and weak acoustical coupling. The mechanical replica enables to vary the initial aperture while mechanical properties are maintained and therefore to mimic abduction and adduction gestures of human phonation. Depending on initial conditions (geometrical, mechanical and acoustical) one or two oscillation regions are experimentally found for which important differences are observed for both oscillation onset pressure thresholds and oscillation frequencies. Measured onset pressure thresholds are used to validate the outcome of a theoretical model of phonation using a reduced mechanical model. The applied coupling stiffness in the theoretical model is estimated from the measured frequency response instead of imposed by an 'ad-hoc' criterion. The variations in coupling stiffness result in a qualitative agreement between predicted and measured values for all assessed experimental conditions. In addition, the Young's modulus of the replica is qualitatively estimated to be within the range observed 'in-vivo'.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of independent and dependent losses and coding on speech quality predictions provided by PESQ (also known as ITU-T P.862) and P.563 models, when both naturally-produced and synthesized speech are used. Two synthesized speech samples generated with two different Text-to-Speech systems and one naturally-produced sample are investigated. In addition, we assess the variability of PESQ's and P.563's predictions with respect to the type of speech used (naturally-produced or synthesized) and loss conditions as well as their accuracy, by comparing the predictions with subjective assessments. The results show that there is no difference between the impact of packet loss on naturally-produced speech and synthesized speech. On the other hand, the impact of coding is different for the two types of stimuli. In addition, synthesized speech seems to be insensitive to degradations provided by most of the codecs investigated here. The reasons for those findings are particularly discussed. Finally, it is concluded that both models are capable of predicting the quality of transmitted synthesized speech under the investigated conditions to a certain degree. As expected, PESQ achieves the best performance over almost all of the investigated conditions.",

The present study investigates how such tonal components embedded in noise are perceived under conditions of enhanced detectability of the tone due to (i) amplitude modulation of the noise background or (ii) interaural disparities in the signal's phase. To quantify the sensation elicited by a tonal component in these masking-release conditions, the listeners are asked to adjust the level of the tone to have the same magnitude of tonal content (German “Tonhaltigkeit”) or to be perceived as equally loud as a tone which is masked by an unmodulated noise and presented diotically (baseline condition). For both sensations the signal-to-noise ratio at equal magnitude of the sensation is lower for the tone in the masking-release conditions than for the baseline condition. This is mainly due to the lower masked threshold of the tone in masking-release conditions. The eff ect is most prominent at low levels and decreases towards higher levels. A high correlation is observed between the data for the magnitude of tonal content and the partial loudness of the tone, demonstrating the similarity between these two sensations.",

However, the relation between prad and the vocal tract impedance spectrum Zmouth has not previously been measured for orchestral instruments. In this study, prad and Zmouth were measured simultaneously over the frequency range from 100 to 10000 Hz while saxophonists played. For notes sounded over the normal and altissimo playing range, experienced saxophonists are able to produce distinctive variations in the spectral envelope of the radiated sound, without changing the pitch or the amplitude of the fundamental, using different vocal tract configurations. When Zmouth was adjusted to have magnitudes comparable with the input impedance of the bore, Zbore, harmonics of prad were usually increased at nearby frequencies, both for the range over which the saxophone has strong resonances (1002000 Hz) and for the higher range (2-10 kHz). Less experienced players who are unable to produce strong peaks in Zmouth produce much smaller variations in prad. prad correlates more strongly with the series impedance Zmouth + Zbore: for large values of |Zmouth|, larger series impedance at a particular frequency always produced larger radiated power. The change in sound inside the mouth is proportionally larger than that in prad, which explains why players judge the timbre to be more changed than do listeners.",

    "abstract": "In most physical models of brass instruments, the air jet (located at the exciter) is governed by an equation of Bernoulli-type for which basic, unsteady or lossy versions are available. The non-linearity introduced by such model is known to be of utmost importance for wind instruments: it is responsible for self-oscillations when fed by a power source. However, this type of model is unable to make the air flow work at a mobile boundary (lip) as it does not account for any transverse component (the vertical dimension during normal brass playing) in the velocity field. In this sense, it is ill adapted to properly address the power exchanges between the jet and the lips. This paper addresses the following twofold issue. The first issue is the derivation of an air flow model in the unsteady case that restores the fundamental property of passivity at boundaries. The second issue is the test of its relevance in self-oscillating contexts, based on passive-guaranteed simulations of a simplified complete instrument. To make the air flow model as simple as possible, its derivation relies on standard Bernoulli assumptions (irrotational, incompressible flow without loss) except for the boundary conditions at the wall. It is derived in two steps. First, we solve the 2D velocity and pressure fields of the Euler equation for boundary conditions that are adapted to a moving lip. Second, we derive a macroscopic model based on averaged velocities and pressures. This yields a finite dimensional differential system which proves to be equivalent to the original one, in the sense that both the velocity and the pressure fields can be recovered from the macroscopic variables. Moreover, it preserves the power balance of the original physical system. Then, a simplified model of an instrument is built by connecting this system to a lip (mass-spring-damper) and to a conservative straight pipe with an ideally dissipative termination. Passivity is fulfilled and the complete power balance is explicitly encoded by recasting the model into the “Port-Hamiltonian formulation”. A numerical scheme that preserves passivity is proposed to simulate the complete system supplied by an ideal air pressure generator. Finally, results are compared with those based on the standard Bernoulli equation.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates autocorrelation-based features as a potential basis for phonetic and syllabic distinctions. The work comes out of a theory of auditory signal processing based on central monaural autocorrelation and binaural crosscorrelation representations. Correlation-based features are used to predict monaural and binaural perceptual attributes that are important for the architectural acoustic design of concert halls: pitch, timbre, loudness, duration, reverberation-related coloration, sound direction, apparent source width, and envelopment (Ando, 1985, 1998; Ando and Cariani, 2009). The current study investigates the use of features of monaural autocorrelation functions (ACFs) for representing phonetic elements (vowels), syllables (CV pairs), and phrases using a small set of temporal factors extracted from the short-term running ACF. These factors include listening level (loudness), zero-lag ACF peak width (spectral tilt), τ1 (voice pitch period), φ1 (voice pitch strength), τe (effective duration of the ACF envelope, temporal repetitive continuity/contrast), segment duration, and Δφ1/Δt (the rate of pitch strength change, related to voice pitch attack-decay dynamics). Times at which ACF effective duration τe is minimal reflect rapid signal pattern changes that usefully demarcate segmental boundaries. Results suggest that vowels, CV syllables, and phrases can be distinguished on the basis of this ACF-derived feature set.",

This effect has been analysed by many authors both in calculations and in experiments. The question arises whether it is possible to influence the wind-factor and to what extent the performance of the barrier could eventually be increased. This paper reports on a wind tunnel experiment set up to try to answer this question. The experiment focuses on the insertion loss close to the barrier (up to a distance of 10 times the barrier height). A model at scale 1/20 is constructed. Both single and double noise barrier (i.e. a noise barrier on either side of the source) configurations are tested, in combination with windscreens. Scale models of vegetative screens are used to modify wind profiles close to the noise barrier. The positive effect on barrier performance is of the order of a few dB. Although this effect may seem small at first sight, it can be obtained at virtually no additional cost and therefore is of practical interest.",

It is shown how fuzzy set theory can help us to construct a mathematical background for translating these modifiers between the languages concerned. A second goal of annoyance modifier research is to define labels to be used in noise annoyance surveys in order to obtain accurate and comparable results. Similarity measures used to compare fuzzy sets associated with verbal descriptors of annoyance levels indicate to what extent previously proposed labels [1] match between the languages considered. An ideal language from the fuzzy point of view where a continuous annoyance scale is exactly divided into equal parts is translated to these natural languages and results in an alternative selection of labels that are better suited for fuzzy calculus. In general this selection of labels corresponds quite well with the set proposed in [1] which is rather surprising since the fuzzy set approach lacks most of the human input used in the ICBEN selection procedure.",

It is shown that the relative power in the fundamental may change by more than 3 dB when the vibrations in the bell section are damped. Two possible causes for the effects are considered: a change in input impedance, and the transfer of mechanical vibrations through the instrument to the lips. Results of modelling and experiments are presented that indicate the latter is the more plausible explanation; however, the etiology of the effect is still unknown.",

An improved description could be achieved by including the time variations of the noise. Here, the time variations of A-weighted road traffic noise levels have been studied. Of special interest are situations with a shielded courtyard. For numerical results, a ray model has been used for calculating the sound propagation, and the traffic has been modelled as a Poisson process. With this model the statistics of A-weighted levels have been investigated for different situations with varying traffic flows. Results from an in-situ measurement have been compared with those from the numerical model, showing acceptable agreement. It is shown both by numerical modelling and measurements that the time variations in noise level are smaller in a courtyard than in a corresponding directly exposed situation. One of the additional conclusions is that the noise reduction of the maximum level can be significantly higher than that of the equivalent level.",

Simulations show that both models exhibit self-sustained vibrations. We show that the occurrence of collisions and the intensity of harmonics depend strongly on the configuration of the syrinx. The songbird model does not present instabilities. The trapezoidal model, however, displays coexisting limit-cycles that represent vibrations with, and without collisions at the same pressure.

    "abstract": "This paper quantifies some of the effects of three popular lossy audio compression algorithms on basic acoustic speech analysis procedures by comparing original audio-CD speech recordings to compressed/decompressed versions of these recordings. The differences found are benchmarked against the effects of a change of microphone. Tested are a Sony Minidisc Walkman recorder and two audio compression codecs: Ogg Vorbis 1 .Orc3 and LAME 3.92 (MP3), with 3 bit rates: 40, 80 (Ogg Vorbis), and 192 kbs (MP3). These are tested against pitch and formant extraction and a global spectral measure, the spectral center of gravity (i.e., first spectral moment). Audio compression added only a limited amount of jump errors (≤3%) to vowel pitch and formant measurements. Only small systematic effects on measurements were found that could be attributed to compression. However, rather large systematic effects resulted from a switch of microphone, mostly on the spectral center of gravity. The audio compression algorithms introduced a Root-Mean-Square (RMS) error, after removing jump errors, of less than I semitone to vowel mid-point pitch, formant, and CoG measurements. The effect of the microphone change on RMS error was as large, i.e., for pitch, or larger, i.e.. > 1.2 semitones for formants and center of gravity. Comparison of the pitch in sonorants and the spectral center of gravity measurements in continuants showed that here too, the RMS errors introduced by the audio compression were always less than 1 semitone, except for the lowest bit-rate, 40 kbs, where CoG errors exploded in vowel-like consonants and fricatives (>2 semitones). The size of the errors shows an effect of compression factor (bit-rate). The higher bit-rate encodings always had smaller RMS errors, except for pitch measurements where there was no effect of encoding or bit-rate whatsoever. When audio compression is applied repeatedly, e.g., during recording, distribution, and archiving, the weakest link determines the total RMS error for pitch and formant measurements. However, the total RMS error of the CoG measurements is the sum of the component errors. It is concluded that Minidisc recordings and compressed speech of bit-rates from 80 kbs and up can be used for acoustic speech analysis if an increased RMS error of up to 1 semitone is acceptable. A low bit-rate encoding of 40 kbs introduces markedly larger errors in formant measurements and must be considered unsuitable for whole-spectrum measurements like the CoG. Repeatedly compressed speech is still useful for pitch and formant measurements, but whole spectrum (e.g., CoG) measurements should only be used with care.",

For this reason, synthesis models have to be capable of modeling this nonlinear behavior, when high quality results are desired. This study presents two novel physical modeling algorithms for simulating the tension modulation nonlinearity in vibrating strings in a spatially distributed manner. The first method uses fractional delay filters within a digital waveguide structure, allowing the length of the string to be modulated during run time. The second method uses a nonlinear finite difference approach, where the string state is approximated between sampling instants using similar fractional delay elements, thus allowing run-time modulation of the temporal sampling location. The magnitude of the tension modulation is evaluated from the elongation of the string at every time step in both cases. Simulation results of the two models are presented and compared. Real-time sound synthesis of the kantele, a traditional Finnish plucked-string instrument with strong effect of tension modulation, has been implemented using the nonlinear digital waveguide algorithm.",

The importance of the application of the scattering coefficient in room acoustics, particularly in a computer model to obtain reliable prediction results, has already been reported in international round robin tests. There is a need for guidelines and a reliable database of surface materials for the application of the standard method. In this study, the effect of some measurement parameters on the measurement of random-incidence scattering coefficient in a reverberation room based on ISO 17497-1 was investigated. A 1:5 scale model of the reverberation room, which has a volume of 2.4 m 3 , was employed to measure the random-incidence scattering coefficient of periodic battens. In the present work, three parameters, the turntable diameter (0.64 m and 0.84m), the air gap below the turntable (50 mm and 222 mm) and the absorption coefficient of the test sample (0.09 and 0.31) were considered. The influence of each parameter over the scattering coefficient of the periodic battens was measured and analysed. A lower scattering coefficient of the periodic battens was obtained when a turntable diameter of 0.64 m was applied. A lower scattering coefficient of the periodic battens at the corresponding real-scale frequency bands from 630 Hz to 2.5 kHz was obtained when an air gap of 50 mm was applied. The absorption coefficient of the test sample influenced the measured scattering coefficient at mid and high frequency bands.",

The mean auditory ratings obtained in these tests have been compared to estimates provided by three different single-ended models, one of which is currently recommended by the International Telecommunication Union for predicting the quality of naturally-produced speech.

    "abstract": "Basic wavelet denoising techniques rely on a thresholding of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients of the noisy signal. Some improvements in noise reduction efficiency can be obtained by the use of shift-invariant undecimated wavelet transforms (UWT). Ultrasonic grain noise is one of the most usual types of noise present in ultrasonic non-destructive evaluation. It comes from reflections in the material structure, and occupies a frequency band very similar to that of the echosignals of interest. In this work, new advances in the application of redundant wavelet transforms to ultrasonic grain noise reduction are presented. Wavelet denoising is applied to several sets of synthetic ultrasonic traces, which are obtained from a model that includes frequency dependent attenuation for both grain and flaw backscattered echoes, frequency dependent scattering from the grains, and an accurate model for the pulse-echo frequency response of the piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer. Two processors based on traditional DWT and alternative a trous UWT denosing have been implemented and compared, using level dependent thresholds (appropriate for correlated noise), soft thresholding, and Universal, SURE and Minimax threshold selection rules. The performances of the two processors are analyzed in terms of the mean value and standard deviation of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of different sets of ultrasonic traces before and after denoising. It is shown that a trous UWT processing provides better results than DWT with a general tendency to higher quality of the resulting traces and greater robustness of the processing. It is also shown that the better performance of the UWT is mainly related to the redundancy of the representation, since there are not significant variations between the threshold values obtained with each processor.",

    "abstract": "In the past, musical instruments were developed over long periods of time by skilled craftsmen. Today, most instruments are mass-produced. Design of musical instruments as mass-produced products requires using strategies which make it easier to identify customer needs and develop exact specifications. To develop useful specifications it is necessary to convert general descriptions into something which can be commonly understood and also be interpretable in terms of acoustic metrics. In this study, methods for analysis and specification of steady state parts of alto saxophone sounds were developed. Saxophonists' use of verbal descriptions of saxophone sounds was investigated. Sound stimuli were binaurally recorded. Judgements upon perceived qualities were made by saxophonists and non-saxophonists using the method of verbal attribute magnitude estimation. Perceptual dimensions were identified using principal component analysis of listening test data. Three prominent dimensions were found and described using the verbal attributes: 1) warm/soft, 2) back vowel analogues and 3) sharp/rough. The perceptual dimensions were modelled as linear functions of acoustic metrics. The results were validated through listening tests with new subjects and new stimuli. Based on the findings, the method was seen as an approach which can enhance the musical instrument design process.",

    "abstract": "The entropy noise mechanism was experimentally investigated under clearly defined flow and boundary conditions on a dedicated test setup. Previous experimental research on the topic of entropy noise could draw only indirect conclusions on the existence of entropy noise due to the complexity of the physical mechanism. In order to reduce this complexity, a reference test rig has been set up within this work. In this test rig well controlled entropy waves were generated by electrical heating. The noise emission of the entropy waves accelerated in an adjacent nozzle flow was measured accurately and therewith a qualitative and quantitative determination of the entropy noise source mechanism could be experimentally accomplished. In addition to this, a parametric study on the quantities relevant for entropy noise was conducted. The results were compared to a one-dimensional theory by Marble & Candel. In a next step investigations on a combustor test rig showed a broadband noise generation mechanism in the frequency range between 1 and 3.2 kHz. The combustor rig was set up with a similar outlet-nozzle geometry like the reference test rig (EWG) and provided therefore outlet-boundary conditions like in real-scale aero-engines (outlet Mach number = 1.0). It was found that this broadband noise has a strong dependency on the nozzle Mach number in the combustor outlet. The summed-up broadband sound pressure level increases exponentially with the nozzle Mach number. However, investigations of comparable cold flow conditions did not show this behavior. Since the results of the reference experiment with artificially generated entropy waves did not show this exponential increase with the nozzle Mach number, this leaves the conclusion, that this additional noise is generated by the interaction of small-scale fluctuations, e.g. in entropy or vorticity, with the turbulent nozzle flow in the combustion chamber outlet nozzle.",

Part I of this paper [1] provides a mathematical approximation based on wave extrapolation of the sound field in and around the focal point due to reflections by a spherical surface. This second part of the paper provides some practical methods for calculating the sound field. A geometrical approach is presented, the limitations of image source methods are described and an engineering method is presented. Computer models based on image source methods are not capable of describing the pressure in or out of the focal. The sound field outside the focal area can be calculated within reasonable accuracy with a geometrical approach. The results show that for a small wavelength the focussing effect is fairly strong. Generally the possible reduction of the focussing effect by absorbers or diffusers is not enough to eliminate the focussing effect by spherical surfaces.",

In this study, the spatial distribution of heavy-weight impact sound pressure levels was investigated by field measurements using heavy/soft impact sources, which have been specified as a standard heavy-weight impact source in 140-11. The results of the present study showed that the vertical and horizontal distribution of measured sound pressure levels showed a significant room mode effect at low frequencies. Among the existing standards for measurement of a heavy-weight impact sound, KS F 2810-2 and JIS A 1440-2 provide an appropriate estimation of the room average sound pressure level for bare slab and floating floor, with respect to a low bias error and 95% confidence interval. The guideline for measurement of a heavy-weight impact source was recently proposed in order to complement the limitations of KS F 2810-2 and JIS A 1440-2, and it has been shown that the guideline appropriately performed in the test building and in living rooms of tested apartment buildings.",

The mode shapes are predicted accurately for both the plate and the air film, and the approach followed includes their strong coupling. Owing to the accuracy of the method, there are applications in the characterisation of the properties of square microphones (those miniaturised on silicon chip) as shown at the end of the paper.

However, previous work showed that speech-in-noise perception was uncorrelated with simultaneous segregation, whereas it appeared to be related to the pure-tone fusion threshold of sequential streaming. The current study aimed to clarify the relationships between pitch-based speech-in-speech segregation, pitch-based streaming, and frequency selectivity. Twenty-three listeners with close to normal hearing were involved. Speech-in-speech perception was measured using words presented in a time-reversed single talker background, with various pitch differences between target and masker. Streaming performance was measured using an objective order-naming task on vowel sequences. Auditory filter widths were derived using a notch-noise method. Results showed a correlation between the effect of pitch on speech-in-speech perception and the effect of pitch on streaming performance. However, frequency selectivity was found to correlate with average speech-in-speech perception but not with streaming, and only in the region of the second formant. These latter results are consistent with the hypothesis that pitch-based streaming probably relies on pitch discrimination, which is only poorly correlated to frequency selectivity. Further, these results suggest that mild impairments in frequency selectivity do not systematically impair pitch-based streaming.",

    "abstract": "Blade-passing frequency (BPF) tonal noise is usually the main contributor to centrifugal fan noise as opposed to broad-band noise; therefore, abating its strength can reduce fan noise significantly. The predominant BPF noise source is the surface acoustic dipole over the cutoff due to the flow interactions between the impeller and the volute. In this study, a modified cutoff with an inclined edge and enlarged cutoff clearance was successfully employed to reduce the BPF noise; the measured noise spectra at three different flow rates of the inclined-cutoff fan and the original fan were compared, and noticeable noise reduction was found. The cause of this tonal noise reduction was numerically studied, using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technology and acoustic analogy theory to calculate the flow fields inside the fan and sound radiation respectively. Results showed that the cutoff, including the geometric configuration and it's clearance with the impeller, was crucial to impeller-volute flow interactions. As a consequence, this inclined cutoff with enlarged cutoff clearance could eliminate the BPF pressure fluctuation, i.e. BPF dipole source, at the design point effectively; although the BPF pressure fluctuation was still notable at large flow rates, the radiated sound power decreased drastically attributed to the phase cancellation of the dipole sources. This study shows that CFD combined with acoustic analogy can provide a reliable access to noise prediction, thus it will be employed in aeroacoustic optimization of centrifugal fans.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new idea of reducing airfoil trailing edge noise using a small bump in the turbulent boundary layer. First, we develop and validate a new computational approach to predict airfoil trailing edge noise using steady RANS CFD, an empirical wall pressure spectrum model, and Howe's diff raction theory. This numerical approach enables fast and accurate predictions of trailing edge noise, which is used to study the noise reduction from the bump for various airfoil geometries and flow conditions at high Reynolds numbers. Three types of bumps, the suction-side bump, pressure-side bump, and both-side bumps, are studied. The results show that all types of bumps are able to reduce far-field noise up to 10 dB compared to clean airfoils, but their impacts are diff erent in terms of the eff ective frequency range. Also, bumps with four diff erent heights are compared with each other to investigate the eff ect of the height of bumps on noise reduction. It is demonstrated that a bump causes velocity deficit within the boundary layer near the wall. This velocity deficit results in reduced turbulence kinetic energy near the wall, which is responsible for trailing edge noise reduction. Overall, this paper demonstrates the potential of a boundary-layer bump in trailing edge noise reduction and sheds light on the physical mechanism of noise reduction with boundary-layer bumps.",

The method relies on the array signal model in the spherical harmonics domain that can be represented as a spatially sparse problem. This makes it possible to use compressive sensing to solve an underdetermined problem via promoting sparsity. The estimation of the angular position of sources with respect to the microphone array, as well as the three-dimensional localization over a volume are investigated. Several sparse recovery algorithms [orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), generalized OMP, &amp;rhov ; 1 -norm minimization, and reweighted &amp;rhov ; 1 -norm minimization] are examined for this purpose. The numerical and experimental results indicate that sparse recovery methods outperform conventional spherical harmonics beamforming. Reweighted &amp;rhov ; 1 -norm has good adaptability to noise, improving the robustness of CSB. The method can successfully localize the angular position of sources, and quantify their relative pressure contribution. The method is promising to localize sources in a three-dimensional domain of interest. However, the three-dimensional localization is more sensitive to noise, source distance, and properties of the sensing matrix than the two-dimensional localization.",

    "abstract": "The sound transmission properties of sandwich panels can be predicted with sufficient degree of accuracy by calculating the wave propagation properties of the structure. This method works well for sandwich panels with isotropic cores but applications to panels with anisotropic cores are hard to find. Honeycomb is an example of anisotropic material which when used as a core, results in a sandwich panel with anisotropic properties. In this paper, honeycomb panels are treated as being orthotropic and the wavenumbers are calculated for the two principle directions. These calculated wavenumbers are validated with the measured wavenumbers estimated from the resonance frequencies of freely hanging honeycomb beams. A combination of wave propagation and standard orthotropic plate theory is used to predict the sound transmission loss of honeycomb panels. These predictions are validated through sound transmission measurements. Passive damping treatment is a common way to reduce structural vibration and sound radiation, but they often have little effect on sound transmission. Visco-elastic damping with a constraining layer is applied to two honeycomb panels with standard and enhanced fluid coupling properties. This enhanced fluid coupling in one of the test panels is due to an extended coincidence range observed from the dispersion curves. The influence of damping treatments on the sound transmission loss of these panels is investigated. Results show that, after the damping treatment, the sound transmission loss of an acoustically bad panel and a normal panel are very similar.",

    "abstract": "Many sound sources emit series of discrete sounds. Auditory perception must bind these sounds together (stream integration) while separating them from sounds emitted by other sources (stream segregation). One cue for identifying successive sounds that belong together is the predictability between their feature values. Previous studies have demonstrated that independent predictable patterns appearing separately in two interleaved sound sequences support perceptual segregation. The converse case, whether a joint predictable pattern in a mixture of interleaved sequences supports perceptual integration, has not yet been put to a rigorous empirical test. This was mainly due to difficulties in manipulating the predictability of the full sequence independently of the predictability of the interleaved subsequences. The present study implemented such an independent manipulation. Listeners continuously indicated whether they perceived a tone sequence as integrated or segregated, while predictable patterns set up to support one or the other percept were manipulated without the participants’ knowledge. Perceptual reports demonstrate that predictability supports stream segregation or integration depending on the type of predictable pattern that is present in the sequence. The effects of predictability were so pronounced as to qualitatively flip perception from predominantly (62%) integrated to predominantly (73%) segregated. These results suggest that auditory perception flexibly responds to encountered regular patterns, favoring predictable perceptual organizations over unpredictable ones. Besides underlining the role of predictability as a cue within auditory scene analysis, the present design also provides a general framework that accommodates previous investigations focusing on sub-comparisons within the present set of experimental manipulations. Results of intermediate conditions shed light on why some previous studies have obtained little to no effects of predictability on auditory scene analysis.",

In this paper, the basic principles and assumptions underpinning the design of such systems are examined. Inexpensive modifications to a capillary-based impedance measurement set-up made possible due to advances in computing and data acquisition technology are discussed. The modified set-up is able to measure both impedance magnitude and impedance phase even though it only contains one microphone. In addition, a method of calibration is described that results in a significant improvement in accuracy when measuring high impedance objects on the modified capillary-based system. The method involves carrying out calibration measurements on two different objects whose impedances are well-known theoretically. The benefits of performing two calibration measurements (as opposed to the one calibration measurement that has been traditionally used) are demonstrated experimentally through input impedance measurements on two test objects and a Boosey and Hawkes oboe.",

The LTFS considered here is made up of an upper floor layer, a cavity space with timber joists and a ceiling. These components are joined by timber battens, ceiling furring channels and ceiling clips. The vibration in the structure is caused by a localized excitation on the top surface and the resulting vibration level of the ceiling surface will be analysed. The cavity space is filled with fibre infill for damping the sound transmitting through the cavity. A unique feature of the design and the model is the sand-sawdust mixture in the upper layer. The theoretical model and the experimental measurements show that the sand-sawdust dampens the vibration in the frequency range between 10 and 200 Hz. The damping by the sand-sawdust and the fibre infill are found by comparing the numerical simulations against the experimental measurements. We show that the simple linear frequency dependent loss factors can be used to predict the low-frequency vibrations of LTFSs.",

All tones up to the 12th fret of the soundboard are played and analyzed for 20 partials each and back-propagated to obtain the radiation patterns. Four parameters were calculated from these radiation patterns, the radiating area, impedance, pressure reconstruction 1 meter in front of guitar top plate and Interaural Cross Correlation (IACC) as a binaural parameter. The guitars used showed distinct timbre differences, the Wichmann bass-reflex guitar has increased overall loudness with decreased tone variability, the Hanika concert guitar shows a very stable tone throughout playing range, and the low-priced Yamaha flamenco guitar has an rather unstable, semiprofessional tone. The calculated parameters were associated with these guitar characters, explaining the strong radiation and small variation of the bass-reflex guitar by decreased radiation area, associating the more stable sound of the Hanika guitar to a stable IACC behaviour, and the more unstable timbre of the Flamenco guitar to a strong variability over the different parameters used. When correlating the parameters for all guitars it appears that the correlation is independent of the guitar used and so appear to be a constant in guitar acoustics.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes an experimentally-based analysis of the interaction between musician and instrument in the case of the classical concert harp. The study highlights gestural strategies used by three harpists while performing a short musical excerpt. As a result of years of practicing, a trained musician has developed the ability to deal with a number of trade-offs among simultaneous objectives while playing. She/he has obviously to set the instrument into vibration, but also to convey some musical intention to the audience and to communicate with other musicians, while keeping a safe posture with respect to articular and muscle pain. In order to precisely describe the motion strategies carried out by trained harpists, an experiment has been designed using a motion capture system and corresponding video and audio recordings. This provides accurate three-dimensional positioning of several markers disposed on the harpist and on the harp, within the execution of a musical piece. From the acquired gestural and acoustical signals, a set of kinematic and dynamic descriptors were extracted. The investigation shows that while each musician uses their own specific and repeatable upper-limb movements, the global sound-producing gesture is mostly controlled by the shoulders. Sound-facilitating hand gestures are highlighted for their supporting role to the musician throughout the musical piece.",

The methods compared fall into two categories: in one of them, the acoustical source (receiver and tubing) is modeled independently from the individual ear, in the other one it is modeled jointly with the individual ear. Models of the individual ear include modified variants of the phase reflectance and the pressure minima methods and a model of an ear simulator. As a result, it appears that the modified phase reflectance method works best for independent models of source and ear, whereas the modified pressure minima method works best for joint models of source and ear. With these methods, acceptable accuracies can be obtained in the frequency range from 100 Hz to 10 kHz, except for a few extremely large ear canals.",

    "abstract": "Noise maps results are usually presented as contour graphs or isoline curves, which describe the sound levels as functions of spatial location. These maps are added to Geographic Information Systems (GIS), allowing sound level evaluation as a function of the continuous coordinates x and y, for a given height above ground. Although the outcome of the system is a continuous variable, the calculations that allow its evaluation are obtained from discrete points structured in a calculation grid. This grid is created by the application of spatial sampling techniques. Using spatial interpolation tools (IDW, krigging... ), values are assigned to the locations in which acoustic calculations have not been performed. The application of sampling and interpolation techniques (the type of grid, its density, the interpolation algorithms... ) contributes to the uncertainty of the results. This paper describes a calculation method to quantify the uncertainty associated to the spatial sampling and interpolation processes. Despite most of the previous literature refers to the uncertainty in a noise map as the uncertainty of the receivers' results (output of the noise model), in this approach we propose also including the contributions derived by the interpolation and classification processes, so that the uncertainty must be estimated only for the locations on the contour lines.",

    "abstract": "This study was triggered by the flute players' and teacher's claim that a high quality of playing cannot be reached without a precise control of the breathing, starting during preparatory phases. Among all the controls developed by the musician, the work focuses on the interactions between respiratory activity and hydrodynamical parameters during flute music performance. In order to study these interactions, the following parameters are measured during the playing of a flautist: muscle activation, chest-wall compartment displacement and volume, blowing pressure in the mouth, lip position, and radiated sound. All these measurements are taken simultaneously, using a combined set-up developed to acquire both respiratory and hydrodynamical data. Three musical excerpts with different complexities (one scale and two pieces of the flute repertory) are analyzed. The results show that in preparation to a long musical phrase, the player takes a deeper and longer inhalation than for a standard phrase and, that he needs to develop a specific control of flow for playing. This control of flow requires the flautist, as opposed to normal breathing conditions at rest, to coordinate the respiratory muscles while expiring. This control, in correlation with the lip geometry, allows the player to produce musical variations such as ``dynamics''. Additionally, the respiratory analyses show that the flautist develops three different patterns of chest volume variations, one for each of the three musical tasks. Finally, a simple, qualitative model is presented in order to link respiratory and aerodynamic parameters to muscular activity, mouth pressure and chest volume during flute playing.",

    "abstract": "The perceived quality of cane reeds used on saxophones or clarinets may be very different from one reed to another even though the reeds have the same shape and strength.The aim of this work is to better understand the differences in the perceived quality of reeds by making use of acoustical measurements.A perceptual study, involving a panel of 10 musicians, was first conducted on a set of 20 reeds of the same strength.Each musician assessed each of the 20 reeds according to three descriptors: Brightness, Softness, and Global quality.Second, signal recordings during saxophone playing (saxophone playing by a musician in the laboratory, called in vivo measurements) were made of the pressures in a player's mouth, in the mouthpiece, and at the bell of the instrument.These measurements enable us to deduce specific acoustical variables, such as the threshold pressure or the spectral centroid of the notes.After an analysis of the perceptual and acoustical data (assessment of the agreement among the assessors and the main consensual differences between the reeds), correlations between the perceptual and acoustical data were performed.A modeling of the descriptors Brightness and Softness according to the acoustical variables is proposed using multiple linear regression.Results show that the pressure in the mouth at the beginning of the permanent regime is an important variable to predict the softness of the reed.The performance of the models in the prediction of the perceptual dimensions provides important clues for a more objective assessment of perceived reed qualities.",

    "abstract": "In active human echolocation, it is common for visually impaired persons to produce tongue click signals for extracting information from the physical environment around them. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive dataset of original detailed experimental data on human tongue clicks. The methods used for analysis are described in order to encourage further work to complement the data, which is available online and open for contributions. Series of six different click signals have been recorded from blind persons in an anechoic room. The different click signals all resemble damped oscillations and have in common that the dominant frequency content is located between 1,000 Hz and 8,000 Hz. The standard deviation in click series of the broadband click sound level is between 2.2 and 4.3 dB. The total duration of the clicks, which is mainly determined by the drop-time, ranges between 2.0 ms and 10.0 ms, for a 20 dB decay range. Average standard deviations of 57% in rise-time and 32% in drop-time have been found. The horizontal and vertical directivity of the tongue clicks show a close agreement with literature data from speech signals, but click signals are generally more directive. The minimum and maximum deviations in the 1/3 octave bands from 1,250 Hz to 4,000 Hz are less than 6 dB, for 0 to 120 deg. azimuth, and for –27 to 127 deg. elevation.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a computation tool for the calculation of wind instrument input impedance in the context of linear planar wave propagation with visco-thermal losses. The originality of the approach lies in the usage of a specific and simple 1D finite element method (FEM). The popular Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) is also recalled and a seamless formulation is proposed which unifies the cases cylinders vs. cones. Visco-thermal losses, which are natural dissipation in the system, are not exactly taken into account by this method when arbitrary shapes are considered. The introduction of an equivalent radius leads to an approximation that we quantify using the FEM method. The equation actually solved by the TMM in this case is exhibited. The accuracy of the two methods (FEM and TMM) and the associated computation times are assessed and compared. Although the TMM is more efficient in lossless cases and for lossy cylinders, the FEM is shown to be more efficient when targeting a specific precision in the realistic case of a lossy trumpet. Some additional features also exhibit the robustness and flexibility of the FEM over the TMM. All the results of this article are computed using the open-source python toolbox OpenWind.",

In the case of single-reed woodwind instruments these may involve tongue strokes to the reed or modulation of the blowing pressure. To analyse the emerging transient phenomena, a time-domain physical model of the player-instrument interaction is employed. In order to avoid adding new terms and complexity to the model, the effect of tonguing is simulated by allowing temporal variation of existing, physically meaningful parameters. Experimental measurements show differences between tones separated using the tongue or the blowing pressure and comparisons with numerical simulations are carried out. In particular the synthesised mouthpiece pressure and reed displacement are compared with data obtained under real playing conditions. In an attempt to understand how articulatory actions affect the excitation mechanism of the instrument, the physical model parameters that are required to resynthesise the recorded sounds are estimated.

The acoustic power generated or dissipated across the double orifices is evaluated by means of the so-called whistling\r\ncriterion. Hereby, the whistling potentiality of the two tandem orifice configurations is computed from the identified scattering matrix. The deduced acoustic power is subsequently compared against the whistling potentiality of one single orifice composing the ducted systems to evince the influence of the duct length between the\r\nsingularities.

    "abstract": "Complex vibration modes, which can be characterised by the superposition of standing and travelling bending waves, occur for instance in structures with inhomogeneous damping distribution. The existence of complex structural modes raises the question of their influence on sound radiation properties. In this paper an analytical model of a simply supported rectangular plate is introduced. It allows a quick calculation of complex vibration patterns with different properties, avoiding time consuming and sometimes unstable damped modal analysis in finite-element-software. Using this model it is possible to generate vibration patterns with varying level and spatial distribution of travelling waves as well as different symmetry of amplitude distributions, in order to reveal the important influence factors on sound radiation. Despite the fact that the analytical model generates idealised vibration patterns, the presented consideraton significantly improves phenomenological understanding of acoustic effects in complex vibration modes. The accuracy of the presented model is validated by results of finite element modal analysis and is evaluated in terms of resulting amplitude and phase distributions of the vibrating surface. The results of both suggested approaches are compared using modal radiation efficiencies, spatial distributions of far field acoustic intensity and sound field directivity. Some additional conclusions are made using the analytical model concerning important acoustic metrics of structural vibration patterns. It is shown, that vibration shapes of even order are very sensitive to the presence of travelling waves regarding their radiation capability and character of sound pressure field.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic horns are used in musical instruments and loudspeakers in order to provide an impedance match between an acoustic source and the surrounding air. The aim of this study is to develop numerical tools for the analysis and optimisation of such horns, with respect to their input impedance spectra. Important effects such as visco-thermal damping and modal conversion are shown to be localised to different parts of a typical brass instrument. This makes it possible to construct hybrid methods that apply different numerical techniques in different parts of the instrument. Narrow and slowly flaring parts are modelled using a one-dimensional transmission line analogy, and the rapidly flaring bell is modelled using a two-dimensional finite-difference method. The connection between the different regions is done by the aid of impedance boundary conditions. The use of such boundary conditions is investigated with respect to the required number of degrees of freedom. Numerical shape optimisation is employed in order to design horns with desired impedance characteristics throughout a design frequency band. A loudspeaker horn is optimised with respect to its sound power output, and a brass instrument is optimised with respect to its intonation. The horns are modelled using the finite-element method and a transmission line analogy. In order to achieve rapid convergence of the optimisation, gradient based minimisation algorithms are used. A prerequisite for success is the ability to accurately and inexpensively compute the gradient of the objective function. The gradient for the finite-element method is computed by an adjoint equation technique, whereas for the transmission line analogy, it is derived by formal differentiation of the model. In order to find smooth solutions, a smoothing technique is used, where optimisation is done with respect to the right hand side of a Poisson type equation.",

    "abstract": "Two experiments investigated the effects of conflicting interaural time and level differences on the masked threshold of speech. Target sentences were prepared using manipulated HRTFs for azimuths of 0° and 60°. Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were measured against a masker with a 0° simulated azimuth, consisting of either Brown noise (−6 dB/oct. spectral roll-off) or speech. Experiment 1 compared the advantage of spatial separation produced by differences between target and interferer in cues to their azimuth. The introduction of an interaural time delay (ITD) or interaural level difference (ILD) reduced SRTs by 3–4 dB, but their combined effect was about 6 dB. Experiment 2 compared the advantage of spatial separation produced by combined cues that indicated either the same or opposing hemi-fields for the target speech. The combined effects of these two cues were indistinguishable, even when they conflicted with each other regarding the direction of the target speech. These results suggest that the improvements in audibility gained from exploiting ILD and ITD are not constrained by a need to focus attention on a particular direction.",

This model makes it possible to calculate the response caused by a force in both the radial and tangential directions at high frequencies, including the local deformation at the excitation point. Now results from this tyre model have been compared with measured data. The effect of the measurement equipment has been included in the model and the model is demonstrated and validated against measured radial and tangential point and transfer mobilities. The agreement is good for radial point mobilities, capturing the local behaviour at the excitation point. The radial transfer mobilities also agree well with measured data. The tangential point and transfer mobilities also show good agreement with measured data in characteristics and levels, if the boundary conditions are changed. Finally, the benefits and limitations of the models are discussed.",

The model takes binaural signals as the input, processing them in a series of signal processing modules, which simulate the peripheral, binaural and the central stages of spatial hearing. In particular, the central processor of the model considers the excitation-inhibition (EI) cell activity patterns as the internal representation of available cues, and the source location estimates are obtained by using a simple pattern-matching procedure. In the listening tests, stereophonic images were presented to the listener's front, where the stimulus was either broadband or 1/3 octave band noise at 7 centre frequencies from 0.5 kHz to 6 kHz. The subjective responses compared well to the model prediction across frequency except for some cases where the image location was overestimated. Also, the prediction for the localisation of broadband phantom images agreed well with the test results, where the model prediction was integrated across frequency according to a tentatively suggested weighting function. Although the neuroscientific background is weak for the model, the good agreement with the subjective responses suggests that the model is worth investigating further.",

At sufficiently high acoustic levels, and past a value of about 0.5 for the Strouhal number, the flow separates and a vortex is formed. Its evolution with the different parameters is studied. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is applied to the ensemble of phase-averaged flow fields in the vicinity of the abrupt change. It is used as a means to separate the global acoustic movement from the localized non linear movements induced by it. The quantity of energy flowing from the first (acoustic) mode toward the higher (nonlinear) modes is calculated and is shown to be largely governed by the Strouhal number.",

The acoustic changes were determined by noise mapping and validated by field measurements. Social surveys were performed six months before, three months following and one year after operation of the railway. The results show that despite railway noise and a small increase in total noise exposure, the annoyance of the residents decreased with time during the study period, showing that annoyance was not significantly related to noise levels or the magnitude of change in exposure level. The results of path analysis show that factors affecting annoyance reactions changed during the study period covering different stages before and after operation of the railway. While the current research design does not provide temporal human response data long enough to ascertain whether the annoyance reaction just before opening of the railway was an overreaction, the study has nonetheless demonstrated that annoyance did attenuate over time. Possible factors affecting human annoyance reactions and implications for environmental management are examined in the paper.",

    "abstract": "The input impedance of an air column (horn) with a slowly varying cross section can be calculated approximately by solving the wave equation assuming plane waves (Webster equation). In some cases analytical solutions are possible. For an arbitrary horn shape described as a succession of short cones the one-dimensional transmission-line (TL) method can be used. This fails for horns with a large flare, where transverse flow demands kinetic energy, effectively increasing the local inertance. The quantities determining the magnitude of this correction appear from a variational calculation based on Rayleigh's principle. The magnitude of these quantities was determined by numerically solving the wave equation at low frequency in a number of horn shapes by a finite difference method. Studied are conical, hyperboloid and catenoidal horns. Since horns, in particular those found in wind instruments, are found in many other shapes, general use of this method is not practical. In this paper a simple formula is proposed useful for any horn shape to calculate approximately the additional inertance. It is introduced as a correction in the TL method and is applicable to any shape, even for a stepwise diameter change and for a flange. Its accuracy for most geometries found on wind instruments is within the detection threshold of the ear, a 0.2% frequency shift. It is not applicable any more when cross-dimensions become comparable to the wavelength.",

With impulse responses measured inside several theatres of different design and with an anechoic source consisting of a soprano singer and a piano keyboard, several virtual sound fields with particular objective parameters were reproduced under controlled conditions. The sound level difference between the stage and the pit (or orchestra) sources was fixed in the virtual sound fields and paired-comparison tests were conducted to obtain scale values of the balance. A relationship between the scale value of the balance and a group of parameters used in the acoustical qualification of rooms is then achieved by using multiple regression analysis. A relevant finding is that the early decay time (EDT) for the stage source has a major effect on the scale values of balance. The contribution of the stage parameters to the scale value is greater than that of the pit/orchestra parameters.",

Such simulations can be augmented with edge diffraction modeling for improved accuracy, but not without a significant increase in processing time due to the additional propagation paths which must be considered and the computational complexity of the diffraction calculations. However, for a given modeling scenario, the contribution of a diffracted path to the overall impulse response can vary over a large range, suggesting that certain diffracted paths can be ignored, or culled, to reduce processing time with a limited effect on the accuracy of the simulation. In this talk, we first analyze the effects of diffraction culling through a precomputed, amplitude‐based ranking scheme. We then describe a simple procedure for identifying and culling insignificant diffraction components during a virtual‐acoustic simulation which approximates the performance of the precomputed ranking. Through numerical and subjective analysis, we show that a significant percentage of diffracted paths can be ignored if the retained paths are those which lead to the highest‐amplitude diffraction components, although the audible effects of such diffraction culling are dependent on the input signal.",

Variation of methanol concentration allows obtaining some mixtures with varied nonlinear parameters while their linear acoustic impedance remains close to the water's one. Analysis of harmonics of phase conjugate waves (PCW) in automatically con-focal WPC-system provides reliable detection of the phantoms.

Two established scattering coefficient measurement methods, proposed by Mommertz and Vorlander [1], are simulated; these correspond to measurements in a reverberant chamber, and free field. The results are also compared to those obtained in a previous paper [2], wherein it was demonstrated that FDTD schemes can be used to predict polar responses. These free field polar responses are used to find the correlation scattering coefficient, which in turn is used to validate the free field case. In modelling the reverberant chamber method, 2D simulations have been used to reduce computation time; hence it is necessary to derive a diffuse field formulation for a 2D reverberation chamber, which is presented. In this case, 1:5 scale experimental data is used for validation.",

    "abstract": "There exist three kinds of methods to determine the scattering coefficients of architectural surfaces: I) the reverberation room method, using coherent averaging of room impulse responses during sample rotation, 2) the free-field method, using coherent averaging of reflected responses during sample rotation, 3) the free-field method, using directivity correlation between reflected fields with a sample and with a flat reference surface. This paper discusses the relationship among the scattering coefficients determined by the three methods. Numerical simulation demonstrates that the two free-field methods give little different values at mid and high frequencies for a 1D sinusoidal surface, but not to the same extent for a 2D sinusoidal surface. Subsequently, this disagreement is examined in comparison with experimental results obtained by the reverberation room method and with theoretical ones. Theoretical consideration reveals that the dominant reason for the disagreement is due to different averaging processes in the three methods, which take the arithmetic mean or the quadratic mean of specular reflection factors with respect to azimuthal incidence angle, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The spatial and temporal characteristics of outdoor wind noise are contrasted to those of unsteady acoustic signals through wavelet processing of data from a 49-microphone array. The results provide clear evidence that wind noise consists of non-planar, intermittent, and weakly coherent microgusts (small turbulent disturbances) propagating across the array. By applying beamforming algorithms to signal cross coherences calculated from complex continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs), the orientations of the microgusts and broadband acoustic signals can be deduced. Wavelet-based beamformers based on the conventional (Bartlett) steering method are shown to produce the most consistent results at low signal-to-noise ratios. A Gaussian-mixture-model classifier is formulated to distinguish between blasting sounds, unsteady but persistent sounds (music), and wind noise. Signal shape features reliably distinguish the blasting and music, whereas the relatively low coherence of the wind noise distinguishes it reliably from the acoustic signals.",

First, the mode-coupling at the discontinuity between two ducts or a perforated plate and air is negligible for low frequencies. Second, all consistent models of the length correction proposed so far, for any geometries except slit-like, are similar when plotted as a function of the square root of the perforation rate (the ratio of the duct cross-section areas for ducts). These two results imply the effect of the thickness of the ducts or the perforated plate can be accounted for in the length correction expression independently from other geometric variables. A single approximate formulation for all geometries of perforations or duct discontinuities, except slit-like geometries, is proposed for practical uses.",

    "abstract": "An exact solution is developed for the sound field reflected by an infinite rigid rough surface with a periodic rectangular profile. The random-incidence scattering coefficient of this surface is derived from the numerical calculation of this solution for several directions of the incident plane wave. Scattering coefficients' values are given in this paper for a great number of configurations by varying the geometrical parameters of the periodic profile, leading to a very detailed description of the scattering properties of this kind of profile. In particular, it is shown that, when the ratio H/L of the depth to the spatial period of the profile is small, the key parameter is H/λ, the ratio of the depth of the profile to the wavelength. The random-incidence scattering coefficient tends to increase with this ratio, as long as H/λ is less than 0.3. This evolution is similar to Gaussian and sine-shaped profiles analysed in previous studies. For H/λ > 0.3, the coefficient's value oscillates while converging to an asymptotic value which depends on the width of the wells. Resonance effects have also been highlighted for periodic rectangular profiles, in particular by comparing the computed scattering coefficients with the few measured values published in the scientific literature. The scattering coefficients' values published in this paper can be introduced in room acoustics' models to characterize periodic rectangular surfaces, provided that their dimensions are much greater than the wavelength. Additional measurements and BEM computations are required to deeply analyse the influence of the finite size and the acoustical absorption of real surfaces having this profile.",

The model aggregates the sound power emitted over driving cycles which are statistically representative of real-world driving conditions. Four different driving conditions are included in the cycles, ranging from free-flowing to stop-and-go traffic conditions. The sound power levels estimated with this new approach are significantly different from the ones estimated with the mean speed approach recommended by the noise mapping guidelines, especially when traffic is congested, suggesting that the method could prove relevant for improving noise map accuracy, in particular in urban context.",

Murray Schafer's musical concept of soundscape started influencing scientific communities of acousticians in the 1970s, part of the Community Noise research has shifted its focus from noise pollution and annoyance to a more holistic perspective on sonic environments, including their positive aspects. To investigate if and how this evolution is represented in the literature of the field, the discourses of two scientific fields in acoustics are compared: the older Community Noise and the more recent Soundscape field. Specifically, the differential use of two key words (Noise and Sound) is analyzed based on the hypothesis that their meanings, which are constructed in discourse, reflect the conceptual grounding of both fields. An algorithm from computational linguistics is applied to calculate the similarity of words according to their use in a local syntactic context. It is shown that Noise and Sound are differently distributed within the discourses of both fields, thereby making explicit the semantic and conceptual differences between a noise pollution approach and a soundscape approach, which includes a more holistic concern about the quality of sonic environments and acoustic design.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops and assesses protocols for the measurement of transmission functions in lightweight buildings. A transmission function is defined that relates the spatial-average sound pressure level in a room to the structure-borne sound power injected into a wall or floor. The intention is to facilitate the prediction of structureborne sound transmission from machinery to receiving rooms. Errors in the measurement of the power input can be reduced by using a pair of accelerometers on either side of the excitation point rather than a single accelerometer on one side. Laboratory measurements on a timber-frame wall indicate that steady-state excitation using an electrodynamic shaker and transient excitation with a force hammer can be considered as equivalent. Measured transmission functions from a laboratory test construction below 500 Hz are found not to be significantly affected by the choice of excitation position being directly above a stud or in a bay. Laboratory and field results on different timber-frame walls indicate that with transient excitation using a force hammer, the transmission function is measurable in vertically-, horizontally- and diagonally-adjacent receiving rooms over the frequency range from 20 to 1 kHz. The approach has been applied in field measurements which indicate that there is potential to create databases of average transmission functions as a simplified prediction tool for sound pressure levels from service equipment in buildings.",

    "abstract": "The efficiency of future aircraft has to be increased because of the CO2 restrictions layed down by\r\nthe European Union. Two key technologies to reach this ambitious goal are a consequent light-weight\r\ndesign of future aircraft and new engine concepts like the Counter-Rotating open rotors (CROR).\r\nHowever, the combination of lightweight materials like carbon-fibre-reinforced plastics (CFRP) with\r\nCROR is acoustically demanding because of the very high sound pressures emitted by this type of\r\nengine and the poor transmission loss of CFRP structures in the lower frequency range.\r\nTherefore, this work conducts a preliminary study to improve the transmission loss of a CFRP panel\r\nexcited by a synthesised CROR pressure field in lower frequency range. As a first step, a typical\r\naircraft fuselage panel mounted in a sound transmission loss facility is equipped with actuators\r\nand sensors to implement multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) feedforward control of flexural\r\nvibration. The CFRP panel is excited via a CROR pressure field synthesised by a 112-channel loud\r\nspeaker array. The active vibration control (AVC) system is realised by accelerometers and inertial\r\nexciters. A considerable vibration reduction of the flexural vibration on the accelerometers is achieved.\r\nThe local attenuation around the accelerometers leads to a new controlled vibration pattern that\r\nradiates sound in a different way than the uncontrolled one. The difficulties in reducing the radiated\r\nsound power through the AVC system are due to low observability, the “pinning” effect, and the\r\nrestructured vibration patterns. All of these effects are studied in detail through surface vibration\r\nscans and sound intensity measurements. Additionally, the radiation resistance matrix is used to\r\nanalyse the controlled vibration patterns.",

    "abstract": "In a previous study, a robust asymmetry in global loudness was observed between rising and falling-intensity 1-kHz tones, pointing out the existence of a mechanism specifically sensitive to sound intensity direction [Ponsot et al., Attention Perception, & Psychophysics, 77(3), 907-920 (2015)]. The properties of this “direction-sensitive” mechanism are further explored in the present study, where its dependence on two stimulus characteristics, the spectral content and the intensity region is examined. In a first experiment, the global loudness of rising and falling-intensity sounds varying over 15dB ranges was assessed in a magnitude estimation task. The ramps had various spectral contents (pure tones from 250 Hz to 8 kHz and broadband noises) and were presented in different intensity-regions (from [50-65 dB SPL] to [70-85 dB SPL]). Significant asymmetries were observed across the different frequencies but not for broadband noises. In addition, a significant interaction between the direction of intensity-change and the region of intensity was observed for tones and noises. This latter effect was specifically addressed in a second experiment using an adaptive loudness-matching procedure, in which asymmetries were inferred from pairwise comparisons, both for 1-kHz tones and for white noises presented in mid and high intensity-regions. As in Exp. 1, greater asymmetries were observed for tones compared to noises; however significant asymmetries were found for noises as well. Furthermore, for both tones and noises, the size of the asymmetries was significantly decreased with the intensity-region when the sound pairs were composed of a falling followed by a rising stimulus. These results are discussed in the light of recent physiological and neuroscience studies showing that spectrally structured looming sounds are treated specially by the brain.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses acoustical characteristics, in particular, sound generation of intermittent flow regime in a horizontal pipe through an orifice, based on recorded pressure fluctuations and videos of upstream and downstream flow of the orifice. The flow regimes of interest are plug flow and slug flow, respectively, where sharp-edged and rounded entrance orifice are tested. In principle, the noise generated in the intermittent flow regime through an orifice increases with a higher gas flow rate. The pressure fluctuation spectra show a haystack configuration with a peak at a low frequency associated with a sequence of elongated gas bubbles. It demonstrates that the sound generation is predominately governed by dynamic of elongated gas bubbles in intermittent flow through the orifice. Particularly, in plug flow, an additional small hump is detected close to St = 0.2, i.e., vortex-shedding at the orifice exit contributes the sound generation in addition to the bubble dynamic. Furthermore, non-dimensional power of the downstream intermittent flow decays with St-a. The value of a increases with a higher liquid rate, and the haystack-like shape at the peak frequency widens as the gas rate increases. In plug flow, the rounded entrance orifice generates less noise by resulting in a smaller pressure drop compared to the sharp-edged orifice in general; however, it generates noise in high frequency.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasonic non-destructive testing and evaluation is one of the most common methods applied for inspection of composite materials. The measured wave velocity gives information about composite properties. Changes in the ultrasonic wave velocity or in the amplitude of the ultrasonic signal indicate possible defects. The application of a single-side access air-coupled ultrasonic technique for the investigation of the Lamb wave propagation in the composite material, and numerical simulations of the Lamb wave interaction with the de-lamination type defect, are presented here. The interaction between wave and damage is analysed in detail. The change of the Lamb wave velocity was measured in a de-laminated area of the composite material GLARE3-3/2. The influence of the de-lamination on the Lamb wave propagation velocity is investigated experimentally and numerically.",

Holford-Urusovskii's method and a hybrid plane wave decomposition - FEM method are applied to an infinite sine-shaped surface having the same profile, while the 3D BEM gives numerical results for the finite-size surface. Perfect rigidity (Neumann boundary condition) is assumed in all computations. The validity of the computations is compared and discussed with regard to the approximations involved. Finally, the measured and calculated values of the scattering coefficients are compared. A good correspondence is found, in particular concerning the overall dependence on frequency. Small deviations have however been observed, at low as well as at high frequencies. They will be explained by uncertainties in the measurements and discretisation errors in the calculations.",

    "abstract": "Insight into vocal fold and lip oscillation mechanisms is important for the understanding of phonation and the sound generation process in brass musical instruments. In general, a simplified analysis of the physical 3D fluid-structure interaction process between the living tissues and the airflow is favoured by most workers. Several simple models (lumped parameter models) have been proposed and these represent the tissues as a distribution of elastic mass(es). The mass-spring-damper system is acted on by a driving force resulting from the pressure exerted by the airstream. The results from these theoretical models have been validated 'in-vitro' using rigid or deformable replicas mounted in a suitable experimental set-up. Previous research by the authors focused on the prediction of the pressure threshold and oscillation frequency of an 'in-vitro' replica, in the absence and presence of acoustical feedback. In the theoretical model a lip or vocal fold is represented as a simple lumped mass system. The model yielded accurate prediction of the oscillation threshold and frequency. In this paper a new 'in-vitro' set-up is presented, which overcomes some of the limitations of the previous study. By the use of a digital camera synchronised with a light source and of pressure sensors, this set-up allows 1) measurement of the area of the replica opening and 2) imposition of independent initial conditions, such as height of the initial opening and internal pressure in the replica. The impact of these findings on physical modelling is discussed.",

    "abstract": "An inverse scattering technique for estimating the unknown shape of a two-dimensional acoustic obstacle, based on scattered pressure field measurements, is proposed. The pressure field is measured around the obstacle domain at distinct points when the obstacle is excited by incident plane waves with different angles of incidence. The contour of the obstacle is described by a parametric model utilizing cubic B-splines, while the obstacle boundary is considered acoustically either soft or hard. Given an estimate of the obstacle shape the scattered field is computed based on the boundary element method. Then the shape is updated iteratively by minimizing a cost function representing the discrepancy between the measured and the estimated field. To minimize the cost function the particle swarm optimization algorithm is adopted, which belongs to the general class of evolutionary algorithms. In the present study, two different operation modes of the particle swarm optimization, the asynchronous and the synchronous one, are examined and applied to simulated scattered pressure field data. The performance of the algorithm with respect to different original obstacle shapes and in cases of noisy simulated measurements is investigated.",

To clarify the nature and the origin of the choices of the ISO working group, this article firstly describes the methodological difficulties which arise when the uncertainty related to noise sampling must be estimated. Two types of difficulties occur: i) the non linearity of the mean energy criterion, which defines the basic equation used to calculate the mean sound level from a sample of N measured values of equivalent A-weighted sound pressure levels; ii) the need to provide a method both easy to use and reliable, even when the samples are of reduced size. Thus, the method finally selected by the ISO working group is presented by giving further information on its statistical bases. The estimator selected is without statistical bias and it is exact, if the assumption of a normal distribution of the measured values is valid; it is in conformity with the mean energy criterion.",

The discrimination therefore seems to be sensitive to phase in addition to spectral amplitude differences. An upperbound of T ≈ 5 μs was obtained for the threshold time constant, showing that human temporal resolution extends down to time scales shorter than found in the past.",

Seismic oceanography tries to retrieve the fine structure of the ocean water masses by processing the acoustic waves reflected in the low-contrast interfaces of fronts, eddies, internal waves or thermohaline intrusions. Since the reflectivity of such interfaces is of order 10 ―3 ―10 ―4 , the absorption capability of the numerical boundaries becomes crucial. Complex Frequency Shifted offers a better alternative to classical Perfectly Matched Layer formulation, but has not yet been extended to acoustic equations. Here, first- and second-order Complex Frequency Shifted Perfectly Matched Layers equations are proposed which can provide reflection coefficients of order 10 ―5 . Therefore, a numerical Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) scheme combined with the proposed CFS-PML equations is able to model such experiments.",

The main goal of the Montreal experiment was to provide data on the flautist's respiratory behavior during flute playing while the aim of the Paris experiment was to gather data for hydrodynamical and aeroacoustical analyses of the flute playing control parameters. The same professional standard player was studied in both experiments. Both locations included sound and mouth pressure recordings. In addition, Montreal measurements included: chest wall compartment volumes (with optoelectronic plethysmography) and the main respiratory muscle electrical activation. In Paris, additional direct measurements included lip opening area and the lip distance to the blowing hole of the flute. Global descriptions of flute playing, from the respiratory to hydrodynamical perspectives, are given. The results show that the blowing patterns are very similar, especially during performance of musical excerpts. Merging the data from the two experiments shows that the hydrodynamical control parameters are directly linked to the melodic structure of the music, independently of the pulmonary volume. This is interpreted as the result of the player's training to produce the muscular activation that is highly adapted to the pulmonary volume.",

For these two systems, we present successively the evolution of the eigenfrequencies and the nonlinear dynamical properties (phase diagrams, backbone curves). The two main results are 1) the second order evolution of the eigenfrequencies with prestresses are in agreement with a previous numerical simulation on a soundboard with the hypothesis of static large displacements and 2) the nonlinear dynamical properties of the system are modified by prestresses, and a prestressed soundboard working with large displacements seems to be technically possible.",

The proposed ultrasonic radiator is a metal cylinder with comparative radial and longitudinal geometrical dimensions, which is mechanically excited by a longitudinal sandwich ultrasonic transducer. The physical mechanism of the high power cylinder radiator lies in the intense coupled vibration between the longitudinal and radial vibrations of the cylinder with large geometrical dimensions. The equivalent circuit for the coupled vibration of the cylinder radiator is derived, and the resonance frequency equations are obtained. The coupled vibrational modes of the radiator are analyzed and the optimum condition for the intense simultaneous resonance of the longitudinal and radial vibrations is acquired. The resonance frequency, the admittance-frequency curve, the vibrational displacement distribution and the radiated acoustic field are numerically simulated and experimentally measured. It is experimentally shown that the measured results are in agreement with the analytical and numerical results, and the cylinder radiator with large geometrical dimensions can be excited into both longitudinal and radial vibration. By properly choosing its geometrical dimension, the cylinder radiator can be designed to resonate at longitudinal and radial vibration simultaneously. Therefore, it is expected to be used as high power ultrasonic radiators in ultrasonic cleaning, ultrasonic processing and ultrasonic sonochemistry.",

Monaural detection thresholds of thirteen otologically normal listeners were repeatedly determined for infrasound stimuli (sinusoids at 5 Hz and at 12 Hz) and for audio sound stimuli (sinusoids and bandlimited pink noise), separately and in presence of the respective other sound type. The measurements were performed with an adaptive 1-up-2-down 3-alternative forced-choice (3-AFC) procedure. Threshold levels for infrasound stimuli were not affected by audio sound at +5 dB sensation level (SL), but they were significantly increased by the presence of some of the audio sound stimuli presented at +50 dB SL. For example, thresholds for the detection of infrasound increased on average by around 5 dB when simultaneously presented with a pink-noise stimulus (frequency range: 250 Hz– 4000 Hz). On the other hand, the presence of infrasound with levels up to +10 dB SL did not cause any significant change in the detection thresholds for audio sound. This could be an indication that infrasound might even be more annoying in a quiet environment.",

The three governing partial differential equations of motion are solved to provide the frequency response of the piezoelectric disc using a polynomial approach. This method makes use of Legendre polynomials series to express the mechanical displacement components and the electrical potential which are introduced into the equations of motion of the piezoelectric structure. The principal advantage of this method consists of incorporating the electrical source, the boundary and continuity conditions directly into the governing equations by the use of position-dependent physical constants and by a wise choice of the polynomial expansions for the independent variables, the mechanical displacement components and the electrical potential. Both harmonic and modal analyses were studied and are presented. Numerical calculations based on the foregoing method were performed to present resonance and anti-resonance frequencies, electromechanical coupling coefficient, field profiles and electrical input admittance for PIC151 and PZT5A disc resonators with various metallization rates. The high accuracy and reliability of our approach is confirmed via a comparison of our results with their counterparts reported in literature.",

    "abstract": "The sound radiation properties of real normal modes are often used to characterise acoustic sources such as vibrating plates. The assumption of homogeneously distributed structural damping is usually made and in consequence the eigenmodes are real. With the increasing use of high-performance composite structures and the demanding requirements for acoustic comfort, damping treatments such as constrained layer damping or embedded elastomer layers may be distributed locally at some critical locations of the vibrating structure. This violates the assumption of homogeneously distributed structural damping and results in complex mode shapes. In this case, dynamics of the vibrating systems within the resonances is no longer dominated by pure standing waves, but also by a superposition with travelling waves.\r\nThis paper presents the results of a numerical study on sound radiation properties of this phenom-enon, generally known as complex modes of vibration. The finite element model of an inhomoge-neously damped plate is used to generate and investigate complex vibration patterns. The level of modal complexity of the generated complex modes is characterized by the modal collinearity index and the spatial distribution of the standing wave ratio. The fluid structure interaction is implemented by a elemental radiator approach and used for the acoustic characterisation of vibration patterns in terms of far-field radiation efficiencies and spatial distributions of sound intensity. It is shown that the eigenvector complexity can seriously affect the sound radiation properties of structural modes.",

    "abstract": "Bias flow liners are perforated walls with an additional bias flow through the perforation. A common application\r\nis their integration in walls of hot gas areas, e.g. in combustion chambers of aero engines, for cooling. It is wellknown for a long time that the bias flow additionally provides a substantial amount of acoustic damping. However, until now the detailed damping mechanisms are not fully understood. Therefore, this study takes a closer look at the energy transfer from a propagating acoustic wave to the flow velocity field, which can be measured in the vicinity of the perforated wall. Two laser-optical measurement techniques, Doppler global velocimetry with sinusoidal laser frequency modulation (FM-DGV) and acoustic particle image velocimetry (A-PIV), were applied\r\nto a bias flow liner. The time-continuous velocity signal measured by FM-DGV was used to perform a spectral\r\nanalysis of the fluctuating velocity components above the liner surface. This was done for different acousticexcitation\r\nfrequencies, where the liner exhibits different dissipation rates. After removal of the acoustic Content from the power spectral density, the hydrodynamic velocity components feature a spectral augmentation in the\r\nvicinity of the excitation frequency. The effect appears downstream of the holes. The amount of spectral Augmentation correlates to the dissipation rate of the liner at the different excitation frequencies. Consequently, a certain transfer of acoustic energy into turbulent velocity fluctuations occurs in different frequency regimes. This energy transfer is, as a matter of fact, a function of the dissipation rate of the liner. Moreover, it has a strong dependence on the spatial location with respect to the orifice of the bias flow liner.",

    "abstract": "The quality of the Ultrasonic Computed Tomography (UCT) imaging device, in term of spatial resolution, sensitivity or dynamic, is a function of the wavelength, the number of transducers, the ultrasonic field generated and the inversion algorithm. This latter factor was studied using four inversion techniques for the tomography of trees. Two new methods, Partial Least Squares method - PLS, and Layer Stripping - LS, are compared to two classical methods, Filtered Backprojection - FBP, and Simultaneous Iterative Reconstruction Technique - SIRT. An original numerical phantom of tree was used and the effects of the variation of the number of transducers and the noise level were analyzed. The PLS was found to converge slowly but reached a high performance for the reconstruction of the projection values (slowness). PLS method was also characterized by a fast computation time. However, the PLS method gave a poor image quality (high sensitivity to noise level and presence of outlier values). The main advantage of the LS method was its high robustness to the noise level. The computing time was however the weakest point of LS method. A combination of the two classic FBP-SIRT methods seemed the most suitable except for the computation time. However, an improvement of the convergence conditions of PLS method (very fast computing time; including also curved rays), with the use of SIRT method, would constitute a promising solution.",

    "abstract": "Despite many advantages of wooden buildings, low-frequency noise disturbance, mainly from human footsteps on timber floors, is a major hindrance for widespread application of wood in multi-storey buildings. In many cases the impact noise evaluations of the wooden floors according to ISO 140-7 and ISO 717-2 standards do not correspond to subjective experiences. This study aims to investigate the characteristics of footstep forces to support further studies related to discrepancies between standard evaluations and low-frequency noise disturbances in lightweight buildings. Transient footstep forces in vertical direction made by different walkers and different footwear on two floor structures were measured and compared. The vertical footstep forces were then compared with the impact forces made by a standard tapping machine. Analysis revealed that footstep forces contain large amplitudes at low frequencies (20 < f < 50) which are not included in the standard evaluation procedure. Therefore, by extending the frequency range of the standard measurements down to 20 Hz and designing an accurate adaptation term for evaluations, a better correlation between standard impact noise evaluations and acoustic performance of the lightweight buildings might be achieved.",

The target sentences were spoken by a female talker, and the masker was either the speech of two additional female talkers or continuous speech-spectrum noise. In the first of two experiments, the target was presented from a front loudspeaker and the masker was presented either from the front or from directly behind the listener. Release from masking in the front-back condition was greater for the two-talker masker than for the noise masker. In the second experiment, both target and maskers were high-pass filtered at 715 Hz, and energy below 215 Hz was added back to the target. When spatial differences were eliminated, the low-frequency energy available in the target was considerably more beneficial when the target was presented against the two-talker masker than against the noise background. The overall results suggest that spatial and spectral differences lead to perceptual distinctions that are helpful to the listener in tracking the target message in the presence of other voices.",

    "abstract": "Most traditional tyre models concern the low and middle frequency ranges. For improved accuracy in tyre/road\r\ninteraction models it is necessary to include higher frequencies. Often only the radial direction is included, although\r\nthe tangential direction may be important, especially studying stick slip motion in the contact between tyre\r\nand road surface. Designing accurate and efifcient models requires insight into the behaviour of the tyre structure\r\nat higher frequencies to make the models as complete as necessary without creating tools that are computationally\r\ntoo costly. To add insight to this area, experimental studies were done on four different tyres with the same\r\ninternal design but with different tread patterns. Point mobilities were measured and compared with two different\r\ntyre models, a two-layer plate model based on the elastic field equations and an orthotropic plate model. The\r\nresults of this study underline the importance of the local deformation when there are forces that act with small\r\nexcitation areas on the tread. Adequate consideration of the tread properties in the tyre/road interaction models\r\nis thus of extreme importance to obtain the correct local contact force distribution. This is most important for the\r\ntangential driving point mobility. Tread patterns are shown mainly to modify the flexural stiffness in comparison\r\nto smooth tyres, while block resonances are not expected to be located in the frequency range in which tyre/road\r\nnoise is important.",

These indicators are calculated for a study population on the basis of maps of the noise measure DENL, using DENL-annoyance relationships. An approach is described for comparing the effect of noise reduction, using the above mentioned noise annoyance indicators. For the municipality of Leiden, the Netherlands, the results from applying this approach indicate that the calculated efficacy of a given noise abatement policy depends to some extent on the noise annoyance indicator that is used. A lower limit of 55 dB for the noise calculations has been suggested by the EU Directive on environmental noise. This leads to a large underestimation of the noise annoyance indicators and may affect priority setting regarding noise abatement. Beside the four noise annoyance measures, two other noise quality indicators are considered: the percentage of people being highly sleep disturbed (p HS) and (AREA50) - the percentage area where DENL exceeds 50 dB. The results for Leiden show that each of these two indicators put more focus on noise from motorways than the other noise indicators considered. © S. Hirzel Verlag.",

What effect does the visual location of an object have on a participant’s expectations of that object’s auditory stimulus? Several studies have looked at the phenomenon in recent years, but these studies rely on static images, speech signals, or photographs alone to represent the visual scene. Building on these studies, our aim is to propose a novel testing method using monochromatic compositing (blue-screen technique) to locate a musical performance recorded in a studio in a number of virtual acoustical environments being assessed by a subject. In this study, the participant is asked to match two distinct acoustical parameters, Early-to-Late Reverberant Energy Ratio and Reverberation Time, of two musical performances in five contrasting visual environments according to his or her expectations of how the room should sound given its visual appearance. This study reveals participant resiliency in the presence of forced auditoryvisual mismatch; participants are able to adjust the presented acoustic modeling algorithm in a statistically similar way despite randomized starting values for the monitored parameters. Subjective results of the experiment are presented along with objective measurements for verification.",

Previously a three-dimensional contact model was presented [1], which makes it possible to calculate the time-varying radial contact forces at the contact patch. The contact forces result from the tyre/road interaction in rolling conditions. Knowing the contact forces and the vibrational properties of the tyre structure, the vibrational velocity field can be calculated. This paper describes how to calculate the vibrational field on the tyre structure, especially in the wavenumber-frequency domain. The study of the static deformation of the tyre under rolling conditions and of the Doppler effect for a periodic excitation of the tyre gives some good understanding on the way the vibrational field is built up. Additionally, a study of the effect of the wave content on sound radiation is made and numerical results show that only a limited number of modes contribute to the total sound radiated by tyre structure vibrations, and that higher-order modes can be discarded.",

The approximations given can be used to calculate the sound field in and around the focal point. The calculation method is verified with an experiment. In the focal point the pressure depends on the wavelength. The width of the peak pressure is also related to the wavelength. For small wavelengths the amplification is high but the area is small, while for lower frequencies the amplification is less, but the area is larger.

Experiments have shown that the BETF for gerbils in free space, regularly termed the head related transfer function (HRTF), contains a single notch in the ultrasonic range, while the BETF for a gerbil standing on a solid surface contains several notches at much lower frequency due to comb-filtering effects. In this research, the BETF for a model gerbil geometry is computed using a boundary element method (BEM). A parallel implementation of the BEM that includes the CHIEF regularization scheme is applied. The gerbil's BETFs for various source elevations and distances in the free-field and in the presence of a solid surface are computed. Comparisons with gerbil HRTF measurements show good agreement. The reflection due to the solid surface is shown to provide an acoustic cue for source elevation as well as source distance. It is demonstrated that the full variation of the BETF with source location can only be captured through a simulation that can account for both the solid surface and the gerbil and their combined influence on the sound field.",

Thus, the signal observables are the set of the parameters of the appropriate distributions at the various levels of the signal decomposition. In this work an inversion procedure based on a Genetic Algorithm and the statistical characterization of the acoustic signal, is described. The quality of a certain population of candidate model parameters (properties of the water columns and/or the sea-bed) is evaluated using the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) of the wavelet sub-band coefficient distributions, between the measured and simulated acoustic signals. Following an appropriate regeneration procedure, the final population is described by an a-posteriori statistical distribution of the model parameters, indicating among the others the possibility of reliable inversion of these parameters, with respect to the specific inversion procedure. Very good inversion results have been observed in simulated shallow water environments with noise free and noisy data.",

    "abstract": "The room acoustic design of the low frequency characteristics of control and recording rooms in studio facilities still poses a challenging task to acoustic designers and consultants. Due to the low density of eigenmodes at frequencies below the Schroeder frequency, the statistical assumptions underlying geometrical acoustics theory do not hold for this frequency range. Consequently simulation methods such as 'raytracing' or the 'mirror-image-method' cannot supply reliable results here. On the other hand analytical solutions for the wave equation of the sound field in enclosed spaces are generally restrained to rather simple room geometries and boundary conditions. Therefore numerical methods such as the finite element method (FEM) are promising contenders for the simulation of low frequency sound fields in arbitrarily shaped rooms with complex boundary conditions. In the course of this study the FEM was used to simulate the low frequency sound field in the control room of a recording studio in Munich, Germany. The results are compared to measurements in the real room in order to evaluate the performance of the simulation. Special attention is paid to a realistic representation of the acoustic characteristics of the room boundaries in the model and the limitations of an impedance approach are discussed. It is made clear, that the Achilles' heel of room acoustic FEM simulations appears to be the realistic boundary specification and that further work has to focus on the identification or development of robust and reliable measurement or modelling techniques to determine the acoustic characteristics of the various materials on the room boundaries.",

    "abstract": "The conventional method of measuring the insertion loss of a partition relies on an assumption of the sound field in the source room being diffuse combined with the classical relation between the spatial average of the mean square pressure in the source room and the incident sound power per unit area; and it has always been regarded as impossible to measure the sound power that is incident on a wall directly. This paper examines a new method of determining this quantity from sound pressure measurements at positions on the wall using 'statistically optimised near field acoustic holography' (SONAH). The purpose is to examine whether one should use a correction similar to the well-known 'Waterhouse correction' when the incident sound power is deduced from the sound pressure in the source room.",

It is simply an integral over the vibrating tyre, of the product of the known velocity by the full Green function which takes into account all the multiple reflections and diffraction between tyre, ground and car body. This Green function can be calculated by means of a beam tracing program named ICARE -which can deal with curved surfaces and multiple diffraction. This approach makes the link between tyre models and reception points well outside the car. In order to deal with small scale phenomena, close to contact, a combined use of BEM and beam tracing is showed to bypass the limitations of both geometrical and BEM approaches. PACS no.43.28.Js",

The hypothesis of the present investigation is that the subjective judgment of impact noise is more annoying if the source position can be localized; lightweight structures have a more localized radiation than heavy structures. For the heavy structures the reverberant vibration field is dominant, therefore having a distributed radiation. A listening test is used to assess the subjective annoyance, using simulated binaural room impulse responses, with sources being a moving point source or a non-moving surface source, and rooms being a room with a reverberation time of 0.5 s or an anechoic room. The paper concludes that no strong effect of the source localization on the annoyance can be found.",

The so-called Butterworth impulse was generated in a standing wave tube with a flat frequency response over a wide frequency range. The inverse filtering principle was adopted to compensate for the loudspeaker frequency response at higher and lower frequencies. Two types of acoustical material and structure were employed: glassfibre material and tube exit. Through comparison with the traditional, well-established transfer function method, it can be seen that the new method can be as accurate as the established method. The main errors of this new method result from the accuracy of the measurement of the amplitude of the reflection coefficient of the sample.",

As the acoustic sources on a car reach lower sound levels, special attention is granted to acoustical comfort. While the knowledge of mechanisms behind road noise is growing, its perception by the driver remains relatively unexplored. In this study, a sensory science technique - the classical sensory profile - is applied to obtain a description of the internal road noise by quantitative perceptual criteria. Seven consumer cars (from Renault, Fiat, Peugeot, and Toyota) were driven under four well-defined conditions varying in speed and road surface. Twenty-one typical road noise recordings were presented to a panel of five experts in acoustics. Twelve listening sessions of three hours, individually and in group, led to a list of 15 relevant perceptual descriptors, such as rough aspect. The performance of the listeners was tested statistically: their repeatability, their ability to discriminate the sounds and the inter-subject agreement. Sufficient agreement was observed across the listeners for 10 of the 15 descriptors, which would constitute the perceptual basis for internal automotive road noise. Through multiple linear regression, strong correlations were found between the associated perceptual dimensions and psychoacoustic properties of the sound samples. The findings from this study are summarized in a sensory grid to assist the test drivers in the evaluation of road noise sound character, and a predictive tool for sound quality evaluation based on correlations between perceptual dimensions and calculated sound metrics.",

It appears that the proposed method works with acceptable accuracy (roughly ±5 dB) in the frequency range from 1 kHz to 10 kHz. At lower frequencies, leakage is responsible for a high variability (up to 20 dB) of the sound pressure generated in the ear canal (and thus at the ear drum as well in this frequency range). In addition, it was observed that predictions based on ear canal models obtained from computer tomography scans were less accurate than predictions based on the method proposed in this paper. As the residual ear canals of the temporal bones used in this study were rather short, these results should be confirmed in vivo.",

The used artificial source is placed in front of the mouth and in front of the chest. Three different synthesized test signals are used: two narrow band signals and one broadband click signal. Impulse responses were recorded in an anechoic room for each individual participant, and listening tests were carried out afterwards by playing post-processed individualized signals using headphones. Results show better performance with the sound source at the chest position in both experiments, with the difference in performance most prominent in the board size identification test. In the board lateralization test, the broadband click results in eminent better performance over narrow band click signals. This suggest that broadband and chest positioned signals seem favorable over narrow band and mouth positioned signals",

Motivated by the rising field of sensing information in (smart) cities, we present current perspectives and a methodological update on the acoustic-based solution of recognition problems in a complex urban real-world scenario. In particular, we examine a static and a sequential approach for the automatic recognition of a cyclist's route between fixed endpoints, the route direction, and the route progress, solely based on the audio data recorded with a cell-phone attached to the cyclist. To this end, we introduce the freely available 'Graz Cell-phone Cycle Corpus extended' ( GC 3 + ) that consists of more than 25 h of GPS-annotated audio material recorded in the southern urban area of the city of Graz, Austria. Promising recognition results confirm basic feasibility of acoustic geo-sensing in an urban environment. The approach's theoretical potential of being generalised to support the solution of position tracking problems on a multi-dimensional urban grid gives reason for the implementation of acoustic geo-sensing methodology in a number of real-world applications.",

Besides studying ultrasound pulse velocity (UPV), other ultrasound parameters were included such as FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and attenuation, neither of which being commonly studied in this kind of work. The experimental study was carried out on pork loin pieces with 3 cm thickness, using a pair of transducers in through-transmission mode (frequency range up to 100 kHz), and another one in pulseecho mode (frequency range up to 1000 kHz). The ultrasound parameters studied showed good discrimination between samples in the different conditions of measurement and cooking. These results consolidate ultrasound testing as a non-destructive method well suited to this kind of meat product, both raw and cooked.",

    "abstract": "The IEC 60318-4 ear simulator is used to measure the insertion loss (IL) of earplugs in the ear canal of an acoustical test fixture (ATF) and is designed to represent an average acoustic impedance (in a reference plane) of the human ear. The ear simulator is usually modeled using a lumped parameter model (LPM) which has frequency limitations and inadequately accounts for the thermo-viscous effects in the simulator. The simulator numerical models that can better deal with the thermo-viscous phenomena often lack essential geometric details. Most related studies also suffer from the lack of experimental validation of the models. Therefore, a transfer matrix (TM) model of the IEC 60318-4 simulator is proposed based on a direct assessment of its geometric dimensions. Such a model is of particular interest for designing artificial ear simulators. The variability in the simulator impedance due to the geometric uncertainties is quantified using the Monte Carlo method. The TM model is validated using i) a finite element (FE) model of the simulator and ii) impedance measurements with a sound intensity probe. It is found to better describe the simulator impedance above 3 kHz compared to the LPM. The TM model is then coupled to a FE model of an occluded ATF ear canal to simulate the IL of an earplug in the frequency range [100 Hz, 10 kHz]. In the model, the simulator is considered as a cylindrical cavity terminated by an equivalent tympanic impedance which is determined from the TM model to simulate the sound pressure measured at the real microphone position (not at the reference plane) in the ATF ear canal. The simulated IL is validated against i) that obtained with a complete FE model of the corresponding system and ii) measurements using an ATF. The TM model is shown to better agree with the simulator FE model than the LPM above 6 kHz regarding the earplug IL simulated using this method.",

Room acoustical parameters according to ISO 3382 were measured for the unoccupied and simulated for the occupied condition. In comparison with European proscenium stage theaters, they have lower room heights in the auditorium, with usually only one upper tier, and no high stage house for movable scenery. The lower volume per seat results in lower reverberation times, The wooden construction and the audience seating arrangement on wooden straw mats on the floor instead of upholstered seats leads to a mostly flat frequency response up to 4 kHz, resulting in an excellent speech intelligibility, as documented by values for definition (D 50 ) and the speech intelligibility index (STI). The acoustical conditions support the dynamic acting space created by pathways extending the stage from the front through the audience to the rear of the auditorium. They allow great contrasts in the perceived acoustical proximity depending on the selected acting position, and support a high degree of immersion of the audience into the dramatic action.",

This conclusion remains valid when the skin and the trim panel are mechanically connected by means of four vibration isolators, and when the cavity is filled with thermal insulation blankets. It also appears that, in case of an active cavity noise control system, there exists an almost linear relation between the reduction of the acoustic potential energy in the cavity and the reduction of the radiated sound power. The optimised control system performs much better than a control system with sensors and actuators in arbitrarily chosen positions. * Research Assistant of the Fund for Scientific Research Flanders (Belgium) (F.W.O.)",

    "abstract": "Acoustic pulse reflectometry is a useful non-invasive technique for measuring the input impulse response, input impedance and internal dimensions of ducts. A sound pulse is injected into the duct under investigation and the resultant reflections are recorded. Suitable analysis of the reflections then yields the input impulse response, from which both the input impedance of the duct and its cross-sectional area as a function of distance can be calculated. However, an input impulse response measurement made using acoustic pulse reflectometry generally contains an offset. Unless this offset is removed, the application of a bore reconstruction algorithm results in a calculated duct profile which expands or contracts spuriously. In this paper, the offset introduced into reflectometry measurements is shown to consist of both constant and time-varying components. The origins of these DC and time-varying offsets are examined and methods of preventing or removing them are investigated. Finally, improved accuracy bore reconstructions, calculated from input impulse response measurements where any offset has been eliminated, are presented.",

Previous auditory perception experiments have shown that listeners are generally able to discriminate differences in the size and the speed of rolling wooden balls.

Recorded sounds of rolling balls were manipulated by merging the temporal characteristics of one sound with the spectral characteristics of another. In this way 16 stimuli were obtained from four original recordings, which were presented pairwise. If listeners were asked to indicate the larger ball from two sounds, they had a preference for the sound with the spectral content of a large ball. If listeners had to indicate the faster ball from two sounds, they preferred the sound with the spectral content of a small ball, and, to a lesser degree, with the spectral content of a fast rolling ball. The temporal information in the sounds was of minor importance for the range of stimuli used in these experiments.",

A set of rules is proposed for controlling a two-mass physical model through activation levels of laryngeal muscles. The proposed rules convert muscle activities into physical quantities such as fold adduction, mass, thickness, depth, stiffness. Numerical simulations of the glottal model, controlled through this set of rules, are used in order to construct a codebook between muscular activations and a set of relevant acoustic parameters of the voice source, such as foundamental frequency, open quotient, speed quotient, and return quotient. The paper explores the potentialities of the derived codebook for the control of the glottal model, and its applications to voice source parameter matching. A fitting procedure is developed, and it is shown that the parameters of the physiologically-controlled two-mass model can be matched to fit target signals (glottal flow pulses) with good accuracy.",

The result is that listeners make more sit identifications. When the context's reverberation is also increased, to approach the level in the test word, extrinsic perceptual compensation is observed, so that the number of listeners' sir identifications reduces to a value similar to that found with minimal reverberation. Thus far, compensation effects have only been observed with speech or speech-like contexts in which the short-term spectrum changes as the speaker's articulators move. The results reported here show that some noise contexts with static short-term spectra can also give rise to compensation. From these experiments it would appear that compensation requires a context with a temporal envelope that fluctuates to some extent, so that parts of it resemble offsets. These findings are consistent with a rather general kind of perceptual compensation mechanism; one that is informed by the 'tails' that reverberation adds at offsets. Other results reported here show that narrow-band contexts do not bring about compensation, even when their temporal-envelopes are the same as those of the more effective wideband contexts. These results suggest that compensation is confined to the frequency range occupied by the context, and that in a wideband sound it might operate in a 'band by band' manner.",

    "abstract": "This study is concerned with sound localisation abilities in water, where the cues for localisation are theoretically severely altered. The main goal of the study was to understand the discrepancy between the poor localisation abilities predicted by the degree of cues alteration and the relatively good performance empirically measured in past investigations. Nine experienced divers performed 8-alternative forced-choice identification tests in open water, with auditory targets presented both in the frontal and rear parts of the horizontal plane. Targets were trains of 300-ms bursts with 25-ms rise/decay times. Bursts were either pure tones (0.4, 1, 6 or 8 kHz) or white noise. With 0.4-kHz tones, the subjects exhibited very accurate left-right distinction and acceptable azimuth resolution. Four subjects made frequent front-back reversals. Also, a bias of the responses towards the median axis was observed in 24% of the data. Six subjects tested with head motion either restricted or free all showed a clear drop of front-back reversals due to head motion. Three subjects tested with all target frequencies exhibited correct localisation accuracy with the white noise, again associated with frequent front-back reversals for two of them. With the 1-, 6- and 8-kHz tones, however, results varied more between individuals. The same three subjects were tested with both the head-conduction and the ear-conduction pathways available, with the head-conduction path blocked off by the wear of a neoprene hood, and with the ear-conduction path blocked off by the wear of neoprene earplugs, in random order. They showed a strong degradation due to the covering of the ear-conduction pathway.",

    "abstract": "A solution is developed for the acoustic radiation from two concentric cylindrical shells which are connected by a set of periodic annular plates, and the outer of which is coated with a viscoelastic perforated layer. All the perforations in the coating have an identical cavity configuration with variable (thickness-dependent) cross-sections. The classical theory of Kennard type and the linear acoustic field equation are employed to simulate the two shells and their entrained fluid, respectively. It is assumed that only membrane motions exist in the annular plates, based on which a two dimensional membrane theory is employed to derive their reactive forces. The viscoelastic perforated coating is divided into many sub-layers each has an equivalent complex wave number by using a thick walled cylinder model. Transfer matrix method is then used to develop the relation between the quantities (velocity and pressure) at the inner and outer surfaces of the coating. The solution is found by using Fourier wave number transforms, and the stationary phase approximation is used to find an expression for the far field pressure. Comparison of numerical results for the two concentric infinite cylindrical shells without the outer coating to measured data from a cabin model is in good agreement. Far field acoustic pressure results are presented for two cylindrical shells with and without the viscoelastic perforated coating, which indicate that the viscoelastic perforated coating can effectively reduce the radiated sound pressure at middle and high frequency ranges. The influences of the coating parameters on far field acoustic pressure are also discussed.",

Classical psycho-acoustic parameters as loudness, sharpness and roughness have been used for this task, resulting in significant improvements in the annoyance caused in humans, especially for diesel engine noises. However, roughness sensation has been well defined and measured in modulated narrowband signals, but not in broadband noises. Here a new model of engine noise production is proposed in order to relate some of its features with the roughness perceived. The model is based on complex cepstrum analysis of the real engine noise, a technique widely used in speech processing, but not explored yet for psycho-acoustic sensations. A noise synthesizer is build for performing subjective tests and detect model parameters related to roughness perception. Results have shown that peak amplitudes range (represented by a certain amplitude modulation index of the impulses) is linearly related to roughness perceived, whereas frequency modulation index of the same impulse train has a weak influence on roughness sensation.",

The cyclostationary near-field acoustic holography method uses the cyclic spectrum density function as the reconstruction variance instead of the spectrum or the power spectrum density, which decomposes the carrier wave and modulating wave in the appropriate cyclic frequency. The reconstructed CSD shows the distribution of the modulating wave of cyclostationary sources and supplies more cyclostationary acoustical information than the conventional NAH. In the present work, the theory of the cyclostationary NAH combined with the wave superposition is introduced, which can be used for the arbitrarily shaped cyclostationary sources. A numerical simulation and a speaker experiment are employed to validate this WSA-based cyclostationay NAH method. The results of the simulation show great agreement between the reconstruction and the analytical value.

Waveguide filter elements model frequency-dependent losses and delay (dispersion) occurring during propagation and at any boundary or discontinuity producing reflected and transmitted waves. In this work, a technique is described for estimating wind instrument waveguide elements from several measurements of the system's impulse response, each measurement taken with the system having incrementally varying termination/boundary conditions. The measured impulse responses yield sequences of multiple arrivals from which estimates of waveguide element transfer functions may be formed. The measurement and post signal processing technique is explored using simple structures consisting of cylindrical and conical tubes, as these are well described theoretically and provide a basis for validating measured data. All waveguide elements necessary for modeling typical wind instrument bores are collected here, each presented with a theoretical description and accompanying measurement. The measurement and processing system is then shown to yield data closely matching the theory, thus providing confidence that the technique may be extended to accurately measure structures which are more difficult to describe theoretically, such as an instrument's flaring bell.",

The response to pure-tone excitation, generated by an open vented box, was recorded along two lines parallel to the walls. A numerical model for the radiating sound source was used to determine the strength of the source and its center. The region in the chamber where the deviation from free-field conditions was less than the allowed 1.5 dB was determined, based on the experimental data. Its was established that even above the cut-off frequency, deviations greater than the allowed 1.5 dB occurred.

During computation a detailed description of meteorological conditions takes a lot of time but principally the needed meteorological data are not available in most cases.

Therefore the two important sound propagation effects for free sound propagation (atmospheric attenuation and geometrical spreading) are investigated for sources in higher altitudes. A ray-tracing algorithm is used to model the refractions of sound due to wind, wind gradients, and temperature gradients. The atmospheric attenuation is calculated by ISO 9613-1. The used meteorological conditions based on the parameters, i.e. temperature, wind, and relative humidity, from one year radiosonde measurements taken at the meteorological observatory Lindenberg in Germany.\r\nAll in all, for long-term periods all these calculated average sound pressure levels and the levels calculated for standardised atmospheric conditions are similar in size. Furthermore, common noise calculations overestimate the meteorological influence on sound propagation slightly.",

The oscillating part of the rate of heat release is modelled by a flame transfer function, i.e. the frequency-domain ratio of heat release rate to acoustic velocity. An equation for the complex eigenfrequencies is derived. Its solutions give the frequencies and growth rates of the acoustic modes in the tube. The approach is then used to study the effect of several flame transfer functions on the stability behaviour of the Rijke tube. The role of several parameters in these flame transfer functions is examined. Finally, the possibility is discussed whether one can discriminate between these transfer functions from measurements of the stability behaviour and frequencies in a simple Rijke tube set-up.",

This study concentrates on a practical method of predicting the installed structure-borne sound power from mechanical installations in lightweight buildings. The structure-borne sound power is a function of source activity, source mobility and receiver mobility, and all three quantities must be known to some degree. It is rarely practical to consider all transmission paths individually and in detail, and therefore, reduced data sets and less computationally demanding procedures are proposed. The paper examines how source data can be used to assemble single equivalent values, using spatial averages and magnitudes. Single equivalent values of receiver mobility also are proposed for lightweight, point-connected ribbed plate constructions. In case studies, the single equivalent values are used for predicting the structure-borne power in the installed condition.",

    "abstract": "Noise and vibration are two of the physical contaminants most commonly found in the construction sector. They can cause several negative effects on the workers and may have a very important influence on people's health and well-being. Furthermore, the perception of the noise can influence on the awareness of the risks the workers are expose to. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the noise and vibration exposure and to develop mechanisms for studying and proposing preventive solutions. A number of representative measurements have been carried out using a sound level meter, a dosimeter, a vibration meter and a HATS to collect data from non-specialized workers of the construction sector, which are the most exposed to noise and vibration due to the different tasks involving machines they are in charge of. Analysis of the most important levels and indexes have been done with those data, and afterwards, they have been compared to the limits imposed by the different current regulations. This work has studied the noise and vibration levels which the workers of the construction sector are exposed to, as well as the perception of the measured noises by workers and another population. The noise and vibration levels the measured workers are exposed to are extremely high and potentially dangerous for their health. The levels surpass the legal limits by far. The construction workers may be in danger due to high levels of noise and vibrations, depending on the machines they use. The workers are not aware of such danger but they perceive the levels are high and show their discomfort through the subjective tests of perception. Preventive measures should be compulsorily implemented.",

A theoretical model for predicting the impact sound level for a decoupled floor structure, which has no rigid mechanical connections between the floor and the ceiling, is developed. An analytical method has been implemented, where a spatial Fourier transform method as well as the Poisson’s sum formula is applied to model transformed plate displacements. Radiated sound power was calculated from these displacements and normalized sound pressure levels were calculated in one-third octave frequency bands. The predicted results from the model are compared with the results from the experiments on the decoupled floor-ceiling construction. The results gave agreements in line with comparisons regarding previous model. The effect of introducing beam-plate moment in the model is studied and is found to be dependent on frequency, showing significant improvement in predicting impact sound level at high frequency region.",

A previous study has been done (see [3]), but with a very simple boundary condition for the mouth, corresponding to an ideal situation assuming that the acoustic pressure is zero at the entrance of the resonator. In this work, we have taken into account a more realistic model, describing the coupling effects between the jet and the pipe. The jet is obtained by blowing through a flue channel and formed by flow separation at the flue exit, and finally directed towards a sharp edge, called the labium. The resulting structure can then be seen as a nonlinear oscillator coupled with the pipe which is a linear acoustic resonator. The pressure obtained through this model has been compared to the pressure measured on an actual instrument, a recorder closed at its end. A modal analysis is then performed using the linearized boundary conditions which can also be used to compute the suitable blowing pressure and the suitable pipe length to obtain a desired fundamental frequency or equivalently a desired pitch. This will constitute the basis of our control algorithm. A possible musical application of such a device is to build a flue instrument with a pitch independent of the dynamical level.",

    "abstract": "The most common application in wireless networks still is telephony. Speech quality not only depends on quality and coverage provided by the wireless services, but also on the terminals (mobile phones, wireless devices, IP-terminals), which are often the bottleneck with respect to speech quality and echo performance, especially in non-ideal situations. New testing procedures are required which allow a reliable and objective determination of speech quality as perceived by the user and which are mainly based on human perception. Such procedures can be used to optimize terminal and network characteristics as well as to define limits for performance characteristics. This publication describes new types of perceptually based objective speech quality assessment methods targeted at speech quality in the presence of background noise and echo performance of modern narrow- and wideband terminals by giving an output score similar to subjective tests. The models, their calculation steps, their correlation to the underlying subjective tests and applications are presented.",

    "abstract": "The aim of sound synthesis methods is to auralize the sound of a physical sound source in the way it is perceived by a listener at a particular location. Most existing synthesis methods start with a source - transmission path -receiver (s-t-r) model to predict spectral characteristics of the sound at the receiver location (e.g. a time-frequency spectrum). To define such a s-t-r model, an adequate representation of the physical sound source is crucial for achieving high quality sound syntheses. In the mid-frequency range, equivalent source models composed of a limited number of elementary substitute sources are usually applied. These equivalent models overcome many of the disadvantages of other sound source reconstruction models. However, quantification of the elementary substitute sources is difficult. After propagation along the transmission path and based upon the predicted spectral characteristics, the sound synthesis methods then synthesize an audible sound at the receiver location. This paper presents a numerical study on the performance of different equivalent source models and quantification techniques. It is shown that the recently developed inverse quantification approach based on acoustic particle velocities can be a fast and sufficient accurate alternative for techniques based on velocity and acceleration on the source surface or on acoustic pressures at indicator positions around the source. Furthermore, guidelines are given to select the number of equivalent substitute sources.",

    "abstract": "Ray tracing (RT) and mirror image source methods (MISM), widely used in room acoustics and in computing noise propagation, fail naturally when diffraction becomes important, especially in 'free field' (cities). Therefore, the goal is to extend these methods by an edge diffraction module, also for higher orders. Known analytical approaches for the diffraction at a wedge may be combined with the MISM but are inefficient. A direct combination with RT is not possible as random emitted particles never pass edges exactly. In 1986, the author proposed a sound particle diffraction model based on Heisenbergs uncertainty relation (UR) introducing the concept of a 'deflection angle probability density function' (DAPDF) ('the closer the by-pass distance at an edge, the stronger the deflection effect'). This heuristic model had given very good agreements with the expected transfer functions of the half-infinite screen and the slit but has the deficit of a missing analytical derivation. To overcome this, the author tried to derive such a DAPDF from the known Fresnel-Kirchhoff theory of diffraction at the half-infinite screen. This succeeded by assuming that the energy flow around the edge is simply cut off by a vertical shift of the screen: the 'hypothesis of the shifted screen'. But this solution was published only very briefly and only in German 1993. It is the aim of this paper to present here for the first time the full derivation. The agreements at the screen are very good but the model fails at a slit (two edges), hence, cannot be modularized as desired. Meanwhile (in 2006 and 2007) the UR-based diffraction model performed some new promising results. The deficiencies and chances of the two models are discussed.",

Conventional countermeasures include the use of large vent bores or open fittings on the one hand and fittings reaching as deep as the bony part of the ear canal on the other hand. A more recent approach is the use of active control where the disturbing own-voice sounds originating from bone conduction are sensed with a microphone in the ear canal and then attenuated by means of destructive interference. This paper describes a prototype implementation of this approach along with an objective and subjective validation of the occlusion effect reduction in N = 10 normal-hearing subjects. As regards the objective evaluation, the average active occlusion reduction achieved within the two octaves from 125 Hz to 500 Hz over all subjects was Sm = -8.2 dB (+- \\sigma = 2.2 dB). As regards the subjective evaluation, all subjects reported satisfaction with the naturalness of their own voice when a combination of aided sound and active control was presented. The subjective rating of this combined effect was significantly larger than the sum of the individual effects when only aided sound or only active control was presented (p<0.004). These findings indicate that active control has the potential to substantially improve the acceptance of the perception of a hearing aid user's own voice, especially when only minimal venting is applied.",

The corpus of sounds, recordings of the interior of different cars, moving at the same motor speed, and having the same price range, consists of sounds with similar timbre, produced by similar sources, in order to let participants focus on sound properties, rather than source differences. Two types of perceptual structures (multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis) were derived from data obtained with two types of tasks (pairwise comparisons and sorting tasks), and compared. In the non-loudness-normalized corpus, loudness was the main factor explaining participant's judgements for both tasks. Only in the loudness-normalized corpus did auditory attributes emerge that characterize the timbre of interior car sounds. In addition, tasks involving sorting data were found to be less appropriate than pairwise data to provide interpretable continuous dimensions.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of a gas-filled microbubble encapsulated by a viscoelastic fluid shell immersed in a Newtonian liquid and subject to an external pressure field is theoretically studied.The problem is formulated by considering a nonlinear Oldroyd type constitutive equation to model the rheological behavior of the fluid shell.Heat and mass transfer across the surface bubble have been neglected but radiation losses due to the compressibility of the surrounding liquid have been taken into account.Bubble collapse under sudden increase of the external pressure as well as nonlinear radial oscillations under ultrasound fields are investigated.The numerical results obtained show that the elasticity of the fluid coating intensifies oscillatory collapse and produces a strong increase of the amplitudes of radial oscillations which may become chaotic even for moderate driving pressure amplitudes.The role played by the elongational viscosity has also been analyzed and its influence on both, bubble collapse and radial oscillations, has been recognized.According to the theoretical predictions provided in the present work, a microbubble coated by a viscoelastic fluid shell is an oscillating system that, under acoustic driving, may experience volume oscillations of large amplitude, being, however, more stable than a free bubble.Thus, it could be expected that such a system may have a suitable behavior as an echogenic agent.",

    "abstract": "The long-term goal of this project is to investigate the differences in the ``feel'' of a violin that can be perceived through the left hand, across a certain range of instruments. The approach taken in this paper involves comparing amplitudes of vibration at the neck of several violins with violinists' sensitivity to vibration in their left hand. Absolute thresholds for vibration detection were measured on violinists holding an isolated vibrating violin neck, which allowed to simulate the real playing condition, in particular the pressure and the position of the hand on the neck. Using a standard alternative forced choice procedure, measurements were done as a function of frequency in the skin sensitivity range 200-900 Hz. Vibration levels of the necks were measured across a set of instruments, using a laser vibrometer and an impulse excitation at the bridge. Results show that the neck vibration levels are overall above the perceptual thresholds for most violins and at most frequencies below 900 Hz but the relative difference between the two curves can vary a lot from violin to violin. This comparison presumes the existence of vibrotactile feedback at the left hand as a potential perceived signature of the violin played.",

    "abstract": "It has been previously shown that skyhook damping can be used to actively reduce vibration transmission between masses in supercritical 2 degree of freedom (dof) systems. The method is based on measuring the absolute velocity of the clean body, multiplying it by a negative gain, and feeding the result back to a force actuator reacting between the clean and the dirty body. This approach results in a broadband vibration isolation. For subcritical 2 dof systems this is normally not possible due to control stability problems. These stability problems can be mitigated by including an appropriate amount of relative damping between the clean and the dirty body in addition to the absolute damping. This approach has been referred to as blended velocity feedback. In this paper the application of the blended velocity feedback on subcritical 2 dof systems is investigated using an auto-tuning controller. An algorithm to gradually change the relative and absolute feedback gains until the active isolation performance reaches its best by applying an optimal combination of the two gains is applied. There is only one such optimal combination which minimises the kinetic energy of the clean body, and consequently the performance surface has a global minimum. Furthermore there are no local minima so a trial and error algorithm could be applied. Although in the frequency domain finding the minimum of the performance surface is straightforward, in the time domain the determining the clean body mean squared velocity can take a considerable time per step of the algorithm, such that the convergence of the trial and error algorithm can be relatively slow. It is hypothesized that more sophisticated algorithms may speed-up the convergence but this would be at cost of using a model-based approach.",

    "abstract": "For the next generation of aircraft, new engine and fuselage concepts are investigated because of the increasing\r\ndemand for fuel efficiency and the CO2/NOx restrictions declared by the European Union. A lightweight design\r\nof civil aircraft combined with efficient engines like the counter-rotating open rotor (CROR) is a key technology\r\nto reach these ambitious goals. Especially in the lower frequency range, where the CROR blade-passing frequencies\r\n(BPF’s) are dominating the acoustic response, the transmission loss of lightweight structures is typically\r\npoor. Active control techniques was tested on plates and beams to increase the system performance in terms of\r\nglobal vibration or sound power reduction. Yet to the authors’ best knowledge, only very little work has been\r\nconducted to establish sensor or actuator position optimisation on a complex aircraft structure.\r\nThe presented paper investigates the potential of a sensor position optimisation on a Dornier 728 experimental\r\naircraft of the German Aerospace center (DLR). This experimental aircraft provides a real fuselage structure and\r\nthe multi-sinusoidal CROR excitation is induced by a 112-channel loud speaker array. The system model of a\r\nfuselage segment is experimentally identified, a sensor optimisation is established and compared to empirically\r\nplaced sensor configurations. The sensor optimisation includes the simulation of an multiple-input multipleoutput\r\n(MIMO) active feedforward vibration controller and the resulting sound radiating vibration patterns.\r\nIt is shown in the experiments that the feedforward controller using optimised sensor locations reduces the radiated\r\nsound power by 7 dB, whereas the empirically placed sensors achieve only 4.5 dB. Furthermore, the potential\r\nof the proposed optimisation method regarding sound power reduction performance and the number of required\r\nsensors is shown for a real aircraft structure and a complex acoustic excitation.",

    "abstract": "Experiments using animal and human larynx models are often conducted without a vocal tract. While it is often assumed that the absence of a vocal tract has only small effects on vocal fold vibration, it is not actually known how sound production and quality are affected. In this study, the validity of using data obtained in the absence of a vocal tract for voice perception studies was investigated. Using a two-layer self-oscillating physical model, three series of voice stimuli were created: one produced with conditions of left-right symmetric vocal fold stiffness, and two with left-right asymmetries in vocal fold body stiffness. Each series included a set of stimuli created with a physical vocal tract, and a second set created without a physical vocal tract. Stimuli were re-synthesized to equalize the mean F0 for each series and normalized for amplitude. Listeners were asked to evaluate the three series in a sort-and-rate task. Multidimensional scaling analysis was applied to examine the perceptual interaction between the voice source and the vocal tract resonances. The results showed that the presence or absence of a vocal tract can significantly affect perception of voice quality changes due to parametric changes in vocal fold properties, except when the parametric changes in vocal fold properties produced an abrupt shift in vocal fold vibratory pattern resulting in a salient quality change.",

    "abstract": "Changing the vocal tract shape is one of the techniques which can be used by the players of wind instruments to modify the quality of the sound. It has been intensely studied in the case of reed instruments but has received only little attention in the case of air-jet instruments. This paper presents a first study focused on changes in the vocal tract shape in recorder playing techniques. Measurements carried out with recorder players allow to identify techniques involving changes of the mouth shape as well as consequences on the sound. A second experiment performed in laboratory mimics the coupling with the vocal tract on an artificial mouth. The phase of the transfer function between the instrument and the mouth of the player is identified to be the relevant parameter of the coupling. It is shown to have consequences on the spectral content in terms of energy distribution among the even and odd harmonics, as well as on the stability of the first two oscillating regimes. The results gathered from the two experiments allow to develop a simplified model of sound production including the effect of changing the vocal tract shape. It is based on the modification of the jet instabilities due to the pulsating emerging jet. Two kinds of instabilities, symmetric and anti-symmetric, with respect to the stream axis, are controlled by the coupling with the vocal tract and the acoustic oscillation within the pipe, respectively. The symmetry properties of the flow are mapped on the temporal formulation of the source term, predicting a change in the even / odd harmonics energy distribution. The predictions are in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations.",

The study was administered in order to mask the annoying noise stimuli by raising the background level. In three sessions, thirty-seven subjects from various professions performed the listening tests. One session consisted of the original non-identified noise stimuli with a total sound pressure level of 62 dBA, whereas the other two sessions consisted of modified noise stimuli. The modifications were made by adding higher background levels of 62 dBA and 65 dBA to each of the non-identified noise stimuli.

Forty two subjects with equal number of males and females from three professional groups, namely students, employees and pensioners, participated in listening tests. The listening tests were administered in three sessions with (1) original background level, (2) amplified background level of 62 dBA and (3) amplified background level of 65 dBA. The first class compartment of a newly built Inter-Regional train was mounted with three pairs of loudspeakers for the reproductions of the amplified background sounds. The results revealed significant effects of masking in various aboard activities like reading, writing, concentrating, etc. as well as between the judgments of the professional groups. The results also indicated that the subjects were more annoyed in the presence of the original background level than in the presence of amplified background levels, especially in 65 dBA background level although the original sound pressure level was lower. Pensioners were more annoyed in all aboard activities compared to the other groups of subjects. Cellular phone conversations were still annoying to the passengers though they were less annoying if masked by the amplified background sound (especially by 65 dBA). However, the subjects reported that in the amplified background conditions they could still perceive that someone was talking but they could not hear what he/she was saying, which was not in the case of original conditions. There were no significant differences observed in perceiving the internal train noises such as brake, acceleration, rattling, squeaking, beating, etc. between masking conditions and also between the professional groups. This was due to the fact that the present Heat Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system was not capable of masking the perceived internal train noises. The results also showed a tendency that the overall acoustical comfort became better with the amplified background sound despite of the higher sound pressure level inside the compartment up to 68 dBA.",

The noise of the sensor becomes even considerably lower than the principal resistance noise level (Johnson noise) of the wires.\r\n\r\nThe specific thermal acoustic sensor does not measure sound pressure but the accompanying particle velocity associated with sound. This particle velocity is deduced from a temperature difference between two heated wires. A drawback is the sensor's lower signal-to-noise (S/N-) ratio at higher frequencies. With the described cross correlation method the noise can significantly be decreased. The time averaged cross correlation signal of two uncorrelated noise sources is theoretically zero and this principle is used in the measurement of the cross spectrum of two sensors. The larger the measuring time and therefore the number of data points stored, the smaller the variance of the noise power in the cross spectrum. The theoretical dependence of the variance in the power of the cross spectrum on the number of stored data points is compared to theory, for various situations. Dependent on the number of data points used, noise reductions as high as 30 dB have been attained.",

    "abstract": "Summary The provisioning of an appropriate level of perceptual speech quality is crucial for the successful deployment of Vo ice over the Internet Protocol (VoIP). Today’s heterogeneous multimedia networks include links that introduce bit errors into the voice data stream. These errors are detected by the IP packet transport protocol and result in packet losses which eventually degrade the speech quality. However, modern speech coding algorithms can either conceal packet losses or tolerate corrupted packets. In this paper, we investigate to which extent it makes sense to keep corrupted speech data for the special case of uniformly distributed bit errors. We simulate different transport strategies that allow the incorporation of damaged speech data into the speech decoding process. The results from an instrumental speech quality evaluation show that keeping as much damaged data as possible leads to superior performance with regard to the perceptual speech quality compared to dropping packets and using packet loss concealment.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses prediction of the subjective response to walking sound - also called drum sound - based on differences in objective measurements. 'Walking sound' refers to the sound heard when someone is walking in the same room as the listener. Walking sound has attracted interest in recent years, particularly due to an increased use of thin floating floor constructions, such as veneer or laminate flooring, which can produce loud and sharp walking sound. A paired comparison test was performed in laboratory where listeners were asked which of the walking sounds was most disturbing. The response was analysed using a modified Bradley and Terry model allowing ties. Various measures, such as loudness according to ISO 532B, were tested against the subjective response using linear regression. The difference in 10-percentile loudness, N-10, between two stimuli was shown to predict the subjective response better than, for example, A-weighted sound pressure level. A difference of about 8% in N-10 resulted in 50% of the subjects noticing a difference. The methodology used is applicable in situations when objective measures that have subjective counterparts are sought. Although the method is based on relative observations, an absolute ranking can be obtained by using a reference or a well-defined recording situation. (Less)",

The method is based on sampling the traveling wave solution to the ideal wave equation and linearly filtering this solution to simulate dispersive effects due to stiffness and frequency-dependent loss; such digital filters may terminate the waveguide or be embedded along its length. For strings of high stiffness, however, dispersion filters can be difficult to design and expensive to implement. In this article, we show how high-quality time-domain terminating filters may be derived from given frequency-domain specifications which depend on the model parameters. Particular attention is paid to the problem of phase approximation, which, in the case of high stiffness, is strongly nonlinear. Finally, in the interest of determining the limits of applicability of digital waveguide techniques, we make a comparison with more conventional finite difference schemes, in terms of computational cost and numerical dispersion, for a set of string stiffness parameters.",

An acoustic effect first encountered by Declercq (reported in J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 116(6), 3328-3335, 2004) is the raindrop effect. When visitors climb the colossal staircase of Maya pyramids, their footsteps are transformed into sound having distinct frequencies similar to raindrops falling in a bucket filled with water. The current paper reports in situ experiments followed by numerical simulations of the raindrop effect together with a physical explanation. In addition to numerical simulations, a rule of thumb formula is extracted from the calculations that enable the prediction of the acoustic raindrop frequency at any other pyramid in Mexico. If the raindrop effect is a phenomenon that was intentionally incorporated in the construction of the Maya pyramids, such as the pyramid in Chichen Itza, then it was most probably related to the rain god Chac for which there is ubiquitous archaeological evidence decorated on the pyramid itself.",

Such process is the major factor to degrade the quality of 3D sound reproduction but the Optimal Source Distribution (OSD) provides simple and effective signal processing and loudspeaker design principle which enables lossless crosstalk cancellation process. The OSD takes advantage of its physical property which ensures that in-phase and out-of-phase components of the binaural reproduction process are balanced. Hence the bulk of the crosstalk cancellation is achieved by its loudspeaker design principle and the related natural interference in the sound field. Inverse filters of the OSD have a unique property where only the simple phase change is required in essence for the perfect crosstalk cancellation. Therefore, each filter has flat frequency response that lead to advantages in many respects. It is shown here that the advantage of the OSD is further enhanced by separating in-phase and out-of-phase components through an alternative system design.",

An objective evaluation tool, spectral distortion (SD), was used to evaluate the HRTF estimation errors. No significant differences of SDs when using local and global KAMs were found. They could satisfy rough sound localization at almost all sampled positions. The global KAMs cover measurements of pinna, head, and torso. Compared with using average HRTFs, the SDs when using local and global KAMs could be averagely reduced by 9.4% and 9.7% respectively. The reduction of SD scores is significant at most of the positions of interest (p < 0.05).",

The network architecture simulations show that DiffServ make the packet loss process less bursty when compared to the current Best Effort (BE) network architecture. These network simulations were followed up with a subjective test to investigate the effects more thoroughly. The subjective test combined three audio clips, three packet loss ratios (3%, 5%, 7%) and two Error Concealment (EC) algorithms with two packet loss processes. Results from the subjective test show statistically significant effects of audio clip, EC, and packet loss ratio on perceived audio quality as well as interaction effects between the network architectures and both audio clip and packet loss ratio. It was found that for a loss ratio of 3%, the loss pattern from a DiffServ network lead to a significantly higher perceived audio quality than the loss pattern from a BE network.

    "abstract": "When a sound exposure stems from a sound source that is close to the ear of the exposed person, the noise is described in terms of the free-field related or diffuse-field related sound pressure level, i.e. the level of a free or a diffuse-sound field that would result in the same exposure of the person's ear as that stemming from the close sound source. The at-ear sound exposure level is measured either by MIRE technique (microphones in real ears) or by a manikin, and the free-field related or diffuse-field related sound pressure levels are obtained by subtracting the free-field-front or the diffuse-field head-related transfer function (HRTF) expressed in dB. The use of either, the eardrum, the open entrance, or the blocked entrance as measurement point for the MIRE-technique is evaluated. The results are the same, wherever in the ear canal the measurements are made. There is good agreement between human HRTFs measured at different laboratories, and for eardrum, open-entrance and blocked entrance, standard HRTF data have been derived, which may be used instead of HRTFs measured for each subject. The resulting statistical uncertainty depends on the choice of measurement point, and whether individual or standard HRTF data are used. Generally, measurements at the blocked entrance are practical and produce results with low statistical uncertainty. The results from manikin-measurements do not agree well with results from humans (MIRE), when HRTFs from the actual manikin or from the manikin standards (IEC 60959 and ITU-T P.58) are used. A better agreement is obtained with HRTFs constructed by multiplying human blocked-entrance data with the transfer function of the standardized coupler for manikins. This method is therefore described (and data tabled) in ISO 11904-2. A comparison between humans, manikins, and the manikin standards suggest, that standards do not specify an average human and should be revised.",

We recorded the ABR and a series of EFPs between the brain surface and nucleus laminaris (NL) in response to binaural clicks. The ABR and the EFP within and around NL are correlated.

The results show the usefulness of low screens as well as suggests improvements in screen design. For the measurements, an acoustic screen built up from concrete modules was temporarily installed beside a small park on the reservation between a two-lane road and a track for walking and cycling. A larger traffic system, of which the two-lane road is a part, determines the daytime equivalent noise level within the urban area. The screen height was about 1.4 m as measured from the level of the road surface and the width of the screen top was 0.3 m. Measurements were carried out both at 20 m distance from the road (within the park) and at 5 m distance from the road (at the cycle track). Insertion loss in maximum level, using controlled lightvehicle pass-by at 50 km/h, was measured to 10 dB at 5 m distance and to 6 dB at 20 m distance, at 1.5 m height. Insertion loss in equivalent level was measured within the park to 4 dB at 1.5 m height. A listening experiment confirmed a perceived improvement from installing the screen. The measured results were also compared with predicted results using a boundary element method (BEM) and a noise mapping software, the latter showing good agreement, overestimating the equivalent level insertion loss by 1 dB in the park. The BEM comparison showed reasonable agreement in maximum level insertion loss considering that facade reflections were excluded, with an overestimation of 5 dB at the cycle track, and good agreement in the park, overestimating by up to 1 dB the equivalent and maximum level insertion losses. BEM predictions were used to also investigate other screen designs, showing a positive effect of an acoustically soft screen top, significant for a screen width of 0.2 m and increasing for wider screens.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the inﬂuence of typically appearing interior driving noises on the production of speech inside vehicles is described. The automatic reﬂex of raising one’s voice in noisy environments, known as the Lombard Eﬀect [1], is quantiﬁed both in the sound pressure level and in the long-term spectral distribution of read speech. For this purpose, a laboratory experiment with 30 participants was performed. In addition to a noise-free reference condition, driving noises at various sound pressure levels as well as noises with white and speech-like spectra were presented to the test attendees while reading out loud a written text. The eﬀects of these diﬀerent noises on the speech’s sound pressure level and spectral distribution were quantiﬁed. In conclusion, there is no signiﬁcant impact of the noise shape on the spectral content of the respective speech, while the noise-aﬀected speech is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent to speech under the quiet condition. In regard to the speech’s sound pressure level, an octave-band analysis of the background noises with a band weighting commonly used for speech intelligibility measurements is proposed to predict speech levels in the tested noise environments.",

The method involves a mesh of at least 7 acoustic receivers distributed in the acoustic influence area of the source, and assumes that the background noise is uncorrelated between them. It is necessary to know the position of the source at a random instant in order to compensate for the propagation time delay between the signals of the receivers. The method focuses on the relative Doppler Effect between a reference microphone and the rest to obtain the velocity and position at every time instant. The performance of the method has been simulated and experimentally tested in the case of a moving sound source travelling in a linear path, and the location errors obtained in both cases are acceptable.",

Although it has been an object of research for several decades, complete understanding of its behavior is far from complete. Many experiments on real cochlea and many mathematical models have been developed in the past decades. In the biophysical cochlear model of Mammano and Nobili [1, 2], both mechanical and hydrodynamical aspects are treated at a level adequate to the complexity of realistic cochlear structures. In this paper, we analyze the time-frequency resolution of this biophysical cochlear model: analysis is first applied to the passive cochlear model and then extended to the active nonlinear model. Further, we propose the method for signal reconstruction from the cochlear time-frequency response. When applied to active cochlear model response, it could result with the signal which human ear actually hears (with some spectral enhancements and noise suppression).",

It is found that the small crack with contacting acoustic nonlinearity produces a noticeable nonlinear signature when using pulse inversion signal processing, and even higher signature with delayed time reversal, without requiring any baseline information from an undamaged medium.",

The three quantities can be measured directly, or indirectly using a reception plate method. Whilst direct measurements can be precise, they require extensive data acquisition and processing. The reception plate method is simpler and less precise and therefore yields an engineering grade of accuracy. This paper reports on a collaborative investigation, towards developing an industrial standard for source characterization using the reception plate method. The method yields data as frequency band-averaged values and also as equivalent single values. These simplifications result in uncertainties when obtaining the source quantities and therefore in predictions of the structure-borne sound power in installed conditions. The causes of these uncertainties are considered.",

By tradition this difference has been attributed mainly to lower inharmonicity in grand pianos, due to longer bass strings. In this study, the importance of the spectral envelope, representing the dynamic balance between high-frequency and lowfrequency energy in the spectrum, is contrasted against the importance of the level of inharmonicity. Results from two listening tests indicate that the inharmonicity is less important than the spectrum bandwidth in determining the timbre of piano bass tones.",

    "abstract": "In the last decades the performances of diffracting devices to be installed on top of noise barriers have been usually estimated through numerical simulations or laboratory measurements on scale models. The recently issued European Technical Specification CEN/TS 1793-4 is the first standard that gives a methodology to measure the diffracting performances of full scale samples (in laboratory or directly at the installation site). This in situ method allows the qualification of such devices by means of a Maximum Length Sequence (MLS) technique in terms of two purposely defined indexes: DI (Diffraction Index) and ADI (Diffraction Index Difference). A free field test facility was realized for this purpose at the Acoustic Laboratory of the University of Perugia. Several tests on different caps were carried out to set up the measurement methodology and to assess its accuracy. Results show that the experimental facilities and the measuring methodology are both efficient and reliable, though particular attention has to be paid to geometrical correction and to time windowing. Furthermore, the installation of this kind of devices can sometimes worsen the noise reduction performances in comparison with the simple noise barrier, due to the choice of materials of the cap and to the geometry of the element itself. The paper is completed by a review of the results obtained by other authors through numerical simulations and experimental measurements on diffracting devices.",

    "abstract": "Near-field acoustical holography (NAH) requires the measurement of the pressure field over a closed surface in order to recover the normal velocity on a nearby concentric surface. It is impractical for large structure when the reconstruction of the field is required only on a partial structure surface. The method of superposition may be applied to reconstruct the field on a partial surface on a structure form measurements made on a nearby limited surface. According to the wave superposition method (WSM), the field on and near the measurement surface may be approximated by the field produced by virtual source points placed on a surface inside the structure. The source strengths are evaluated by applying boundary conditions on the measurement surface. Here, an iterative procedure is applied to extend the measurement surface in order to obtain better reconstruction precision. The algorithm requires the inversion of the Green's function matrix which may be ill-conditioned. Tikhonov regularization method is used to invert it, and the value of the regularization parameter is determined based on use of the L-curve criteria. A numerical simulation of two ball sound sources as an example to validate the results is used. The result of experiment shows the superiority and applicability of the data extrapolation based on patch-NAH.",

It is shown that the acoustic field has a complicated amplitude and phase structure which varies with ultrasound frequency. The dependence of the acousto-optic diffraction efficiency on the acoustic wave amplitude and the phase mismatch is studied. It is established that the diffraction efficiency can approach 100% despite a noticeable phase mismatch. Optimal values of acoustic power and light incidence angles are found. It is revealed that due to the wedge-like form of the transducer the frequency band at the third harmonic can be several times increased with retaining a high value of the electric-to-acoustic power conversion.",

    "abstract": "Extensive numerical modeling of long-range propagation of sound and seismic waves as well as observations of underwater acoustic fields with line arrays reveal that wave fronts are often much more stable and predictable than the rays comprising these wave fronts. This paper considers multiple scattering of sound by environmental inhomogeneities with spatial scales that are small compared to the propagation range but large compared to the wavelength. These inhomogeneities include 3-D variations in sound speed and current velocity that are small compared to the average sound speed, can be either random or deterministic, and are superimposed on an arbitrary slowly varying background. A theoretical explanation of wave-front stability in highly structured environments is achieved by demonstrating that end points of rays launched from a point source and having a given eikonal (phase) are scattered primarily along the wave front corresponding to the same eikonal in an unperturbed environment. The ratio of displacements of the ray end points along and across the unperturbed wave front is proportional to the number of uncorrelated scattering events. The results apply to conventional rays and to horizontal rays describing propagation of adiabatic normal modes in almost-layered media. The origin of relative stability of wave fronts compared to rays is traced back to Fermat's principle.",

For the so called propagation zone an optimized finite difference method adopted from fan tone noise propagation is applied together with a linear perturbation approach based on the Euler equations. Special attention is payed to the indirect noise generation in the propagation zone, where initially quiet perturbations of the fluid state radiate noise when accelerated or decelerated in a varying base flow regime. A non-isentropic mathematical model is chosen. The approach is compared with a previously published experiment for the assessment of indirect combustion noise. The numerical results show the strong influence of reflections from the inflow boundary of the plenum on the resulting pressure response in the outlet duct. By assuming reasonable reflections from the plenum, the observed time signal of the pressure reaches a reasonable agreement between numerical simulation and experiment. Furthermore, the acoustic intensity is used to show the good quality of the numerical solution. Finally, the intensity based source location identifies the nozzle as a dominant source of sound, with large magnitudes of generation and annihilation of acoustic energy. The source power found in the heated volume is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than in the nozzle. This result again underlines the importance of indirect combustion noise.",

    "abstract": "In virtual acoustic imaging systems, the perception of a sound source anywhere in space can theoretically be reproduced for one listener by using only two loudspeaker and an appropriate set of filters, called crosstalk cancellation (CTC) filters. However, the ideal position of the loudspeakers in such systems is still a question that is currently addressed by many researchers. Several analytical models with varying degrees of complexity have been used to analyze this matter. The fact is that, so far, all implemented CTC systems were built for a single listener use. When it comes to two listener CTC systems, the conditioning of the matrix of transfer functions between the loudspeakers and the listener's ear seems to be more irregular than the conditioning of the matrix for a one listener CTC system. Using a simplified model made it possible to verify that the position of the sound sources also plays a major role as far as the two listeners system's performance is concerned. Now, the influence of the presence of the listener's head in this model is evaluated. The free-field model of a two listener CTC system is expanded by modelling the listeners' heads as two rigid spheres. Using this new model an optimal source displacement is calculated based on two potential source distribution arrangements, namely a linear and a circular source distribution.",

Background noise may be of increasing importance for future outdoor noise quality and health effects, as traffic activities are expected to grow further in the next decades. A statistical model was used for mapping background noise levels (L90) using traffic numbers. The model was validated for road traffic noise by long term measurements at motorways in the Netherlands. For airport noise, predictions were validated by simulation of time data based on real flight traffic numbers provided by the NLR. Subsequently the model was applied to the main roads, railways and Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in the Netherlands. The study shows that both for road traffic noise and airport noise, background noise levels will increase stronger than equivalent noise levels when traffic numbers increase. It is therefore important that policymakers give high priority to further reduction of noise emissions in the next decades.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, the sound transmission loss (STL) of ultrafine glass fiber felts in terms of areal density and sound frequency has been modeled by artificial neural network (ANN), the Law of Theoretic Mass and fitting polynomial, respectively. The STL of ultrafine glass fiber felts with the areal density ranging from 0 to 300 g/m 2 and at the sound frequency ranging from 500 to 6300 Hz was employed as training data for ANN. By the optimization of ANN structure, the number of neurons in the two hidden layers was determined to 8 and 4 respectively. The mean squared error of the ANN model was only 0.191 and the correlation coefficient was 0.9989, which showed high accuracy for estimating the STL of the felts. Compared with other two models, the ANN model showed excellent agreement with the measured results and it's very appropriate for the estimation of acoustic properties of ultrafine glass fiber felts.",

    "abstract": "In Germany, the rating level is an important parameter to assess noise immissions in occupied offices. The rating level denotes the energy-equivalent sound pressure level during a measurement period with speech sounds and considers penalties for tonal, informational and impulsive constituents. There is little evidence that the rating level correlates with the performance and perceived annoyance of office workers. This study evaluates 89 different sound conditions under which subjects have to complete a short-term memory task and a questionnaire in laboratory conditions with respect to their relationships with the rating level. The relationships of the penalty for impulsiveness and the penalty for tonality or informational constituents with the rating level are analyzed separately. In addition, the penalty for tonality or informational constituents is substituted by percentile level statistics, namely the difference between the 10 th and 90 th percentile levels. In contrast to the penalty for tonality or informational constituents, this metric is objectively measurable. Using the rating level to assess the noise at office workplaces could be improved by using percentile level statistics to account for informational constituents. To improve the predictive validity, it is suggested to report the penalties separately.",

    "abstract": "Cavity resonance is one of the important sources of tire noise. The measures commonly used for suppressing the cavity resonance is to paste sound absorbing material on the inner surface of the tire, which has been proved to be very effective by many experimental studies. But so far there is a lack of methods to assess the influence of absorbing material on the cavity resonance and help determine the optimal sound absorbing material for a tire. To resolve this problem, a method based on the eigenvalue analysis is proposed. In the method, the resonance of a tire cavity lined with sound absorbing material is turned into a complex eigenvalue problem of a closed cavity with prescribed boundary conditions. The real and imaginary parts of the complex eigenvalue can then be used to represent the influence of sound absorbing material on the cavity resonance. Experiments were conducted on a tire lined with polyurethane foams of different thickness and flow resistivity to validate the results obtained by the proposed method, and a good agreement between their results is achieved.",

    "abstract": "The impact of urban sound on human beings has often been studied from a negative point of view (noise pollution). In the two last decades, the interest of studying its positive impact has been revealed with the soundscape approach (resourcing spaces). The literature shows that the recognition of sources plays a great role in the way humans are affected by sound environments. There is thus a need for characterizing urban acoustic environments not only with sound pressure measurements but also with source-specific attributes such as their perceived time of presence, dominance or volume. This paper demonstrates, on a controlled dataset, that machine learning techniques based on state of the art neural architectures can predict the perceived time of presence of several sound sources at a sufficient accuracy. To validate this assertion, a corpus of simulated sound scenes is first designed. Perceptual attributes corresponding to those stimuli are gathered through a listening experiment. From the contributions of the individual sound sources available for the simulated corpus, a physical indicator approximating the perceived time of presence of sources is computed and used to train and evaluate a multi-label source detection model. This model predicts the presence of simultaneously active sources from fast third octave spectra, allowing the estimation of perceptual attributes such as pleasantness in urban sound environments at a sufficient degree of precision.",

The aim of this paper is to introduce a flexible procedure where the acoustic source data may be synthesized and stored from commercially available Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes and later used to predict radiated noise. Different applications will require either analytical or numerical methods for the radiation calculations. Attention is restricted to low Mach number flows where the noise generation is dominated by the interaction of the flow with a surface with at least one characteristic dimension short compared to the wavelength of interest. This makes it possible to focus on the surface source term of the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation. In this paper, in order to illustrate the basic method for storing and utilizing data from the CFD analysis, the flow past a circular cylinder at a Reynolds number of Re = 1.4. 105 will be studied, where the cylinder is compact and therefore the analytical free-space Green's function may be used. © S.

The electrical impedances of five loudspeakers were measured by Klippel LPM analyzer, and the model parameters were identified by fitting the measured impedance curve. The obtained accuracy was evaluated with respect to the simplicity of different models. The results show that, this new model agrees well with the measured electrical impedance, and gives an accurate prediction of the lossy inductance varying with frequencies, especially for the frequency dependent phase.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this preliminary study was to investigate the feasibility of a tool to compare a severity index of nonlinear events and vocal self-rating over a long period of time. One hundred and ninety-seven phonations were analyzed to quantify the severity of instabilities in the voice attributed to nonlinear dynamic phenomena, including voice breaks, subharmonics, and frequency jumps. Instabilities were first counted; then a severity index was calculated for the instabilities in each phonation. The two quantities were compared to the subject's autoperceptual rating. Generally speaking, the measures derived from nonlinear dynamic analysis of the high-pitched, soft phonations followed the subject's own rating of inability to produce soft voice. These preliminary single subject results provide a foundation for future multi-subject studies to formulate acoustic and autoperceptual measures for the fatiguing effects of prolonged speaking in vocally demanding professions. However, given the number of observations, the results are still useful in showing general relationships. While future work should add additional subjects, a study providing preliminary evidence is useful before attempting to undertake a multi-subject study with complex analysis (i.e., individually selecting the nonlinear events) and with a long observation duration (days, weeks, and months) of subject.",

With this model a characteristic length is assumed for which the sound pressure is constant. For example for a circular cylindrical tube the characteristic length is the radius. A triangular cross-section does not have a characteristic length, but as will be shown in this paper the model can in fact be used as long as 1) the cross-sectional pressure is constant and 2) a characteristic impedance and propagation wavenumber can be established for the geometry. These parameters can be found for a tube with a triangular cross-section and an implementation of the low reduced frequency which can handle tubes with both circular, rectangular triangular cross-sections has been made in COMSOL Multiphysics. For the circular and the rectangular tube results found using this implementation have been compared to results from an analytical model, a so-called full Navier-Stokes implementation in COMSOL Multiphysics and the commercial package FFT ACTRAN which also uses the low reduced frequency model. The triangular tube implementation has been compared to the analytical case as well as the full Navier-Stokes implementation.",

Many of the existing models are developed based on experiments which alter natural walking by for example presence of force transducers, limitations in the speed and path of walking and replacing the real floor with a transducerfacilitated measurement rig. These alterations result in contact forces which do not represent real GRFs. In this study, a time-domain inverse measurement method based on LMS algorithm is used to measure low-frequency (<100 Hz) forces induced by human footsteps. The LMS-based force identification method is first validated for low-frequency excitations with less complexity in number of excitation positions and frequency content compared with the footsteps. The method is then applied to measure ground reaction forces created by human walking.",

    "abstract": "Piezoelectric semiconductors have emerged as materials capable to amplify sound waves when electrons are set to drift at supersonic speeds. Several experiments have demonstrated this behaviour at moderate amplification levels for some intrinsic semiconductors and carrier concentrations. On a theoretical basis we show that amplification of sound can be significantly enhanced when the materials are operated close to the plasma frequency. If the drifting carriers collectively oscillate with the plasma the electromechanical coupling is enhanced since the permittivity is related inversely proportional to the mechanical stress and vanishes near the bulk plasma frequency. By optically or electrically doping GaAs and InSb as exemplified in this work, we predict that amplification of sound can be achieved effectively for a bandwidth exceeding several decades making this active system very attractive for loss-compensation in metamaterials and applicable for sensing such as nonlinear devices. The paper contains a detailed derivation and discussion of transmission and reflection coefficients for pressure pulses impinging on a semiconductor slab and the acoustic gain enhancement that can be achieved by dynamic switching of the electric field as well as tuning flexibility through dynamic control of the carrier density.",

It is shown that this pattern arises from the interference between the sound directly generated at the point of contact between ball and plate, and the sound reflected at the edge of the plate. This effect was added to synthesized rolling sounds which resulted in a more natural sound. A discussion is presented concerning the perceptual relevance of this pattern.",

One of the main drawbacks of this type of building systems is the sound insulation, where flanking transmission is an important issue. A prediction model for flanking transmission of lightweight building structures is thus under development. This paper is a theoretical study of the structural transmission coefficient of a junction, using a propagating wave approach. Free waves travel in the periodic wave-medium. The periodic resilient elements consist of rotation and displacement springs. The free waves meet a discontinuity (or junction), and the power transmitted through the discontinuity is then studied. The discontinuity consists of a mechanical coupling and point mass load. The model is analytic and deterministic, and makes use of a spatial Fourier transform wave approach for periodic structures. The approach is intended for flanking transmission of lightweight building structures, but it is also applicable for structures such as ships and aircraft. Numerical results are presented and discussed. It is concluded that the periodic nature of the wave media affects the power transmitted through a discontinuity.",

    "abstract": "Summary The precedence effect (PE) is an auditory spatial illusion where the apparent location of two sounds presented from different spatial locations but separated by a delay is determined primarily by the spatial attributes of the leading stimulus. In this review, we compare previously published psychophysical and physiological experiments on the PE in cats. Also included are data from some new psychophysical studies allowing further comparisons to published physiological results. Psychophysical experiments on the precedence effect (on the PE in cats) in cats have shown that they perceive pairs of auditory stimuli presented from different locations in space in a manner dependent on the interstimulus delay (ISD) between stimuli, similar to humans. The behavior of the cats indicates that they experience the phases of the PE, including summing localization, localization dominance, and the echo threshold. These three phenomena of the PE are elicited on the horizontal and vertical planes using ISDs. Here, we present new psychophysical data showing that the PE can also be elicited on the horizontal plane using interstimulus intensity differences (ISIs) and can be disrupted with conflicting ISDs and ISIs. While neural mechanisms of the PE phenomena are less known, single unit recordings from the inferior colliculus (IC) of anesthetized cats support the hypothesis that the IC is an important neural substrate of the PE.",

At the moment, a study concerning sound generation, perception and optimisation is being carried out. In this paper, aspects of sound generation and results of listening tests are summarised, whereas the role of consonance and roughness is described in detail. First, a rating-scale test with stimuli from real recordings yields no significant influence of roughness on pleasantness. But afterwards, a sound-synthesis model is introduced and validated which is able to reproduce sounds inside railbound vehicles. With this model, a variation of the gear teeth number verifies that pleasantness is very probably dependent on the consonance effect. Instrumental roughness models, however, do not reproduce the sensation of consonance completely.",

    "abstract": "In everyday life, humans often perceive complex auditory events. Many natural sound sources are not point-like, but spatially extensive. Also, sound reproduction techniques sometimes produce virtual sources whose directional cues propose multiple directions at a time. Perceptual mechanisms for decoding the perceived direction and the spatial distribution of such auditory events are not well known. This paper investigates how sound objects whose localization cues indicate different azimuth direction as a function of frequency, 1) are localized, and 2) how horizontally wide they are perceived. A horizontally wide (45°) sound source was created by presenting spectrally consecutive, non-overlapping, bandlimited noise samples simultaneously from the different loudspeakers of a loudspeaker grid in an anechoic environment. The narrowband samples together formed a broadband stimulus. The order of the narrowband noise samples in the loudspeakers, as well as the total frequency range of the samples, was varied from case to case. In each test case, the subjects were asked to indicate the perceived center of gravity of the sound image, as well as the direction of all the loudspeakers that they perceived to radiate sound. Generally, the perceived center could not be predicted merely by a simple model using Raatgever's frequency weighting function for binaural salience [1]. Alternative frequency weights were calculated analytically from the listening test results. The results also indicated that the perceived width of the sound sources produced by the nine-loudspeaker setup was, in all cases, less than half of the actual width of the source. This implies that some frequency bands from different loudspeakers fused together spatially.",

The insertion loss (IL) of such silencers has been measured without and with perforations in the plates, without and with mean air flow and without and with noise generated by loudspeakers placed downstream in the flow duct system. Whether the plate is perforated or not but without noise generated by loudspeakers in the duct, the IL due to the poroelastic plate silencer is found to increase in the presence of mean air flow at speeds of 37.65 m/s and 5.5 m/s. With noise from the loudspeakers and a mean air flow of 37.65 m/s, the IL when the plate is perforated is higher than that achieved with the non-perforated plate at frequencies less than 100 Hz. To investigate the extent to which there may be structure-borne components of the plate deflection, the displacement of the duct wall has been measured and plotted versus frequency. The displacement of the non-perforated plate is found to be higher than the displacement of the duct wall. However the displacement of the perforated plate is less than that of the duct wall which suggests that low frequency improvement in the performance in the presence of mean air flow and perforations is a consequence of the aeroacoustic effects of the perforations rather than increased plate deflection.",

Furthermore, we present a numerical procedure for obtaining modal solutions, and we discuss sample solutions for the three-layered waveguide. Second, FEM is applied to simulate the waveguide setup including real-world transducers mounted on wedges. We introduce a 2D model of the setup and a procedure for obtaining group velocity dispersion diagrams. The model is validated using theoretical and experimental results. In addition, the effect of discretization error is demonstrated. We present sample dispersion diagrams and compare them to those obtained with the matrix methods. Finally, we utilize the FEM simulation results to depict the displacement profiles across the waveguide. We show that the results of both modeling techniques are in good agreement and that they provide interesting insights into the wave mechanics of the three-layered waveguide.",

    "abstract": "Squeal noise in vehicle disc brakes is perceived by consumers as both annoying and as an indication of a problem with the braking system, dramatically affecting quality, satisfaction ratings and warranty costs. Among the methods that have been used to control squeal noise, increasing the system damping has been shown to be very effective. The most commonly used method to increase system damping consists of attaching multi-layer laminates on the back of the brake pads. Such laminates, also known as brake shims, are composed of different layers of metal and viscoelastic materials. In this paper, the dynamics of a disc brake system are discussed. At first, the squeal noise mechanism is broken down and a simple analytical model is used to exemplify the modal coupling phenomenon and how damping affects it. A technique to measure brake system damping as a function of brake lining pressure and temperature is explained and the results with and without brake shims are discussed. One of the conditions believed necessary for the occurrence of squeal noise in some disc brake systems is related to the relative position of the rotor and pad critical mode shapes. This condition, addressed in some previous papers [1, 2], is also studied here by using the Sound Intensity technique. Measurement of the properties of viscoelastic materials as a function of temperature and frequency is discussed. Results are shown for different materials (rubber, acrylic and silicone). Modal damping is also measured for different brake shim configurations as a function of braking temperature and lining pressure using the above mentioned technique. It was found that the modal coupling plays an important role in noise generation for certain brake system designs. For the brake system analyzed, the anti-nodes of the rotor mode related to the squeal frequency are fixed in space, i.e., they no longer rotate, remaining in the same position along the rotor diameter. Also, measuring system damping can be effectively used in the design and selection of brake shim configurations. However, in practice, the technique presented in this paper showed the best results for specific squeal noise problems where rotor and pad bending modes are the main root cause of the noise.",

In a first experiment, the boundary conditions of the plate are considered as uniform viscoelastic ones. The vibroacoustic behavior of this kind of structure has been investigated by different researchers. The different studies have emphasized the strong influence of the boundary conditions on the vibroacoustic response of the plate. However, their influence on auditory perception is not known and far from obvious. A second experiment is carried out for an application by considering the example of a pane of glass with nonuniform viscoelastic boundary conditions, made of various joints and blocks positioned between the glass and its frame. In both cases the vibrating plate is modeled using the finite element method and artificial stimuli are generated using a sound synthesis technique. Stimuli are submitted to a panel of subjects who are asked to give preference and dissimilarity judgments. The results of the auditory evaluation are then coupled with the results of the physical analysis of the plate response in order to provide further information in terms of structural design recommendations.",

    "abstract": "Injection of acoustic power from a piezoelectric transducer into a pressurized gas was studied in two cases. 1) Direct injection into the gas i.e. the acoustic system is placed in contact with the gas. 2) Injection through a metallic wall (the gas tank). We defined several indicators by which the acoustic injection could be quantified: the maximum injection efficiency (IE max ), the mean injection efficiency in a defined frequency range (MIE), the relative bandwidth of the injection (RBW), and a combined performance (CP) for the system, which combines MIE and RBW. The CP indicator efficiency was tested in case 1), of direct injection, where the optimal stack was found to be several λ/4 layers. In cases 2), the injection through a high impedance wall was more complex to investigate and less efficient in bandwidth. Several optimal designs were found with A/4 or A/2 matching layers, depending on whether the indicator was considered. High injection efficiency and wide bandwidth are difficult to obtain simultaneously. One of the best matching lines is a single A/2 layer, with low impedance compared to the transducer or wall impedance.",

The investigations are conducted on a cylindrical pipe terminated by a catenoidal horn using an axisymmetric numerical model based on the lattice Boltzmann method. The simulations are carried out using input values of the mean flow found experimentally for different dynamic playing levels (pianissimo, mezzo forte and fortissimo) and different reed types (soft and hard). The results show that |R| is unaffected in the range of mean flows corresponding to the different dynamic levels analyzed. Conversely, the end correction l appears to be considerably more sensitive to variations of the dynamic level, particularly in the low frequency region. Nevertheless, the results obtained indicate a small effect for musical contexts and thus generally substantiate the zero mean flow assumption commonly used to predict the acoustic transmission and the dynamic response of clarinet-like systems.",

The ultrasonic beam is decomposed into plane waves, using Fourier transforms. The presence of both the interfaces and the defect produces successive reflections. In order to take into account all the corresponding fields, an iterative method has been implemented. At each iteration, the problem of the scattering by the defect is processed with the passive re- emission method, the data on the defect being calculated under Kirchhoff approximation (in good agreement with the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction for a defect located in a fluid medium); the transmission through the interfaces is performed for plane waves, the scattered field being expressed using Fourier integrals. This iterative method gives a more accurate solution than the global one, namely the passive re-emission principle under Kirchhoff approximation straightforwardly applied on the whole system of the structure. Numerical results are given (cartographies and cuts of the pressure field in the fluid), which show -i) the effect of the defect on the field which propagates in the structure, -ii) the convergence rate of the iterative process as a function of the incident angle, -iii) the changes in the field depending on the location of the defect.",

The classical theories [1, 2] state open turbulent flames being acoustic radiators of mainly monopole type. This has been confirmed by various experiments and numerical simulations [3, 4]. A weak non-isotropic component of the acoustic field has also been observed. In several investigations it was suspected the deviations from the isotropic character of the acoustic field to be related to refraction effects due to the varying mean speed of sound. It is the purpose of this investigation to substantiate this hypothesis. Using the acoustic perturbation equations for reacting flows (APE-RF) the acoustic impact of spatially varying mean speed of sound within a turbulent reacting flow field is numerically investigated. The results show this effect to be frequency dependent and the mean flow field, especially the mean speed of sound, to be taken into account to accurately predict combustion generated noise of open turbulent flames.",

In this paper, a new approach is proposed in order to accurately simulate impedance behavior, particularly a locally reacting impedance. The proposed model places special emphasis on the frequency dependent impedance case. This impedance definition is commonly used to characterise plane surfaces. The results demonstrate how accurate the proposed realisation is, compared to theory and how the simulations obtained outperform previously proposed methods.",

The focus of this work is the development of a technique that allows a good representation of the sound field, assuming that the sound sources originated by the combustion are known. Following the acoustic analogy approach, the sound radiation of open flames can be evaluated by a volume integral over the equivalent acoustic source terms in the combustion zone. The DRBEM allows replacing the volume integral by a series of surface integrals. The technique is applied to the theoretical model of a spherical flame. The accuracy of the DRBEM model can be studied by comparing it with available analytical solutions for the sound radiation of this flame type. For enclosed flames, the DRBEM is used to calculate the sound propagation in the region of temperature gradients that appears at the exhaust of the combustion chamber. The sensitivity of the radiated sound field to this adjacent inhomogeneous temperature field is investigated. The non-uniqueness problem of the boundary integral equation method is tackled by the Burton and Miller approach. The DRBEM allows an effective determination of the radiated acoustic field because it can take into account inhomogeneities and satisfies automatically the radiation condition at infinity.",

This project investigates the reflected sound field from planar acoustical reflectors with rounded reflector edges away from the source side, creating a convex edge. The authors use 2D boundary element method (BEM) sound field simulations to compare the performance of the convex-edged reflectors against flat reflectors. Results show that the convex edge increases nonspecular reflections by 3 dB with each doubling of curvature radius. Because the simulations were run in two dimensions, results generalize only to long reflectors mounted above long sources, such as an orchestra or choir.",

Wherever possible, measurements covered the two configurations with and without orchestra shells on the stages. The experimental procedure was carried out according to the ISO 3382-1 where monophonic impulse responses were measured using sine sweep signals in the 125-4000 Hz octave band range on the stage and in the audience area. The experimental results of support parameters versus frequency are compared with their predictions through the diffuse field theory using the reverberation times measured in the halls. The relationships of spectrally averaged support parameters with architectural elements of the enclosure of the stage are studied. Results show that the most significant regressions are for early support with the volume of the stage enclosure and its height/width ratio. The differences found in support measures due to the addition of the orchestra shells are also examined.",

    "abstract": "The simulation of sound propagation in and around forest areas requires a detailed understanding of the acoustic properties of trees. Therefore, the acoustic properties of laser-scanned real trees and idealized trees are studied by means of a three-dimensional finite difference time domain (FDTD) sound propagation model. The aim is to gain functional relationships between backscattered and transmitted sound pressure levels and selected tree characteristics. The choice of the model type enables the simultaneous consideration of multiple reflections and diffraction of sound waves. The spatial resolution of 5 cm admits a frequency range up to 1350 Hz and the resolution of the trunk and major branches. The simulated sound pressure signals are detected by a virtual microphone array in front and behind an infinitely long row of trees, respectively. Regarding the density of tree material within a volume, thin objects reflect less sound energy than dense objects, which in contrast have a noticeable acoustical effect on the transmission loss. The relations are provided by a set of empirical equations.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that the sound of the solid-body electric guitar depends not only on the extended electronic chain running from the pickup to the loudspeaker, but also on the vibratory behaviour of its structure. Indeed, the strings couple with the structure of the instrument, so the vibratory behaviour of the structure alters the sound. However, nominally ``identical'' electric guitars can show different vibratory behaviours. Measurements during the making process might help finding the origin of these differences. The aim of the article is to understand how the modal behaviour of electric guitars changes during the making process. In this paper, the making process is split in 6 stages: raw neck, shaped neck, equipped neck, body, raw guitar and equipped guitar. Vibratory measurements are performed on 11 nominally ``identical'' guitars at each of the 6 stages, in order to track the evolution of modal frequencies during the making process. Simple analytical models predict quite well the evolution of modal frequencies experimentally observed. The study also provides information about the evolution of modal damping ratios and about the variability of the modal parameters among the 11 guitars. Knowledge of the evolution of modal parameters can be of great help for luthiers, for example to make a selection of suitable separated parts at the beginning of the making process. Knowledge of the modal parameter variability at each stage can help separating the respective influence of raw material properties and making process.",

The dependency of the voltage gain, the efficiency (the ratio of the output over the input power) and the effective electromechanical coupling coefficient of the piezoelectric transformer on the geometrical dimensions are analyzed. Meanwhile, the load dependency of the electromechanical parameters of the transformer is also investigated. It is concluded that the electromechanical characteristics of the piezoelectric transformer are closely related with the geometrical dimensions and the load electrical impedance. The conclusions can be used for the optimization design of the ring-type piezoelectric ceramic transformers in the engineering applications.",

Special focus is laid on the modification of the jet evolution in space and time when small varicose vibrations are excited externally on the walls of the second constriction (ventricular folds) in the supraglottal space. The experiments are carried out in a water flow channel representing a 3:1 upscaled model of the glottal region. Instead of fixed walls in the second constriction we use silicone membranes with an internal air cushion. Sinusoidal pressure oscillations of various frequencies are excited from outside pressure lines. Flow studies show that the glottal deflection in the supraglottal space is highly sensitive to these weak oscillations, hinting on the non-linear interaction of the oscillatory waves with the shear-layer roll-up of the jet. This is known as modelocking in jet dynamics and is expected to have consequences on the sound spectrum in phonation, too.",

    "abstract": "When constructing a tyre, it is of importance that improvements and planned changes are not only physically measurable, but that they also can be perceived by a listener. Tyre/road noise becomes a more important focus area, especially with the growing market of electric vehicles. In the design of tyre/road sound, there are three main aims: to reduce the overall sound level, to increase pleasantness and to do so still maintaining the carried information about e.g. driving conditions. To be able to do this, an understanding of how physical changes in a tyre are reflected in the perception of the same tyre is essential. In the present study, the aim is thus to determine if the rolling noise of a tyre can be both differentiated and characterized by its perceptual qualities. The focus is on the perception of the sound outside the car, perceived by, for example, a pedestrian. Listeners have judged different road tyre combinations and their perception in terms of their emotional responses (pleasantness, activation and stress) and their psychoacoustic responses (loudnes s, sharpness, roughness, and pitch). The results confirmed that rolling noise can be perceptually differentiated. Further, it is possible to differentiate between the effects of the street and the effects of the tyre on all emotional and most psychoacoustic parameters. The results suggest that changes to both road surfaces and tyres can affect both emotional and psychoacoustic perceptual qualities.",

    "abstract": "The loudness related to a sound may vary according to the localization of its source.This phenomenon is described as directional loudness and has been mainly observed for high-frequency sounds and for sources located in the horizontal plane.Because of the acoustic shadow of the head, the left and right ear pressures are modied depending on the source azimuth and the global loudness resulting from a summation process may vary accordingly.But directional loudness has also been reported to occur at 400 Hz, where shadowing eects are usually rather small.It might therefore be suspected that directional loudness eects could be inuenced by other parameters involved in the localization process.In a previous study, a small but signicant increase of loudness with increasing interaural time dierence (ITD) was shown for low-frequency pure tones (200 and 400 Hz) at a low loudness level (40 phon).The present study aimed at getting insight into the potential cause and extent of this eect by assessing the loudness of similar pure tones lateralized with headphones by applying an interaural level dierence (ILD) in addition to an ITD and by measuring the eect of ITD at the hearing threshold.It showed signicant eects of both ILD and ITD on loudness, and no interaction between these factors.As the eects added even when the factors were contradictory, it supports the hypothesis that the eect is caused by the ITD itself and is not related to the localization process.However, the ITD eect was not signicant at the hearing threshold.",

    "abstract": "Due to variabilities in the material, the geometrical configuration, or the manufacturing properties, a structure that is designed to be spatially periodic cannot be exactly periodic. The presence of small irregularities in a nearly periodic structure may influence the propagation of the vibration field, the field being localised. A number of papers have addressed such localisation phenomena. This paper will instead focus on the mean vibration field and its influence on sound radiation and sound insulation in a plate stiffened by supports or beams. The approach is to seek a formal solution with the aid of spatial transform technique (similar to the perfect periodic case) and then apply the expected value operator to the solution. Two assumptions must then be introduced: 1) The reaction forces are statistically independent of a phase-term that is due to the irregularity, and 11) the mean field is periodic. The approach is presented in general terms, the specific configuration (a stiffened plate) being presented as an example. Numerical results are presented and discussed, and it can be seen that the small irregularities cause an increase in stiffness and damping (when material damping is present). (Less)",

    "abstract": "Two different techniques for the evaluation of reverberation time are compared for the subjective reverberance in an auditorium. The first is an existing technique where the reverberation time is obtained from the best straight-line fit to the measured decay curve that has been smoothed by the Schroeder integrated impulse method. The second is a proposed technique which accounts for the 50-ms average response time of the human ear and the 3-dB just-detectable loudness change of the ear, and is so-called subjective evaluation of reverberation time. As a result, the total acoustic energies in successive 50-ms intervals of the decay are calculated, and considering the decay of the total energy, the reverberation time is calculated by interpolation. The direct sound is included in the first 50-ms interval, and the 3-dB just-detectable loudness change is included for the first and its adjacent 50-ms intervals. For exponential or near-exponential decays at the associated audience seats in the auditorium, the reverberation times produced by both techniques are close to each other and correlate well to the impression of reverberance from a subjective test at these seats. The first technique is thus sufficient to obtain a reverberation time which can describe the extent of reverberation sensed by the ear. However, for highly non-exponential decays at other seats, the reverberation times evaluated by both techniques can be significantly different, and those from the second technique correlate better to the results of the subjective test. The reverberation time calculation must thus incorporate the perception limits of the ear where the first 10 dB of the decay is affected most by the limits. This paper provides an understanding of the evaluation of reverberation time for subjective reverberance under different decay conditions.",

The idea is to create 3D sound using loudspeakers and visual tracking of the position of the listener. Previously, applications of binaural technology using loudspeakers have been limited due to the small sweet spot of such systems. Recently visual tracking has emerged as a feasible option for overcoming these limitations. Although it is a difficult task to predict the position of the listener relative to the loudspeakers in any given situation, under certain conditions it is possible to track the position of the listener relative to the loudspeakers. Here it is shown that it is possible to track the position of a listener that is not wearing any sensors by using image processing techniques, while the audio system is adapted using filter update techniques that are seamless as far as the audible perception of the listener is concerned.",

Accurate analytic results for these new shapes of backing electrode are not available until now whereas current applications (metrology, miniaturisation) arise which need more refined modelling. Therefore the present paper aims at providing an analytical description of the strong coupling between a fluid layer trapped between an axisymmetrically curved smooth backing wall and a circularvibrating membrane (the thickness of the fluid layer depends on the radial coordinate) using modelling wherein viscosity, heat conduction, inertia and compressibility of the fluid are considered, beyond realistic boundary conditions (no slip condition and no temperature variations near the walls). Solutions are given as the sum of an expansion on eigenfunctions of the membrane in vacua and an extended power series (using Frobenius method) to overcome the limitations of a standard electrical equivalent network analysis in the frequency range of interest (up to 100kHz for circular membranes approximately one millimetre in diameter). The results obtained provide tools for optimising the design of such small electrostatic transducers.",

Due to the spectral and temporal variations between speech segments, the effect of such processing is likely to vary across the signal. To facilitate the analysis of these varying effects, a Danish speech corpus for measuring the perception of individual phonemes was developed. More than 1150 nonsense words were created according to a common template and audio-visually recorded with two male and two female talkers. Carrier sentences were also recorded. The audio recordings of all words were presented to ten normal-hearing listeners to ensure that phoneme recognition scores under optimal conditions were close to 100%. Accepted words were compiled into test lists with different characteristics. These lists were evaluated with seven normal-hearing listeners to determine norm data and to investigate memory effects. The speech recognition thresholds (SRTs) of the test lists varied between −7 to −0.9 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) depending on list type and talker. The recognition score sensitivity to the SNR was 5.2 to 8.9%/dB. Memory effects were small and not significant. The presented speech materials seem well suited for measuring phoneme recognition scores and thus for assessing signal processing effects that vary across speech segments.",

The implications of assuming that the specific acoustic impedance is entirely resistive are also considered. An analysis of the accuracy of the proposed approach is presented for a reference case.

This device provides broadband vibrational energy harvesting and sensing facilities intended for underwater wireless sensor networks. The transducer is composed of two acrylic glass (PMMA) half-spherical shells and a Pz26 piezoelectric ring clamped between the two shells. A simulation model of vibrational energy harvesting has been developed with electromechanical circuits for thickness and radial vibrational modes. This approach was validated by a finite element simulation. As a result, optimal power harvesting conditions and estimated harvested voltage were defined. A prototype of 2.2 cm in diameter was realized and characterized. Analysis in air environment reveals several structural resonance modes in the 20–80 kHz frequency range. The directivity patterns corresponding to these modes was obtained using laser Doppler vibrometry. The measurements for the underwater environment show that the structural resonance modes shift down in frequency to the 10–60 kHz range, and exhibiting low directivity dependence. Power harvesting performances was measured and quantified relative to acoustical pres- sure measurements using a hydrophone. The average conversion coefficient value was found to be in the order of 3 V/MPa. In broadband excitation mode, and for an acoustic pressure of 10 kPa, the amount of harvested power out of 5 main resonance modes is 3.3 μW.",

    "abstract": "Presented are the results of laboratory experiments on investigating manifestations of acoustic emission (AE) of a gouge-filled fault during stick-slip. The laboratory experiments were held at the slider-model setup, when a granite block slides along a rough granite base under normal and shear loads. In the course of experiments we altered the structure of the two-component filler of the fault and focused on variations of the AE parameters. The kinematic parameters of fault slip events in all the realizations remained approximately the same. The eff ect of gouge structure on the statistics of AE has been revealed. An alteration of proportion of quartz sand / glass beads in the filler of the fault was accompanied by an alteration of the b -value of frequency-energy distribution from 0.53 to 0.85, and the p -value of Omori law from 1.00 to 2.06. Also, it has been demonstrated that the nucleation of a slip event is accompanied by an alteration of the mechanism of AE generation – at the initial stage the 'tensile crack' signals prevailed, while at the final stage – the 'shear crack' signals did. The alteration of AE genesis manifested vividly in a corresponding alteration of the emitted waveforms for all the realizations.",

    "abstract": "Virtual acoustic environments have demonstrated their versatility for conducting studies in various research areas as they allow easy manipulations of experimental test conditions or simulated acoustic scenes, while providing expansion possibilities to related interdisciplinary and multimodal fields. Although the evolution of auditory and cognitive models is consistently pursued, listening experiments are still considered the gold standard, usually necessitating a large amount of resources, including travel expenses of study participants. In order to facilitate practical and efficient study execution, we therefore implemented a mobile hearing laboratory by acoustically optimising the interior of a caravan. All necessary technical facilities were integrated to perform listening experiments in virtual acoustic environments under controlled conditions directly on site, for example, in front of schools or senior residential centers. The design and construction of this laboratory are presented and evaluated based on insulation properties, selected room acoustic parameters, and interior ambient noise levels that are to be expected during operation at representative test sites. Limitations, particularly in low-frequency insulation performance, should provide incentives for further optimisations in similar future projects.",

This global loudness asymmetry was found to be larger for pure tones than for broadband noises. In this study, our aim was to determine whether this difference between pure tones and noises is due to the difference in bandwidth between sounds or to the difference in the strength of the sensation of pitch. The loudness asymmetry was measured for broadband and for narrow-band signals that do or do not elicit a sensation of pitch. The asymmetry was greater for sounds that elicit a sensation of pitch whatever their bandwidth. The loudness model for time varying sounds [1] predicted well the asymmetry for the broadband noise that does not elicit a sensation of pitch and for a multi-tonal sound. For the other sounds the asymmetry was greater than predicted. It is known that loudness and pitch interact. The difference in asymmetry between sounds that elicit pitch and sounds that do not elicit pitch might be due to this interaction.",

    "abstract": "In some special situations the wind-induced noise of perforated plates may show strong power enhancement in a certain frequency band and hence exhibits a character. This problem is investigated experimentally in laboratory and some test results are presented in this paper. It is shown that the phenomenon happens only when the incident angle of the wind is relatively large to the perforated panel; say between 60 and 80 degrees. There seems an optimum wind speed corresponding to the size of the holes for this phenomenon. The peak frequency of the tone-like signal is mainly determined by the thickness of the plate and the size of the holes and can be roughly estimated from the geometry of the plate and the wind speed. The condition when the tone-like phenomenon may happen seems very much dependent on the perforation pattern along the wind direction. Same perforated plate may produce totally different sound in the same wind condition if the orientation of the plate is changed. Randomized hole size and distribution may help to reduce the tone-like signal and hence the total wind-induced noise. Possible explanations of the phenomenon are discussed.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes the intensity potential approach for prediction of high-frequency sound power radiation. The approach is based on the Helmholtz decomposition of the vector field of time-averaged sound intensity into its irrotational and rotational components. The local power balance in a lossless medium is expressed in terms of the irrotational component only, and results in the Poisson equation for a scalar intensity potential of this component only. The approach gives an exact expression for the sound power through any closed surface in terms of the irrotational component, provided that the boundary conditions are correct. The approach is evaluated by exploring the two intensity components in three canonical examples, and by comparison to measured data with special focus on directivity aspects. It is concluded that the intensity potential approach is relevant, in particular for high-frequency sound fields from multiple sources that are uncorrelated and broadbanded. However, the intensity is generally overestimated in the shadow zones and underestimated in the directly exposed regions. Further, peaks in narrow frequency bands associated with interference of waves are ignored.",

The suggested reflection coefficient employs the radiation impedance of a finite surface by combining the radiation impedance of an infinitely large surface and that of the finite surface backed by an infinite rigid baffle. For 28 surface impedance values that are assigned to all the boundary surfaces, the suggested reflection coefficient is found to improve low frequency responses compared to the infinite panel theory; larger improvements are found for a more disproportionate room, more absorptive surfaces, and surfaces having larger negative phase angles of the surface impedance. A larger improvement is also found for a nonuniform absorption case than for a uniform absorption setting having a similar equivalent absorption coefficient.",

    "abstract": "Sound masking can improve speech privacy in rooms by increasing background-noise levels that mask distracting speech sounds. The Lombard Effect indicates that an increase in background-noise level can increase talker voice levels, reducing speech privacy and the benefit of a sound-masking system. To investigate this, a model of an existing open-plan office was created in CATT-Acoustics and validated. The model was used to predict speech-transmission index (STI) and the effectiveness of a sound-masking system, without and with the Lombard Effect, described by the existing Lombard Voice Model. Predictions were made for ambient-noise levels of 30, 40, and 45 dBA, at various distances from a primary talker, and for 0–4 secondary talkers. With 30-dBA ambient noise, STIs at 1 and 4 m varied with the number of talkers from 0.67 to 0.91 and 0.23 to 0.62 without the sound-masking system, from 0.58 to 0.70 and 0.13 to 0.25 with it but ignoring the Lombard Effect, and from 0.64 to 0.73 and 0.18 to 0.27 with the Lombard Effect. The Lombard Effect reduced the benefit of the sound-masking system by 3–9% and 7–22%. With higher ambient noise, the system is less effective; the Lombard Effect can almost cancel its benefit, resulting in increased STI (decreased privacy) with the system operating.",

    "abstract": "There is an auditorium operating as a discussion room and lecture room at the Municipal Library of Vyborg, Russia (built during Finnish rule when the city's name was Viipuri in Finnish), designed by Aalto and built in 1933―35, where the wave-shaped ceiling has been especially designed to enhance the acoustics and make every position within the room acoustically equivalent. No matter where a speaker is standing, he is supposed to be heard equally well all over the room. The corrugated ceiling has therefore been constructed to distribute sound optimally, at least from the point of view of a ray theoretical analysis. The numerical study presented here shows that the corrugation is such that the ray approach is not exactly valid due to diffraction effects that must be incorporated as well. A detailed description of the sound distribution as a function of the position of the sound source and the receiver is presented for different situations including the exact configuration of Aalto's auditorium. The used approach is constrained in terms of frequencies by the corrugation dimensions of the auditorium. Practically it means that the theory can predict correct results up to 800 Hz, which is 70% of the frequencies commonly of interest in speech or music. Additional effects caused by windows, pillars near the windows and downstand beams hidden above the ceiling are not considered. The acquired knowledge is important for future construction of similar rooms.",

However, we still have a poor understanding of how auditory spatial information is encoded in the cortex and of the relative contribution of different cortical areas to spatial hearing. Electrophysiological recordings from neurons in the primary auditory cortex (Al) have shown that their spatial selectivity is shaped by a combination of binaural interactions and spectral cues provided by the external ears. Neurons with similar binaural and spatial response properties appear to be arranged in clusters, although there is no conclusive evidence for any topographic order in spatial selectivity within the cortex. Recent studies using virtual acoustic space stimuli, which simulate over headphones all the localization cues associated with real sound sources, have shed light on the way in which those cues are processed by A neurons and on the factors that influence the development of their spatial response properties.",

The modelling is a generalisation of the classical models: it includes a generalized mechanical impedance of the membrane, and an adapted approach to derive separately both a generalized reactance and a generalized resistance due respectively to the compressibility and the viscosity of the fluid-gap (beyond the inertia). Finally, theoretical results on the sensitivity of miniaturised microphones as a function of the frequency are provided and discussed.",

The first term is related to the scattering amplitude in the modified Bom approximation, a variant of the well known Bom approximation. The second term constitutes a correction which is of the order of impedance mismatch between the scatterer and the surrounding medium. Numerical comparisons of this formula with exact results have been performed. It is shown that the new approximation betters the modified Born approximation and other variants of the Born approximation as the weak scatterer condition for the validity of Born type approximations is relaxed.",

In any case, the angle of the bow with the violin (skewness) is likely to form an important control parameter, which has hardly been addressed in scientific studies of violin performance. In the current study measurements of skewness in violin and viola performance are presented, and possible explanations of the observed behavior are offered. The results provide strong indications of that skewness fulfills an important function in controlling bow-bridge distance, integrated in players' performance strategies.",

    "abstract": "To assess the quality of speech communication, reference is usually made to speech intelligibility, but what does that mean for practical speech conditions? Even with high signal-to-noise ratios speech intelligibility alone falls short of what is required for a broader scope of differentiation. The pursued objective here is to improve the description of the communication situation which means paying more attention to the perception and comprehension processes with the main focus on the listener's efforts to cope with the situation or the stress and strain he experiences. In two experiments - on speech intelligibility and the assessment of the comprehension process -listeners were presented sentences and monosyllables at six different speech levels (40 to 75 dB) and varying traffic noises (55 dB). For each sentence both speech intelligibility and answers to assessment questions concerning coping, concentration, annoyance, and subjectively rated intelligibility (on a 5-point scale) have been evaluated. The answers to the assessment questions always refer to three different sentences with the same experimental conditions. As a result, assessment parameters have shown to be more sensitive, especially in cases where speech intelligibility is nearly constant (for levels of high speech intelligibility: SI > 80%, SNR > 5 dB). The data indicates that not until a signal- to-noise ratio of beyond SNR A > 15 to 20 dB high intelligibility with lowest possible mental effort can be achieved. The noise level has a particular influence on the level of annoyance (always at the same SNR) whereas a simultaneously applied task only affects one's concentration. Based on the assessment of coping and concentration five quality levels for the comprehension process have been developed.",

    "abstract": "The interaction between turbulent flames and isolated acoustic waves is a problem of fundamental interest with practical applications, for example for a better understanding of combustion instabilities. After developing a specific version of the well-known Rayleigh's criterion, allowing to investigate local amplification or damping of an acoustic pulse interacting with a reaction front, extensive investigations have been carried out on this subject. The present publication summarizes the main conclusions of all these studies. Premixed as well as non-premixed flames have been considered, using different fuels. All these investigations rely on high-fidelity models and high-accuracy methods, in order to reproduce quantitatively all important physical processes controlling this configuration. Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) employing detailed physical models are best suited for this purpose, but lead to considerable requirements in terms of computing time. Due to these very high computational costs, first studies considered only two-dimensional flows. It is then questionable how general the obtained results can be for real turbulence. Therefore, the investigations have been later on extended to three-dimensional flows. A dedicated compressible DNS code has been developed for this purpose. For all DNS computations the developed Rayleigh's criterion then allows to quantify amplification or damping and to examine the reason for it. Strong focusing effects, highly local amplification and damping phenomena are observed. The influence of individual reactions and species on the damping process can also be quantified in this manner.",

    "abstract": "Active fish tracking sonars (AFTS) were used in 2001 to study fish movement in response to intake occlusion plates at The Dalles Dam on the Columbia River. AFTS provides three-dimensional fish tracks by aligning the axis of a split-beam transducer with a fish target. High-speed stepper motors move the transducer so that a tracked target remains on-axis. Occlusion plates with lateral extensions covered the top half of the turbine intakes to produce a fish friendly near-dam environment. Two AFTS were positioned at the center of Main Unit 1, one each for monitoring installed and removed plate conditions. A regression analysis showed that occlusion plates had pronounced effects on fish movement along the dam. The plates appeared to inhibit movement toward the spillway, movement toward the dam (especially in front of the turbine intake), and movement downward toward the turbines. Fish fate (as opposed to movement directions from regression slopes) into particular areas was determined using Markov-chain analysis. The sluiceway (a safer passage route above the turbine intake) zone of influence was larger with the occlusion plates installed, contrary to the regression results. In addition, the probability of passage out the near turbine and bottom sides of the sample volume wasmore » about 50% lower with occlusion plates installed.« less",

In the presence of a long downstream pipe, the oscillation frequency is well predicted by means of a model assuming a single mechanical degree of freedom for the lips. A minimum of the threshold pressure for buzzing is observed when the lips are just closed at rest. The magnitude of this threshold pressure is underestimated by the model. In order to fit experiments the quality factor of the lip resonance has to be reduced by a factor two compared to the measured quality factor. In the absence of downstream pipe the threshold pressure increases by a factor three and a jump in oscillation frequency from one mechanical lip-mode to another one is observed as the lung pressure is increased. An attempt to describe this behavior by means of a 2-mass-model fails.",

Nevertheless, since such Lamb waves are often generated by means of bounded beams, here, a study is revealed, based on Schlieren photography, of the interaction of a bounded beam, incident near the edge of a plate at the Lamb angle. The study shows that retro reflection occurs of the generated Lamb waves and that more complicated mode conversion takes place whenever the border of the beam reaches the edge of the plate. The difference is shown between scattering of the A 1 and the S1 Lamb mode. Furthermore, it is shown that Lamb waves excite a radiating acoustic multipole when encountering the edge of the plate.",

The model quantifies the effect of the lagging sound over the angular position and the width of the perceived auditory event, and incorporates some well-known aspects of the precedence effect in a single framework. Two sound source localisation experiments were carried out in order to show the utility of the proposed model. In the first experiment, the localisation accuracy for single sound sources was measured. In the second experiment, the subjects localised spectrally coherent lead-lag stimulus pairs with different angular separations. The responses were analysed using the proposed model. It is shown that the model can be used for assessing the fusion, localisation dominance, and the lag discrimination suppression aspects of the precedence effect as well as the associated widening of the auditory event.",

However, when the airflow or acoustic pressure in a duct is large and the end plate of the expansion chamber silencer is not thick enough, the effect of the vibration of the end plate should not be ignored. In this paper, based on a coupling of the BEM and the finite element method (FEM), the numerical results illustrate the existence of the effect on the TL of the vibrating end plates. Furthermore, numerical experiments also show that for an expansion chamber of constant size, the thicker the end plate, the less influence the vibration of the end plate has on the TL. And this may be helpful for the design of silencer.",

In this paper, we provide an original procedure for obtaining high acoustic absorption of single and multi-layered panels with predefined microstructure. The procedure uses the homogenisation technique for obtaining effective properties of an airsaturated material and solution to acoustic problems. We study a certain topology of the material and point out the effect of matrix material stiffness on the results of the optimisation procedure. We demonstrate that for stiff and rigid frames of a single layer, the optimal design parameters do not differ much whereas for the soft frames, the same results may significantly change. Moreover, we show that the absorption properties can be essentially improved by arrangements of different materials (soft, stiff and air) in sandwich panels. It is also possible to design a material which efficiently absorbs acoustic energy at low frequencies which is hard to achieve by means of conventional materials.",

This paper aims at evaluating on site the field performance of such building base isolation. Two performance indicators are defined and used, both expressed as insertion gain: a Power Flow insertion Gain (PFIG) based on the power transmitted to the building upper-structure, and a Building Insertion Gain Indicator (BIGI) based on the building floor velocities. The paper shows that both indicators can be used to evaluate the field performance of base-isolated buildings: the PFIG can be indirectly obtained from local measurements of the isolator transmissibility and some knowledge of the mobility magnitudes of the building structures in contact and the BIGI indirectly obtained from measurements of the treated building transmissibility (as defined in ISO/TS 14837-31) and some knowledge of the transmissibility of similar but untreated buildings. The methods are successfully validated using a numerical model of a 2D ground-building configuration easy to calculate and assumed realistic enough. The paper ends with a discussion on the practicality of obtaining these performances on- site in real buildings.",

This paper gives a detailed description of a newly developed sound source system allowing simultaneous monaural stimulation of listeners with infrasound and audio-sound stimuli in psychoacoustic experiments. The sound source system covers a frequency range between 4 Hz and 6000 Hz. It can generate infrasound stimuli and audio-sound stimuli up to at least 123 dB SPL and 80 dB SPL, respectively, with inaudible harmonic distortions. Likewise, during simultaneous generation of high-level infrasound and audio sound, residual unwanted modulation frequencies remain imperceptible, owing to special design features. It can be concluded that the sound source system is suitable for investigating the auditory perception of infrasound accompanied by audio sound.",

The jet is issued from a nozzle having the exit dimensions of 20 cm in width and 2 cm in height h. The jet Reynolds number, based on the nozzle height and jet exit velocity U j , is varied up to 7.0 · 10 4 . Acoustic measurements revealed the distinct variations in the noise levels with different plate lengths. The L/h = 2.5 wall jet has an increase in noise levels by around 10 dB compared to that of a free jet (background noise). Wall jets in the range of L/h = 5 to 20 radiate higher noise levels compared to other plates, while the least noise emissions are observed from fully developed wall jets ( L/h &gt; 20). The significant sources identified for noise emissions are the trailing edge and the secondary shear layer in the wall jets. The low frequency noise corresponding to the Strouhal number (based on h ) below 0.2 is characterized as the trailing edge noise. The spectra of the wall jets collapse in the Strouhal number range (based on the inner layer thickness of wall jets) of ∼0.2 to 1.0 indicating the secondary shear layer noise of wall jets.",

The dimensions of a bicylindrical resonator are optimized numerically to approximate a saxophone impedance. The target is the impedance measured on an usual saxophone. A classical gradient-based non-linear least-square fit function is used. Several cost functions corresponding to distances to the target impedance are assessed, according to their influence on the optimal geometry. Compromises appear between the frequency regions depending on the cost function. It is shown that the chosen cost functions are differentiable and locally convex. The convexity region contains the initial geometrical dimensions obtained by crude approximation of the first resonance frequency of the target. One optimal geometry is submitted to further analysis using descriptors of the impedance. Its deviations from the target saxophone are put into perspective with the discrepancies between the target saxophone and a saxophone from a different manufacture. Descriptors such as harmonicity or impedance peak ratio set the bicylindrical resonator apart from saxophone resonators, despite a good agreement of the resonance frequencies. Therefore, a reed instrument with a bicylindrical resonator could be tuned to produce the same notes as a saxophone, but due to differences in the intrinsic characteristics of the resonator, it should be considered not as a saxophone but as a distinct instrument.",

    "abstract": "Amplitude modulation (AM) is a characteristic of wind turbine noise that has only been recognised as an issue in recent years. It is a characteristic related to aerodynamic noise and descriptions of it include \"swishing\", \"whooshing\" or less frequently a \"thumping\" sound. Due to increased awareness among exposed communities AM presents a potentially serious obstacle to future wind farm developments. This work reports on the application of a recently developed calculation method for AM in a practical setting. Correlations will be drawn with subjective reports of AM by nearby residents keeping a noise diary. The suitability of the method and its ability to quantitatively confirm subjective reports of AM will be assessed. A study is presented here whereby subjectively recorded occurrences of AM by residents living near a wind energy development in Ireland are correlated to calculated levels over a twenty day period. In order to detect and calculate AM a method published by the Amplitude Modulation Working Group of the Institute of Acoustics, referred to as the Reference Method, is applied. A subjective assessment of the sound recordings to confirm the presence of AM is discussed, including estimating the expected frequency range that AM occurs. The results of the Reference Method calculation are presented for periods with and without a subjective report of AM by the residents. Consideration is given to the criteria and thresholds for valid AM ratings within the Reference Method especially where intermittent periods of AM are identified. The Reference Method is shown to be highly suitable as a quantitative measure of AM which correlates well with subjective reports. Caution must be taken when using the method as valid periods of AM may be overlooked due to the rigorous detection thresholds set by the method.",

    "abstract": "Over many years, scientists and engineers have developed a broad variety of mathematical formulations to investigate the propagation and interactions with flow of flow-induced noise in early-stage of product design and development. Beside established theories such as the linearized Euler equations (LEE), the linearized Navier–Stokes equations (LNSE) and the acoustic perturbation equations (APE) which are described in an Eulerian framework, Galbrun utilized a mixed Lagrange–Eulerian framework to reduce the number of unknowns by representing perturbations by means of particle displacement only. Despite the advantages of fewer degrees of freedom and the reduced effort to solve the system equations, a computational approach using standard continuous finite element methods (FEM) suff ers from instabilities called spurious modes that pollute the solution. In this work, the authors employ a discontinuous Galerkin approach to overcome the difficulties related to spurious modes while solving Galbrun's equation in a mixed and pure displacement based formulation. The results achieved with the proposed approach are compared with results from previous attempts to solve Galbrun's equation. The numerical determination of acoustic modes and the identification of vortical modes is discussed. Furthermore, case studies for a lined-duct and an annulus supporting a rotating shear-flow are investigated.",

    "abstract": "According to existing methods for the assessment of hearing damage, signals with the same A-weighted equivalent level should pose the same hazard to the auditory system. As a measure of hazard, it is assumed that Temporary Thresholds Shifts (TTS) reflect the onset of alterations to the hearing system that, if continued, will eventually lead to a permanent damage. Under this premise, results from a TTS experiment using three different band-pass signals derived from broad-band noise are presented. TTS was determined for 9 subjects exposed to three 2-octave bands of noise: Low (125 to 500 Hz), mid (0.5 to 2 kHz), and high (2 to 8 kHz). The band-pass signals were adjusted to give the same equivalent A-weighted sound exposure according to ISO-1999 [1] and were presented to one ear of the subjects in three separate experimental sessions. The results showed that there is a great difference in the subjects response to the exposures. The highest TTS with the longest recovery was observed after the high-band exposure. The mid-band exposure also resulted in high levels of TTS, but with shorter recovery. The low-band exposure did not show any statistically significant TTS. These results contradict the assumptions made using the A-weighting curve for the assessment of hearing damage. By modifying exposure ratings to compensate for the build-up of energy at mid and high-frequencies (above 1 kHz) due to the presence of the listener in the sound field and for the levels below an effect threshold that does not induce changes in hearing (equivalent quiet levels), ratings of the sound exposure that reflect the observed temporary changes in auditory function can be obtained.",

These thin mufflers are commonly employed in domestic refrigeration compressors because of the limited space in such compressors. The point source model has convergence problems at points close to the source, whereas the surface source model may generate a non-uniform pressure distribution on the source surface. A new square line source model was implemented in this study. Using this new model, a generic formulation of four-pole parameters by the modal expansion method was developed in two different curvilinear coordinates, enabling TL to be calculated. To verify the proposed line source model, the TL results for a cylindrical thin muffler were compared with those obtained by the three-dimensional finite element method (FEM). The TLs of rectangular and cylindrical mufflers with various inlet/outlet positions and dimensions were investigated. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can determine the effects of higher-order modes on TLs. In addition, comparison with the circular line source model revealed that the proposed square line source model is computationally efficient and can determine TLs with a sufficiently high accuracy.",

The PTP values of seventeen excised canine larynges with 0% to 15% bilateral vocal fold elongations in 5% elongation steps were measured using an excised larynx phonation system. It was found that twelve larynges exhibited a monotonic relationship between PTP and elongation; in these larynges, the 0% elongation condition had the lowest PTP. Five larynges exhibited a PTP minimum at 5% elongation. To provide a theoretical explanation of these phenomena, a two-mass model was modified to simulate vibration of the elongated vocal folds. Two pairs of longitudinal springs were used to represent the longitudinal elastin in the vocal folds. This model showed that when the vocal folds were elongated, the increased longitudinal tension would increase the PTP value and the increased vocal fold length would decrease the PTP value. The antagonistic effects contributed by these two factors were found to be able to cause either a monotonic or a non-monotonic relationship between PTP and elongation, which were consistent with experimental observations. Because PTP describes the ease of phonation, this study suggests that there may exist a nonzero optimal vocal fold elongation for the greatest ease for phonation in some larynges.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic liners are widely used in jet engine inlet and exhaust ducts, as a passive means of noise reduction. One possible way of liner optimization is the use of a non-uniform acoustic impedance distribution. It has been shown that such a liner can lead to an attenuation in the acoustic amplitude of some of the modes present in the duct. However, the sound attenuation perceived by an observer in the far-field is arguably the most important effect to be achieved. These issues may be illustrated by considering the radiation of sound from a cylindrical duct with impedance varying circumferentially, axially or in both directions and the acoustic pressure at the far-field in each situation. The radiation of sound from an open pipe is represented by a pressure distribution on a disk, viz. the exit plane. The radiation of sound in free space, i.e. without obstacles, is specified by a Kirchhof integral. The source distribution on the duct exit plane, which allows the evaluation of radiation integrals, is specified by the radial, axial, and circumferential modes, in the cylindrical nozzle. The evaluation of the radiation integrals show that (i) the total acoustic field consists of a spherical wave multiplying a sum of radial modes n = 1, . . . ,∞ and azimuthal modes of odd order only m = 1,3,5, . . . ; (ii) each mode consists of a monopole term and a dipole term and depend on the frequency and the radial wavenumbers, determined by the boundary condition at the duct wall. When the impedance distribution varies circumferentially or axially, the evaluation of the wavenumbers involves the determination of the roots of an infinite determinant, while when the impedance aries both axially and circumferentially, the roots of a doubly infinite determinant have to be calculated. In the case of external noise of an aircraft, the observer is on the ground, at a distance much greater than the duct diameter, and the radiation integrals for an observer in the far-field can be simplified, since the dipole term is weak. The evaluation of the acoustic pressure for an observer in the far-field, shows that it depends on the radial wavenumbers in the nozzle, which are specified by the wall boundary conditions, and thus depend on the acoustic impedance distribution. This allows comparison of hard-walled nozzles, with liners with constant impedance and non-uniform liners, the latter with impedance distribution varying circumferentially, axially or in both directions. The far-field acoustic pressure is specified by a directivity factor that is calculated for several values of the parameters for each of the cases mentioned above.",

In this work, an analytical method for predicting both the absorption coefficient and the transmission loss of hybrid active/passive multilayered cells and the associated experimental investigation are presented. These cells combine passive and active control by using passive layers and an active plate. Passive layers consist of absorbing materials located on the reception side in order to increase absorption over a wide frequency range. The active plate vibrates as a secondary source in order to reduce sound transmission at low and/or at resonance frequencies. To validate the analytical approach, measurement methods in ducts based on the scattering-matrix description are applied to characterise three types of system: (i)-passive discontinuities such as multilayered sandwiches including porous layers (ii)-active discontinuities here the active plate playing the secondary source role, (iii)-hybrid cells equipped with active control system. For these three cases, the correspondence between theoretical simulations and experimental results is satisfactory.",

The resulting theoretical expressions are numerically validated. Assuming small and local perturbations the non-linear effects appear to be strongest for sound speed perturbations taking place close to the lower turning depths of the corresponding eigenrays. At the upper turning depths ― in the case of temperate propagation conditions ― the effects are much weaker due to the larger sound speed gradients. The magnitude of the second-order sensitivity of travel times relative to the first-order sensitivity can be used to obtain an estimate for the limits of linearity.",

Thresholds were determined from 0.25 to 2 kHz in 1 / 2 -octave steps for up to 20 min after the exposure. The results showed that the maximum affected frequency was 1 / 2 octave above the exposure frequency. In the second experiment, the TTS recovery curve produced by a 1-kHz pure tone exposure was assessed at 1.5 kHz, at approximately 15 s intervals for the first 5 min and at regularly increasing intervals up to 45 min after the exposure. The results showed a maximum in the recovery around 2 min after the exposure. The data gathered in these experiments were used to construct a mathematical model of TTS recovery. The model describes both the 1 / 2 -octave shift and the 2-min bounce and it can be used in the comparison of temporary changes in the auditory function, assessed at different times and frequencies.",

One of the results of this study is the finding that this is not true for ultrasonic waves in plates whose is shown to be a function of frequency. The of anisotropy occurs for plate waves in all anisotropic materials including fibre-reinforced composites. The physical reason for the dispersion of velocity is concerned with frequency dependent wave structure which activates different elasticity for various propagation directions. To probe of a certain stiffness component (e.g. Young's modulus), the plate wave fields should be kept similar by variation in operation frequency. The phase velocity and its frequency dependence provide frequency variation of the beam steering angle for plate waves (dispersion of beam steering). This effect is important to be accounted for in various applications since the plate waves are widely used for non-destructive evaluation of composite materials. A strong frequency-dependent focusing of ultrasonic energy (dispersion of phonon focusing) occurs for a 0 -waves in unidirectional carbon fibre reinforced composite. The phonon focusing prevents omni-directional wave propagation that might pose a problem in the plate wave applications for structural health monitoring. The results presented indicate that the effect of plate wave and its implications can be enhanced or diminished by matching the operation frequency.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a numerical method for predicting the sound reduction index of a double wall including an active control system and a porous layer inside the double wall cavity is presented. The double wall is placed in a laboratory situation between an emission and a reception room. Active control sources and error microphones are distributed in two vertical planes located inside the double wall cavity. The secondary sources role is to improve the sound reduction index at low frequencies by reducing the acoustical pressure at microphone positions created by the primary source placed inside the emission room. The simulation principle is based on the decoupled Green method where the radiated pressure inside the reception room is deduced from the double wall velocity and from the reception room Green's functions. The double wall and the active control system are modelled by finite element method using Nastran software. The two rooms Green's functions are analytically modelled using a modal method. The model allows investigating effects of various parameters on active control efficiency, such as the effect of evanescent modes inside the double wall cavity, the double wall cavity thickness, the number of control channels as well as the effect of a porous layer inserted inside the double wall cavity placed between secondary sources plane and error microphones plane.",

The composite transducer is composed of a radially polarized piezoelectric ceramic ring and a metal ring. The radial vibrations of the radially polarized piezoelectric ring and the metal ring are analyzed and their electro-mechanical equivalent circuits are obtained. Based on the mechanical boundary conditions between the piezoelectric ring and the metal ring, the six-port electro-mechanical equivalent circuit of the radially composite ultrasonic transducer is obtained and the frequency equation is given. The theoretical relationship between the resonance/anti-resonance frequency and the effective electro-mechanical coupling coefficient with the geometrical dimensions of the composite transducer is analyzed. At the same time, the radial vibration of the composite transducer is simulated by using Finite Element Method. The vibrational modal shape and the harmonic response are given numerically. At last, some radially composite ultrasonic transducers are designed and manufactured; their resonance/anti-resonance frequencies are measured. It is shown that the analytical resonance/anti-resonance frequencies are in good agreement with the numerically simulated and experimental results. It is expected that this type of radially composite ultrasonic transducers can be used in large scale ultrasonic liquid processing, such as ultrasonic extraction, ultrasonic sonochemistry and other applications where large radiation surface and ultrasonic power are needed.",

The result is a Poisson equation for a scalar intensity potential. The intensity potential formulation and the boundary element method are both suitable for exterior problems. The governing equations of the intensity potential and the boundary element method for solving this problem are presented. Results from the proposed method are compared with experimental results, for the case of radiated sound power in one-third-octave bands from sources in a partial enclosure. The results show that the method is applicable for estimation of global radiated sound power in one-third-octave bands in the high-frequency range.",

A listening test with 25 participants was performed inside a laboratory to assess the impact of different vehicle interior transfer functions on the speech quality assessment in four predetermined dimensions. Idealized driving noises at three different vehicle speeds were presented simultaneously with speech samples to quantify the interferences of these noise conditions with varied signal-to-noise ratios. To minimize the influence of different human speakers, four talkers (two male and two female) were selected from commercially available audio books. The respective speech samples were adjusted in level and long-term average speech spectrum to the common values of conversational speech. The automatic reflex of raising one's voice in noisy environments, called “Lombard Effect” [1], was taken into account for an additional adjustment of speech levels while driving noises were present. A strong relationship between the speech-to-noise ratio and the test participants' evaluations was found. Thus, one can assume that the speech signals' attenuation or amplification caused by the different room acoustics of the tested vehicles play a more important role for a sufficient speech quality than the varied speech timbre or other parameters. Only at very high speech-to-noise ratios ( ≥ 20 dB with A-weighting), room-acoustical parameters such as IACC or the reverberation time are more determining for the speech quality appreciation than the speech's sound pressure level.",

It is shown in this paper that this method can be generalized to n broadband sources with same height, above an homogeneous ground or a ground with an impedance discontinuity. All sources are considered to have the same emission spectrum. The method is based on the comparison of the level difference spectrum between two microphones - hereinafter called attenuation spectrum - measured and computed.

A ray tracing model is used to decide whether a sonic boom emitted downwards by a high flying supersonic aircraft hits the ground or is refracted upwards before it reaches the ground. Aircraft altitude, speed, and flight direction are systematically changed\r\nwithin realistic ranges. The meteorological data rely on a homogeneous reanalysis dataset for eleven years over\r\nthe domain of Europe with a very high vertical resolution. The cases of sonic booms hitting or not hitting the ground are identified for various situations and respective frequency distributions are derived. In addition, the angle of incidence of rays arriving at the ground and the turning-level height of rays not reaching the ground are studied as the intensity of sonic booms also depends on these parameters.\r\nIt turned out that sonic-boom rays are refracted such that they do not reach the ground if the flight altitude is rather high (long propagation path) and the aircraft speed remains between Mach numbers of 1.05 and 1.25.\r\nSonic-boom rays not reaching the ground are furthermore possible if the aircraft heading is mainly upwind, the temperature mostly increases along the propagation direction of the ray, and a wind speed maximum exists below flight level. The probability of sonic-boom rays not reaching the ground generally increases from north to south, but also depends on the season.",

    "abstract": "The issue of adjusting vibro-acoustical computational cost is especially important when enhancing the sound quality of a mechanical structure using simulation. Simulation parameters must be specified so as to: i) reduce computational cost, and ii) satisfy perceptual constraints. For a simple plate-cavity system, the adjustment of computational cost is investigated in the framework of evaluating the influence of variable structural parameters (cavity absorption, thickness and tightening conditions of the plate) on the auditory perception of sounds radiated inside the cavity. By concentrating on such a simple system, we eventually aim at achieving some recommendations adaptable to different vibrating structures of our environment – in the areas of transport and building – made up of plane elements coupled with enclosures. Considering stationary sounds, this study deals with the adjustment of a major frequency computation parameter, i.e. frequency resolution. The specification of the frequency resolution for vibro-acoustical simulations has a great influence on the spectral envelope of the sounds synthesized afterwards. Here, we modify the spectral envelope of real sounds in order to reproduce the envelope of spectra of synthesized sounds that would be computed in a simulation using a given frequency resolution. The adjustment process pursues the following objective: determining a frequency resolution for which certain perceptual outcomes relative to modified real sounds remain similar to those concerning the original real sounds. These perceptual constraints are pertinent regarding the issue of adjusting vibro-acoustical computational cost. These constraints notably concern the merits of the stimuli and are translated into two adjustment criteria. The results of a first experiment, an auditory evaluation of partial corpora of modified stimuli, highlight that, for the plate-cavity system under consideration, 4 Hz may be an adjusted frequency resolution. The consequences of using this frequency resolution are then further assessed through a second experiment, an auditory evaluation of the complete corpus of modified stimuli. A wider range of perceptual results (perceptual spaces, preference spaces and merits) obtained for the modified sounds and the original sounds are compared. It is shown that both adjustment criteria are fulfilled for the adjusted frequency resolution equal to 4 Hz.",

    "abstract": "The substitute-sources method (SSM) was previously implemented for a single noise barrier in a turbulent atmosphere by applying a substitute surface between the barrier and the receiver [1, 2]. Here, the method is extended, aiming to more general applicability to traffic noise propagation in urban environments. In the method, multiple substitute surfaces are used along the propagation path. The atmospheric turbulence causes a transfer of the initially coherent field into a residual, random field along the propagation path. The mean sound level at the receiver position is found from uncorrelated addition of the substitute surfaces' contributions. The calculation of each contribution is based on a mutual coherence function (MCF) for a turbulent atmosphere. The strength of the substitute sources and the Green functions to the received pressure are calculated for a non-turbulent atmosphere, here by using a fast field program (FFP). A special MCF for the residual field is derived. Examples are calculated for a turbulent atmosphere with upward refraction or without refraction. The results are compared with those from a parabolic equation method (PE) for the refractive cases and with an analytical solution otherwise. The results show good agreement, which indicates that the SSM could be useful for predictions of outdoor sound propagation.",

    "abstract": "Assessing the quality of Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems is a complex problem due to the many modules involved that address different subtasks during synthesis. Adding face synthesis - the animation of a talking head and its rendering to video - to a TTS system makes evaluation even more difficult. In the case of talking heads, today, we are at the infancy of research towards evaluating such systems. This paper reports on progress made with the AT&T sample-based Visual TTS (VTTS) system. Our system incorporates unit-selection synthesis (now well known from Audio TTS) and a moderate-size recorded database of video segments that are modified and concatenated to render the desired output. Given the high quality the system achieves, we feel for the first time that we are close to passing the Turing test, that is, that we are almost able to synthesize talking heads that look like recordings of real people. We demonstrate this point in applications, either over the web (client/server), or in stand-alone form, in a kiosk setting. Several steps are necessary to assure a very high quality sample based VTTS system. First, highly accurate image analysis tools are important for creating the necessary video clip databases. The problem is compounded by the fact that facial videos cannot be stored whole due to unfavorable combinatorics: for a given synthetic sequence, it is very unlikely that a whole face video clip contains the correct mouth sequence, the appropriate eye sequence, and also a suitable background face, given what we want to synthesize. Consequently, separate parts of a synthetic face need to be accessible independently from each other at synthesis time. Therefore, image analysis tools semi-automatically extract (i.e., cut) desired facial features out of recorded video, normalize the apparent position of the camera (the pose, i.e. angle and distance between face and lens), and index and store the images in disjoint databases. Second, fast search techniques (unit selection) extract the most appropriate sequences of facial building blocks at runtime. This includes background face images that convey desired head movements and serve as canvases for painting (projecting) other content-bearing parts of the face such as mouth and eyes. In a final step, the resulting composite face image is then rendered on a graphic screen for display. The higher the quality of a (V)TTS system, the more important it is to carefully evaluate all algorithmic choices. Naturally, subjective testing, although time consuming and expensive, has to be the ultimate measure. However, we used objective measures for quality assessment during the development phase of our system. For example, we found that accuracy and timeliness of lip closures and protrusions, turning points (where a speaker's mouth changes direction from opening to closing), and overall smoothness of the articulation are very critical for achieving high quality. We also found that visual prosody, the movement of the head in synchrony with the stress pattern of the spoken sentence, is important for a natural look.",

    "abstract": "Sounds from automotive powertrains often have tonal components, due to periodically fluctuating parameters in the structure. In this study a single authentic car noise, recorded binaurally in a car compartment, was used for synthesis of single tone in background noise during acceleration. Three aspects of the tone were altered, length (half, same, double) amplitude (-6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9 dB change) and amplitude modulation frequency (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 Hz). The frequency of the tone followed an order of a revolution speed, which was also recorded. In a listening test, where sounds were rated on adjective scales, significant difference could be shown with the sound series as within group factor for most adjectives. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used for grouping the adjectives into five dimensions interpreted as: quality, audibility, tonal content, modulation and safety. The obtained dimensions were shown to be reliable. With means over the adjectives in each dimension for all the sounds, relationships between the physical differences and the dimensions and the three series of change were found. This research will enable a deeper understanding of subjective dimensions underlying acoustical factors important for perceived sound quality. The findings may therefore be used in future design approaches improving the perceived sound quality in the automotive industry.",

    "abstract": "The sound insulation demands for dwellings and public building has increased over the years as the number of sound sources has grown. From the outside our homes are exposed to noise from cars, trains, airplanes, etc. Noise intrudes from our neighbours and their television and stereo equipments. Also noise from spaces for mechanical services systems tends to become more important due to increasing energy saving demands. This thesis presents new analytical models for predicting the sound reduction index of single or double plate systems. In the single plate case, a theoretical and experimental analysis of the air-borne sound transmission through a single plate is presented. The plate is assumed to be excited by a diffuse sound field and the velocity distribution of the plate is derived from the Kirchoff plate equation in the frequency domain. The resulting Fourier transform is evaluated using residue calculus and the solution is verified numerically. The analytical model is valid for a wide frequency range, both below, above and at the critical frequency. Special interest is paid to the area dependency of the sound reduction index. This technique is further expanded for the double plate case by adding another plate and an intermediate layer which is modelled as a locally reacting spring. The model is valid and continuous through both the mass-spring-mass resonance and the coincidence region. The results from the analytical models show good agreement with measured results in both the single and double plate case. A simplified model is also presented for the sound reduction index of finite size floating floors. The model is valid for two elastic plates with a resilient layer in between where the bottom plate, the load-bearing slab, is assumed to be excited with a diffuse airborne sound field. The top plate and the resilient layer compose the floating floor. The problem is solved for frequencies below, between and above the critical frequencies of the plates. Above the critical frequency of the load-bearing plate, but below that of the floating slab, the main coupling between the plates will occur at the coincidence angle of the load-bearing plate. Above the critical frequency of both plates, the main transmission will occur at the angle of coincidence of each plate. As the plates will interact, the sound insulation improvement will to some extent depend on the properties of the load-bearing slab. It is shown how the sound reduction index depends on the physical parameters and the geometry of the plates.",

The Operational Acoustic Modal Analysis (OAMA) technique doesn't suffer from this problem. An important disadvantage of the OAMA approach is that the estimated mode shapes are not correctly scaled. This scaling problem will be tackled in this paper. We will introduce a sensitivity based rescaling technique for the acoustic domain.

It introduces an important in-plane localization technique, which is based on the existence of resonant spatially localized wave fields. The wave from the transducer is acting as a dynamic influence on the plate surface, making the waves reflect in a non-ideal way. The non-ideal reflections make the modes underneath the transducer have different resonant frequencies than the modes beside the insonified area. They appear both for contact and non-contact sources. In the nonlinear damage localization application, the trapped mode wave field interacts with another signal at lower frequency. This results in sidebands around the high frequency whose amplitudes are related to the amount of damage underneath the transducer.",

Widespread classical engineering models from different European countries are compared in this study with physical wave propagation from a defined line source representing traffic noise. The numerical model is based on a fast-field programme. This scheme allows for a very fast calculation of wave propagation in a layered medium including complex boundary conditions. Source properties are carefully adjusted for comparison and the respective meteorological conditions of national guidelines are taken into account. It turns out that the different guidelines are in good agreement with exact calculations up to distances about 1000 m. The so-called downwind condition gives an excellent estimate for the conditions most favourable for sound propagation.

In this paper a Large Eddy Simulation of a lean combustor is presented. To account for mixing effects in case of partially premixed combustion, a suitable extension to the well known coherent flame model (CFM) is applied. The turbulent reaction rate of the partially premixed flame is approximated by solving an additional transport equation for the flame surface density which accounts for flame wrinkling effects as well as for the creation and destruction of flame surface due to stretch and strain effects. The variation of stoichiometry in the flame is accounted by using a suitable presumed PDF methodology. The pdf-model represents finite rate, as well as non-equilibrium chemistry effects in the flame. The model has been validated against experimental data. The results show an overall reasonable agreement with experimental data, both in profile shapes as well as peak values. Further the coupling between Computational Fluid Dynamics and Computational Aeroacoustic is presented. This paper should give a short overview about the capturing of sound sources.",

    "abstract": "Traditional wave superposition method can't reconstruct the sound field precisely because of the absence of the equivalent source configuration information. A method named Joint Patch Near-field Holography (JPNAH) is proposed based on the statistically optimal near-field acoustical holography and the wave superposition method. The basic idea is that the fictitious sources' location essential to the wave superposition method can be decided by the statistically optimal near-field acoustical holography, and then complex sound field will be reconstructed by the wave superposition method with high efficiency and precision. Besides the reconstruction of the patch sound field, the JPNAH has many other virtues. Firstly, the JPNAH technique is not sensitive to the sound source outside the patch area. Secondly, compared to the NAH, the JPNAH performs better in the low frequency range. Finally, it is possible to achieve a real-time mapping of the complex sound field by using the JPNAH. Numerical simulations were performed based on a single-pulse-ball model; and also motor experiments were carried out in a semi-anechoic chamber. Both of numerical simulations and experiments show that the JPNAH can be used to reconstruct the sound field radiated from a complex sound source.",

Based on the general approach (metric transformations) proposed in 1961 by the Russian scientist Lev Dolin we present an alternative realization of the acoustic cloaking shell with higher flexibility of the cloaking shell parameters.",

The displacement components and electrical potential, expanded in a series of Legendre polynomials, are introduced into the governing equations along with position-dependent material constants, so that the solution of the wave equation is reduced to an eigenvalue problem. The dispersion curves for PZT-4 and Ba 2 NaNb 5 O 15 cylindrical curved plates are calculated. The effect of piezoelectricity is also shown. Mechanical displacement distribution and electric potential distribution are illustrated and the influence of the radius to thickness ratio on the circumferential wave characteristics is discussed. Finally, the influence of the polarizing direction on the piezoelectric effect is shown.",

For isotropic plates, these quality factors lead to the obtaining of the dispersion curves of the guided modes and of their energy velocity whose direction is in the incidence plane. For anisotropic plates, the component of the energy velocity parallel to the incidence plane is still provided by the frequency and polar angle quality factors. The normal component may be obtained by taking into account a third quality factor. It is an azimuthal angle quality factor derived from the phase derivative with respect to the deviation angle between the incidence plane and a symmetry plane of the anisotropic material. Results for a plate of cubic symmetry are exhibited. They are compared to those obtained from energy calculations that involve the kinetic and strain energies as well as the Poynting vector.",

The beam is driven by a constant step force at an initial time that causes the impact of the beam tip with a baffled plate which, in turn, radiates noise. A Finite Element Method is used for the beam modeling and a modal analytical method for the plate modeling. The contact force is computed as a Lagrange multiplier to ensure the pertinent contact condition. The radiating surface of the plate is treated as a pure monopole layer. Results show the rattle noise characteristic features on the contact force, contact point separation and acoustic pressure on a 0.5 s time characteristic simulation. Rattle noise is related to a typical contact force which switches all the time from zero to non-zero values. The influence of the increase plate and beam stiffness on the noise is presented which shows noise when the plate stiffness is decreased with respect to that of the beam.",

    "abstract": "Improvements in tread-pattern design have reduced the noise generated by tyres to a point where some new patterned tyres are as quiet as smooth tyres. However, considering that smooth tyres also generate noise the generation mechanisms that are independent of tread pattern must also be studied in order to further reduce tyre/road noise. The rubbing noise generated by dry sliding friction within the contact patch of a rolling tyre is a mechanism that is independent of tread pattern and has the potential to be a critical generation mechanism in future efforts to further reduce tyre noise. In this paper the rubbing noise generated by dry sliding friction has been studied with a view to gaining an understanding of the fundamental mechanism. A controlled laboratory experiment was built to generate rubbing noise between a rotating steel disk and a small stationary specimen of Tancast10, a rigid polyurethane foam. Nearfield Acoustic Holography has been used to measure the rubbing noise produced. Using this technique the leading edge of contact has been identified as the source location of the rubbing noise being generated. Furthermore, it was found that for an increasing sliding velocity the amplitude of rubbing noise increased, however, the frequency content of the noise did not alter with changing velocities.",

The lens is made of acrylic resin or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and is submerged in water. Our analytical approach is based on a classical theory that expands an incident wave into spherical waves to satisfy boundary conditions conveniently at the spherical interface between the water and the lens. The continuity conditions of displacement and stress at the interface determine the generation of longitudinal and shear waves in the lens. Additionally, sound absorption in the lens is considered. The Rayleigh integral associated with the particle velocity on the exit interface enables us to evaluate all sound fields behind the lens. Numerical examples demonstrate that no significant effect appears in the fields near the focus rather than in the pre-focal and post-focal regions even when the shear wave generation is included in the theory. To verify the usefulness of the present theory, we conducted experiments in water using a directive beam emitted from a 1-MHz circular-aperture transducer. It has been demonstrated that the agreement between the theory and the experiment is generally excellent.",

Since this cochlear model also accounts for fine structure and connected level dependent effects, it is superior to filter-based approaches and hence allows the investigation of the contributions of cochlear- and retro-cochlear processing on behavioural data, including stimulus-duration dependent effects of threshold fine structure.",

    "abstract": "A hybrid wind instrument generates self-sustained sounds via a real-time interaction between a computed excitation model (such as the physical model of human lips interacting with a mouthpiece) and a real acoustic resonator. Attempts to produce a hybrid instrument have so far fallen short, in terms of both the accuracy and the variation in the sound produced. The principal reason for the failings of previous hybrid instruments is the actuator which, controlled by the excitation model, introduces a fluctuating component into the air flow injected into the resonator. In the present paper, the possibility of using a loudspeaker to supply the calculated excitation signal is evaluated. A theoretical study has facilitated the modeling of the loudspeaker-resonator system and the design of a feedback and feedforward filter to successfully compensate for the presence of the loudspeaker. The resulting self-sustained sounds are evaluated by a mapping of their sound descriptors to the input parameters of the physical model of the embouchure, both for sustained and attack sounds. Results are compared with simulations. The largely coherent functioning confirms the usefulness of the device in both musical and research contexts.",

Measured transient behaviour of machine-bowed strings is compared in detail with predictions from a range of previously-published computer simulation models. The general trends of waveforms and parameter dependence observed experimentally are successfully predicted, but some important details are not well captured by any of the models tested. The discrepancies, mainly associated with uncertainty about the correct model for the frictional interaction between bow and string, are examined systematically to reveal patterns of sensitivity to specific features of the models and to provide guidance on aspects of those models that may require enhancement to achieve a closer match to experiment. Of the models tested, the friction model based on contact temperature performed significantly better than more traditional ones based on instantaneous sliding speed.",

    "abstract": "Despite the fundamental role played by sound in multiple virtual reality contexts, few studies have explored the perception of virtual sound source motion in the acoustic space.The goal of this study was to compare the localization of virtual moving sound sources rendered with two different spatialization techniques: Vector Base Amplitude Panning (VBAP) and fifth-order Ambisonics (HOA), both implemented in a soundproofed room and in their most basic form (basic decoding of HOA, VBAP without spread parameter).The perception of virtual sound trajectories surrounding untrained subjects (n=23) was evaluated using a new method based on a drawing-augmented multiple-choice questionnaire.In the spherical loudspeaker array used in this study, VBAP proved to be a robust spatialization technique for sound trajectory rendering in terms of trajectory recognition and height perception.In basic-decoded HOA, subjects exhibited far more disparate trajectory recognition and height perception performances but performed better in perceiving sound source movement homogeneity.",

The ultimate goal for a neural model is to simulate responses to many stimuli, which may provide better insights into neural mechanisms. We tested the ability of modified same-frequency inhibition-excitation models for inferior colliculus neurons to simulate individual neuron responses to both amplitude-modulated sounds and tone-in-noise stimuli. Modifications to the model were guided by receptive fields computed with 2nd-order Wiener kernel analysis. This approach successfully simulated many individual neurons' responses to different types of stimuli. Other neurons suggest limitations and future directions for modeling efforts.",

Based on elastic equations and piezoelectric constitutive relations relevant for a monoclinic crystal, a set of mathematical-modelling equations is derived. Special emphasis is given to the problem where a 6mm PZT-2 material is excited electrically along a general direction in the X-Z crystal-axis plane. We determine the electrical impedance as a function of frequency. Resonance conditions are discussed including dependencies with the PZT-2 layer thickness. Results are also presented for the angular dependence of the PZT-2/water interface pressure (where angle refers to the excitation direction in the X-Z plane) in the case where the PZT-2 layer is embedded into semi-infinite layers of air and water on either side. Finally, the PZT-2/water interface pressure signal for a transducer is computed subject to an eight-period sinusoidal current burst with driving frequency at 1 MHz. The present model is suitable for optimization of the dynamic transducer response as a function of excitation-direction angle and other physical parameters.",

Four sets of noise measurements are conducted at three different sites, including ballast tracks at grade and railway on a concrete viaduct. The time histories computed from a horizontal radiation model are compared with the measured noise profiles. The measured sound exposure levels are used to deduce the vertical directivity pattern for different railway systems of continuously welded rail systems. It is found that the vertical directivity of different railway systems shows a rather similar pattern. The vertical directivity of train noise is shown to increase up to about 30° before reducing to a minimum at 90°. A multipole expansion model is proposed to account for the vertical radiation directivity of the train noise. The empirical model is found to be applicable to different train/rail systems at train speeds ranging up to 120 km/h.",

Since pernambuco is rare and expensive, it is of interest to investigate if it is possible to compensate for variations in density between blanks for bows; particularly in such a way that important qualities of high quality bows are maintained in bows made of wood with a lower density. In this study, numerical optimization is used to replicate some of the static and dynamic properties of a reference bow, using wood with 10% lower density. The structural calculations of the bow are made with a finite element program (ANSYS), which is coupled to an external optimization routine. The automatic optimization process is performed using the Method of Moving Asymptotes. Included are also some remarks on how homogenous scaling of the cross section of a bow of constant length affects some of the static and dynamic properties when used as compensation for density variations.",

The results indicated that the perforated ceiling with and without absorption sheet greatly reduced the resonance of floor impact sound by the non-perforated ceiling. However, the perforated ceiling without an absorption sheet did not improve the single number quantity (SNQ, rubber ball: L ′ iA,Fmax,V.T and tapping machine: L ′ n,w ) for the floor impact sound insulation. The perforated ceiling with attached absorption sheet produced SNQs of 2 dB lower and higher than that produced by the non-perforated ceiling for heavy and light weight impact sources, respectively.

    "abstract": "This work presents a numerical solution of the forced plate vibration problem using the nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. The plate is modelled as a three-dimensional domain, and its vibration is governed by the linear elasticity equations. The nodal DG method discretises the spatial domain and computes the spatial derivatives of the equations element-wise, while the time integration is conducted using the Runge-Kutta method. This method is in particular of interest as it is very favourable to carry out the computation by a parallel implementation. Several aspects regarding the numerical implementation such as the plate boundary conditions, the point force excitation, and the upwind numerical flux are presented. The numerical results are validated for rectangular concrete plates with different sets of boundary conditions and thicknesses, by a comparison with the exact mobilities that are derived from the classical plate theory (CPT) and the first order shear deformation theory (FSDT). The plate thickness is varied to understand its effect regarding the comparison with the CPT. An excellent agreement between the numerical solution and the FSDT was found. The agreement with the CPT occurs only at the first couple of resonance frequencies, and as the plate is getting thinner. Furthermore, the numerical example is extended to an L-shaped concrete plate. The mobility is then compared with the mobilities obtained by the CPT, FSDT, and linear elasticity equations.",

In this paper, we propose two types of acoustic metamaterials with a magnetorheological elastomer (MRE), and the tunable band gap structures of the acoustic metamaterials are investigated by the finite element method (FEM). The MRE acts as a cladding layer, and its shear modulus can be changed by an applied magnetic field. The band gaps of the two kinds of acoustic metamaterials are calculated for various magnetic fields, and it is found that the frequency and width of the band gaps can be adjusted by controlling the applied magnetic field. These results are helpful for the application of acoustic metamaterials in active noise and vibration control.",

    "abstract": "Finite structures play a more realistic role in applications designed for sound and vibration isolation. Doublepanel structure with poroelastic cores is able to exhibit a superior sound insulation performance in mid-high frequency range, while is relatively inferior to isolate waves at low frequencies. In order to further reduce sound transmission at low frequencies and cater for the actual situation, this paper decides to introduce the metamaterial concept into finite double-wall sandwich plates and presents an analytical model to calculate the sound transmission loss through the metamaterial-based double-panel with fully clamped boundary conditions. The metamaterial-based double-wall sandwich plates are constructed by replacing the bare panel with the metamaterial plate, consisting of a homogeneous plate and periodically attached local resonators. Biot's theory is used to examine the wave propagation in the poroelastic medium. The vibro-acoustic problem of the proposed sandwich plate is solved by employing the modal superposition theory and the Galerkin method. Numerical results show that the sound transmission is significantly reduced at low frequencies. Unique phenomena caused by attached local resonators are explained and the eff ects of resonator inerter, incident angles and damping on the sound insulation properties are also studied.",

    "abstract": "With the release of the revised version of the Swiss standard SIA 181:2006 \"Protection Against Noise in Buildings\", a measurement technique was introduced for simulating user-generated noise in bathtubs, shower cubicles, wash basins etc. employing a pendulous hammer. Despite the undoubted advantages of the measurement method, over the past few years questions have increasingly been raised regarding various issues involved in its use. The characteristics of the pendulous hammer are insufficiently well specified in the standard and a procedure specifying a periodic check of the instrument is lacking. The measurement method itself is described in inadequate detail, so that (for example) depending on the choice of the excitation, potentially very diff erent results may be obtained. In addition, no information is given regarding the measurement uncertainty. The standard gives level corrections for diff erent excitation scenarios. This allows a comparison of the diff erence between the level of the original noise and that generated by the pendulous hammer. The validity of these level corrections is now, to a certain extent, being challenged. In addition, it has been suggested that – depending on the constructional details - the airborne noise emitted by acoustic radiation from the component under investigation is excessive, thereby potentially falsifying the measured values. These issues have been investigated by Empa and, based on a comprehensive set of laboratory and field measurements, clarified. Measurement protocols are given for various components, and the measurement uncertainty has been evaluated. The eff ect of airborne noise has been shown to be acceptable for tests conducted in accordance with the SIA 181 standard. Sufficient measurement data is now available to allow the level corrections to be determined. Finally, specifications for the pendulous hammer itself have been formulated.",

While wood is the most common material used for modern professional clarinets, other materials have been and continue to be used, including synthetic materials. Despite the availability and accessibility of these materials, professional musicians rarely use instruments made from synthetics, insisting that their wooden counterparts produce superior results. Numerous studies have found the energy radiated directly by rigid cylindrical vibrating tubes to be both insignificant and have little to no effect on an internal vibrating air column. Using real instruments played by musicians, the present study compared a prototype clarinet upper joint with a synthetic bore liner produced by French instrument maker Henri Selmer Paris to two unlined, solid wood clarinets of the same make and model by examining two acoustical parameters. Spectral centroid and fundamental frequency f 0 pitch error were measured for 45 notes (written E3-C7), performed by five accomplished clarinetists unaware of which instrument they were playing. Consistent with findings from other researchers, the particular instrument had no significant effect on spectral centroid. Meanwhile, although a significant effect of the instrument on f 0 pitch error was found, pairwise comparisons suggest non-significant effects from the lined joint.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, the design of large-size rectangular ultrasonic plastic soldering system is studied by using the band gap theory of phononic crystal and coupled vibration theory of large-size rectangular tool. In practical engineering applications, lateral vibration of the large-size rectangular tool will seriously cause the displacement of the tool's radiation surface uneven. So the lateral vibration of the tool should be suppressed. As we all know, phononic crystal materials can suppress the vibration and they are composed of two or more different materials periodically (including matrix material and scattering material). This paper uses periodic slotted structure to suppress the lateral vibration of the large-size rectangular tool. The lateral vibration band gap of the large-size rectangular tool which has periodic slotted structure in this paper is simulated. In addition, the influence of the scatterer's size on the lateral vibration band gap is also obtained. At the same time, the magnitude and uniformity of the tool's radiation surface displacement before and after slotting is compared in experiments. The research shows that by reasonably designing the periodic structure and size of the phononic crystal, the lateral vibration of the large-size rectangular tool can be effectively suppressed, and the displacement of the tool's radiation surface can be more even.",

Using rippled-spectrum signals, the ripple depth thresholds were measured as functions of ripple density under conditions of rippled or non-rippled reference signals. With rippled reference signals, the ripple depth thresholds were as low as 0.11 at low ripple densities (2–3 cycles/oct) and rose to 1.0 at a ripple density of 8.9 cycles/oct. For non-rippled reference signals, ripple depth thresholds were nearly the same as for rippled reference signals at ripple densities of up to 7 cycles/oct; at ripple densities of 10 cycles/oct and higher, ripple depth thresholds rose slowly and reached 1.0 at a ripple density of 26 cycles/oct. The results hypothetically suggest contributions of the excitation-pattern processing and temporal-processing mechanisms of frequency analysis to discrimination of rippled signals. The excitation-pattern mechanism featured low depth thresholds at low ripple densities but could not function at ripple densities above 10 cycles/oct. The temporal-processing mechanism manifested at higher ripple densities and non-rippled reference stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Guided Wave Tomography is a nondestructive imaging technique that consists in inverting guided wave propagation data to localize defects. In particular, this technique should provide quantitative information about the corrosion state of metallic plates by reconstructing a thickness map from diffraction or time-of-flight measurements. In this paper we first present an analytical framework for corrosion profile reconstruction considering the 1D case. Due to the fact that, in practice, the low frequency ultrasound range (typically 50 to 100 kHz) is used for long range inspections, the first-order shear deformation approximation is relevant for plate thicknesses encountered in metallic structures. This leads to an analytical description of guided wave phenomena: diffraction, refraction and mode conversion, for 5 modes: A0, S0, SH0, A1 and SH1. The validity of an analytical approach to modeling thickness loss defects, in particular the validity of the first Born approximation, is discussed by comparing with elastodynamic numerical results. The comparison results show that the nonlinear behavior with depth increase, or width increase, of the defects (distortion) can be fully described using a multimodal high order Born series. Consequently, a consistent iterative inversion Born series based algorithm can be used to deal with the reconstruction of strong thickness losses.",

Ratings for wind turbine sound heard alone showed no coherent statistically significant differences between wind turbine types, neither for A-weighted sound levels nor loudness.

    "abstract": "During the last decades, new building techniques based on lightweight systems have been developed and today they are frequently used in many countries. Nowadays, these systems present some disadvantages when compared with the traditional building technologies, since most of the acoustic regulations are still based on the latter. Frequently, the acoustic rating of a lightweight structure using the standard methods is not well correlated with the perceived disturbances caused by footsteps, falling masses, etc. Wooden houses are specifically known for their poor impact sound insulation, fulfilling the legal requirements but highly annoying for the residents. Therefore, the intention of this paper is to contribute to a better knowledge of the vibrational behavior of lightweight wooden floors (LWF). In this study, a simple un-damped floor with constant cross-section geometry and elastic properties along one of the coordinate axes has been selected. These kinds of structures can be considered as waveguides where the cross-sectional modes are propagated as waves along one axis. The dispersion curves describe the wave propagation in the structure where each curve represents one wave. This approach is very helpful to facilitate the physical understanding of the acoustical performance of the floors since each wave present in the structure can be identified and classified. The so-called Waveguide Finite Element Method (WFEM) has been applied. This method uses finite element techniques to describe the modes of the cross-section geometry. Each mode is then propagated along the waveguide, getting the wave solutions or dispersion curves. To understand the wave propagation on the structure, different modifications of the LWF have been analyzed. In these modifications, the different basic parts of the floor (beams and plates) have been decoupled to different degrees by e.g. blocking degrees of freedom or changing the elastic parameters of the coupling elements. This methodology allowed for analyzing the evolution of the vibrational behavior of the system from the uncoupled waveguides to the complete coupled structure, getting a full picture of the vibrational behavior of a LWF.",

    "abstract": "This article uses a basic model of a reed instrument , known as the lossless Raman model, to determine analytically the envelope of the sound produced by the clarinet when the mouth pressure is increased gradually to start a note from silence. Using results from dynamic bifur-cation theory, a prediction of the amplitude of the sound as a function of time is given based on a few parameters quantifying the time evolution of mouth pressure. As in previous uses of this model, the predictions are expected to be qualitatively consistent with simulations using the Raman model, and observations of real instruments. Model simulations for slowly variable parameters require very high precisions of computation. Similarly, any real system, even if close to the model would be affected by noise. In order to describe the influence of noise, a modified model is developed that includes a stochastic variation of the parameters. Both ideal and stochastic models are shown to attain a minimal amplitude at the static oscillation threshold. Beyond this point, the amplitude of the oscillations increases exponentially, although some time is required before the oscillations can be observed at the '' dynamic oscillation threshold ''. The effect of a sudden interruption of the growth of the mouth pressure is also studied, showing that it usually triggers a faster growth of the oscillations.",

The absorption characteristics are governed by the radiation impedance, Z(r), which is a function of the absorber's geometry and the incidence angle, together with the surface impedance of the absorber. The behaviour of Z(r) is evaluated numerically for a number of typical configurations, and the effect on the statistical absorption coefficient, alpha(stat) is calculated. The evaluations stress that alpha(stat) is regulated by the interaction between Z(r) and the impedance of the absorber. A comparison is made of results from measurements and calculations performed on the measurement set-up. (Less)",

The problem is of general interest in connection with the excitation and transmission of structure-borne sound. The indenter is assumed to be circular, weightless, and stiff compared with the plate. A rigid indenter is assumed to provide a better approximation of the actual situation than a soft indenter would, e.g when a hammer acts on a wooden plate. A detailed three-dimensional analysis is performed. Traditionally, the problem is solved in approximate terms by assuming a pressure distribution at the interface between the indenter and the plate. In the present study, a pressure distribution is also assumed, an optimal choice of the pressure amplitude being found by means of a variational formulation. Numerical results are presented and discussed, the discrepancy between the results obtained and the perfectly rigid indenter being examined. (Less)",

The reasons for this discrepancy were investigated, and it was found that the overall duration of the source signal, its onset and offset times, and the magnitude and rate of any spectral fluctuations, have a very strong effect on the IACC. Two test signals, synthesised to be representative of a wide range of musical stimuli, can extend the external validity of traditional IACC-based measurements.",

    "abstract": "Vibrational power flow or structural intensity analysis is used to study the many paths of vibrational energy flow around complex flexible lightweight structures such as cars and aircraft. The vibrational power flow approach was developed so that the various paths of energy flow in the structure could be ranked in a rational way. A series of fundamental studies of power flow in simple structural elements, such as beams and plates, has been conducted over the last 25 years. These methods of measuring power flow have relied heavily on arrays of accelerometers mounted directly onto the structure. However, the practical application of power flow analysis has been limited by the lack of suitable measuring equipment. This paper reports on a preliminary case study which demonstrates the application of electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) also known as ‘TV holography’ to measure the vibrational power flow due to flexural vibrations in an experimental beam with anechoic terminations. Results obtained from the ESPI based measurements at three different frequencies are compared to conventional two-accelerometer power flow measurements and also to the measured power input to the structure. Although it is difficult to draw general conclusions about the ESPI based system from a single case study under ideal “infinite” beam conditions a number of observations about using the measurement system are summarised at the end of the paper.",

    "abstract": "The concept of source descriptor and coupling function is commonly recognized to form a rigorous basis for structure-borne sound source characterization. While this concept initially is valid for the single-point case only, it can be extended to sources with multi-point coupling by including the interface mobility approach. By considering a continuous interface that passes all contact points, the velocities, forces and mobilities are series expanded into interface orders by means of a spatial Fourier decomposition. The use of a continuous formulation for the multi-point case, however, can be problematic from a practical point of view. This paper discusses a reformulation of the interface mobility approach for a simplified calculation and clarified interpretation of the interface orders. With a discrete Fourier series as a basis for the interface mobility approach, the interface is reduced to a set of points and the interface orders are shown to describe the interplay of the data at the contact points. A discrete formulation furthermore yields simplified equations and a strict upper bound for the number of orders that have to be included, thus enhancing the practicability of interface mobilities for source characterization.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that a recently published methodology for predicting flow generated noise by compact surfaces under free-field conditions [1] can be extended to a different and more complex configuration of industrial interest. In the previous paper, the methodology was applied to low Mach number flow past a circular cylinder in free-field, where the Green's function and its derivative were obtained analytically. In this paper, the method will be applied to the case of low Mach number flow past a complex confined scattering geometry where both compact and non-compact surfaces are involved. Here the generation of noise is dominated by the interaction of the flow with a surface whose maximum dimension is shorter than the wavelength of interest. The analysis is based on the surface-source term of the Ffowcs Williams-Hawkings equation. The acoustic source data of the flow are generated by use of a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation. Due to the complexity of the scattering surfaces, the derivative of the Green's function must be obtained numerically through a Computational Acoustics (CA) simulation. The results have been validated through comparison with sound power measurements. © S. Hirzel Verlag · EAA.",

The ceramic is assumed mounted with silver electrodes, bounded at the outer circular boundary with a polymer ring, and submerged into water. The transducer models are developed to account for any external electrical loading impedance in the driving circuit. The models are adapted to calculate the surface acceleration needed by the Field II software in predicting pressure pulses at any location in front of the transducer. Results show that both models predict the longitudinal resonances with consistency. The one-dimensional model is found to exhibit approximately 2.9 dB peak overshoot at the lowest longitudinal resonance frequencies prediction. These values are decreasing for higher longitudinal modes. If the three-dimensional model is restricted in its radial movement at the circular boundary both models exhibit identical results. The Field II predicted pressure pulses are found to have oscillating consistency with a 2.0 dB overshoot on the maximum amplitude using the one-dimensional compared to the three-dimensional model. This is with no electronic loading. With a 50 Ω loading an amplitude overshoot is found to be 1.5 dB.",

    "abstract": "The timbre of the pipa, a traditional plucked Chinese music instrument, is characterized by nuanced inharmonicity resulting from peculiarities of regionally distinct string composition and construction. This paper investigates the relationship between string physical construction and the resulting inharmonicity in the sounds produced by the traditional silk and modern Beijing and Shanghai metallic strings. Inharmonicity occurs in string instruments primary due to stiffness of the strings, and is commonly analyzed using Fletcher's inharmonicity formulation based on the Euler-Bernoulli stiff-string physical model. While this formulation accurately predicts partial shifts observed in the solid-core steel Beijing strings throughout the audible frequency range, it fails to accurately predict the partial shifts observed in the stranded-core steel Shanghai and traditional silk strings beyond about 8 kHz. An alternate formulation of inharmonicity is developed based on the Timoshenko beam physical model, which accounts for not only stiffness, but also rotary inertia and shear deformation within the string. Inharmonic partials derived from this formulation are verified by comparing against spectra of pipa recordings, and it is found that the Timoshenko-based formulation is capable of predicting the observed inharmonicity across all pipa string types. The unusual inharmonicity of the silk and Shanghai strings above 8 kHz is explained by the shear deformation properties of the string materials and construction, which limit the phase velocities supported by the strings and hence limit the inharmonic frequency shifts of the upper partials. In the case of the solid-core steel Beijing string, the shear deformation limit is beyond the audible frequency range, so the Euler-Bernoulli based formulation is adequate to explain its inharmonicity. In the case of the stranded steel Shanghai and twisted silk strings, whose physical shear moduli are 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the solid-core steel Beijing string, the shear deformation influences inharmonicity within the audible frequency range. For these strings (and generally for strings with relatively lower shear moduli), the Timoshenko-based formulation of inharmonicity should be used.",

Sweeping echoes in a three-dimensional (3D) space have recently been reported. We first investigated the regularity of reflected sound in a 2D regularly shaped space based on number theory. The reflected pulse sound train has almost equal intervals between pulses on the squared-time axis as in a 3D space. This regularity of the arrival time of reflected pulse sounds generates sweeping echoes whose frequencies increase linearly with time. Computer simulation of room acoustics shows good agreement with the theoretical results. We first describe our investigation of a square cross-section based on number theory. Next, we describe rectangular cross-sections with various aspect ratios investigated based on the same theory as that for the square. We also discuss our measurements of sweeping echoes in a long hallway. We propose a method for extracting sweep rates of sweeping echoes by calculating their correlation with a time stretched pulse. We analyzed the sweeping echoes for a source and receiver at the center of a rectangular cross-section. These sweeping echoes were not only perceived at the exact center position but also around the center.",

    "abstract": "Summary Our model of detection and discrimination is based on the common assumption that, for psychoacoustic tasks dominated by a single auditory comparison, d-prime is equal to a perceived-intensity difference divided by the standard deviation of this perceived intensity. In general, the transformation from the external, physical intensity of an acoustic signal to an internal, perceived intensity is nonlinear, compressive, and similarto the transformation from physical intensity to loudness. We represent the compression associated with this intensity transformation by a quadratic function. This leads to explicit mathematical representation of the external-to-internal intensity transformation and itsinverse. For psychoacoustic tasks such as intensity discrimination, increment detection, and forward masking, we can write explicit expressions for d-prime and signal threshold. Model predictions based on these expressions are in good agreement with experimental data from the literature, as well as observations from our laboratory. Some of these comparisons between model and data lead to predictions regarding the dependence of internal noise (or variance) on stimulus intensity for intensity discrimination and increment detection. Other comparisons suggest that the influence of neural adaptation on forward masking is greater than the influence of masker persistence. The quadratic-compression model may provide a useful framework for understanding a variety of simple psychoacoustic tasks. PACS no. 43.66.Ba, 43.66.Cb, 43.66.Dc, 43.66.Fe",

One of its advantages in comparison to other methods and techniques is transient noise immunity. Namely, the mentioned noise is transformed through the cross-correlation into background noise. Transient noise influence in MLS technique is analyzed here on theoretical and practical basis using simulations and measurements. The influences of transient noise signal parameters such as signal duration, level and type are observed. The results show that the reduction of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of Impulse Response (IR) as the main consequence of transient noise is directly related to the energy of noise signal. The change of transient noise parameters causes change of SNR reduction but only if the noise energy is changed. Although this noise does not influence the decay of obtained IR, the attention should be paid to SNR reduction since it could be important for some applications.",

In this setting, the Webster horn equation is regarded as a controlled dynamical equation in the space variable. Pressure is the state, the control being made of two parts: one variable part, the inside diameter of the duct and one constant part, the weights of the elementary time-harmonic components of the velocity potential. Then one looks for a control that optimizes a criterion related to the definition of an {oscillation regime} as the cooperation of several natural modes of vibration with the excitation, the {playing frequency} being the one that maximizes the total generation of energy, as exposed by A.H. Benade, following H. Bouasse. At the same time the relevance of this criterion is questioned with the simulation results.",

    "abstract": "Ameasurement method is presented that allows aseparation of sound sources based on pass-by measurements of trains.It combines asound pressure microphone with twosound velocity transducers, all of which are positioned at one point.The velocity transducers are employed as directional microphones.The true source positions and their sound power are determined by solving an inverse problem: In asystem of propagation equations the source positions are optimized until abest fit to the measured signals is achieved.Measurement results are shown for pass-by measurements of German ICE 3high speed trains at speeds between 200 and 250 km/h.The extended pantographs are thereby identified as dominating sound sources in the upper part of the vehicles.The measurements yield reproducible results and are in accordance with data taken from literature.The method represents an alternative to the array measurement technique although with aconsiderably smaller measurement and data analysis effort.Information on the sound power of multiple sources is gathered with an accuracyc omparable to array measurements.The localization of the sources is though less precise and the separation is limited to twosources at atime.Therefore the measurement concept can not be seen as ageneral replacement of the array measurement technique.Nevertheless there is ab road range of applications where a fines pacial resolution is not of major interest.In these cases the method is likely to represent an appropriate substitute.",

They presented only fundamental results; here the field is fully analyzed. The boundary conditions at the area discontinuity are equality of acoustic pressures and that of acoustic mass fluxes. For nonzero, finite S 1 /S 2 (S 1 , the cross-sectional area of one part of the pipe; S 2 , that of the other part), the characteristic wave number multiplied by the total pipe length (simply, the wave number) of the m-th mode lies in ((m- ½)π, (m+ ½)π); for zero S 1 /S 2 , it lies in [(m- ½)π, (m+ ½)π] and can analytically be calculated. If the discontinuity is located at 2n/2m (n = 1,..., m - I) or (2n — 1)/2m (n = 1,..., m) of the pipe length, the wave number equals mπ for all S 1 /S 2 . In the former configurations, the field is identical with that in a straight pipe. In the latter, the ratio of the pressure amplitude in one part of the pipe to that in the other depends on S 1 /S 2 . For zero S 1 /S 2 , if the discontinuity is located at n/(2m + 1) (n = 1, 3,..., 2m - 1) or n/(2m ― 1) (n = 1, 3,..., 2m - 3) of the pipe length, the wave number equals (m + ½)π or (m - ½)π and coincides with that of the (m + 1)-th or (m - 1)-th mode, respectively; the wave numbers are degenerate.",

A questionnaire was used to obtain a 'priority classification' of acoustical attributes to describe their requirements. The Borda count was chosen as the analysis method. As it is not suggested for subjective data ascribed to ordinal scales, it has been validated through a comparison with the more rigorous and suitable Condorcet method and a modified version of this method. The uncertainty assessment was taken into account and the Normalized Error was used to compare the results related to five orchestra-concert hall configurations and one orchestra-opera house configuration. The factors that influence the ranking have been investigated and the different acoustical conditions in the auditorium do not seem to have affected the answers. The results suggest the existence of possible orchestra and stage effects or other unknown systematic effects which were not considered in the final classification. The attributes pertaining to the accuracy of ensemble playing and the playing technique were judged to be more important than those related to the stage or pit acoustics, even though the quality of the playing aspects depends on the acoustics.",

The procedure of deriving of a new dynamic equation governing the vorticity mode which is generated by sound, is discussed in details. It uses only instantaneous quantities and does not include averaging over sound period. The resulting equation applies to both periodic and aperiodic sound of any waveform as the origin of the vorticity mode. The theory is illustrated by two representative examples of generation of the vorticity mode in a relaxing Maxwell fluid, caused by periodic sound beam and a sound beam with a stationary but aperiodic waveform.",

In this work the one dimensional, time averaged, macroscopic sound transfer process in rigid-frame porous media is reinterpreted with the concepts developed in the field of sound intensity. An algebraic derivation shows that the active intensity is proportional to the spatial gradient of the sound energy density, so that the two quantities obey a diffusion equation. The name sound conductivity is suggested for the related coefficient, and the expressions of the sinks of sound energy and of the sources of reactivity in the material are formalized. Moreover a differential formulation for the energy densities inside the material is developed and solved analytically.",

The only assumption made is that the Stokes layer thickness is much smaller than the wave length A and this provides the expansion parameter. The emphasis is laid on the calculation of attenuation coefficient and explicit results are obtained both for large and small values of the tube radius. The scheme is shown to be valid for λ « R where λ is the mean free path and R is the tube radius.",

    "abstract": "A famous theoretical prediction of the minimum bow force to maintain Helmholtz motion of a bowed string is re-examined to take account of effects associated with resonances of the instrument body. Starting from a more robust assumption of an ideal stick-slip velocity waveform at the bowing point rather than a perfect sawtoothshaped excitation force at the bridge, the analysis predicts that the minimum bow force, and the force waveform exciting the instrument bridge, can depend in a complicated way on the position of the bow on the string. Also, the frequency of maximum wolfiness of an instrument like a cello is predicted to shift away from that of the strong body resonance causing a wolf note. Simulations are used to evaluate the new formulation. For the simple case in which the string vibrates only in a single polarisation, the results are accurately confirmed. However, simulation also reveals that string vibration in the second polarisation can change the detailed response. Further simulations are used to investigate the influence on minimum bow force of some physical details of the model, especially torsional string motion and the presence of sympathetic strings.",

    "abstract": "Since motorcycles are one of the main sources of noise in urban environments, the use of electric powered two-wheelers may contribute to the improvement of soundscapes in Smart Cities.However, quiet vehicles can lead to an increased risk of accident for pedestrians and other drivers.In order to assess the noise generated by powered two-wheelers and their detectability, five different low capacity motorcycles were measured in a pass-by noise test.The measurements were performed at different speeds using a linear microphone array and a dummy head.The sound directivity radiated by the moving sources was studied with a microphone array.To establish the detectability of powered two-wheelers, thirty-seven subjects participated in an auditory test consisting on a virtual road-crossing scenario.The subjects had to detect the approaching of a vehicle at 20 km/h.The results showed a significant reduction in the sound pressure level emitted by electric motorcycles at low-speed, as well as a notable increase in sound directivity with velocity.The reaction time obtained for the detection of electric powered two-wheelers was higher compared to the traditional propulsion ones.The results highlighted the risk posed by this kind of electric vehicles for pedestrians.",

    "abstract": "When monofilament nylon strings of different tensions are used on a plucked instrument like the guitar or lute, it is readily observed that a lower-tension string tends to give a brighter sound. The elementary linear theory of a plucked string predicts no such effect. Linear theory can be extended to include bending stiffness and frequencydependent damping: Detailed measurements on a range of nylon strings are analysed to enable this extended model to be made quantitatively accurate. It is shown that a small influence of the string gauge is predicted, but synthesis based on this model does not match measurements or perceived differences of sound quality. Two nonlinear effects are then explored. The familiar effect of coupling between transverse and axial vibration in the string is shown to account for some observed features, but still does not explain the large difference of sound. The evidence from measurements strongly suggests that the mechanism responsible for the sound differences involves nonlinear interaction between the string and other parts of the structure, such as the frets. Because a lower-tension string tends to be played at larger amplitude, such buzzing interactions are more likely to occur. Implications for makers and players of instruments like the lute are discussed.",

The major physical features of the problem, i.e. a variable bottom topography, elastic properties of the subbottom structure, volume attenuation and other range inhomogeneities are efficiently treated. The computer models presented are based on normal mode solutions of the Helmholtz equation on the one hand, and on various types of numerical schemes for parabolic approximations of the Helmholtz equation on the other. A new coupled mode code is introduced to model sound propagation in range-dependent ocean environments with variable bottom topography, where the effects of an elastic bottom, of volume attenuation, surface and bottom roughness are taken into account. New computer models based on finite difference and finite element techniques for the numerical solution of parabolic approximations are also presented. They include an efficient modeling of the bottom influence via impedance boundary conditions, they cover wide angle propagation, elastic bottom effects, variable bottom topography and reverberation effects. All the models are validated on several benchmark problems and versus experimental data. Results thus obtained were compared with analogous results from standard codes in the literature.",

The Fourier series expansion is introduced for a spatial coordinate to provide the transient response of the structure. Theoretical displacements are obtained for aluminum tubes filled with glycerol or air. The corresponding displacements are observed experimentally by the laser ultrasonic technique. Good agreement is found in the arrival time, shape and relative amplitude of various longitudinal and shear bulk waves propagating in the solid and liquid media.

In addition to the on-axis and directivity responses, microphone array measurements have been interpreted in the wavenumber domain, where the source radiation is analyzed in space and time.

In addition, the magnetic bias is determined by compressional pre-stressing. The initial compressional stress derives from the displacement of the shell body during assembly. The required displacement of a Class VII flextensional transducer is calculated using the finite element method (FEM), which is validated by experiment. Compressional pre-stress as a function of water depth is also investigated, since this has the potential to exploit the high-power capability of Terfenol rod.

The proposed methodology is also supplemented by the competent and widely tested absorbing boundary condition of the Generalized Perfectly Matched Layer (GPML) developed by the authors in acoustics, for the successful absorption of the travelling waves at the limits and thus the proper termination of the used computational domain. The whole theory is implemented in the case of the rectangular duct with rigid walls in order to compare the simulation results with the exact analytical solution that can be properly derived in such a case and thus to evaluate and verify the effectiveness of the suggested numerical scheme. Numerous simulations of multimodal sound propagation in straight or bent ducts clearly indicate the substantial capabilities of the method as a valuable computational tool in acoustics which can effectively replace the prevailing but costly and cumbersome experimental approaches.",

    "abstract": "The use of porous materials to reduce sound transmission through vibrating structures was investigated in this study. Measurements carried out at LMA showed that adding a layer of melamine foam to a steel plate increases the sound transmission of the treated plate in some frequency bands. A model was therefore developed to predict this increase of the transmitted sound level, induced by covering a vibrating structure with a porous material. The existence of compressional waves, where the quarter wavelength is equal to the thickness of the added layer, was found responsible for the increase of sound transmission at the corresponding frequencies. Biot theory and the equivalent fluid model were used to model the acoustical behavior of the porous material. With the model based on Biot theory, which involves heavy data processing, accurate predictions were obtained. To overcome the drawbacks of the Biot model, a simpler procedure was developed for predicting the frequency range in which transmission increases. Based on the surface admittance at normal incidence, a value which can be easily determined experimentally using an impedance tube, the proposed procedure efficiently predicts the frequency range in which higher sound transmission occurs.",

    "abstract": "This is the first of three articles that deals with the goal of using non-contact nonlinear acoustic methods for the damage localization in plates. In this first part, the resonant air gap wave field between one active and one passive reflecting plate was investigated experimentally. Of particular interest is the wave field amplitude strength, and its distribution on the passive surface. The wave amplitude may be increased by choosing one plate to be concave, overcoming the nonlinear damping taking place for two flat plates. Applications are connected with an increased wave field having advantages for processes taking place under open conditions and for a non-contact transducers' efficiency of transferring energy into an object. A double resonance gives highest air pressure, while a triple provides most energy in the passive object. By choosing the gap distance, frequency and transducer width, the appearing resonant wave will have a considerably larger amplitude at the object surface. The work through the interface from air to object is investigated and the wave field in a resonant air-plate system is shown.",

    "abstract": "Envelope repetition rate (ERR) is an important cue for the pitch of harmonic complex tones (HCT), especially when the tone consists entirely of unresolved harmonics. Neural synchronization to the stimulus envelope provides a prominent cue for ERR in the auditory periphery, but this temporal code becomes degraded and gives way to rate codes in higher centers. The inferior colliculus (IC) likely plays a key role in this temporal-to-rate code transformation. Here we recorded single IC neuron responses to HCT at varying fundamental frequencies (F0). ERR was manipulated by applying different inter-harmonic phase relationships. We identified a subset of neurons that showed a 'non-tonotopic' rate tuning to ERR between 160 and 1500 Hz. A comparison of neural responses to HCT and sinusoidally amplitude modulated (SAM) noise suggests that this tuning is dependent on the shape of stimulus envelope. A phenomenological model is able to reproduce the non-tonotopic tuning to ERR, and suggests it arises in the IC via synaptic inhibition.",

P.863) and VISQOL. A modified version of the methodology defined in the ITU-T Rec. P.835 was derived and used in this paper to subjectively assess the listening speech quality, the listening audio quality as well as the overall listening quality of the waiting loop perceived by the user. It is expected that the perceived listening quality of the customer support waiting loop can influence the overall quality of the customer support communication service. The waiting loop consisted of a speech announcement and a music fragment. Both are assessed separately as well as overall. The results show that the degradations introduced by the investigated codecs and packet loss, representing typical degradations commonly seen in voice communication over telecommunication networks, seriously impact the subjectively perceived listening quality of the speech announcement and music fragment as well as the overall subjectively perceived listening quality of the waiting loop. As expected the listening quality of the music fragment is, in most of the cases, significantly lower than the listening speech quality of the announcement. The POLQA results show a high correlation between subjective and objective measurements for the listening speech and audio quality as well as the overall listening quality of the waiting loop. On the other hand, it is shown that the VISQOL model provides too low correlations between predicted objective and subjective scores for accurate prediction of the listening speech and audio quality as well as the overall listening quality of the waiting loop. © S.

The method is based on the head-related transfer function (HRTF) database and the interaural transfer function (ITF) obtained from two measured input signals. An algorithm to reduce the effect of background noise on the localization performance in a noisy environment was adopted in the proposed localization method. Weighted error functions (WEFs), defined using the ITF and the ratio of HRTFs for two ears, were used with a special frequency weighting function derived to reduce the effect of noise and to render the WEF a physical meaning. Computer simulations confirmed that the weighting function can effectively reduce the effect of background noise on the localization performance even if the noise power is very high. Localization tests in an actual room confirmed that both the azimuth and elevation angles of sound source can be estimated simultaneously with high accuracy. In particular, the front-back and updown confusions, which are critical limitations for conventional localization methods, could be resolved using two input signals.",

    "abstract": "The Helmholtz-Kirchhoff integral (HKI) formula is very useful when designing transducers because it can be used to predict the acoustic pressure of a radiator at any position given only the acoustic pressure and velocity of the source. Many studies have been carried out to determine how to predict the acoustic pressure distributions generated by radiator sources using the HKI formula and boundary conditions. However, if the surface integration process includes radiator edges or vertices, then it is difficult to predict a consistent acoustic pressure distribution accurately, and the precise HKI formula to solve this problem and rigorous derivation are not known. In this article, to overcome these limitations, a formulation of the HKI for the boundary is proposed. This formulation is based on intuitive considerations and proven mathematically. Using the proposed expression of the HKI formula for the boundary, the acoustic pressures radiated by irregular surfaces were calculated and compared with the distributions obtained by the finite element method and theoretically exact solutions. The results obtained with the proposed formulation of the HKI were confirmed to be more accurate than those of the conventional HKI formula.",

A directional converter of longitudinal vibration with multiple outputs composed of an input rod, a hemispherical vibrator, and three output rods is presented. The frequency equation used in the design is derived with free edges at the input and output ends of the converter, as well as the continuity of displacements, forces, and angles of rotation at each component junction. The resonant frequencies of three fabricated converters designed using the proposed method are in good agreement with those from the finite element method and also with tested values. With the input end of the converter joined with a piezoelectric transducer with a resonant frequency of 19.8 kHz, the longitudinal vibration modes and displacement amplitudes of the output ends of the three converters at their resonant frequencies are tested. The results show that longitudinal vibration can be transferred from the input end to the multi-output ends through the converter. Furthermore, there exists a linear relationship between the excitation voltage and the displacements of each output of the converter.",

Depending on the nature of the tracks, for instance when considering diverging tracks compared to very narrow tracks, the number of subtracks needs to be such that smooth noise contours and footprints are computed, putting a requirement on the minimum number of subtracks needed. In practice however, as the tracks need to be digitized by expert hand, the number of available subtracks is often limited. Furthermore, the location of the subtracks is often unknown, requiring corridor boundaries to be estimated and to be translated into subtrack locations.&lt;br/&gt; This paper presents a method for the construction of the required number of subtracks based on an estimate of lateral flight dispersion. Two cases are envisioned: the first being an estimate of the lateral flight dispersion using a set of three pre-existing subtracks (one backbone track and left/right subtracks), the second being an estimate using a backbone track and corridor boundaries. The method uses geometric matching of the original tracks, followed by an estimation of the local lateral track dispersion. The lateral distribution function is then used for the construction of new subtracks. A series of aircraft noise calculations using diff erent numbers of subtracks are shown, showcasing the influence of the number of subtracks on the noise contours, depending on the nature of the tracks (e.g.situations with tight turns).",

    "abstract": "Bottom bounce is a typical sound propagation mode in deep oceans. A receiver moored below the sea surface receives sound waves transmitted from a submerged source through multipath paths. Four of them which traveled by bottom bounce mode play the leading role in source localization. A passive broadband source localization method is proposed herein based on the four arrival paths and using a single receiver. Through autocorrelation of the signal that is mainly composed of four multipath arrivals, six positive relative time diff erences that are dependent on the source range and depth are acquired via combination. The time diff erences are sorted in an ascending order to form a measured vector. A ray-tracing model is used to predict the replica vector. Then, the source is localized by fitting the replica vector to the measured one. An experiment is conducted in the South China Sea. The proposed method is utilized to successfully localize a source at a depth of 47 m below the surface and at a distance of 13.6 km.",

    "abstract": "A method is proposed here to synthesize the acoustic response of a room to a musical reed wind instrument with tone holes played by a musician. The procedure uses convolution of a) two measured pulse responses and b) the mouthpiece pressure during playing. The novelty of the approach is to include the sound radiation directivity of the source in the impulse response measurement of the room by using the wind instrument's air column as an exciter. At the reed input end of the air column pressure pulses at typical peak pressures of several kilopascals are generated using a compressor and a solenoid valve, which provides a high SNR even at distant measurement positions. For auralization purpose, the source signal measurement is done very close to the sound generation locus, i.e. inside the mouthpiece. Because this measurement is largely insensitive to room acoustics, the proposed method can be considered a very convenient alternative to music recordings in anechoic conditions. As a proof of concept we report here experimental results for the case of a bassoon. The method can be extended to auralizations of reed and lip-reed musical instruments in virtual acoustic scenes, and sheds light on the importance of the reflective and radiative properties of the air column for the sound coloration.",

The functionally graded beam is one of the commonly used components to bear forces in the structure. Accurate analysis of the dynamic characteristics of the axially functionally graded (AFG) beam plays a vital role in the design and safe operation of the whole structure. Based on the Euler-Bernoulli beam theory (EBT), the characteristic equation of transverse free vibration for the AFG Euler-Bernoulli beam with variable cross-section is obtained in the present work, and the governing equations of the beam are transformed into ordinary differential equations with variable coefficients. Using differential quadrature method (DQM), the solution formulas of characteristic equations under different boundary conditions are derived, and the natural frequencies of the AFG beam are calculated, while the node partition of a non-uniform geometric progression is discussed.",

The current study aims at comparing the two methods in terms of total annoyance model testing. It revealed that annoyance models, respectively built within imaginary and simulated contexts, provided similar prediction when they were tested using in-field annoyance responses.

These losses are prominent in a boundary layer near the tube walls. Under the assumption that the boundary layer is thick compared to a characteristic geometry length, such as the radius for a circular cross-section, and fills out the entire cross-section, the tube can be described via a lumped parameter model. The lumped parameters have been known for several decades for a tube with circular cross-section, but the equilateral triangular tube has only been investigated in terms of transmission line parameters. The lumped parameters have here been established for the equilateral triangular tube as a truncated series solution of the transmission line parameters. One result observed is that the lumped parameter model for a triangular tube has 38% more viscous loss than a circular tube for a given area.",

This paper is interested in revealing the effects of physical and geometrical characteristics of the layers constituting the shells on the scattering phenomenon. The object of this work, is to study the influence of the layers thicknesses on guided waves, the overall thickness of the shells is fixed. The plane of modal identification was chosen to analyze the scattering phenomenon. We investigate the resonance trajectories of the guided waves, especially the curves change. The investigation and comparison made on resonance trajectories, show a shape change, a gradual deviation, or both, appear on the resonance trajectories of different guided waves, for the reduced cutoff frequencies of guided waves a sliding to higher and lower value are noticed. The interaction between guided waves is also manifested in the scattering phenomenon. The findings for the bi-layered cylindrical shells are then compared with those obtained for the mono-layered stainless steel and copper cylindrical shells. Then, this work is completed by an investigation on the reduced cut-off frequencies of the A 1 wave, that have been extracted for different possible values of the intermediary radius. In this part, to understand the observed phenomena, other examples of bi-layered cylindrical shells are introduced. The obtained results are analyzed and investigated.",

The comparison between the analytical solutions and the 2.5-D BEM prediction results shows that the BEM calculations for a coherent line source can be used to approximately show the barrier attenuation spectrum for a one-point source and the single-number rating for an incoherent line source when the barrier is straight on the ground. Then, validations with scale modelling tests were performed outdoors under controlled conditions. The results obtained by using several loudspeakers radiating incoherent sounds simultaneously show good agreement with the 2.5-D BEM prediction results for the one-point source and incoherent point sources, not only for a simple barrier on the ground but also for a double-straight barrier on a viaduct. Based on these agreements, the frequency and longitudinal distance dependences on the barrier attenuation for incoherent point sources are discussed to understand the barrier attenuation spectrum for the incoherent line source.",

This information rate sets definite upper limits on the listener's speech-recognition performance. The performance limits depend on the entropy and vocabulary size of the speech material. The estimates of sensory information rate can be used to evaluate to what extent a listeners' performance is limited by peripheral loss of information or by suboptimal central processing. Calculations for a Swedish sentence test material, with an excitation-pattern auditory model, were consistent with human speech recognition results in speech-shaped masking noise. This suggests that the scarcity of sensory information may be the primary limiting factor in this test condition. Similar calculations for low-pass- and high-pass-filtered clean speech indicated a higher sensory information rate than required for the listeners' actual performance. These results suggest that the speech recognition performance under masking and filtering may be limited by different mechanisms. The analysis also showed that the information in adjacent frequency bands is not additive.",

The layer is modeled according to Biot theory and both open and closed pores conditions at the fluid-porous interfaces are considered. Series expansions in the thickness variable are used to replace the porous field variables at the boundaries by their values at the center-plane of the layer. When truncated, this yields a system of equations with the fluid pressures at the surfaces and the porous field variables at the center-plane as unknowns. The problem is split into separate symmetric and antisymmetric cases and is solved by utilizing the governing equations for the porous medium. The result is two 2D differential equations in the plane of the layer which relates the fluid pressures to their normal derivatives at the surfaces. Numerical comparisons are made with 3D Biot theory for two material configurations and two thicknesses. The agreement was found to be better than expected. A thin porous layer may then in some cases be replaced by the approximate boundary conditions and thereby simplify the analysis of fluid-porous coupled problems.",

The analytical solution involves further approximations and has a smaller range of validity than the fast method, but could nonetheless be useful. Both the fast method and the analytical solution assume a flat geometry, whereby they can be useful as a complement to scattering cross-section based methods. Moreover, two-dimensional (2-D) modelling is done and no ground surface is considered.

Among different vehicular impacts (noise, air pollution, etc.) vibrations induced by traffic have recently gained wider attention. Ground-borne vibrations that are produced by dynamic overloads transmitted to the pavement surface by heavy vehicles, propagate through road superstructure and underlying soils and, finally, through structural elements of the buildings (facing the street). These type of vibrations, are supposed to be responsible' for severe nuisance to building occupants and for minor structural damage in heritage buildings. In this paper a mathematical prediction model to assess vibration level induced by road traffic is presented. The prediction model is the composition of several interacting sub-models dealing with the different phases in which the problem can be divided: a generation phase due to the dynamic interaction between vehicle and the roughness of road profile, a phase of transmission of vibrations through the pavement structures and, subsequently, through the underlying soils up to the foundations and to the structures of adjacent buildings. The model has been used to assess the effectiveness of different solutions of antivibrating pavements.",

The step from computer simulations, or even lab studies, to the actual implementation is often much larger than first expected.

The present paper is the first in a series of two, that treat the process of preparing and evaluating an active noise control system. Part I gives a general discussion on proposed methods from a theoretical standpoint. Part II describes the application of these methods in practical measurements in an aircraft application. The emphasis is on multiple-error, multiple-output control but the general guidelines haves proven to be useful even in small applications. The discussion covers some acoustical aspects as well as the signal processing view. A method, based on simulated annealing using the metropolis sampler is suggested for searching the suboptimal positions for the control sources and sensors, including a thorough discussion on the preparation of input data for the optimisation process. Finally, a version of the complex lms algorithm, normalised individually for each actuator, is discussed.",

A classic generic anchor consists of a low-pass filtered version of the audio reference; but evaluation of specific sound properties (for example spatial features) could require a specific anchor. In a first experiment, we evaluated five spatial anchors to find which was the most appropriate for a test including evaluation of Space quality. One of the tested anchors obtained low scores for all the excerpts used. In a second experiment, a copy of this anchor was integrated into an evaluation test of audio codecs, with assessment of the categories Timbre, Defects, and Space. The scores obtained in this test indicated that this anchor fulfilled the required criteria (a low score for the anchor over all excerpts, the correct range of codec scores for Space, and no serious degradation for Timbre and Defects).",

    "abstract": "Great highland bagpipe drones are equipped with single beating reeds. These reeds were traditionally made of cane but more and more musicians nowadays use synthetic reeds. The advantage of synthetic reed is its reduced dependance on air moisture and temperature as well as its increased stability with aging. Despite this advantage, many musicians consider that equipping their instrument with synthetic reeds would degrade its timbre and remain faithful to cane reeds. In the present study, the sound of drones equipped with cane or plastic reeds was first recorded. Expert listeners were then asked to assess these recordings with respect to the following attributes : global quality of sound, clarity, aggressiveness, warmth, volume and immersion. The reed material appeared to be without significant effect on the global quality of drone sound (and also on other perceptual attributes), when one tenor or bass drone was played alon e, and when the two tenor drones and the bass drone were played with the chanter (full set). However, independently of the material, some reeds obtained higher ratings than some other ones. Global Quality was correlated with warmth, immersion and clarity (to a lesser extent with aggressiveness)in full set condition. Correlations between perceptual results and signal analyses showed, about tenor drones, that listeners appreciated sounds having a fundamental frequency with a large magnitude, and less energy for higher harmonics. The analysis of the material influence on these signal properties indicated that synthetic tenor reeds should obtained higher quality ratings (even if this effect was not significant according to the statistical analysis).",

    "abstract": "Prediction of vibration and/or acoustic radiation of machines is an old problem which has in part been solved via a linear vibrations approach. Equipment mounted on a host structure, or receiver, is often responsible for vibration and radiation of the latter. The equipment is called source (electrical motor, ventilation system, cylinder and vibrating laminae in a music box . . . ). The host structure is passive (receiver structure of an engine, building supporting the ventilation system, music box itself. . . ). Beyond the case where one source structure is coupled with a host structure, there are a great number of configurations where the source structure excites an intermediary structure, itself mounted on the receiver. Our contribution pertains to such cases with an application to a car engine cooling fan system: the fan (source) is attached via elastic connections to a plate (intermediary structure), which excites the chassis (receiver) through rigid and elastic links. The vibratory behaviour of the assembled structure depends on those of the structures, which are known either by their technical specifications or because they are physically obtainable. According to the situation, there may or may not be a choice between different methods to predict the vibration and/or acoustic radiation of the host structure. In cases where choice exists, the predictions obtained by different methods vary and this paper attempts to show how to obtain the best prediction of forces imposed on the receiver structure. The originality is to be found in a metrological procedure more apt than another to predict the vibratory behaviour of an assembly in series of three structures in an industrial context. Indeed, when inertance matrices necessary for the prediction are measured on isolated structures, the prediction is of lesser quality than when a certain number of them are measured on coupled structures. This echoes a similar conclusion drawn recently from academic configurations.",

First using an impulsive monopole source of radius R with uniform internal structure. The pressure field is affected by the entire spherical region r &lt; R . Several methods are used. It is first obtained from the difference between the retarded and advanced solutions of the pertinent wave equation for this case. It is also later obtained from the retarded solution alone, confirming the first case. We also illustrate how to obtain the energy supplied to the fluid. The second configuration models two acoustic dipoles of the same strength on a linear collision course. The dipoles come from infinity and reverse directions after collision as they return to infinity. The radiated energy in this case is obtained when the collision occurs at the origin, and later when there is a finite stand-off separation between them. This second situation shows that: (a) less energy is then radiated than in the first, (b) that the radiated energy is then dominated by a τ –5 time decay law rather than a τ –3 law and (c) that in this case one can have more than one “time-duration factor.”",

    "abstract": "Mechanical vibrations of a base which, during measurement, affect the sound level meter (SLM) via a tripod can have a considerable influence on the measuring value displayed. Especially vibrations along the main measuring direction of the microphone (reference direction) cause a mechanical stimulation of the microphone and a considerable reduction of the linear measuring range. To check the vibrational sensitivity, an automatic measuring assembly has been set up in which two sound level meters are exposed simultaneously to a sound field of constant frequency. The displayed A-weighted values of both meters are compared with each other while one of the two meters is stimulated by an electro-dynamic shaker to vibrate at a band limited acceleration of 1 m/s 2 . The stimulation is applied in two directions: (1) in the reference direction of the microphone and (2) turned 90° in the direction perpendicular to the reference direction. The frequency of the stimulation varies between 31.5 Hz and 1 kHz. The result of the measurement shows that the lower limit of linearity under the specified conditions of mechanical vibration may be shifted to a level of up to more than 75 dB(A).",

In this method, the scattered ultrasound generated from the crack is recorded, and the third harmonic nonlinear component of the ultrasonic signal is used to reconstruct an image of the crack by the time reversal process. Numerical simulations are performed to examine the validity of this approach. The fatigue long bone is modeled as a hollow cylinder with a crack of 1, 0.1, and 0.225 mm in axial, radial and circumferential directions respectively. A broadband 500 kHz ultrasonic signal is used as the exciting signal, and the extended three-dimensional Preisach-Mayergoyz model is used to describe the nonclassical nonlinear dynamics of the crack. Time reversal is carried out by using the filtered third harmonic component. The localization capability depends on the radial depth of the crack.",

    "abstract": "The acoustic diffusion performance of a terraced classroom was investigated using a two-dimensional boundary element method. Quadratic residue diffuser (QRD) and porous material were employed on the ceiling and rear wall, respectively, to improve the diffusion performance. The diffusion gains of various models were calculated to compare the diffusion performance. It is found that terraces in a rectangular classroom raise the lowest sound pressure level and provide slight diffusion improvement. The QRD ceiling enhances the diffusion by scattering the sound wave to be more evenly distributed, but at some frequencies the diffusion improvement is minor or even negative. The absorption rear wall provides useful diffusion gain mainly at higher frequencies by absorbing parts of the reflected sound. When the parameters of the QRD ceiling and porous material change, the diffusion improvement first increases and then begins to decrease. In a terraced classroom with both treatments, the diffusion at lower frequencies is similar to that with the QRD ceiling, while at higher frequencies it resembles that with the absorption rear wall. The results clearly indicate that the combination of the two treatments produces the most desirable diffusion performance of the tested models.",

The method is extended for application to three-dimensional situations with both high and low barriers. Calculations are made for a thin, hard screen, without the influence of a ground surface. The Kirchhoff approximation is applied for the low screens and a more accurate diffraction model is used for the higher screens. The calculated results are compared with corresponding ones for two-dimensional situations, by using the substitute-sources method (SSM) also. The two and three-dimensional calculations give very similar results, which indicates that, for a large variety of situations, only two-dimensional models are needed. The results are also compared with those obtained using a scattering cross-section method which, although it predicts a much weaker influence of turbulence than the SSM, shows mostly the same trend, namely that the turbulence influence is large only within a range of lower screen heights.",

It is demonstrated that the optimal detector which is present in the model is crucial to account for specific temporal detection phenomena. In particular, the model can account for the apparent differences in the estimates of binaural time constants found with different experimental paradigms. It is argued that the differences in temporal-window estimates stem from listeners ability to listen off-time, whenever this enhances detection performance.",

Here, 2024 T3 aluminium alloy bonded joints, whose metallic plates underwent phosphoric acid pretreatment prior to bonding, are investigated before and after exposure to ―40°C for 67 hours. This procedure of ageing is repeated several times and the samples are examined, after each cycle by ultrasonic eigen modes of the tri-layer (called Lamb waves in order to traduce the guided form of theses modes). In particular, the position of the cutoff-frequencies of ultrasonic guided waves which propagate into the bonded structure allows us to calculate the stiffnesses of the metal/adhesive interfaces via a rheological model. Thus, after exposure, a progressive decrease in the value of the stiffnesses is observed even for pretreated surfaces.",

    "abstract": "A simple analytical model evaluating the signal loss of reflected and transmitted ultrasonic waves induced by double random rough interfaces was presented based on the Phase-Screen approximation (PSA). By expressing the phase correlation factor of the acoustic beam doubly transmitting through rough interfaces into the function of the flaw depth and the incident angle, the model overcomes some limitations and inadequacy subjected by those models which use only the phase-screen approximation to evaluate the signal loss of waves induced by the single rough interface. The signal attenuation will decrease with the increase of the beamSs incident angle for the flaw near the upper interface, while the signal attenuation is not sensitive to the incident angle, as the flaw is far from the upper interface. The results indicate that the influence of the angle factor for the waves doubly transmitted through the rough interface on the phase correlation will only operate near the upper interface. The experimental results show that the theoretical prediction is in good agreement with experimental measurements. Therefore, the model proposed in the paper is suitable for the real-time ultrasonic non-destructive testing of rough flaws under the rough surfaces in materials.",

This requires the minimization of the noise sources, namely noise from the turbulent flow, combustion noise and noise caused by periodic instabilities and fluctuations of the ignition zone. This has to be achieved under conservation of the benefits of swirl flames, e.g. high ignition stability and broad operation ranges. This paper is focused on the description and characterisation of fluctuations of the ignition zone due to different mixing and stabilization characteristics of noise from swirl flames. Another goal was the description of flame noise caused by the formation and burning of coherent, periodic flow structures, often detected in swirl flows and flames [1, 2, 3, 4]. The physical model offers the possibility to understand the formation mechanism of the coherent flow structures and their effect on the combustion of non-premixed and premixed swirl flames.",

The angular, frequency and joint angular and frequency distributions of the radiated power and / or energy, as well as the total radiated energy, are analytically determined in all cases by spatial, temporal or spectral techniques, thus illustrating their use and derivations.

Analytical results are obtained for the acoustic pressure in the case of a constant gas flow subject to different boundary conditions. In the second part of the paper, the derived wave equation is solved for a parabolic flow profile using the finite-element method and results are compared with the constant-flow case. It is demonstrated that the gas-flow profile does not change the pattern of acoustic resonance frequencies significantly. In particular it is noted that the presence of flow gives rise to new peaks and we show that non-linearities with respect to the mean flow velocity appear already at 1% of the speed of sound at certain frequencies.",

In this experiment, the subjects were able to relate the value of L AeqT to the differences between the seven-point annoyance scale scores displayed. Therefore, they directly gave the value of L AeqT for their acceptable threshold. This study investigated whether each acceptable L Ae q T level can be predicted from the annoyance and noise sensitivity. First, multiple regression models for each outdoor noise source were constructed to predict the annoyance from L Ae q T and the noise sensitivity based on the data collected in and around the city of Nagano. The regression models were used to determine whether each outdoor noise was over or under the acceptable threshold, which was defined as the midpoint between the scores a little annoying and somewhat annoying. The correlation between the experimental results using separate sample of residents from other prefectural capital cities in Japan and the predictions by the regression models was 0.703. Also, the discriminant models were used to classify cases by their values of categorical dependent, where correlation with the proposed models was 0.837, indicating that the discriminant models are valid.",

The proposed scoring procedure classifies the observed sequence of choices in a maximum likelihood sense. The classifier exploits a priory knowledge about the choice statistics estimated from a limited set of observed data. The proposed method was implemented and evaluated in conjunction with a newly developed Internet-based selfscreening test. The implemented test measures localization skills in an interactive auditory virtual environment (AVE) while including both acoustical and behavioral aspects of everyday localization situations. By means of cross-validation, it is shown that the test results of listeners with normal localization skills and the test results of listeners with impaired localization skills can be reliably separated using the introduced scoring method. It is further shown that good classification results are obtained when a uniform a priori density model for the choices of the localization-impaired reference group is applied. © S. Hirzel Verlag.

Contrary to frequency-domain methods, time-domain methods may include non-linear effects and time-varying boundary conditions. However, time-domain modelling of thermoacoustic devices is computationally expensive, due to large differences in geometric length scales and time scales. The primary aim of this paper has been to model thermoacoustic devices with computational efficiency by using two different methods. The acoustic field outside the stack, based on the assumption of plane waves, is modelled using the efficient Equivalent Source Method (ESM), whereas the complex acoustic field in the stack is modelled using a finite-difference model. In a previous paper of the authors, ESM and a finite-difference model have been combined to model acoustic wave propagation, though thermal effects and heat flow to the stack plate were excluded. In this paper, however, these effects are included. The performance of the model is studied and compared to linear thermoacoustic theory. The proposed model may provide a useful tool for studying time-varying acoustic fields and temperature distributions in thermoacoustic devices.",

Thus, there is a need for efficient modelling solutions. One possibility is to combine the established time-domain methods with more efficient methods. The aim of this paper has been to develop a time-domain model combining the equivalent source method (ESM) and the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. The idea was to model the complex acoustic fields using FDTD method and the less complex fields using ESM. These methods were coupled by ensuring continuity of volume velocity and pressure at the boundary between them. Simulations with the combination of the methods were compared to analytical and experimental results, and shown to be accurate and numerically stable for 1-D energy flow, including viscous attenuation. Furthermore, the combination proved significantly quicker than using only the FDTD method. Combining ESM and FDTD has potential as a computationally efficient alternative compared to the latter alone.",

Complete system architecture is proposed that recovers the lost information by using a model of real instruments in order to make the separation of individual musical notes possible.

    "abstract": "Structure-borne sound sources are ideally characterised by taking into account six degrees of freedom: three translational components and three rotational components. The complexity of such a characterisation is immense and the effort to measure all components is not realistic or even impossible. If a practical characterisation of structure-borne sound sources in building acoustics is aimed for, reliable information about the importance of the different components is essential. In search for possible simplifications of the degrees of freedom, a series of measurements was carried out on a scale model of an excentric motor connected to a plate on a small receiving room of one cubic metre. The sound pressure in the receiving room was used to verify whether a prediction based on the measured normal source components leads to a correct result. The deviations between the direct pressure measurement and the calculation give some guidance to whether the simplification can be justified or not for the particular structure-borne sound source under test. Once the relevant degrees of freedom have been determined, a simplified prediction based on separately measured source and receiver characteristics can be carried out. The measurement procedure is meant as a method to verify potential simplifications for the characterisation of structure-borne sound sources. It also quantifies in advance the accuracy of a prediction based on those simplifications.",

Recursive process gives interfacial displacements and stresses fields in term of deepness. A fast-Fourier transform (FFT) procedure has been used in order to extract the wave numbers propagating in the multilayer. For di erent incidence angle, the upper frequency bound of this homogenization domain is estimated. Inside the homogenization domain, we discover a maximum of three planes waves susceptible to propagate in the medium. The dispersion curves reveal a linear behavior below this frequency limit. A consistent algorithm is adopted to develop an inverse procedure for the determination of the materials constants of multidirectional composite. The extracted wave numbers are used as the inputs for the SAHM model. The outputs of (SAHM) are the elastic constants of multidirectional composite. Using this method, the frequency dependent e ective elastic constants are obtained and example for [0 /90 ] composite is given.",

The specific acoustic impedance will be calculated from microphone signals of a p-p intensity probe, and the H 2 estimator will demonstrate that it provides the best estimate both at fixed measuring points and in scanning. The absorption coefficient calculated from the specific acoustic impedance is related to the sound field characterisation in the vicinity of the panels: in the very low frequency region it presents maxima and minima attributable to the behaviour of the channels between panels as open-closed tubes, and also shows the effect of the first transverse standing wave in fixed point measurements performed in the centre of the channel opening. This effect disappears in the scanning measurement providing an average absorption curve in a wide area in front of the absorbers. A simple model can be made from the results for the absorption of the wideband absorbers of the rear wall of the room.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasonic hyperthermia and thermo-ablation are two promising alternatives for local overheating of deep-seated human tumours. After a short characterisation of the two techniques and the identification of the main parameters, results of an analytical theory of local heat up, cooling, and heat diffusion are presented. The theory is based on a spherical model for hyperthermia with a critical thermal dose and on a cylinder-symmetrical model for thermo-ablation with a critical temperature threshold for thermal toxicity and cell death through coagulative necrosis. Two representative hard ware concepts are discussed. The hyperthermia applicator consists of a MHz transducer, which rotates concentrically in a water filled capsule with acoustically transparent window, and radiates collimated or focussed ultrasound under 45$\\,^{\\circ}$ into a concentric target area of nearly spherical symmetry. The applicator for thermo-ablation is a MHz transducer which radiates high intensity focussed ultrasound (HIFU) into cigar shaped target areas at the focal zone. Typical therapy diagrams for both techniques are presented. They show therapeutic target volumes as functions of the therapy time with the peak temperature or the radiated acoustic power as parameters. These diagrams are discussed under consideration of power requirement, maximal sound intensity, and power efficiency at close to optimized frequency conditions.",

The modal analysis of the sound fields in both types of ducts proceeds in parallel over wide parts; the numerical solutions, however, reveal significant differences. The case of the duct bend was treated in Part I of this paper; this part will be concerned with the ring-shaped duct. Several forms of developments of the characteristic equation for the radial wave numbers as mode solutions will be described; all of them intend to approximate the characteristic equation by a polynomial equation so that its solutions can be used as starters for a numerical solution of the complete charateristic equation, thus leading to sets of mode solutions. Finally, a set of modes from a flat duct with un-symmetrical lining, which are easily and safely determined by a continued-fraction expansion, are used as starters for modes of a ring-shaped channel with same width and lining. This works quite well under certain parameter conditions.",

This is realized for a number of different configurations with water as the medium and nylon as the cord material. The results obtained here could hopefully serve as the first step towards estimating the noise generated by very large networks of cords, like a fishing net where a knowledge of sound generated by different gears is of utmost importance.",

    "abstract": "A numerical method is proposed to describe, in the frequency domain, the elastic waves radiated from a piezoelectric transducer in an infinite elastic formation in the rotational symmetric case. It relies upon the coupling between the Finite Element Method, to model the transducer and the surrounding formation up to a spherical boundary, and a series expansion, to model the field on and outside the boundary. Validation tests conducted on point force show that the accuracy of the results is mainly determined by the number of terms used in the series expansion which has to be increased when the frequency increases. The method is applied to the design of a directional piezoelectric source. The directional radiation is obtained by controlling electrically the symmetrical and anti-symmetrical vibrations of a double-ended longitudinal vibrator. The control law on electrical excitation is extracted from the numerical computation and a directional radiation is obtained for both longitudinal and transverse waves.",

In order to study theoretically the acoustical property due to the total hole area, the holes were treated as an orifice, such, as an example, as in the short open pipe system. This theoretical result was in an excellent agreement with the experimental one. In detail, the acoustic impedance due to the hole could be greatly increased with a decrease in hole area. Therefore, it can be concluded that the acoustic property of a micro-speaker could be changed by increasing the acoustic impedance due to the hole, by reducing the hole area.",

Numerical results show that the proposed method is valid for obtaining a good imaging of the location and shape of the scattering object, even when the far-field data are measured in a limited aperture and corrupted by noise. Generally, multiple scattering effects between the object and the waveguide boundaries have some influence the reconstruction of the scattering object.",

Quantities such as Young's modulus and the shear modulus, Poisson's ratio and material damping must be known when dealing with noise problems in analytical and numerical calculations. By classical methods, often only a single number is obtained which is real and independent of frequency. Sometimes, however, this is not sufficient. If a material behaves visco-elastically, we can use N-parameter-models to describe its behaviour. Then, the aforesaid properties can be described as complex numbers and in dependence of frequency, often with just a fistful of parameters which are valid for a wide frequency range. This paper gives a short introduction into the theory of visco-elastic materials and presents three different measurement examples of parameter identification.",

    "abstract": "A higher-order curvilinear finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique, combined with the alternating-direction implicit (ADI) concept, is presented in this paper for the unconditionally stable characterization and optimal design of modem 3-D acoustic propagation arrangements. Departing from a compact non-standard dis-cretization discipline, applied directly to the general form of the linearized Euler's equations, the novel method develops a family of accurate spatial/temporal operators and introduces a dual-mesh framework for the correct association of velocity components and pressure values. Moreover, the presence of an arbitrary mean flow vector in lossy regions is efficiently treated via a stencil control process that selects the appropriate candidate according to the problem, under study. On the other hand, different media interfaces, not necessarily aligned with grid's cells, are elaborately analyzed in terms of a convergent algorithm which satisfies the physical continuity conditions and exhibits enhanced directional sensitivity. To truncate open-boundary regions and ensure satisfactory annihilation rates for the intricate vorticity and entropy waves, the higher-order technique introduces a parameterized perfectly matched layer (PML) absorber. Finally, the frequent case of bent ducts with flexible or rigid walls and changeable cross-section is rigorously manipulated by a multimodal decomposition process that decouples non-separable modes. Hence, the detrimental dispersion errors of customary approaches are drastically subdued and the prolonged duration of time-domain simulations is safely circumvented through time increments far above the Courant criterion. Numerical results, concerning various modern acoustic structures as well as extensive comparisons with reference data, confirm the preceding merits and yield optimized configurations.",

The indicators L den and L night , prescribed by the European Environmental Noise Directive for noise mapping, are of main interest. Sound propagation over flat ground from a long, straight highway is simulated, for receiver distances ranging from 50 m to 2000 m. Detailed, meteorological data from a tower (located near Mol, Belgium), for a full year, is used. An extended database containing yearly-averaged hourly traffic counts is available. Detailed sound propagation calculations are made with the Green's Function Parabolic Equation method, accounting for the refractive state of the atmosphere and range-dependent ground effect. The imprecision introduced by averaging meteorological conditions and traffic intensities over time, and by not fully accounting for the temporal correlation between them, may result in an underestimation up to 20dB(A) for one-day L den values, using this particular meteorological data set. For yearly-averaged values, the imprecision may reach 3dB(A). For L night , very similar conclusions could be drawn. Multiple linear regression analysis is used to rank the factors that contribute to the imprecision. This led to the conclusion that the decrease in accuracy resulting from different averaging approaches is mainly proportional to the variability in the refractive state of the atmosphere over a 24 hour-period. The type of traffic intensity profile may intensify this error up to 10dB(A). The use of meteorological data, statistically-averaged over the year, results in a small loss in accuracy compared to calculating noise levels for every hour of the year and averaging the result afterwards. The error introduced by the approach used to average meteorological condition and traffic intensity over the day is not affected by this.",

    "abstract": "This paper will discuss two methods for obtaining derived, noise-evoked otoacoustic emissions (NEOAEs). The first, originally proposed by Maat et al. [1], utilises the polynomial correlation functions. The application of linear compensation on the estimation of these functions is investigated in a more formal manner than in earlier publications, by looking at its effect on the statistical estimators. The second, related but novel, approach of obtaining derived-NEOAEs is based on rescaling the H1-estimator. Then moving back and forth between the time and frequency domains, separating the response into short and long latency temporal regions, in order to perform linear compensation. The errors on this second method are discussed, and two sources are highlighted; one due to random error on the estimates themselves; and the other due to numerical artefacts from the use of band-limited excitation. It is observed that the highest level excitation signal, counter intuitively, produces the noisiest estimate. A method of reducing noise-induced artefacts in the output spectra for the derived-NEOAEs is proposed that takes into account redundancy in the time series.",

Idealized conditions and an analytical slope wind profile (Prandtl's equations) are used. Simple ray calculations suggest that parts of the sound energy emitted from a near-surface acoustical source are trapped near the ground, independent of whether the sound propagates in upslope/upwind or downslope/downwind direction. Linear Euler finite-difference time-domain simulations corroborate this finding and predict a sound amplification relative to a no-wind condition for both propagation directions provided rigid ground is assumed. For absorbing ground it is found that downslope/downwind propagation results in a strong damping. In this case the slope wind effect is just opposite to what is usually expected over flat terrain with respect to upwind or downwind sound propagation.",

    "abstract": "An approximate approach to derive the input mobility of an infinite elastic stratum on a rigid base is investigated. The excitation is due to a vertical force, which is applied via a small massless indenter with a circular base, fixed to the stratum. Two cases are investigated: a stratum with a fixed base and a stratum with a frictionless base. General expressions for the mobilities are derived from the equations of motion of an isotropic elastic medium. Using a numerical approach, the analytical results are evaluated up to a Helmholtz number k L d = 10, where k L is the wave number of the P- wave and d is the stratum depth. For small Helmholtz numbers, asymptotic expressions are derived analytically; the two evaluations agree well up to a Helmholtz number of 0.2 for the frictionless base and to 0.5 for the fixed base. It is shown that the mobilities for the two cases differ significantly at small Helmholtz numbers. This is mainly due to the influence of a propagating wave, which can exist only in the case of a frictionless base. It is also shown that the local deformations in the vicinity of the indenter are built up by low-frequency, non-propagating Lamb modes. Finally, the dispersion relations are evaluated up to a Helmholtz number k L d = 16.",

A discrete vegetation noise model was developed and compared to an earlier model showing improved estimations, especially at frequencies below 0.5 kHz. Field measurements of sound from deleafed trees are compared to a deleafed tree model with satisfactory agreement. A wind turbulence model (Sandia method) was coupled to the discrete model and thereby time series of fluctuating vegetation noise can be computed. Several measurements including higher wind speeds than reported in earlier literature were compared to predictions of fluctuating vegetation noise with good agreement. Psycho acoustic tests was performed by 36 subjects to determine the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios when wind turbine noise is inaudible in three different natural ambient noises. The masking threshold varied between -6.5 dBA and -2.7 dBA for coniferous tree noise and sea wave noise respectively. Further tests revealed that at S/N ratios of +3dBA and above the wind turbine noise was considered as the dominant sound source.",

    "abstract": "The second part of this paper deals with the exact solution for the force mobility of an infinite elastic stratum with respect to a vertical force. The stratum rests on a rigid and frictionless foundation. The upper surface of the stratum is excited by a circular weightless indenter with a prescribed velocity; otherwise this surface is stress-free. The mixed boundary conditions result in dual integral equations, which are solved using analytical and numerical techniques. An exact analytical solution for the force mobility of the stratum is determined by using the method of resolvent kernel together with the residue theorem. The results are validated by comparisons with the results from a numerical solution using the quadrature method. It is shown that the results from an approximate solution as presented in the first part, where the prescribed velocity is exchanged for a presumed stress distribution, agrees well with the present results for low frequencies up to approximately the first thickness resonance, but not for higher frequencies.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic Wood anomaly is a pulsed ultrasound phenomenon in which sharp spectral anomalies such as tips or dips or both occur in the spectrum of a pulse reflected from or transmitted through a periodically corrugated interface for normal incidence. To date only surface acoustic waves generated on periodic interface through diffraction mechanism have been identified as the physical source of these spectral anomalies, and each anomaly has been proved being matched by specific order(s) of diffraction of related surface wave(s) with high accuracy. However, in this study, we report the observation of several anomalies that are not originated from surface waves, and an anomaly that cannot be matched by any individual order of diffraction. Using a proposed sectional analysis approach, comb filtering effect is proved to be a new source of spectral anomalies, and a multiple surface wave theory is developed not only to provide a satisfactory explanation for the unusual anomaly observed, but also to serve as a general guideline for understanding spectral anomaly formation.",

    "abstract": "This thesis, gathering four papers, concerns the enhancement in understanding and modelling of the audible dynamic stiffness of vibration rubber isolators including experimental measurements. Paper A studies the performances of three different types of vibration isolator using an indirect measurement technique to estimate the blocked dynamic transfer stiffness of each specimen. The measurements are performed over a wide audible frequency range of 200 to 1000 Hz in a specially designed test rig enabling the investigation of arbitrary preload influences. Paper B addresses the modelling of the audible-frequency stiffness of the rubber conical mount experimentally appraised in Paper A accounting for preload effects. The model is based on a simpliflied waveguide approach approximating the nonlinearities attributed to the predeformations by adopting shape factor considerations. The carbon black filled rubber is assumed incompressible, displaying a viscoelastic behavior based on a fractional derivative Kelvin-Voigt model efficiently reducing the number of required material parameters. In Paper C the focus is on the axial dynamic stiffness modelling of an arbitrary long rubber bushing within the audible frequency range. The problems of simultaneously satisfying the locally non-mixed boundary conditions at the radial and end surfaces are solved by adopting a waveguide approach, using the dispersion relation for axially symmetric waves in thick-walled infinite plates, while fulfilling the radial boundary conditions by mode-matching. The results obtained are successfully compared with simpliflied models but display discrepancies when increasing the diameter-to-length ratios since the influence of higher order modes and dispersion augments. Paper D develops an effective waveguide model for a pre-compressed cylindrical vibration isolator within the audible frequency domain at arbitrary compressions. The original, mathematically arduous problem of simultaneously modelling the preload and frequency dependence is solved by applying a novel transformation of the pre-strained isolator into a globally equivalent homogeneous and isotropic configuration enabling the straightforward application of a waveguide model to satisfy the boundary conditions. The results obtained present good agreement with the non-linear finite element results for a wide frequency range of 20 to 2000 Hz at different preloads.",

    "abstract": "Nanoemulsion preparation and improvement play a pivotal role in the area of pharmaceuticals, food, mechanical, and chemical engineering. The ultrasonic technique is one of the most commonly used methods in preparing nanoemulsion, related to mechanical and electrical engineering. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of edge fillet radius in four different layouts of a cubic ultrasonic microcontainer at different frequencies through 36 simulations by using COMSOL Multiphysics software. To this aim, the simulations were performed in three edge fillet radius values of zero, 2.5 and 5 mm, and at the excitation frequencies of 20, 200 and 300 kHz. In this regard, experimental tests were carried out in two modes of: a) regular ultrasonic bath (RUB) and b) filleted-edges ultrasonic bath (FEUB). Based on the simulation and experimental results, the removal of sharp edges has a positive influence on propagating waves, leading to an increase in the acoustic energy density at different frequencies and the effect was more significant at lower frequencies and layouts with more PZTs.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this work is to numerically study the fluid flow and acoustic field of a supersonic impinging jet by applying the vorticity confinement (VC) method. For this aim, the three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations with the incorporation of the VC method are considered and the resulting system of equations is solved by using the sixth-order compact finite-difference scheme. To eliminate the numerical instability, a low-pass high-order filter is used. The nonreflective boundary conditions are applied for all the free boundaries and the radiated sound field is obtained by the Kirchhoff surface integration. Comparisons of the present results with the experimental data and other numerical simulations show that the solution methodology adopted based on the application of the VC method with the high-order compact finite-difference scheme provides a good prediction of the fluid flow and the acoustic field of the impingement region on coarser grids than that usually required in the LESs, and thus, the calculations of coarse grid LESs are improved.",

    "abstract": "This article presents a methodological approach to try to respond to some of the protection and management needs against the noise of a peri-urban natural park. The methodology presented is based on the generation of \"ad hoc\" noise maps. To analyze its possibilities and the limits of use, a coastal park surrounded by a densely populated area in the southwest of Spain is used as a case study. In this study, birds in their diverse ecosystems are the main target noise receiver of the study. The source of noise pollution considered is the traffic noise of the highways and the urbanized areas surrounding the park. However, the methodology can be extrapolated to any source of noise and other protection figures. An adequate diagnosis of the environmental noise would help to overcome the supposed incompatibility between the preservation of nature and the tourist exploitation of natural spaces. With this in mind, it has also been proposed as target noise receivers, the ornithologists and visitors who wish to become bird-watchers and bird-listeners. To this end, it has been proposed to produce noise maps with certain methodological guidelines that fit on a case-by-case basis. Several heights are used in this paper, adapting the map to noise receivers. With the same purpose, noise level maps in octave bands were developed. The tonal frequencies of interest are those that the birds use in their songs (according to the species, normally between 2 and 8 kHz). The maps have been contrasted with noise measurements carried out throughout the park. The study shows that in the areas most exposed to the noise of the Rio San Pedro and the university campus, noise levels at 2 kHz can reach 74 dB during the peak traffic hours. In addition, a large percentage of the area of both areas is affected by noise levels that exceed 50 dB (100% and 44% respectively). We are also concerned that a small population of birds has been counted in these areas based on preliminary observations at peak traffic times. The results can help the decision-makers to evaluate how traffic noise invades different ecosystems and where it can mask the sound of birds.",

    "abstract": "Propagation of waves in nonlinear, dispersive and dissipative media, as described by Korteweg-de Vries-Burgers' equation (KdVB), have been studied. The focus of the investigation has been to study analyticaly, the structure of a shock wave that is broken down by dispersive and dissipative phenomena. To be able to use the inverse scattering transform (IST) to get analytical solutions for Korteweg-de Vries' equation (KdV), an N-wave was used as model for the initial shock. The IST is used to transform KdV, which is a nonlinear differential equation, into Marchenko's equation that is a linear Volterra integral equation. A zeroth order iteration solution, which reconstructs the initial waveform, is presented. For positive times, this solution shows a decaying shock front which slows down, leaving an oscillating tail behind. In the early stages, the behaviour of the leading and the tailing shock of the N-wave are similar but soon the structure caused by the tailing shock is disrupted by the oscillating tail of the leading shock. This solution is valid for moderate values of the dispersion coefficient. In order to obtain solutions for smaller values of the dispersion coefficient, asymptotic analysis is used. The corresponding asymptotic analysis for Burgers' equation, with a small dissipation coefficient, is quoted for comparison. An asymptotic analysis is also made for KdVB, in the case for which dispersion as well as dissipation is important.",

    "abstract": "The spectral latency of otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) is physically due to the cochlear traveling time from the base to the tonotopic site and back. The Greenwood map provides the relation between the position of the tonotopic place along the cochlea and the frequency. As a consequence, the latency is intrinsically dependent on frequency. The relation between OAE latency and frequency is also related to the tuning curve, i.e. the relation between the quality factor of cochlear resonances and frequency. In this work we use a theoretical model for the cochlear transmission, which permits to compute the OAE spectral latency as a function of the tuning spectral curve. By inverting this functional relation, the model was used to estimate the tuning curve in a population of adult and neonate subjects. Spectral latency was measured by wavelet time-frequency analysis of transient evoked OAE data. Independently, we used theoretical models of spontaneous OAEs generation, based on the Bragg condition for coherent reflection by random cochlear inhomogeneities, to get an independent relation between minimum spacing between spontaneous OAEs and spectral tuning. Very good agreement was found between the estimates of spectral tuning obtained on the same neonate subjects with the two independent methods.",

    "abstract": "The idea that otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) can be used to perform an early detection of hearing loss is strongly supported by both theoretical considerations and experimental evidence. It is well-known that the amplitude of the transient evoked OAE (TEOAEs) is dominated by the contribution of the spectral components for which the cochlear amplifier is most effective (spontaneous or long-lasting OAEs). It is also well-known that the outer hair cells (OHCs) are the first part of the auditory system to be damaged by noise. Thus it is quite obvious to predict that mild cochlear damage due to the early effects of noise exposure could be detected by using OAE measurements. Hall and Lutman (1999) have shown that OAEs are indeed more sensitive than standard audiometry in a range of mild hearing loss, by taking into account the sensitivity and test-retest fluctuations of both techniques. Lucertini et al. (2002) have shown that TEOAE parameters can effectively discriminate not only between populations of normal and impaired subjects, but also between exposed and nonexposed to noise. Moleti et al. (2002) have further demonstrated that both linear and nonlinear TEOAEs can effectively be used for this task.",

The choice fol a certain method has implications with respect to a variety of aspects. A well-considered choice for a certain method depends on these implications.

The results show that in condition 1, /θ/ is equally recognized in both contexts, while /f/ is significantly better recognized in the /u/ context. Adding the vowel improves recognition for every FV combination, except for /fe/, which is only acceptably recognized in the whole word condition. Those effects were the same for both forms of speech. Some acoustic characteristics of the frication noise and of the vocalic portion were investigated in relation to the listeners' responses. The results of the acoustic analysis indicate that the low frequency part of the middle fricative spectrum has some perceptual relevance for fricative distinction, although it does not provide a complete explanation of the perceptual data. The analysis of the vocalic portion reveals that there are consistent differences in F2 and/or F3 between the two fricative contexts, although the perceptual relevance of that contrast seems to depend on the vocalic context: while for vowel /u/ the F2 contrast seems to provide a reasonable explanation of the perceptual improvement in fricative identification for both forms when the vowel is added, for /e/ only the Hypo data seem to support the perceptual relevance of a F2-F3 combination. On the other hand, formant slopes do not explain that perceptual improvement.",
