    "abstract": "We are quickly passing through the historical moment when people work in front of a single computer, dominated by a small CRT and focused on tasks involving only local information. Networked computers are becoming ubiquitous and are playing increasingly significant roles in our lives and in the basic infrastructures of science, business, and social interaction. For human-computer interaction to advance in the new millennium we need to better understand the emerging dynamic of interaction in which the focus task is no longer confined to the desktop but reaches into a complex networked world of information and computer-mediated interactions. We think the theory of distributed cognition has a special role to play in understanding interactions between people and technologies, for its focus has always been on whole environments: what we really do in them and how we coordinate our activity in them. Distributed cognition provides a radical reorientation of how to think about designing and supporting human-computer interaction. As a theory it is specifically tailored to understanding interactions among people and technologies. In this article we propose distributed cognition as a new foundation for human-computer interaction, sketch an integrated research framework, and use selections from our earlier work to suggest how this framework can provide new opportunities in the design of digital work materials.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of computing into the physical world promises more than the ubiquitous availability of computing infrastructure; it suggest new paradigms of interaction inspired by constant access to information and computational capabilities. For the past decade, application-driven research on abiquitous computing (ubicomp) has pushed three interaction themes: natural interfaces, context-aware applications, and automated capture and access . To chart a course for future research in ubiquitous computing, we review the accomplishments of these efforts and point to remaining research challenges. Research in ubiquitious computing implicitly requires addressing some notion of scale, whether in the number and type of devices, the physical space of distributed computing, or the number of people using a system. We posit a new area of applications research, everyday computing, focussed on scaling interaction with respect to time. Just as pushing the availiability of computing away from the traditional desktop fundamentally changes the relationship between humans and computers, providing continuous interaction moves computing from a localized tool to a constant companion. Designing for continous interaction requires addressing interruption and reumption of intreaction, representing passages of time and providing associative storage models. Inherent in all of these interaction themes are difficult issues in the social implications of ubiquitous computing and the challenges of evaluating&gt; ubiquitious computing research. Although cumulative experience points to lessons in privacy, security, visibility, and control, there are no simple guidelines for steering research efforts. Akin to any efforts involving new technologies, evaluation strategies form a spectrum from technology feasibility efforts to long-term use studies—but a user-centric perspective is always possible and necessary",

Contexts in which relationships are particularly important are described, together with specific benefits (like trust) and task outcomes (like improved learning) known to be associated with relationship quality. We especially consider the problem of designing for long-term interaction, and define relational agents as computational artifacts designed to establish and maintain long-term social-emotional relationships with their users. We construct the first such agent, and evaluate it in a controlled experiment with 101 users who were asked to interact daily with an exercise adoption system for a month. Compared to an equivalent task-oriented agent without any deliberate social-emotional or relationship-building skills, the relational agent was respected more, liked more, and trusted more, even after four weeks of interaction. Additionally, users expressed a significantly greater desire to continue working with the relational agent after the termination of the study. We conclude by discussing future directions for this research together with ethical and other ramifications of this work for HCI designers.",

We call such systems “socially translucent systems” and suggest that they have three characteristics—visbility, awareness, and accountability—which enable people to draw upon their experience and expertise to structure their interactions with one another. To motivate and focus our ideas we develop a vision of knowledge communities, conversationally based systems that support the creation, management and reuse of knowledge in a social context. We describe our experience in designing and deploying one layer of functionality for knowledge communities, embodied in a working system called “Barbie” and discuss research issues raised by a socially translucent approach to design.",

    "abstract": "A user interface software tool helps developers design and implement the user interface. Research on past tools has had enormous impact on today's developers—virtually all applications today are built using some form of user interface tool. In this article, we consider cases of both success and failure in past user interface tools. From these cases we extract a set of themes which can serve as lessons for future work. Using these themes, past tools can be characterized by what aspects of the user interface they addressed, their threshold and ceiling, what path of least resistance they offer, how predictable they are to use, and whether they addressed a target that became irrelevant. We believe the lessons of these past themes are particularly important now, because increasingly rapid technological changes are likely to significantly change user interfaces. We are at the dawn of an era where user interfaces are about to break out of the “desktop” box where they have been stuck for the past 15 years. The next millenium will open with an increasing diversity of user interface on an increasing diversity of computerized devices. These devices include hand-held personal digital assistants (PDAs), cell phones, pages, computerized pens, computerized notepads, and various kinds of desk and wall size-computers, as well as devices in everyday objects (such as mounted on refridgerators, or even embedded in truck tires). The increased connectivity of computers, initially evidenced by the World Wide Web, but spreading also with technologies such as personal-area networks, will also have a profound effect on the user interface to computers. Another important force will be recognition-based user interfaces, especially speech, and camera-based vision systems. Other changes we see are an increasing need for 3D and end-user customization, programming, and scripting. All of these changes will require significant support from the underlying user interface sofware tools.",

    "abstract": "This article presents an interactive technique for moving through an immersive virtual environment (or “virtual reality”). The technique is suitable for applications where locomotion is restricted to ground level. The technique is derived from the idea that presence in virtual environments may be enhanced the stronger the match between proprioceptive information from human body movements and sensory feedback from the computer-generated displays. The technique is an attempt to simulate body movements associated with walking. The participant “walks in place” to move through the virtual environment across distances greater than the physical limitations imposed by the electromagnetic tracking devices. A neural network is used to analyze the stream of coordinates from the head-mounted display, to determine whether or not the participant is walking on the spot. Whenever it determines the walking behavior, the participant is moved through virtual space in the direction of his or her gaze. We discuss two experimental studies to assess the impact on presence of this method in comparison to the usual hand-pointing method of navigation in virtual reality. The studies suggest that subjective rating of presence is enhanced by the walking method provided that participants associate subjectively with the virtual body provided in the environment. An application of the technique to climbing steps and ladders is also presented.",

To shed light on this new social phenomenon, we present a grounded theory of motivation informed by the first cross-platform qualitative study of the crowdfunding community. By performing 83 semistructured interviews, we uncover creator motivations, which include the desire to raise funds, expand awareness of work, connect with others, gain approval, maintain control, and learn; and supporter motivations, which include the desire to collect rewards, help others, support causes, and be part of a community. We also explore deterrents to crowdfunding participation, including, among creators, fear of failure, and, for supporters, lack of trust. Based on these findings, we provide three emergent design principles to inform the design of effective crowdfunding platforms and support tools.",

    "abstract": "The role of prototypes is well established in the field of HCI and Design. A lack of knowledge, however, about the fundamental nature of prototypes still exists. Researchers have attempted to identify different types of prototypes, such as low- vs. high-fidelity prototypes, but these attempts have centered on evaluation rather than support of design exploration. There have also been efforts to provide new ways of thinking about the activity of using prototypes, such as experience prototyping and paper prototyping, but these efforts do not provide a discourse for understanding fundamental characteristics of prototypes. In this article, we propose an anatomy of prototypes as a framework for prototype conceptualization. We view prototypes not only in their role in evaluation but also in their generative role in enabling designers to reflect on their design activities in exploring a design space. We base this framework on the findings of two case studies that reveal two key dimensions: prototypes as filters and prototypes as manifestations. We explain why these two dimensions are important and how this conceptual framework can benefit our field by establishing more solid and systematic knowledge about prototypes and prototyping.",

We have been able to significantly reduce the implementation complexity of groupware through the key features that comprise GroupKit. A runtime infrastructure automatically manages the creation, interconnection, and communications of the distributed processes that comprise conference sessions. A set of groupware programming abstractions allows developers to control the behavior of distributed processes, to take action on state changes, and to share relevant data. Groupware widgets let interface features of value to conference participants to be easily added to groupware applications. Session managers —interfaces that let people create and manage their meetings—are decoupled from groupware applications and are built by developers to accommodate the group's working style. Example GroupKit applications in a variety of domains have been implemented with only modest effort.",

Bringing different and often controversial points of view together to create a shared understanding among these stakeholders can lead to new insights, new ideas, and new artifacts. New media that allow owners of problems to contribute to framing and resolving complex design problems can extend the power of the individual human mind. Based on our past work and study of other approaches, systems, and collaborative and participatory processes, this article identifies challenges we see as the limiting factors for future collaborative human-computer systems. The Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory (EDC) is introduced as an integrated physical, and computational environment addressing some of these challenges. The vision behind the EDC shifts future development away from the computer as the focal point, toward an emphasis that tries to improve our understanding of the human, social, and cultural system that creates the context for use. This work is based on new conceptual principles that include creating shared understanding among various stakeholders, contextualizing information to the task at hand, and creating objects to think with in collaborative design activities. Although the EDC framework is applicable to different domains; our initial effort has focused on the domain of urban planning (specifically transportation planning) and community development.",

Critical approaches to technology design are of both practical and social importance in the home. Home appliances are loaded with cultural associations such as the gendered division of domestic labor that are easy to overlook. Further, homes are not the same everywhere---even within a country. Peoples' aspirations and desires differ greatly across and between cultures. The target of western domestic technology design is often not the user, but the consumer. Web refrigerators that create shopping lists, garbage cans that let advertisers know what is thrown away, cabinets that monitor their contents and order more when supplies are low are central to current images of the wireless, digital home of the future. Drawing from our research in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Asia, we provide three different narratives of defamiliarization. A historical reading of American kitchens provides a lens with which to scrutinize new technologies of domesticity, an ethnographic account of an extended social unit in England problematizes taken-for-granted domestic technologies, and a comparative ethnography of the role of information and communication technologies in the daily lives of urban Asia's middle classes reveals the ways in which new technologies can be captured and domesticated in unexpected ways. In the final section of the article, we build on these moments of defamiliarization to suggest a broad set of challenges and strategies for design in the home.",

Although there have been several recent studies focused on the development of multimodal virtual environments (VEs) to study human-machine interactions, less attention has been paid to human-human and human-machine interactions in shared virtual environments (SVEs), and to our knowledge, no attention paid at all to what extent the addition of haptic communication between people would contribute to the shared experience. We have developed a multimodal shared virtual environment and performed a set of experiments with human subjects to study the role of haptic feedback in collaborative tasks and whether haptic communication through force feedback can facilitate a sense of being and collaborating with a remote partner. The study concerns a scenario where two participants at remote sites must cooperate to perform a joint task in an SVE. The goals of the study are (1) to assess the impact of force feedback on task performance, (2) to better understand the role of haptic communication in human-human interactions, (3) to study the impact of touch on the subjective sense of collaborating with a human as reported by the participants based on what they could see and feel, and (4) to investigate if gender, personality, or emotional experiences of users can affect haptic communication in SVEs. The outcomes of this research can have a powerful impact on the development of next-generation human-computer interfaces and network protocols that integrate touch and force feedback technology into the internet, development of protocols and techniques for collaborative teleoperation such as hazardous material removal, space station.",

A scenario about an architect illustrates the process of creative work within such an environment.",

Action Research (AR) is a class of methods and approaches for conducting democratic and collaborative research with community partners. AR has evolved over the last several decades and offers HCI researchers theoretical lenses, methodological approaches, and pragmatic guidance for conducting socially relevant, collaborative, and engaged research. In this article, I describe the historical context and origins of AR, the scientifically rigorous practice of conducting and evaluating AR projects, and the ways in which AR might meaningfully be applied to HCI research.",

I support this claim with four ideas about cognition: (1) interacting with tools changes the way we think and perceive -- tools, when manipulated, are soon absorbed into the body schema, and this absorption leads to fundamental changes in the way we perceive and conceive of our environments; (2) we think with our bodies not just with our brains; (3) we know more by doing than by seeing -- there are times when physically performing an activity is better than watching someone else perform the activity, even though our motor resonance system fires strongly during other person observation; (4) there are times when we literally think with things. These four ideas have major implications for interaction design, especially the design of tangible, physical, context aware, and telepresence systems.",

In this article we provide a critical analysis of 30 years of ageing research published across the ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI) community. Discourse analysis of the content of 644 archival papers highlights how ageing is typically framed as a “problem” that can be managed by technology. We highlight how ageing is typically defined through an emphasis on the economic and societal impact of health and care needs of older people, concerns around socialisation as people age, and declines in abilities and associated reductions in performance when using technology. We draw from research within the fields of social and critical gerontology to highlight how these discourses in SIGCHI literature represent common stereotypes around old age that have also prevailed in the wider literature in gerontology. We conclude by proposing strategies for future research at the intersection of ageing and HCI.",

I look to post-humanism and relational ontologies to sketch what I call Entanglement HCI in response. I review selected theories—Actor-Network Theory, Post-Phenomenology, Object-Oriented Ontology, Agential Realism—and their existing influences on HCI literature. Against this background, I develop Entanglement HCI from the following four perspectives: (a) the performative relationship between humans and technology; (b) the re-framing of knowledge generation processes around phenomena; (c) the tracing of accountabilities, responsibilities and ethical encounters; and (d) the practices of design and mattering that move beyond user-centred design.",

    "abstract": "We describe a prototype virtual reality teleconferencing system called MASSIVE which has been developed as part of our on-going research into collaborative virtual environments. This system allows multiple users to communicate using arbitrary combinations of audio, graphics, and text media over local and wide area networks. Communication is controlled by a so-called spatial model of interaction so that one user's perception of another user is sensitive to their relative positions and orientations. The key concept in this spatial model is the (quantitative) awareness which one object has of another. This is controlled by the observing object's focus and the observed object's nimbus , which describe regions of interest and projection, respectively. Each object's aura defines the total region within which it interacts. This is applied independently in each medium. The system (and the spatial model which it implements) is intended to provide a flexible and natural environment for the spatial mediation of conversation. The model also provides a basis for scaling to relatively large numbers of users. Our design goals include supporting heterogeneity, scalability, spatial mediation, balance of power, and multiple concurrent meetings; MASSIVE meets all of these goals. Our initial experiences show the importance of audio in collaborative VR, and they raise issues about field of view for graphical users, speed of navigation, quality of embodiment, varying perceptions of space, and scalability.",

We present an ethnographic study of the game as it toured through two different cities and draws upon video recordings of online players, runners, technical support crew, and also on system logs of text communication. Our study reveals the diverse ways in which online players experienced the uncertainties inherent in GPS and WiFi, including being mostly unaware of them, but sometimes seeing them as problems, or treating the as a designed feature of the game, and even occasionally exploiting them within gameplay. In contrast, the runners and technical crew were fully aware of these uncertainties and continually battled against them through an ongoing and distributed process of orchestration. As a result, we encourage designers to deal with such uncertainties as a fundamental characteristic of location-based experiences rather than treating them as exceptions or bugs that might be ironed out in the future. We argue that designers should explicitly consider four potential states of being of a mobile participant: connected and tracked, connected but not tracked, tracked but not connected, and neither connected nor tracked. We then introduce five strategies that might be used to deal with uncertainty in these different states for different kinds of participant: remove it, hide it, manage it, reveal it, and exploit it. Finally, we present proposals for new orchestration interfaces that reveal the ‘seams’ in the underlying technical infrastructure by visualizing the recent performance of GPS and WiFi and predicting the likely future performance of GPS.",

Students also rated peers’ work from their own country 3.6% higher than those from elsewhere. We performed three experiments to improve grading accuracy. We found that giving students feedback about their grading bias increased subsequent accuracy. We introduce short, customizable feedback snippets that cover common issues with assignments, providing students more qualitative peer feedback. Finally, we introduce a data-driven approach that highlights high-variance items for improvement. We find that rubrics that use a parallel sentence structure, unambiguous wording, and well-specified dimensions have lower variance.

    "abstract": "A person seeking another person's attention is normally able to quickly assess how interruptible the other person currently is. Such assessments allow behavior that we consider natural, socially appropriate, or simply polite. This is in sharp contrast to current computer and communication systems, which are largely unaware of the social situations surrounding their usage and the impact that their actions have on these situations. If systems could model human interruptibility, they could use this information to negotiate interruptions at appropriate times, thus improving human computer interaction.This article presents a series of studies that quantitatively demonstrate that simple sensors can support the construction of models that estimate human interruptibility as well as people do. These models can be constructed without using complex sensors, such as vision-based techniques, and therefore their use in everyday office environments is both practical and affordable. Although currently based on a demographically limited sample, our results indicate a substantial opportunity for future research to validate these results over larger groups of office workers. Our results also motivate the development of systems that use these models to negotiate interruptions at socially appropriate times.",

Second, it began to identify specific visual attributes that appear to contribute to different judgments. Three experiments are reported. All used the stimuli and viewing time as before. Using a paradigm known to disrupt processing beyond the stimulus offset, Experiment 1 was designed to ensure that the previous findings could not be attributed to such continued processing. Adopting a within-subject design, Experiment 2 investigated the extent to which judgments differing in cognitive demands (visual appeal, perceived usability, trustworthiness) may be driven by the visual characteristics of a Web page. It also enabled analyses of visual attributes that contributed most to the different judgments. Experiment 3 replicated Experiment 2 but using a between-subject design to ensure that no practice effect could occur. The results suggest that all three types of judgments are largely driven by visual appeal, but that cognitively demanding judgments are processed in a qualitatively different manner than visual appeal, and that they rely on somewhat different visual attributes. A model accounting for the results is provided.",

    "abstract": "High prevalence of mental illness and the need for effective mental health care, combined with recent advances in AI, has led to an increase in explorations of how the field of machine learning (ML) can assist in the detection, diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems. ML techniques can potentially offer new routes for learning patterns of human behavior; identifying mental health symptoms and risk factors; developing predictions about disease progression; and personalizing and optimizing therapies. Despite the potential opportunities for using ML within mental health, this is an emerging research area, and the development of effective ML-enabled applications that are implementable in practice is bound up with an array of complex, interwoven challenges. Aiming to guide future research and identify new directions for advancing development in this important domain, this article presents an introduction to, and a systematic review of, current ML work regarding psycho-socially based mental health conditions from the computing and HCI literature. A quantitative synthesis and qualitative narrative review of 54 papers that were included in the analysis surfaced common trends, gaps, and challenges in this space. Discussing our findings, we (i) reflect on the current state-of-the-art of ML work for mental health, (ii) provide concrete suggestions for a stronger integration of human-centered and multi-disciplinary approaches in research and development, and (iii) invite more consideration of the potentially far-reaching personal, social, and ethical implications that ML models and interventions can have, if they are to find widespread, successful adoption in real-world mental health contexts.",

Cognitive theorists have speculated that these moments occur at subtask boundaries.

In a controlled experiment, users performed several interactive tasks while their pupil dilation, a reliable measure of workload, was continuously measured using an eye tracking system. The workload data was extracted from the pupil data, precisely aligned to the corresponding task models, and analyzed. Our principal findings include (i) workload changes throughout the execution of goal-directed tasks; (ii) workload exhibits transient decreases at subtask boundaries relative to the preceding subtasks; (iii) the amount of decrease tends to be greater at boundaries corresponding to the completion of larger chunks of the task; and (iv) different types of subtasks induce different amounts of workload.

We investigated how body-based information about the translational and rotational components of movement helped participants to perform a navigational search task (finding targets hidden inside boxes in a room-sized space). When participants physically walked around the VE while viewing it on a head-mounted display (HMD), they then performed 90% of trials perfectly, comparable to participants who had performed an equivalent task in the real world during a previous study. By contrast, participants performed less than 50% of trials perfectly if they used a tethered HMD (move by physically turning but pressing a button to translate) or a desktop display (no body-based information). This is the most complex navigational task in which a real-world level of performance has been achieved in a VE. Behavioral data indicates that both translational and rotational body-based information are required to accurately update one's position during navigation, and participants who walked tended to avoid obstacles, even though collision detection was not implemented and feedback not provided. A walking interface would bring immediate benefits to a number of VE applications.",

In this article, we take two steps to evaluate and improve the usability of mobile interfaces for such users. First, we offer an ethnographic study of the usability barriers facing 90 low-literacy subjects in India, Kenya, the Philippines, and South Africa. Then, via two studies involving over 70 subjects in India, we quantitatively compare the usability of different points in the mobile design space. In addition to text interfaces such as electronic forms, SMS, and USSD, we consider three text-free interfaces: a spoken dialog system, a graphical interface, and a live operator. Our results confirm that textual interfaces are unusable by first-time low-literacy users, and error prone for literate but novice users. In the context of healthcare, we find that a live operator is up to ten times more accurate than text-based interfaces, and can also be cost effective in countries such as India. In the context of mobile banking, we find that task completion is highest with a graphical interface, but those who understand the spoken dialog system can use it more quickly due to their comfort and familiarity with speech. We synthesize our findings into a set of design recommendations.",

Two accounts are particularly vocal about these mechanisms, namely the technology acceptance model (TAM) and work on user experience (UX) models. In this study we review 37 papers in the overlap between TAM and UX models to explore the experiential component of human-computer interactions. The models provide rich insights about what constructs influence the experiential component of human-computer interactions and about how these constructs are related. For example, the effect of perceived enjoyment on attitude is stronger than those of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. It is less clear why the relations exist and under which conditions the models apply. We discuss four of the main theories used in reasoning about the experiential component and, for example, point to the near absence of psychological needs and negative emotions in the models. In addition, most of the reviewed studies are not tied to specific use episodes, thereby bypassing tasks as an explanatory variable and undermining the accurate measurement of experiences, which are susceptible to moment-to-moment changes. We end by summarizing the implications of our review for future research.",

    "abstract": "A wealth of evidence suggests that love, closeness, and intimacy---in short relatedness---are important for people’s psychological well-being. Nowadays, however, couples are often forced to live apart. Accordingly, there has been a growing and flourishing interest in designing technologies that mediate (and create) a feeling of relatedness when being separated, beyond the explicit verbal communication and simple emoticons available technologies offer. This article provides a review of 143 published artifacts (i.e., design concepts, technologies). Based on this, we present six strategies used by designers/researchers to create a relatedness experience: Awareness, expressivity, physicalness, gift giving, joint action, and memories. We understand those strategies as starting points for the experience-oriented design of technology.",

On Twitter, one mechanism people use to avoid harassment is the blocklist , a list of accounts that are preemptively blocked from interacting with a subscriber. In this article, we present a rich description of Twitter blocklists – why they are needed, how they work, and their strengths and weaknesses in practice. Next, we use blocklists to interrogate online harassment – the forms it takes, as well as tactics used by harassers. Specifically, we interviewed both people who use blocklists to protect themselves, and people who are blocked by blocklists. We find that users are not adequately protected from harassment, and at the same time, many people feel that they are blocked unnecessarily and unfairly. Moreover, we find that not all users agree on what constitutes harassment. Based on our findings, we propose design interventions for social network sites with the aim of protecting people from harassment, while preserving freedom of speech.",

Instead, we propose to design culturally adaptive systems, which automatically generate personalized interfaces that correspond to cultural preferences. In an evaluation of one such system, we demonstrate that a majority of international participants preferred their personalized versions over a nonadapted interface of the same Website. Results show that users were 22% faster using the culturally adapted interface, needed fewer clicks, and made fewer errors, in line with subjective results demonstrating that they found the adapted version significantly easier to use. Our findings show that interfaces that adapt to cultural preferences can immensely increase the user experience.",

To systematically describe the motivations of these learners, we developed the Online Learning Enrollment Intentions (OLEI) scale, a 13-item questionnaire derived from open-ended responses to capture learners' authentic perspectives. Although motivations varied across courses, we found that each motivation predicted key behavioral outcomes for learners (N = 71, 475 across 14 courses). From learners' motivational and behavioral patterns, we infer a variety of needs that they seek to gratify by engaging with the courses, such as meeting new people and learning English. To meet these needs, we propose multiple design directions, including virtual social spaces outside any particular course, improved support for local groups of learners, and modularization to promote accessibility and organization of course content. Motivations thus provide a lens for understanding online learners and designing online courses to better support their needs.",

However, many of these studies have largely privileged a medical perspective and thus overlooked how patients and carers integrate self-care into their daily lives and mediate their conditions through technology. In this review, we focus on how patients and carers use and experience self-care technology through a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) lens. We analyse studies of self-care published in key HCI journals and conferences using the Grounded Theory Literature Review (GTLR) method and identify research trends and design tensions. We then draw out opportunities for advancing HCI research in self-care, namely, focusing further on patients’ everyday life experience, considering existing collaborations in self-care, and increasing the influence on medical research and practice around self-care technology.",

We provide a critical review of the purposes of these technologies and how they discursively conceptualise the agency of autistic children. Through our analysis, we establish six categories of these purposes: behaviour analysis, assistive technologies, education, social skills, therapy and well-being. Further, our discussion of these purposes shows how the technologies embody normative expectations of a neurotypical society, which predominantly views autism as a medical deficit in need of ‘correction’. Autistic children—purportedly the beneficiaries of these technologies—thus become a secondary audience to the largely externally defined purposes. We identify a lack of design for technologies that are geared towards the interests, needs and desires of autistic children. To move HCI’s research into autism beyond this, we provide guidance on how to consider agency in use and explicitly allow for appropriation beyond externally driven goals.",

Given the environmental impact of food waste, there is potential to make a significant difference. To understand everyday domestic practices around food and waste, we took a “practice” lens and carried out a study in 14 households that involved interviews, in-home tours and, in five of the households, a FridgeCam technology probe. The analysis highlights that food waste is the unintended result of multiple moments of consumption dispersed in space and time across other integrated practices such as shopping and cooking, which are themselves embedded in broader contextual factors and values. We highlight the importance of respecting the complex negotiations that people make within given structural conditions and competing values and practices, and suggest design strategies to support dispersed as well as integrated food practices, rather than focusing on waste itself.",

Hence, these voice assistants offer new opportunities to different populations, including individuals who are not interested or able to use traditional computing devices such as computers and smartphones. To understand how older adults who use technology infrequently perceive and use these voice assistants, we conducted a 3-week field deployment of the Amazon Echo Dot in the homes of seven older adults. While some types of usage dropped over the 3-week period (e.g., playing music), we observed consistent usage for finding online information. Given that much of this information was health-related, this finding emphasizes the need to revisit concerns about credibility of information with this new interaction medium. Although features to support memory (e.g., setting timers, reminders) were initially perceived as useful, the actual usage was unexpectedly low due to reliability concerns. We discuss how these findings apply to other user groups along with design implications and recommendations for future work on voice-user interfaces.",

It is innovative for the inclusion of the perspective of the mover, together with the traditional perspectives of the observer and the machine.

We critically review the main theories and models used in the research to analyse their application to designing effective habitual behaviour change interventions. We highlight the potential for Dual Process Theory, modern habit theory, and Goal Setting Theory, which together model how users form and break habits, to drive effective digital interventions.

IoT devices, so-called smart objects , are becoming even more pervasive and social, leading to the need to provide non-technical users with innovative interaction strategies for controlling their behavior. In other words, the opportunities offered by IoT can be amplified if new approaches are conceived to enable non-technical users to be directly involved in “composing” their smart objects by synchronizing their behavior. To fulfill this goal, this article introduces a model that includes new operators for defining rules combining multiple events and conditions exposed by smart objects, and for defining temporal and spatial constraints on rule activation. The article also presents the results of an elicitation study that was conducted to identify possible visual paradigms for expressing composition rules. Prototypes implementing the resulting visual paradigms were compared during a controlled experiment and the one that resulted most relevant for our goals was used in a study that involved home-automation experts. Finally, the article discusses some design implications that came out from the performed studies and presents the architecture of a platform supporting rule definition and execution.",

We illustrate what types of support sought and provided in posts and comments co-occur. We find that posts seeking support receive more comments, and comments from “throwaway” (i.e., anonymous) accounts are more likely on posts also from throwaway accounts. Anonymous commenting enables commenters to share intimate content such as reciprocal disclosures and supportive messages, and commenter anonymity is not associated with aggressive or unsupportive comments. We argue that anonymity is an essential factor in designing social technologies that facilitate support seeking and provision in socially stigmatized contexts, and provide implications for social media site design.

Through a reflexive thematic analysis, we identified four tensions—exploitation, membership, disclosure, and allyship. We explore the complexity involved in each, demonstrating that an equitable endpoint may not be possible, but this work is still worth pursuing when researchers make certain considerations. We emphasize that researchers who work with marginalized people should account for each tension in their research approaches to move forward.

In a creative collaboration, interaction dynamics, such as turn-taking, contribution type, and communication, are the driving forces of the co-creative process. Therefore the interaction model is a critical and essential component for effective co-creative systems. There is relatively little research about interaction design in the co-creativity field, which is reflected in a lack of focus on interaction design in many existing co-creative systems. The primary focus of co-creativity research has been on the abilities of the AI. This article focuses on the importance of interaction design in co-creative systems with the development of the Co-Creative Framework for Interaction design (COFI) that describes the broad scope of possibilities for interaction design in co-creative systems. Researchers can use COFI for modeling interaction in co-creative systems by exploring alternatives in this design space of interaction. COFI can also be beneficial while investigating and interpreting the interaction design of existing co-creative systems. We coded a dataset of existing 92 co-creative systems using COFI and analyzed the data to show how COFI provides a basis to categorize the interaction models of existing co-creative systems. We identify opportunities to shift the focus of interaction models in co-creativity to enable more communication between the user and AI leading to human-AI partnerships.",

This is likely to have profound effects in the classroom, where novices learning to code can now use free tools to automatically suggest solutions to programming exercises and assignments. However, little is currently known about how novices interact with these tools in practice. We present the first study that observes students at the introductory level using one such code auto-generating tool, Github Copilot, on a typical introductory programming (CS1) assignment. Through observations and interviews we explore student perceptions of the benefits and pitfalls of this technology for learning, present new observed interaction patterns, and discuss cognitive and metacognitive difficulties faced by students. We consider design implications of these findings, specifically in terms of how tools like Copilot can better support and scaffold the novice programming experience.",

In light of this debate, platforms have begun experimenting with softer alternatives to outright bans. We examine one such intervention called quarantining, that impedes direct access to and promotion of controversial communities. Specifically, we present two case studies of what happened when Reddit quarantined the influential communities r/TheRedPill (TRP) and r/The_Donald (TD). Using over 85M Reddit posts, we apply causal inference methods to examine the quarantine’s effects on TRP and TD. We find that the quarantine made it more difficult to recruit new members: new user influx to TRP and TD decreased by 79.5% and 58%, respectively. Despite quarantining, existing users’ misogyny and racism levels remained unaffected. We conclude by reflecting on the effectiveness of this design friction in limiting the influence of toxic communities and discuss broader implications for content moderation.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in AI and machine learning (ML) promise significant transformations in the future delivery of healthcare. Despite a surge in research and development, few works have moved beyond demonstrations of technical feasibility and algorithmic performance. However, to realize many of the ambitious visions for how AI can contribute to clinical impact requires the closer design and study of AI tools or interventions within specific health and care contexts. This article outlines our collaborative, human-centered approach to developing an AI application that predicts treatment outcomes for patients who are receiving human-supported, internet-delivered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) for symptoms of depression and anxiety. Intersecting the fields of HCI, AI, and healthcare, we describe how we addressed the specific challenges of (1) identifying clinically relevant AI applications ; and (2) designing AI applications for sensitive use contexts like mental health. Aiming to better assist the work practices of iCBT supporters, we share how learnings from an interview study with 15 iCBT supporters surfaced their practices and information needs and revealed new opportunities for the use of AI. Combined with insights from the clinical literature and technical feasibility constraints, this led to the development of two clinical outcome prediction models. To clarify their potential utility for use in practice, we conducted 13 design sessions with iCBT supporters that utilized interface mock-ups to concretize the AI output and derive additional design requirements. Our findings demonstrate how design choices can impact interpretations of the AI predictions as well as supporter motivation and sense of agency. We detail how this analysis and the design principles derived from it enabled the integration of the prediction models into a production interface. Reporting on identified risks of over-reliance on AI outputs and needs for balanced information assessment and preservation of a focus on individualized care, we discuss and reflect on what constitutes a responsible, human-centered approach to AI design in this healthcare context.",

While powerful in prediction accuracy, Deep Learning models are black boxes by nature, preventing users from making informed judgments about the correctness and fairness of such an automated system. Explanations have been proposed as a general remedy to the black box problem. However, it remains unclear if effects of explanations on user trust generalise over varying accuracy levels. In an online user study with 959 participants, we examined the practical consequences of adding explanations for user trust: We evaluated trust for three explanation types on three classifiers of varying accuracy. We find that the influence of our explanations on trust differs depending on the classifier’s accuracy. Thus, the interplay between trust and explanations is more complex than previously reported. Our findings also reveal discrepancies between self-reported and behavioural trust, showing that the choice of trust measure impacts the results.",

The central studies of the extent, content, and impact of such frustration were done more than 15 years ago. We revisit this issue after computers have become more mature and computer use is more extensive. To this end, we had 234 crowdsourced participants log the frustrating episodes they experienced with their computers during one hour of computer use. The average time lost due to frustrating episodes was between 11% and 20% of the one-hour period. Though this is less time lost than in the earlier studies, frustration remains a common user experience. While shorter, the median level of frustration during the episodes was high (7 on a 9-point scale). The frustration level correlated with task importance and time lost but was unaffected by computer experience and largely unaffected by computer self-efficacy. In addition, participants indicated that 84% of the episodes had happened before, that 87% could happen again, and that they were unable to resolve 26% of the episodes. This high rate of recurrence and lack of control likely added to the frustration level. The episodes spanned various issues pertaining to performance (49%), usability (36%), and utility (16%).",

    "abstract": "Human-AI collaboration for decision-making strives to achieve team performance that exceeds the performance of humans or AI alone. However, many factors can impact success of Human-AI teams, including a user’s domain expertise, mental models of an AI system, trust in recommendations, and more. This article reports on a study that examines users’ interactions with three simulated algorithmic models, all with equivalent accuracy rates but each tuned differently in terms of true positive and true negative rates. Our study examined user performance in a non-trivial blood vessel labeling task where participants indicated whether a given blood vessel was flowing or stalled. Users completed 140 trials across multiple stages, first without an AI and then with recommendations from an AI-Assistant. Although all users had prior experience with the task, their levels of proficiency varied widely. Our results demonstrated that while recommendations from an AI-Assistant can aid in users’ decision making, several underlying factors, including user base expertise and complementary human-AI tuning, significantly impact the overall team performance. First, users’ base performance matters, particularly in comparison to the performance level of the AI. Novice users improved, but not to the accuracy level of the AI. Highly proficient users were generally able to discern when they should follow the AI recommendation and typically maintained or improved their performance. Mid-performers, who had a similar level of accuracy to the AI, were most variable in terms of whether the AI recommendations helped or hurt their performance. Second, tuning an AI algorithm to complement users’ strengths and weaknesses also significantly impacted users’ performance. For example, users in our study were better at detecting flowing blood vessels, so when the AI was tuned to reduce false negatives (at the expense of increasing false positives), users were able to reject those recommendations more easily and improve in accuracy. Finally, users’ perception of the AI’s performance relative to their own performance had an impact on whether users’ accuracy improved when given recommendations from the AI. Overall, this work reveals important insights on the complex interplay of factors influencing Human-AI collaboration and provides recommendations on how to design and tune AI algorithms to complement users in decision-making tasks.",

Following the PRISMA guidelines, the review points to diverse experimental practices for inducing and measuring body ownership. The two major components of embodiment measurement, body ownership and agency, are examined. The embodiment of virtual avatars generally leads to modest body ownership and slightly higher agency. We also find that BOI research lacks statistical power and standardization across tasks, measurement instruments, and analysis approaches. Furthermore, the reviewed studies showed a lack of clarity in fundamental terminology, constructs, and theoretical underpinnings. These issues restrict scientific advances on the major components of BOIs, and together impede scientific rigor and theory-building.",

It recommends an equitable reduction in resource use through sensible distributive practices where fulfillment is based on values including solidarity, cooperation, care, social justice, and localized development.

We suggest that selecting an appropriate input device for an interactive task requires looking beyond the physical structure of devices to the deeper perceptual structure of the task, the device, and the interrelationship between the perceptual structure of the task and the control properties of the device. We affirm that perception is key to understanding performance of multidimensional input devices on multidimensional tasks. We have therefore extended the theory of processing of percetual structure to graphical interactive tasks and to the control structure of input devices. This allows us to predict task and device combinations that lead to better performance and hypothesize that performance is improved when the perceptual structure of the task matches the control structure of the device. We conducted an experiment in which subjects performed two tasks with different perceptual structures, using two input devices with correspondingly different control structures, a three-dimensional tracker and a mouse. We analyzed both speed and accuracy, as well as the trajectories generated by subjects as they used the unconstrained three-dimensional tracker to perform each task. The result support our hypothesis and confirm the importance of matching the perceptual structure of the task and the control structure of the input device.",

The program enables for two individuals placed in different locations to simultaneously feel and manipulate dynamic objects in a shared desktop virtual environment. Results show that haptic force feedback significantly improves task performance, perceived task performance, and pereceived virtual presence in the collaborative distributed environment.

Yet many attempts to automate the existing system have failed because controllers remain attached to a key work artifact: the paper flight strip. This article describes a four-month intensive study of a team of Paris en-route controllers in order to understand their use of paper flight strips. The article also describes a comparison study of eight different control rooms in France and the Netherlands. Our observations have convinced us that we do not know enough to simply get rid of paper strips, nor can we easily replace the physical interaction between controllers and paper strips.These observationshighlight the benefits of strips, including qualities difficult to quantify and replicate in new computer systems. Current thinking offers two basic alternatives: maintaining the existing strips without computer support and bearing the financial cost of limiting the air traffic, or replacing the strips with automated versions, which offer potential benefits in terms of increased efficiency through automation, but unknown risks through radical change of work practices. We conclude with a suggestion for a third alternative: to maintain the physical strips, but turn them into the interface to the computer. This would allow controllers to build directly upon their existing, safe work practices with paper strips, while offering them a gradual path for incorporating new computer-based functions. Augmented paper flight strips allow us to take advantage of uniquely human skills in the physical world, and allows us to leave the user interface and its subsequent evolution in the hands of the people most responsible, the air traffic controllers themselves.",

    "abstract": "Researchers in Computer Supported Cooperative Work have recently developed discount evaluation methods for shared-workspace groupware. Most discount methods rely on some understanding of the context in which the groupware systems will be used, which means that evaluators need to model the tasks that groups will perform. However, existing task analysis schemes are not well suited to the needs of groupware evaluation: they either do not deal with collaboration issues, do not use an appropriate level of analysis for concrete assessment of usability in interfaces, or do not adequately represent the variability inherent in group work. To fill this gap, we have developed a new modeling technique called Collaboration Usability Analysis. CUA focuses on the teamwork that goes on in a group task rather than the taskwork. To enable closer links between the task representation and the groupware interface, CUA grounds each collaborative action in a set of group work primitives called the mechanics of collaboration . To represent the range of ways that a group task can be carried out, CUA allows variable paths through the execution of a task, and allows alternate paths and optional tasks to be modeled. CUA's main contribution is to provide evaluators with a framework in which they can simulate the realistic use of a groupware system and identify usability problems that are caused by the groupware interface.",

    "abstract": "Mobile workers need seamless access to communication and information services while on the move. However, current solutions overwhelm users with intrusive interfaces and ambiguous notifications. This article discusses the interaction techniques developed for Nomadic Radio, a wearable computing platform for managing voice and text-based messages in a nomadic environment. Nomadic Radio employs an auditory user interface, which synchronizes speech recognition, speech synthesis, nonspeech audio, and spatial presentation of digital audio, for navigating among messages as well as asynchonous notific ation of nely arrived messages. Emphasis is placed on an auditory modality as Nomadic Radio is designed to be used while performing other tasks in a user's everyday environment; a range of auditory cues provides peripheral awareness of incoming messages. Notification is adaptive and cntext sensitive; messages are presented as more or less obtrsive based on importance inferred from content filtering, whether the user is engaged in conversation and his or her own recent responses to prior messages. Auditory notifications are dynamically scaled from ambient sound through recorded voice cues up to message summaries. Iterative design and a preliminary user evaluation suggest that audio is an appropriate medium for mobile messaging, but that care must be taken to minimally intrude on the wearer's social and physical environment.",

    "abstract": "When some items in a menu are selected more frequently than others, as is often the case, designers or individual users may be able to speed performance and improve preference ratings by placing several high-frequency items at the top of the menu. Design guidelines for split menus were developed and applied. Split menus were implemented and tested in two in situ usability studies and a controlled experiment. In the usability studies performance times were reduced by 17 to 58% depending on the site and menus. In the controlled experiment split menus were significantly faster than alphabetic menus and yielded significantly higher subjective preferences. A possible resolution to the continuing debate among cognitive theorists about predicting menu selection times is offered. We conjecture and offer evidence that, at least when selecting items from pull-down menus, a logarithmic model applies to familiar (high-frequency) items, and a linear model to unfamiliar (low-frequency) items.",

To exploit these modalities in HCI, we need to understand the interplay between them and the way in which they support communication. We propose a framework for the gesture research done to date, and present our work on the cross-modal cues for discourse segmentation in free-form gesticulation accompanying speech in natural conversation as a new paradigm for such multimodal interaction. The basis for this integration is the psycholinguistic concept of the coequal generation of gesture and speech from the same semantic intent. We present a detailed case study of a gesture and speech elicitation experiment in which a subject describes her living space to an interlocutor. We perform two independent sets of analyses on the video and audio data: video and audio analysis to extract segmentation cues, and expert transcription of the speech and gesture data by microanalyzing the videotape using a frame-accurate videoplayer to correlate the speech with the gestural entities. We compare the results of both analyses to identify the cues accessible in the gestural and audio data that correlate well with the expert psycholinguistic analysis. We show that \"handedness\" and the kind of symmetry in two-handed gestures provide effective supersegmental discourse cues.",

    "abstract": "Public transportation systems are among the most ubiquitous and complex large-scale systems found in modern society. For those unable to drive such as people with cognitive disabilities, these systems are essential gateways for participation in community activities, socialization, and independence. To understand the magnitude and scope of this national problem, we highlight deficiencies identified in an international study by the Transportation Research Board of the National Research Council and present specific cognitive barriers identified in empirical studies of transportation systems in several U.S. cities.An interdisciplinary team of HCI researchers, urban transportation planners, commercial technologists, and assistive care specialists are now collaborating on the Mobility-for-All project to create architectures and prototypes that support those with cognitive disabilities and their caregivers. We have grounded our research and design efforts using a distributed cognition framework. We have derived requirements for our designs by analyzing “how things are” for individuals with cognitive disabilities who learn and use public transportation systems. We present a socio-technical architecture that has three components: a) a personal travel assistant that uses real-time Global Positioning Systems data from the bus fleet to deliver just-in-time prompts; b) a mobile prompting client and a prompting script configuration tool for caregivers; and c) a monitoring system that collects real-time task status from the mobile client and alerts the support community of potential problems. We then describe a phased community-centered assessment approach that begins at the design stage and continues to be integrated throughout the project.This research has broad implications for designing more human-centered transportation systems that are universally accessible for other disenfranchised communities such as the elderly or nonnative speaker. This project presents an “in-the-world” research opportunity that challenges our understanding about mobile human computer interactions with ubiquitous, context-aware computing architectures in noisy, uncontrolled environments; personalization and user modeling techniques; and the design of universally accessible interfaces for complex systems through participatory design processes.This article provides both a near-term vision and an architecture for transportation systems that are socially inclusive, technologically appealing, and easier for everyone to use.",

The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) addresses this problem by providing a standard machine-readable format for website privacy policies. P3P user agents can fetch P3P privacy policies automatically, compare them with a user's privacy preferences, and alert and advise the user. Developing user interfaces for P3P user agents is challenging for several reasons: privacy policies are complex, user privacy preferences are often complex and nuanced, users tend to have little experience articulating their privacy preferences, users are generally unfamiliar with much of the terminology used by privacy experts, users often do not understand the privacy-related consequences of their behavior, and users have differing expectations about the type and extent of privacy policy information they would like to see. We developed a P3P user agent called Privacy Bird. Our design was informed by privacy surveys and our previous experience with prototype P3P user agents. We describe our design approach, compare it with the approach used in other P3P use agents, evaluate our design, and make recommendations to designers of other privacy agents.",

While \"use\" refers to a general description of a thing in terms of what it is used for, \"presence\" refers to existential definitions of a thing based on how we invite and accept it as a part of our lifeworld . Searching for a basis on which these existential definitions are formed, we argue that the expressions of things are central for accepting them as present in our lives. We introduce the notion of an expressional , referring to a thing designed to be the bearer of certain expressions, just as an appliance is designed to be the bearer of a certain functionality. Aesthetics, as a logic of expressions, can provide a proper foundation for design for presence. We discuss the expressiveness of computational things as depending both on time structures and space structures. An aesthetical leitmotif for the design of computational things---a leitmotif that may be used to guide a normative design philosophy, or a design style---is described. Finally, we describe a practical example of what designing a mobile phone as an \"expressional\" might be like.",

The framework describes judgment on quality attributes (usability, content/functionality, aesthetics, customisation and engagement) with dependencies on decision making arising from the user's background, task and context. The framework is tested and refined by three experimental studies. The first two assessed judgment of quality attributes of websites with similar content but radically different designs for aesthetics and engagement. Halo effects were demonstrated whereby attribution of good quality on one attribute positively influenced judgment on another, even in the face of objective evidence to the contrary (e.g., usability errors). Users' judgment was also shown to be susceptible to framing effects of the task and their background. These appear to change the importance order of the quality attributes; hence, quality assessment of a design appears to be very context dependent. The third study assessed the influence of customisation by experiments on mobile services applications, and demonstrated that evaluation of customisation depends on the users' needs and motivation. The results are discussed in the context of the literature on aesthetic judgment, user experience and trade-offs between usability and hedonic/ludic design qualities.",

We compare zoomable user interfaces with and without an overview to understand the navigation patterns and usability of these interfaces. Thirty-two subjects solved navigation and browsing tasks on two maps. We found no difference between interfaces in subjects' ability to solve tasks correctly. Eighty percent of the subjects preferred the interface with an overview, stating that it supported navigation and helped keep track of their position on the map. However, subjects were faster with the interface without an overview when using one of the two maps. We conjecture that this difference was due to the organization of that map in multiple levels, which rendered the overview unnecessary by providing richer navigation cues through semantic zooming. The combination of that map and the interface without an overview also improved subjects' recall of objects on the map. Subjects who switched between the overview and the detail windows used more time, suggesting that integration of overview and detail windows adds complexity and requires additional mental and motor effort.",

A restricted linear undo mechanism can conveniently be implemented using object-oriented techniques. Although linear undo provides an arbitrarily long history, it is not possible to undo isolated commands from the history without undoing all following commands. Various undo models have been proposed to overcome this limitation, but they all ignore the problem that in graphical user interfaces a previous user action might not have a sensible interpretation in another state. Selective undo introduced here can undo isolated commands by copying them into the current state “ if that is meaningful.” Furthermore, the semantics of selective undo are argued to be more natural for the user, because the mechanism only looks at the command to undo and the current state and does not depend on the history in between. The user interface for selective undo can also be implemented generically. Such a generic implementation is able to provide a consistent recovery mechanism in arbitrary applications.",

We use this framework to critically reflect on research into the aesthetics of interaction and to suggest sensibilities for designing aesthetic interaction. Finally, a digital jewelery case study is described to demonstrate a design approach that is open to the perspectives presented in the framework and to consider how the framework and sensibilities are reflected in engagement with participants and approach to design.",

    "abstract": "We identify and present a major interaction approach for tangible user interfaces based upon systems of tokens and constraints. In these interfaces, tokens are discrete physical objects which represent digital information. Constraints are confining regions that are mapped to digital operations. These are frequently embodied as structures that mechanically channel how tokens can be manipulated, often limiting their movement to a single degree of freedom. Placing and manipulating tokens within systems of constraints can be used to invoke and control a variety of computational interpretations.We discuss the properties of the token+constraint approach; consider strengths that distinguish them from other interface approaches; and illustrate the concept with eleven past and recent supporting systems. We present some of the conceptual background supporting these interfaces, and consider them in terms of Bellotti et al.'s [2002] five questions for sensing-based interaction. We believe this discussion supports token+constraint systems as a powerful and promising approach for sensing-based interaction.",

    "abstract": "Many information structures are represented as two-dimensional networks (connected graphs) of links and nodes. Because these network tend to be large and quite complex, people often perfer to view part or all of the network at varying levels of detail. Hierarchical clustering provides a framework for viewing the network at different levels of detail by superimposing a hierarchy on it. Nodes are grouped into clusters, and clusters are themselves place into other clusters. Users can then navigate these clusters until an appropiate level of detail is reached. This article describes an experiment comparing two methods for viewing hierarchically clustered networks. Traditional full-zoom techniques provide details of only the current level of the hierarchy. In contrast, fisheye views, generated by the “variable-zoom” algorithm described in this article, provide information about higher levels as well. Subjects using both viewing methods were given problem-solving tasks requiring them to navigate a network, in this case, a simulated telephone system, and to reroute links in it. Results suggest that the greater context provided by fisheye views significantly improved user performance. Users were quicker to complete their task and made fewer unnecessary navigational steps through the hierarchy. This validation of fisheye views in important for designers of interfaces to complicated monitoring systems, such as control rooms for supervisory control and data acquistion systems, where efficient human performance is often critical. However, control room operators remained concerned about the size and visibility tradeoffs between the fine room operators remained concerned about the size and visibility tradeoffs between the fine detail provided by full-zoom techniques and the global context supplied by fisheye views. Specific interface feaures are required to reconcile the differences.",

We tested three specific hypotheses in the course of an office move. The greater availability of public digital data along with changes in people's jobs or interests should lead to wholescale discarding of paper data, while preparing for the move. Instead we found workers kept large, highly valued papar archives. We also expected that the major part of people's personal archives would be unique documents. However, only 49% of people's archives were unique documents, the remainder being copies of publicly available data and unread information, and we explore reasons for this. We examined the effects of paper-processing strategies on archive structure. We discovered different paper-processing strategies ( filing and piling )that were relatively independent of job type. We predicated that filers' attempted to evaluate and catergorize incoming documents would produce smaller archives that were accessed frequently. Contrary to our predictions, filers amassed more information, and accessed it less frequently than pilers. We argue that filers may engage in premature filing : to clear their workspace, they archives information that later turns out to be of low value. Given the effort involved in organzing data, they are also loath to discard filed information, even when its value is uncertain. We discuss the implications of this research for digital personal information management.",

This debate could be advanced by large-scale randomized studies addressing the critical issue of whether remotely operated or simulation-based labs are as effective as the traditional hands-on lab format. The present article describes the results of a large-scale (N = 306) study comparing learning outcomes and student preferences for several different lab formats in an undergraduate engineering course. The lab formats that were evaluated included traditional hands-on labs, remotely operated labs, and simulations. Learning outcomes were assessed by a test of the specific concepts taught in each lab. These knowledge scores were as high or higher (depending on topic) after performing remote and simulated laboratories versus performing hands-on laboratories. In their responses to survey items, many students saw advantages to technology-enabled lab formats in terms of such attributes as convenience and reliability, but still expressed preference for hands-on labs. Also, differences in lab formats led to changes in group functions across the plan-experiment-analyze process: For example, students did less face-to-face work when engaged in remote or simulated laboratories, as opposed to hands-on laboratories.",

In exploratory learning, instead of working through precisely sequenced training materials, the user investigates a system on his or her own initiative, often in pursuit of a real or artificial task. The value of exploratory learning has been studied in controlled settings, with special attention newly acquired systems, be there has been little investigation of its occurrence in natural situations or in support of ongoing learning. To address this question, a field study of the behavior and attitudes of computer users in everyday working situations was performed, using diaries and structured interviews that focused on learning events. The study showed that task-oriented exploration was a widely accepted method for learning, but that it often required support from manuals and from other users or system support personnel. Exploration not related to a current or pending task was infrequent, and most users believed it to be inefficient.

It is found that lag in the head-tracking system is relatively unimportant in predicting performance, whereas lag in the hand-tracking system is critical. The effect of hand lag can be modeled by means of a variation on Fitts' Law with the measured system lag introduced as a multiplicative variable to the Fitts' Law index of difficulty. This means that relatively small lags can cause considerable degradation in performance if the targets are small. Another finding is that errors are higher for movement in and out of the screen, as compared to movements in the plane of the screen, and there is a small (10%) time penalty for movement in the Z direction in all three experiments. Low frame rates cause a degradation in performance; however, this can be attributed to the lag which is caused by low frame rates, particularly if double buffering is used combined with early sampling of the hand-tracking device.",

Extent refers to the size of an environment, whereas scale refers to whether people have to travel through an environment to see the detail necessary for navigation. Each participant was provided with full body-based information (walking through the virtual marketplaces in a large tracking hall or on an omnidirectional treadmill), just the translational component of body-based information (walking on a linear treadmill, but turning with a joystick), just the rotational component (physically turning but using a joystick to translate) or no body-based information (joysticks to translate and rotate). In large and small environments translational body-based information significantly improved the accuracy of participants' cognitive maps, measured using estimates of direction and relative straight line distance but, on its own, rotational body-based information had no effect. In environments of small extent, full body-based information also improved participants' navigational performance. The experiments show that locomotion devices such as linear treadmills would bring substantial benefits to virtual environment applications where large spaces are navigated, and theories of human navigation need to reconsider the contribution made by body-based information, and distinguish between environmental scale and extent.",

Preattentive processing refers to an initial organization of the visual field based on cognitive operations believed to be rapid, automatic, and spatially parallel. Examples of visual features that can be detected in this way include hue, intensity, orientation, size, and motion. We beleive that studies from preattentive vision should be used to assist in the design of visualization tools, especially those for which high-speed target detection, boundary identification, and region detection are important. In our present study, we investigated two known preattentive features (hue and orientation) in the context of a new task (numerical estimation) in order to see whether preattentive estimation was possible. Our experiments tested displays that were designed to visualize data from salmon migration simulations. The results showed that rapid and accurate estimation was indeed possible using either hue or orientation. Furthermore, random variation in one of these features resulted in no interference when subjects estimated the percentage of the other. To test the generality of our results, we varied two important display parameters—display duration and feature difference—and found boundary conditions for each. Implications of our results for application to real-world data and tasks are discussed.",

Often implemented as ubiquitous systems or within a small portion of the traditional desktop, notification systems typically deliver information of interest in a parallel, multitasking approach, extraneous or supplemental to a user's attention priority. Such systems represent a difficult challenge to evaluate meaningfully. We introduce a design model of user goals based on blends of three critical parameters---interruption, reaction, and comprehension. Categorization possibilities form a logical, descriptive design space for notification systems, rooted in human information processing theory. This model allows conceptualization of distinct action models for at least eight classes of notification systems, which we describe and analyze with a human information processing model. System classification regions immediately suggest useful empirical and analytical evaluation metrics from related literature. We present a case study that demonstrates how these techniques can assist an evaluator in adapting traditional UEMs for notification and other multitasking systems. We explain why using the design model categorization scheme enabled us to generate evaluation results that are more relevant for the system redesign than the results of the original exploration done by the system's designers.",

Participants from two older age groups were recruited: twenty people in a younger-old group (ages 60-70) and twenty people in an older-old group (ages 71-85). Ten younger adults (ages 18-39) served as a comparison group. All participants had at least some Internet search experience. The experimental task consisted of six realistic search problems, all involving information related to health and well-being and which varied in degree of complexity. The results indicated that though necessary, Internet-related knowledge was not sufficient in explaining information-seeking performance, and suggested that a combination of both knowledge and key cognitive abilities is important for successful information seeking. In addition, the cognitive abilities that were found to be critical for task performance depended on the search problem's complexity. Also, significant differences in task performance between the younger and the two older age groups were found on complex, but not on simple problems. Overall, the results from this study have implications for instructing older adults on Internet information seeking and for the design of Web sites.",

    "abstract": "Recent improvements in text entry error rate measurement have enabled the running of text entry experiments in which subjects are free to correct errors (or not) as they transcribe a presented string. In these “unconstrained” experiments, it is no longer necessary to force subjects to unnaturally maintain synchronicity with presented text for the sake of performing overall error rate calculations. However, the calculation of character-level error rates, which can be trivial in artificially constrained evaluations, is far more complicated in unconstrained text entry evaluations because it is difficult to infer a subject's intention at every character. For this reason, prior character-level error analyses for unconstrained experiments have only compared presented and transcribed strings, not input streams. But input streams are rich sources of character-level error information, since they contain all of the text entered (and erased) by a subject. The current work presents an algorithm for the automated analysis of character-level errors in input streams for unconstrained text entry evaluations. It also presents new character-level metrics that can aid method designers in refining text entry methods. To exercise these metrics, we perform two analyses on data from an actual text entry experiment. One analysis, available from the prior work, uses only presented and transcribed strings. The other analysis uses input streams, as described in the current work. The results confirm that input stream error analysis yields richer information for the same empirical data. To facilitate the use of these new analyses, we offer pseudocode and downloadable software for performing unconstrained text entry experiments and analyzing data.",

By itself, this system is a “point design,” an example of an advanced user interface technique.

In particular, we argue that the common-sense viewpoint that “two hands save time by working in parallel” may not always be an effective way to think about two-handed interface design because the hands do not necessarily work in parallel (there is a structure to two-handed manipulation) and because two hands do more than just save time over one hand (two hands provide the user with more information and can structure how the user thinks about a task). To support these claims, we present an interface design developed in collaboration with neurosurgeons which has undergone extensive informal usability testing, as well as a pair of formal experimental studies which investigate behavioral aspects of two-handed virtual object manipulation. Our hope is that this discussion will help others to apply the lessons in our neurosurgery application to future two-handed user interface designs.",

Queueing networks are particularly suited for modeling parallel activities and complex structures. Symbolic models have particular strength in generating a person's actions in specific task situations. By integrating the two approaches, QN-MHP offers an architecture for mathematical modeling and real-time generation of concurrent activities in a truly concurrent manner. QN-MHP expands the three discrete serial stages of MHP, of perceptual, cognitive, and motor processing, into three continuous-transmission subnetworks of servers, each performing distinct psychological functions specified with a GOMS-style language. Multitask performance emerges as the behavior of multiple streams of information flowing through a network, with no need to devise complex, task-specific procedures to either interleave production rules into a serial program (ACT-R), or for an executive process to interactively control task processes (EPIC). Using QN-MHP, a driver performance model was created and interfaced with a driving simulator to perform a vehicle steering, and a map reading task concurrently and in real time. The performance data of the model are similar to human subjects performing the same tasks.",

In doing this we wish to highlight the polysemous nature of things and to argue that archiving practice in the home is not solely concerned with the invocation of memory. In support of this we show how sentimental artifacts are also used to connect with others, to define the self and the family, to fulfill obligations and, quite conversely to efforts of remembering, to safely forget. Such values are fundamental to family life where archiving takes place and consequently we explore how home archiving is achieved as a familial practice in the negotiated spaces of the home.

These constraints help people interact more smoothly. We draw from social developmental psychology to characterize the design of multi-user interfaces in terms of how constraints on these mechanisms can be best used to promote collaboration.

    "abstract": "Large wall-sized displays are becoming prevalent. Although researchers have articulated qualitative benefits of group work on large displays, little work has been done to quantify the benefits for individual users. In this article we present four experiments comparing the performance of users working on a large projected wall display to that of users working on a standard desktop monitor. In these experiments, we held the visual angle constant by adjusting the viewing distance to each of the displays. Results from the first two experiments suggest that physically large displays, even when viewed at identical visual angles as smaller ones, help users perform better on mental rotation tasks. We show through the experiments how these results may be attributed, at least in part, to large displays immersing users within the problem space and biasing them into using more efficient cognitive strategies. In the latter two experiments, we extend these results, showing the presence of these effects with more complex tasks, such as 3D navigation and mental map formation and memory. Results further show that the effects of physical display size are independent of other factors that may induce immersion, such as interactivity and mental aids within the virtual environments. We conclude with a general discussion of the findings and possibilities for future work.",

Therefore, individual differences are key factors for the development of WBI programs. Among various dimensions of individual differences, the study presented in this article focuses on cognitive styles. More specifically, this study investigates how cognitive styles affect students' learning patterns in a WBI program with an integrated approach, utilizing both traditional statistical and data-mining techniques. The former are applied to determine whether cognitive styles significantly affected students' learning patterns. The latter use clustering and classification methods. In terms of clustering, the K-means algorithm has been employed to produce groups of students that share similar learning patterns, and subsequently the corresponding cognitive style for each group is identified. As far as classification is concerned, the students' learning patterns are analyzed using a decision tree with which eight rules are produced for the automatic identification of students' cognitive styles based on their learning patterns. The results from these techniques appear to be consistent and the overall findings suggest that cognitive styles have important effects on students' learning patterns within WBI. The findings are applied to develop a model that can support the development of WBI programs.",

Leveraging single-user applications for supporting multi-user collaboration has the potential to significantly increase the availability and improve the usability of collaborative applications. In this article, we report an innovative Transparent Adaptation (TA) approach and associated supporting techniques that can be used to convert existing and new single-user applications into collaborative ones, without changing the source code of the original application. The cornerstone of the TA approach is the operational transformation (OT) technique and the method of adapting the single-user application programming interface to the data and operation models of OT. This approach and supporting techniques were developed and tested in the process of transparently converting two commercial off-the-shelf single-user applications (Microsoft Word and PowerPoint) into real-time collaborative applications, called CoWord and CoPowerPoint, respectively. CoWord and CoPowerPoint not only retain the functionalities and “look-and-feel” of their single-user counterparts, but also provide advanced multi-user collaboration capabilities for supporting multiple interaction paradigms, ranging from concurrent and free interaction to sequential and synchronized interaction, and for supporting detailed workspace awareness, including multi-user telepointers and radar views. The TA approach and generic collaboration engine software component developed from this work are potentially applicable and reusable in adapting a wide range of single-user applications.",

We report research into using target expansion for facilitating selection. Widgets that expand or grow in response to the user's focus of attention allow for a reduced initial size which can help optimize screen space use and may be easier to select than targets that do not expand. However, selection performance could plausibly suffer from a decreased initial widget size. We describe an experiment in which users select a single, isolated target button that expands just before it is selected. Our results show that users benefit from target expansion even if the target only begins expanding after 90% of the distance to the target has been travelled. Furthermore, our results suggest that, for sufficiently large ID values, users are able to take approximately full advantage of the expanded target size. For interfaces with multiple expanding widgets, however, subtle problems arise due to the collisions or overlap that may occur between adjacent expanding widgets. We give a detailed examination of the issues involved in both untiled and tiled multiple expanding targets and present various design strategies for improving their performance.",

Users' evaluations are generally measured through questionnaires. We suggest that other evaluation methods, including economic measures, may provide different estimates of the relative value of features. In a laboratory experiment we created four versions of a data-entry application by independently manipulating the system's usability and aesthetics. Users' evaluations of the four experimental systems were obtained in a within-subjects design. In addition, five between-subjects experimental conditions were created, based on the evaluation method (questionnaire alone or auction and questionnaire), monetary incentives (present or absent), and experience in using the system (present or absent). In questionnaire-based responses, the systems' usability affected evaluations of usability as well as aesthetics. Similarly, the systems' aesthetics affected evaluations of both aesthetics and usability. Questionnaire-based evaluations of usability and aesthetics were not affected by experience with the system or by monetary performance incentives. Auction bids were only influenced by the system's usability: bids corresponded to the objective performance levels that could be attained with the different systems. The results suggest that by using economic methods, researchers and practitioners can obtain system evaluations that are strongly related to performance criteria and that may be more valid when the evaluation context favors task-oriented performance.",

In this article, finger-stroke features during gameplay on an iPod were extracted and their discriminative power analyzed. Machine learning algorithms were used to build systems for automatically discriminating between four emotional states (Excited, Relaxed, Frustrated, Bored), two levels of arousal and two levels of valence. Accuracy reached between 69% and 77% for the four emotional states, and higher results (~89%) were obtained for discriminating between two levels of arousal and two levels of valence.

    "abstract": "Our life is characterized by the presence of a multitude of interactive devices and smart objects exploited for disparate goals in different contexts of use. Thus, it is impossible for application developers to predict at design time the devices and objects users will exploit, how they will be arranged, and in which situations and for which objectives they will be used. For such reasons, it is important to make end users able to easily and autonomously personalize the behaviour of their Internet of Things applications, so that they can better comply with their specific expectations. In this paper, we present a method and a set of tools that allow end users without programming experience to customize the context-dependent behaviour of their Web applications through the specification of trigger-action rules. The environment is able to support end-user specification of more flexible behaviour than what can be done with existing commercial tools, and it also includes an underlying infrastructure able to detect the possible contextual changes in order to achieve the desired behaviour. The resulting set of tools is able to support the dynamic creation and execution of personalized application versions more suitable for users’ needs in specific contexts of use. Thus, it represents a contribution to obtaining low threshold/high ceiling environments. We also report on an example application in the home automation domain, and a user study that has provided useful positive feedback.",

    "abstract": "Collaborative virtual environments (CVEs) enable two or more people, separated in the real world, to share the same virtual “space.” They can be used for many purposes, from teleconferencing to training people to perform assembly tasks. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of CVEs is compromised by one major problem: the delay that exists in the networks linking users together. Whilst we have a good understanding, especially in the visual modality, of how users are affected by delayed feedback from their own actions, little research has systematically examined how users are affected by delayed feedback from other people, particularly in environments that support haptic (force) feedback. The current study addresses this issue by quantifying how increasing levels of latency affect visual and haptic feedback in a collaborative target acquisition task. Our results demonstrate that haptic feedback in particular is very sensitive to low levels of delay. Whilst latency affects visual feedback from 50 ms, it impacts on haptic task performance 25 ms earlier, and causes the haptic measures of performance deterioration to rise far more steeply than visual. The “impact-perceive-adapt” model of user performance, which considers the interaction between performance measures, perception of latency, and the breakdown of perception of immediate causality, is proposed as an explanation for the observed pattern of performance.",

    "abstract": "The design of real-life complex systems calls for advanced software engineering models, methods, and tools in order to meet critical requirements such as reliability, dependability, safety, or resilience that will avoid putting the company, the mission, or even human life at stake. When such systems encompass a substantial interactive component, the same level of confidence is required towards the human-computer interface. Conventional empirical or semiformal techniques, although very fruitful, do not provide sufficient insight on the reliability of the human-system cooperation, and offer no easy way to, for example, quantitatively and qualitatively compare two design options with respect to that reliability. The aim of this article is to present a user interface description language (called ICOs) for the engineering and development of usable and reliable user interfaces. The CASE tool supporting the ICOs notation (called Petshop) is a Petri nets-based-tool for the design, specification, prototyping, and validation of interactive software. In that environment models (built with the formal description technique ICOs) of the interactive application can be interactively modified and executed. This is used to support prototyping phases (when the models and the interactive application evolve significantly to meet late user requirements, for instance) as well as the operation phase (after the system is deployed). The use of ICOs and PetShop is presented on several large-scale systems such as a multimodal ground segment application for satellite control, an air traffic control interactive application, and an application for new generation of interactive cockpits in large civil aircraft such as Airbus A380 or Boeing 787. The article emphasizes the demonstration of the expressive power of the notation and how it can support the description of various aspects of user interfaces, namely interaction techniques (both WIMP and post-WIMP), interactive components (such as widgets), and the behavioral part of interactive applications such as the dialog and the functional core. It also demonstrates that PetShop provides dedicated support for prototyping activities of behavioral aspects at the various levels of the architecture of interactive systems. While the focus is on past work done on various large-scale applications, the article also highlights why and how ICOs and Petshop are able to address challenges raised by next-generation user interfaces.",

However, persuasive strategies that motivate one player may demotivate another. In this article, we show the importance of tailoring games for change in the context of a game designed to improve healthy eating habits. We tailored a custom-designed game by adapting only the persuasive strategies employed; the game mechanics themselves did not vary. Tailoring the game design to players’ personality type improved the effectiveness of the games in promoting positive attitudes, intention to change behavior, and self-efficacy. Furthermore, we show that the benefits of tailoring the game intervention are not explained by the improved player experience, but directly by the choice of persuasive strategy employed.

By engaging with the system, she continuously acts out these three roles and her awareness of them is crucial in her experience. We argue that this 3-in-1 is always already shaping the user's understanding and perception of her interaction as it is staged through her experience of the object's form and expression. Through examples ranging from everyday technologies utilizing performances of interaction to spatial contemporary artworks, digital as well as analogue, we address the notion of the performative spectator and the spectating performer. We demonstrate how perception is also performative and how focus on this aspect seems to be crucial when designing experience-oriented products, systems and services.",

We find that people's explicit judgments for the same queries differ greatly. As a result, there is a large gap between how well search engines could perform if they were to tailor results to the individual, and how well they currently perform by returning results designed to satisfy everyone. We call this gap the potential for personalization . The two implicit indicators we studied provide complementary value for approximating this variation in result relevance among people. We discuss several uses of our findings, including a personalized search system that takes advantage of the implicit measures by ranking personally relevant results more highly and improving click-through rates.",

We motivate the approach and then describe how it consists of three distinct activities -- practice, studies and theory -- that are interleaved in complex ways through nine different relationships. We present a historical account of how the approach has evolved over a fifteen-year period, charting the evolution of a complex web of projects, papers, and relationships between them. We articulate the challenges of pursuing each activity as well as overarching challenges of balancing artistic and research interests, flexible management of relationships, and finally ethics.",

We report on a month-long case study with a group of about 25 young forced migrants (YFMs), where we applied and adapted strategies from PD and participatory research (PR). We gained insights into the benefits and drawbacks of combining PD and PR concepts in this particular scenario. The PD+PR approach supported intercultural collaborations between YFMs and young members of the host community. It also enabled communication across language barriers by using visual and “didactic reduction” resources. On a theoretical level, the experiences we gained allowed us to reflect on the role of “safe spaces” for participation and the need for further discussing it in PD. Our results can benefit researchers who take part in technology-related participatory processes with YFMs.",

This research determined the effect of Internet user age and email content such as weapons of influence (persuasive techniques that attackers can use to lure individuals to fall for an attack) and life domains (a specific topic or aspect of an individual's life that attackers can focus an emails on) on spear-phishing (targeted phishing) susceptibility. One-hundred young and 58 older users received, without their knowledge, daily simulated phishing emails over 21 days. A browser plugin recorded their clicking on links in the emails as an indicator of their susceptibility. Forty-three percent of users fell for the simulated phishing emails, with older women showing the highest susceptibility. While susceptibility in young users declined across the study, susceptibility in older users remained stable. The relative effectiveness of the attacks differed by weapons of influence and life domains with age-group variability. In addition, older compared to young users reported lower susceptibility awareness. These findings support effects of Internet user demographics and email content on susceptibility to phishing and emphasize the need for personalization of the next generation of security solutions.",

To investigate the effectiveness and limitations of such a chatbot in conducting surveys, we conducted a field study involving about 600 participants. In this study with mostly open-ended questions, half of the participants took a typical online survey on Qualtrics and the other half interacted with an AI-powered chatbot to complete a conversational survey. Our detailed analysis of over 5200 free-text responses revealed that the chatbot drove a significantly higher level of participant engagement and elicited significantly better quality responses measured by Gricean Maxims in terms of their informativeness, relevance, specificity, and clarity. Based on our results, we discuss design implications for creating AI-powered chatbots to conduct effective surveys and beyond.",

We argue that in working remotely, closely coupled work tasks encourage remote workers to spend the extra effort required in articulation of work to make the collaboration function. Also we find that people in distributed software development have already made collaborative technologies part of their work, and individuals are comfortable with them; thus, collaboration technology readiness takes a different shape in this setting.",

    "abstract": "Buildings and urban spaces increasingly incorporate artificial intelligence and new forms of interactivity, raising a wide span of research questions about the future of human experiences with, and within, built environments. We call this emerging area Human- Building Interaction (HBI) and introduce it as an interdisciplinary domain of research interfacing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with Architecture and Urban Design. HBI seeks to examine the involvement of HCI in studying and steering the evolution of built environments. Therefore, we needs to ask foundational questions such as: what are the specific attributes of built environments that HCI researchers should take into account when shifting attention and scale from “artefacts” to “environments”? Are architecture and interaction design methods and processes compatible? Concretely, how can a team of interaction designers bring their tools to an architectural project, and collaborate with other stakeholders? Can and will architecture change the theory and practice of HCI? Furthermore, research in HBI should produce knowledge and practical guidelines by experimenting novel design instances that combine architecture and digital interaction. The primary aim of this paper is to specify the mission, vision, and scope of research in Human-Building Interaction. As the introductory paper to the TOCHI special issue, it also provides a summary of published manuscripts and describes their collective contribution to the development of this field.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we argue that an approach informed by practice theory coupled with design fiction provides useful insights into the role of interaction design with respect to environmental sustainability. We argue that a practice-oriented approach can help interaction designers step away from models of individual behavior and studies of artifacts towards seeing sustainable behaviors as part of multidimensional and interrelated practices and practice elements. We analyze two previously conducted studies. The first study of everyday repair focuses on how people repair their broken objects. The second study of green-DIY examines how green enthusiasts facilitate their practices of making sustainable DIY (do-it-yourself) projects. We describe the practices of everyday repairers and green enthusiasts in terms of materials, competences, and meanings, and the interrelations among those elements, using the framework of Shove et al. [2012]. We argue that understanding the dynamics of practice and their unique configurations is a starting point to redefine the roles of sustainable interaction design (SID). We propose that designers design towards resources and tools in ways that reflect on the challenges of intelligibility of their design interventions in practices. In addition to considering SID in the light of practice theories, we reveal how design fictions are readily incorporated into green practices in ways that transform those practices and hold implications for transformations of design as well. We bring forward opportunities for designers to co-design with DIY enthusiasts, targeted as practitioners in their own right, designing toward or within a design fiction. As a result, we conclude with the possibility for sustainable interaction designers to become practice-oriented designers who design with transparent open strategies and accessible materials and competences.",

We identify general eye, head and torso coordination patterns and provide an analysis of the relative movements’ contribution and temporal alignment. We quantify effects of target distance, direction and user posture, describe preferred eye-in-head motion ranges and identify a high variability in head movement tendency. Study insights lead us to propose gaze zones that reflect different levels of contribution from eye, head and body. We discuss design implications for HCI and VR, and in conclusion argue to treat gaze as multimodal input, and eye, head and body movement as synergetic in interaction design.",

I thus propose a cooperative engagement between feminist utopianism and PD at the levels of theory, methodology, and on-the-ground practice. I offer an analysis of a case—an urban renewal project in Taipei, Taiwan—as a means of exploring what such a cooperative engagement might entail.

Focusing on socially shared practices—e.g. cooking, laundering—has been identified as a promising direction. Building on a growing body of research in sustainable HCI that takes practices as unit of analysis, this article explores what it means to take practices as a unit of design. Drawing on theories of practice, it proposes that practice-oriented design approaches should: involve bodily performance, create crises of routine and generate a variety of performances. These guidelines were integrated into a Generative Improv Performances (GIP) approach, entailing a series of performances by improvisation actors with low-fidelity prototypes in a lab environment. The approach was implemented in an empirical study on bathing. Although the empirical example does not deal with common types of interactive technologies, the guidelines and GIP approach offer sustainable HCI a way to think beyond immediate interactions and to conceptualize change on a practice level.",

Drawing on experiments in two different online contexts, this study measures the prevalence of cheating and evaluates two different methods for deterring it. Our first experiment investigates cheating behavior in a pair of online exams spanning 632 students in India. Our second experiment examines dishonest behavior on Mechanical Turk through an online task with 2,378 total participants. Using direct measurements that are not dependent on self-reports, we detect significant rates of cheating in both environments. We confirm that honor codes--despite frequent use in massive open online courses (MOOCs)--lead to only a small and insignificant reduction in online cheating behaviors. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new intervention: a stern warning that spells out the potential consequences of cheating. We show that the warning leads to a significant (about twofold) reduction in cheating, consistent across experiments. We also characterize the demographic correlates of cheating on Mechanical Turk. Our findings advance the understanding of cheating in online environments, and suggest that replacing traditional honor codes with warnings could be a simple and effective way to deter cheating in online courses and online labor marketplaces.",

An anthropomorphic user interface is not immune to these judgments, specifically when exhibiting social interaction skills in public spaces. A favorable impression may help engaging users in interaction and attaining acceptance for long-term interactions. We present three studies implementing a model of first impressions for initiating user interactions with an anthropomorphic museum guide agent with socio-relational skills. We focus on nonverbal behavior exhibiting personality and interpersonal attitude. In two laboratory studies, we demonstrate that impressions of an agent's personality are quickly formed based on proximity, whereas interpersonal attitude is conveyed through smile and gaze. We also found that interpersonal attitude has greater impact than personality on the user's decision to spend time with the agent. These findings are then applied to a museum guide agent exhibited at the Boston Museum of Science. In this field study, we show that employing our model increases the number of visitors engaging in interaction.",

We present four adaptation cases revealing two interrelated types of adaptations—technical and organizational—as responses to the new system in use. First, individual clinicians respond to the immediate alteration in workflows caused by the EMR, while the organizational adaptations later mitigate the changes in healthcare quality control resulting from the clinicians’ initial adaptation. Our analysis reflects the critical nature and value of both adaptation types, with an emphasis on the triggers and process of organizational adaptation, for the successful implementation of a socio-technical-political system in a healthcare organization.",

While soft keyboards for text entry are well optimized, based on language and touch models, no such information exists to guide the design of emoji keyboards. In this article, we investigate of the problem of emoji entry, starting with a study of the current state of the emoji keyboard implementation in Android. To enable moving forward to novel emoji keyboard designs, we then explore a model for emoji similarity that is able to inform such designs. This semantic model is based on data from 21 million collected tweets containing emoji. We compare this model against a solely description-based model of emoji in a crowdsourced study. Our model shows good perfor mance in capturing detailed relationships between emoji.",

    "abstract": "Despite the geographically situated nature of most sharing economy tasks, little attention has been paid to the role that geography plays in the sharing economy. In this article, we help to address this gap in the literature by examining how four key principles from human geography—distance decay, structured variation in population density, mental maps, and “the Big Sort” (spatial homophily)—manifest in sharing economy platforms. We find that these principles interact with platform design decisions to create systemic biases in which the sharing economy is significantly more effective in dense, high socioeconomic status (SES) areas than in low-SES areas and the suburbs. We further show that these results are robust across two sharing economy platforms: UberX and TaskRabbit. In addition to highlighting systemic sharing economy biases, this article more fundamentally demonstrates the importance of considering well-known geographic principles when designing and studying sharing economy platforms.",

    "abstract": "Many Smart City projects are beginning to consider the role of citizens. However, current methods for engaging urban populations in participatory design (PD) activities are somewhat limited. In this article, we describe an approach taken to empower socially disadvantaged citizens, using a variety of both social and technological tools, in a Smart City project. Through analysing the nature of citizens’ concerns and proposed solutions, we explore the benefits of our approach, arguing that engaging citizens can uncover hyper-local concerns that provide a foundation for finding solutions to address citizen concerns. By reflecting on our approach, we identify four key challenges to utilising PD at an urban scale; balancing scale with the personal, who has control of the process, who is participating and integrating citizen-led work with local authorities. By addressing these challenges, we will be able to truly engage citizens as collaborators in co-designing their city.",

    "abstract": "This article examines the educational efficacy of a learning environment in which children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) engage in social interactions with an artificially intelligent (AI) virtual agent and where a human practitioner acts in support of the interactions. A multi-site intervention study in schools across the UK was conducted with 29 children with ASC and learning difficulties, aged 4--14 years old. For reasons related to data completeness and amount of exposure to the AI environment, data for 15 children was included in the analysis. The analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of social responses made by ASC children to human practitioners. The number of initiations made to human practitioners and to the virtual agent by the ASC children also increased numerically over the course of the sessions. However, due to large individual differences within the ASC group, this did not reach significance. Although no evidence of transfer to the real-world post-test was shown, anecdotal evidence of classroom transfer was reported. The work presented in this article offers an important contribution to the growing body of research in the context of AI technology design and use for autism intervention in real school contexts. Specifically, the work highlights key methodological challenges and opportunities in this area by leveraging interdisciplinary insights in a way that (i) bridges between educational interventions and intelligent technology design practices, (ii) considers the design of technology as well as the design of its use (context and procedures) on par with one another, and (iii) includes design contributions from different stakeholders, including children with and without ASC diagnosis, educational practitioners, and researchers.",

However, given the physical and ergonomic limitations of neck movement, users may need assistance to view these display spaces comfortably. Through two studies, we developed new ways of minimising the physical effort and discomfort of viewing such display spaces. We first explored how the mapping between gaze angle and display position could be manipulated, helping users view wider display spaces than currently possible within an acceptable and comfortable range of neck movement. We then compared our implicit control of display position based on head orientation against explicit user control, finding significant benefits in terms of user preference, workload and comfort for implicit control. Our novel techniques create new opportunities for productive work by leveraging MR headsets to create interactive wide virtual workspaces with improved comfort and usability. These workspaces are flexible and can be used on-the-go, e.g., to improve remote working or make better use of commuter journeys.",

We lack a common reference point to guide designers' choices when using smell. Here, we map out an olfactory design space to provide designers with such guidance. We identified four key design features: (i) chemical, (ii) emotional, (iii) spatial, and (iv) temporal. Each feature defines a building block for smell-based interaction design and is grounded in a review of the relevant scientific literature. We then demonstrate the design opportunities in three application cases. Each application (i.e., one desktop, two virtual reality implementations) highlights the design choices alongside the implementation and evaluation possibilities in using smell. We conclude by discussing how identifying those design features facilitates a healthy growth of this research domain and contributes to an intermediate-level knowledge space.

However, the potential to combine innovative HCI designs with the theoretical grounding and state-of-the-art interventions from psychology has yet to be fully realised. In this article, we synthesise HCI work on emotion regulation interventions and propose a three-part framework to guide technology designers in making: (i) theory-informed decisions about intervention targets; (ii) strategic decisions regarding the technology-enabled intervention mechanisms to be included in the system; and (iii) practical decisions around previous implementations of the selected intervention components. We show how this framework can both systematise HCI work to date and suggest a research agenda for future work.",

To help address DES, we investigate eye exercises resulting from survey answers and blue light filtering in three user studies (N = 71).

Such a novel and pressing topic has fostered, both in the academia and in the industry, the emergence of a variety of digital self-control tools allowing users to self-regulate their technology use through interventions like timers and lock-out mechanisms. While these emerging technologies for behavior change hold great promise to support people’s digital wellbeing, we still have a limited understanding of their real effectiveness, as well as of how to best design and evaluate them. Aiming to guide future research in this important domain, this article presents a systematic review and a meta-analysis of current work on tools for digital self-control. We surface motivations, strategies, design choices, and challenges that characterize the design, development, and evaluation of digital self-control tools. Furthermore, we estimate their overall effect size on reducing (unwanted) technology use through a meta-analysis. By discussing our findings, we provide insights on how to (i) overcome a limited perspective that exclusively focuses on technology overuse and self-monitoring tools, (ii) evaluate digital self-control tools through long-term studies and standardized measures, and (iii) bring ethics in the digital wellbeing discourse and deal with the business model of contemporary tech companies.",

Established concepts (e.g., 2D authentication schemes) are vulnerable to observation attacks, and most alternatives are relatively slow. We present RubikAuth, an authentication scheme for VR where users authenticate quickly and secure by selecting digits from a virtual 3D cube that leverages coordinated 3D manipulation and pointing. We report on results from three studies comparing how pointing using eye gaze, head pose, and controller tapping impact RubikAuth’s usability, memorability, and observation resistance under three realistic threat models. We found that entering a four-symbol RubikAuth password is fast: 1.69–3.5 s using controller tapping, 2.35–4.68 s using head pose and 2.39 –4.92 s using eye gaze, and highly resilient to observations: 96–99.55% of observation attacks were unsuccessful. RubikAuth also has a large theoretical password space: 45 n for an n -symbols password. Our work underlines the importance of considering novel but realistic threat models beyond standard one-time attacks to fully assess the observation-resistance of authentication schemes.

Our research thus first reviewed the nudge concept and differentiated it from other interventions before applying it to the cybersecurity area. We then carried out an empirical study to assess the effectiveness of three different nudge-related interventions on four types of cybersecurity-specific decisions. Our study demonstrated that the combination of a simple nudge and information provision, termed a “hybrid nudge,” was at least as, and in some decision contexts even more effective in encouraging secure choices as the simple nudge on its own. This indicates that the inclusion of information when deploying a nudge, thereby increasing the intervention’s transparency, does not necessarily diminish its effectiveness. A follow-up study explored the educational and long-term impact of our tested nudge interventions to encourage secure choices. The results indicate that the impact of the initial nudges, of all kinds, did not endure. We conclude by discussing our findings and their implications for research and practice.",

    "abstract": "With increased focus on historically excluded populations, there have been recent calls for HCI research methods to more adequately acknowledge and address the historical context of racism, sexism, gendered racism, epistemic violence, classism, and so on. In this article, we utilize Black feminist epistemologies to serve as critical frameworks for understanding the historical context that reveals the interconnected systems of power that mutually influence one another to create unequal outcomes or social inequalities for different populations. Leveraging Black feminist thought (BFT) and intersectionality as critical social theories of design praxis, we introduce intersectional analysis of power—a method that enables HCI researchers, designers, and practitioners to identify and situate saturated sites of violence in a historical context and to transform the ways in which they engage with populations that have been historically oppressed. Engaging in self-reflection as researchers, we apply an intersectional analysis of power to co-design technologies with community street outreach workers who address violence in their predominantly Black communities. We: (1) identify the saturated site of violence; (2) identify the intersecting systems of power and who holds power (past and present); (3) describe the “conceptual glue” that binds these intersecting systems together and the assumption(s) that those who hold power are employing to guide their interactions; (4) examine the ways in which Black people are subjugated, surveilled, and/or expected to assimilate to “normative” ways of being and behaving; and (5) identify acts of resistance. This article contributes an alternative to traditional HCI and design methods that falsely perpetuate a lens of neutrality and colorblindness that centers on whiteness, innovation, and capitalism and ignores the history of State-sanctioned violence and structural oppression.",

    "abstract": "Gestural interaction has evolved from a set of novel interaction techniques developed in research labs, to a dominant interaction modality used by millions of users everyday. Despite its widespread adoption, the design of appropriate gesture vocabularies remains a challenging task for developers and designers. Existing research has largely used Expert-Led, User-Led, or Computationally-Based methodologies to design gesture vocabularies. These methodologies leverage the expertise, experience, and capabilities of experts, users, and systems to fulfill different requirements. In practice, however, none of these methodologies provide designers with a complete, multi-faceted perspective of the many factors that influence the design of gesture vocabularies, largely because a singular set of factors has yet to be established. Additionally, these methodologies do not identify or emphasize the subset of factors that are crucial to consider when designing for a given use case. Therefore, this work reports on the findings from an exhaustive literature review that identified 13 factors crucial to gesture vocabulary design and examines the evaluation methods and interaction techniques commonly associated with each factor. The identified factors also enable a holistic examination of existing gesture design methodologies from a factor-oriented viewpoint and highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each methodology.

    "abstract": "Chatbots are often designed to mimic social roles attributed to humans. However, little is known about the impact of using language that fails to conform to the associated social role. Our research draws on sociolinguistic to investigate how a chatbot’s language choices can adhere to the expected social role the agent performs within a context. We seek to understand whether chatbots design should account for linguistic register. This research analyzes how register differences play a role in shaping the user’s perception of the human-chatbot interaction. We produced parallel corpora of conversations in the tourism domain with similar content and varying register characteristics and evaluated users’ preferences of chatbot’s linguistic choices in terms of appropriateness, credibility, and user experience. Our results show that register characteristics are strong predictors of user’s preferences, which points to the needs of designing chatbots with register-appropriate language to improve acceptance and users’ perceptions of chatbot interactions.",

We then revisit human augmentation as an alternative to user friendliness that seems particularly relevant in the areas of inclusive design and artificial intelligence. Viewing human-AI interaction as a kind of human augmentation raises issues such as how to promote trust and situation awareness. We also pose the question: Can HCI and human factors engineering work together to solve the increasingly urgent challenges of human-AI technology? In an initial look at this question, we contrast the different approaches of HCI and human factors on emerging AI research. This article concludes by considering other potentially promising paths for HCI. We propose more collaboration between HCI and human factors, or related disciplines, in the future to address the massive challenges posed by the rapid growth in data science and artificial intelligence.",

While many in HCI and design have examined the impulse to solve problems–the solutionist or techno-solutionist mindset–we examine the logic that binds the solution and the problem together as a pair. Focusing on the timely and consequential problem of systemic racial injustice, we think through the paradoxical possibility that the pairing of the problem and solution (so often treated as the default in design and HCI) perpetuates the very conditions we seek to improve. With Calvin Warren’s profound Afro-pessimism, we recognize how the tools used to solve structural inequities around Black life are constructed with inequities themselves. The problem-solution, therefore, is a dead end. We use this paradox as an invitation to rethink ongoing efforts to seek equity and justice more broadly, setting out a fragile but hopeful path for HCI and design.",

We discuss how facilitating cooperation and preventing abuse, two key elements in Grimmelmann's definition of moderation, are inherently dialectical in practice. We close by showing how researchers, designers, and moderators can use our framework of trade-offs in their own work, and arguing that trade-offs should be of central importance in investigating and designing content moderation.",

In this article, we conducted a two-stage exploratory study using a human-centered design methodology. We first conducted a qualitative interview study to identify key user needs in engaging with CSCs. We then performed an experimental study to investigate potential CSC conversational design solutions based on the results from the interview study. We identified that emotional support, explanations of medical information, and efficiency were important factors for users in their interactions with CSCs. We also demonstrated that emotional support and explanations could affect user perceptions and experiences, and they are context-dependent.

Compared to data visualization, there is no established vocabulary for analyzing and discussing the properties of physicalizations. Through a grounded analysis of examples and literature, we propose a comprehensive design vocabulary, which consist of three separate, but connected parts: explicit variables , implicit properties , and consequential aspects . Explicit variables build on visual variables known from visualization and extend it to account for physicalization’s multi-modal nature. Implicit properties concern elements which are central to the design intention and user experience of physicalizations, yet are not a result of “explicit” encoding strategies. Finally, consequential aspects refer to unintentional effects of design decisions, that influence how a physicalization is experienced. Our work illustrates how physicalizations incorporate opportunities and challenges that are not afforded in other data representations, such as embodiment and imagined touch . With this, we contribute to generating theory on physicalization. Our design vocabulary can support (1) creators through informing their design processes and highlighting design strategies, (2) educators, and (3) academics and practitioners to analyse existing physicalizations, and reflect on the impact of design decisions on interpretation and experience.",

Prior work has identified dark patterns in windows, icons, menus, and pointer (WIMP) interfaces and ubicomp environments, but how dark patterns can manifest in Augmented and Virtual Reality (collectively XR) requires more attention. We therefore conducted 10 co-design workshops with 20 experts in XR and deceptive design. Our participants co-designed 42 scenarios containing dark patterns, based on application archetypes presented in recent HCI/XR literature. In the co-designed scenarios, we identified 10 novel dark patterns in addition to 39 existing ones, as well as 10 examples in which specific characteristics associated with XR potentially amplified the effect dark patterns could have on users. Based on our findings and prior work, we present a classification of XR-specific properties that facilitate dark patterns: perception, spatiality, physical/virtual barriers, and XR device sensing. We also present the experts’ assessments of the likelihood and severity of the co-designed scenarios and highlight key aspects they considered for this evaluation, for example, technological feasibility, ease of upscaling and distributing malicious implementations, and the application’s context of use.

We find that film worker resistance to emergent and projected uses of AI echoes earlier technical developments, such as the incorporation of sound, color, HD, DVD, and CGI. These innovations initially sparked anxieties about the demise of cinema, but ultimately created new aesthetic possibilities and professions. We end with a reflection on core concerns for worker engagement, including topics of prophesy and the “soul” of sociotechnical labor.",

Our findings show that researchers mainly engage with the pragmatic qualities of the experience. We thus propose a unified model for HX for understanding the design of haptic experiences, combining key elements of UX and HX research to give haptic designers a tool for thinking about the rich and complex haptic experiences elicited by their designs.

Previous work hypothesized that switching modality could speed up interactive correction of recognition errors. This article presents multimodal error correction methods that allow the user to correct recognition errors efficiently without keyboard input. Correction accuracy is maximized by novel recognition algorithms that use context information for recognizing correction input. Multimodal error correction is evaluated in the context of a prototype multimodal dictation system. The study shows that unimodal repair is less accurate than multimodal error correction. On a dictation task, multimodal correction is faster than unimodal correction by respeaking. The study also provides empirical evidence that system-initiated error correction (based on confidence measures) may not expedite error correction. Furthermore, the study suggests that recognition accuracy determines user choice between modalities: while users initially prefer speech, they learn to avoid ineffective correction modalities with experience. To extrapolate results from this user study, the article introduces a performance model of (recognition-based) multimodal interaction that predicts input speed including time needed for error correction. Applied to interactive error correction, the model predicts the impact of improvements in recognition technology on correction speeds, and the influence of recognition accuracy and correction method on the productivity of dictation systems. This model is a first step toward formalizing multimodal interaction.",

We find that conventional collaboration transparency systems are inefficient in their use of network resources and lack support for key groupware principles: concurrent work, relaxed WYSIWIS, and group awareness. Next, we present an alternative approach to implementing collaboration transparency that provides many features previously seen only in collaboration-aware applicaitons. Our approach is based on a replicated architecture where selected single-user interface components are dynamically replaced by multiuser versions. The replacement occurs at run-time and is transparent to the single-user application and its developers.. As an instance of this approach, we describe its incorporation into a Java-based collaboration transparency system for serializable, Swing-based Java applications, called Flexible JAMM (Java Applets Made Multiuser). To validate that the flexible collaboration transparency system is truly an improvement over conventional systems, we conducted an empirical study of collaborators performing both tightly and loosely coupled tasks using Flexible JAMM versus a representative conventional collaboration transparency system, Microsoft NetMeeting. Completion times were significantly faster in the loosely coupled task using Flexible JAMM and were not adversely affected in the tightly coupled task. Accuracy was equivalent for both systems. Participants greatly preferred Flexible JAMM.",

Cognitive benefits arise as a result of reducing the load of mentally composing and visualizing the task at an unnaturally low level which is imposed by traditional unimanual techniques. Area sweeping was selected as our experimental task. It is representative of what one encounters, for example, when sweeping out the bounding box surrounding a set of objects in a graphics program. Such tasks cannot be modeled by Fitts' Law alone and have not been previously studied in the literature. In our experiments, two bimanual techniques were compared with the conventional one-handed GUI approach. Both bimanual techniques employed the two-handed “stretchy” technique first demonstrated by Krueger in 1983. We also incorporated the “Toolglass” technique introduced by Bier et al. in 1993. Overall, the bimanual techniques resulted in significantly faster performance than the status quo one-handed technique, and these benefits increased with the difficulty of mentally visualizing the task, supporting our bimanual cognitive advantage hypothesis. There was no significant difference between the two bimanual techniques. This study makes two types of contributions to the literature. First, practically we studied yet another class of transaction where significant benefits can be realized by applying bimanual techniques. Furthermore, we have done so using easily available commercial hardware in the context to our understanding of why bimanual interaction techniques have an advantage over unimanual techniques. A literature review on two-handed computer input and some of the relevant bimanual human mototr control studies is also included.",

An experimental “design” task was conducted, and video recordings of the participants' activities facilitated an observational analysis of interaction in, and through, the virtual world. Observations include: problems due to “fragmented” views of embodiments in relation to shared objects; participants compensating with spoken accounts of their actions; and difficulties in understanding others' perspectives. Implications and proposals for the design of CVEs drawn from these observations are: the use of semidistorted views to support peripheral awareness; more explicit or exaggerated representations of actions than are provided by pseudohumanoid avatars; and navigation techniques that are sensitive to the actions of others. The paper also presents some examples of the ways in which these proposals might be realized.",

    "abstract": "Calendar applications for small handheld devices are growing in popularity. This led us to develop DateLens, a novel calendar interface for PDAs designed to support complex tasks. It uses a fisheye representation coupled with compact overviews to give the big picture in a small space. The interface also gives users control over the visible time period, as well as supporting integrated search to discover patterns and outliers. Designed with device scalability in mind, DateLens currently runs on desktop computers as well as PDAs. Two user studies were conducted to examine the viability of DateLens as a replacement for traditional calendar visualizations. In the first study, non-PDA users performed complex tasks significantly faster with DateLens than with the Microsoft Pocket PC 2002 TM calendar (using a PDA emulator). In addition, they rated DateLens as being easier to use than the default calendar application for a majority of the tasks. In the second study, the participants were expert Pocket PC users and the software was run on their own devices. Again, DateLens performed significantly faster for the complex tasks, and there were satisfaction differences favoring each calendar for different kinds of tasks. From these studies, it is clear that DateLens is superior for more complex tasks such as those associated with longer time periods. For daily event tracking, users familiar with the default Pocket PC calendar strongly preferred its daily view and behaviors.",

The current study analyzes the interface design of such Live Help functions. More specifically, it attempts to understand whether or not the implementation of Text-To-Speech (TTS) voice communication and 3D avatars in the user interface of Live Help affects consumers' views of their own interactions with a service person.A laboratory experiment was designed to empirically test the hypotheses that TTS voice communication and 3D avatars can significantly affect consumers' perceptions of presence and flow. A 2*3 full factorial design was used (assessing three options for the use of voice and text, and two options for the use of avatars). The results of the experiment demonstrate that the presence of TTS voice significantly increases consumers' perceptions of flow (a construct depicting a user's interaction with a computer as playful and exploratory), while 3D avatars enhance consumers' feelings of telepresence (a user's experience of seeming to be present in a remote environment by means of a communication medium). These findings offer practitioners guidelines on how to improve interface designs for real-time human-to-human communications on electronic commerce Web sites.",

Expected movements are those that users naturally perform; sensed are those that can be measured by a computer; and desired movements are those that are required by a given application. We show how a systematic comparison of expected, sensed, and desired movements, especially with regard to how they do not precisely overlap, can reveal potential problems with an interface and also inspire new features. We describe how this approach has been applied to the design of three interfaces: pointing flashlights at walls and posters in order to play sounds; the Augurscope II, a mobile augmented reality interface for outdoors; and the Drift Table, an item of furniture that uses load sensing to control the display of aerial photographs. We propose that this approach can help to build a bridge between the analytic and inspirational approaches to design and can help designers meet the challenges raised by a diversification of sensing technologies and interface forms, increased mobility, and an emerging focus on technologies for everyday life.",

The system also provides users direct manipulation of digital information by using the users’ own hands and fingers for more natural and more intuitive interaction. Based on the experiments with our first prototype system, some critical issues on augmented desk systems were identified when trying to pursue rapid and fine recognition of hands and fingers. To overcome these issues, we developed a novel method for realtime finger tracking on an augmented desk system by introducing a infrared camera, pattern matching with normalized correlation, and a pan-tilt camera. We then show an interface prototype on EnhancedDesk. It is an application to a computer-supported learning environment, named Interactive Textbook. The system shows how effective the integration of paper and digital information is and how natural and intuitive direct manipulation of digital information with users’ hands and fingers is.",

The proposed framework has been incorporated into DistEdit, a toolkit for building group text editors. Based on our experience with DistEdit's undo facilities, we discuss several issues that need to be taken into account in using the framework, in order to ensure that a reasonable undo behavior is provided to users. We show that the framework is also applicable to single-user systems, since the operations to undo can be selected not just on the basis of who performed them, but by any appropriate criterion, such as the document region in which the operations occurred or the time interval in which the operations were carried out.",

    "abstract": "Video media spaces are an excellent crucible for the study of privacy. Their design affords opportunities for misuse, prompts ethical questions, and engenders grave concerns from both users and nonusers. Despite considerable discussion of the privacy problems uncovered in prior work, questions remain as to how to design a privacy-preserving video media space and how to evaluate its effect on privacy. The problem is more deeply rooted than this, however. Privacy is an enormous concept from which a large vocabulary of terms emerges. Disambiguating the meanings of and relationships between these terms facilitates understanding of the link between privacy and design. In this article, we draw from resources in environmental psychology and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) to build a broadly and deeply rooted vocabulary for privacy. We relate the vocabulary back to the real and hard problem of designing privacy-preserving video media spaces. In doing so, we facilitate analysis of the privacy-design relationship.",

We successfully predicted human performance in telephone operator tasks with engineering models constructed in the EPIC ( E xecutive P rocess- I nteractive C ontrol) architecture for human information processing, which is especially suited for modeling multimodal, complex tasks, and has demonstrated success in other task domains. Several models were constructed on an a priori basis to represent different hypotheses about how operators coordinate their activities to produce rapid task performance. The models predicted the total time with useful accuracy and clarified some important properties of the task. The best model was based directly on the GOMS analysis of the task and made simple assumptions about the operator's task strategy, suggesting that EPIC models are a feasible approach to predicting performance in multimodal high-performance tasks.",

    "abstract": "This article describes 3 experiments that investigate the possibiity of using structured nonspeech audio messages called earcons to provide navigational cues in a menu hierarchy. A hierarchy of 27 nodes and 4 levels was created with an earcon for each node. Rules were defined for the creation of hierarchical earcons at each node. Participants had to identify their location in the hierarchy by listening to an earcon. Results of the first experiment showed that participants could identify their location with 81.5% accuracy, indicating that earcons were a powerful method of communicating hierarchy information. One proposed use for such navigation cues is in telephone-based interfaces (TBIs) where navigation is a problem. The first experiment did not address the particular problems of earcons in TBIs such as “does the lower quality of sound over the telephone lower recall rates,” “can users remember earcons over a period of time.” and “what effect does training type have on recall?” An experiment was conducted and results showed that sound quality did lower the recall of earcons. However; redesign of the earcons overcame this problem with 73% recalled correctly. Participants could still recall earcons at this level after a week had passed. Training type also affected recall. With personal training participants recalled 73% of the earcons, but with purely textual training results were significantly lower. These results show that earcons can provide good navigation cues for TBIs. The final experiment used compound, rather than hierarchical earcons to represent the hierarchy from the first experiment. Results showed that with sounds constructed in this way participants could recall 97% of the earcons. These experiments have developed our general understanding of earcons. A hierarchy three times larger than any previously created was tested, and this was also the first test of the recall of earcons over time.",

However, these experiments have not provided user interface designers with an understanding of the severity or the nature of the difficulties young children have when using input devices. To address this need, we conducted a study to gain a better understanding of 4 and 5 year-old children's use of mice. We compared the performance of thirteen 4 year-olds, thirteen 5 year-olds and thirteen young adults in point-and-click tasks. Plots of the paths taken by the participants show severe differences between adults' and preschool children's ability to control the mouse. We were not surprised then to find age had a significant effect on accuracy, target reentry, and efficiency. We also found that target size had a significant effect on accuracy and target reentry. Measuring movement time at four different times (first entering target, last entering target, pressing button, releasing button) yielded the result that Fitts' law models children well only up to the time they first enter the target. Overall, we found that the difference between the performance of children and adults was large enough to warrant user interface interactions designed specifically for preschool children. The results additionally suggest that children need the most help once they get close to targets.",

    "abstract": "The article argues that new approaches for delivering HCI knowledge from theory to designers will be necessary in the new millennium. First the role of theory in HCI design to date is reviewed, including the progress made in cognitive theories of interaction and their impact on the design pr ocess. The role of bridging models that build on models of interaction is described, but it is argued that direct application of cognitive theory to design is limited by scalability problems. The alternative of representing HCI knowledge as claims and the role of the task-artefact approach to theory-based design are introduced. Claims are proposed as a possible bridging representation that may enable theories to frame appropriate recommendations for designers and, vice versa, enable designers to ask appropriate questions for theoretical research. However, claims provide design advice grounded in specific scenarios and examples, which limits their generality. The prospects for reuse becoming an important mode of development and the possible directions in generalizing claims for reuse are discussed, including generalizing claims beyond their original context, providing a context for reuse of claims by linking them to generic task and domain models. It is argued that generic models provide a way forward for developing reusable libraries of interactive components. The approach is illustrated from a case study of extracting claims from one information ret rieval application, generalizing claims for future reuse in information-searching tasks, and reapplying claims in the Web-based Multimedia Broker application. The article concludes by proposing that HCI knowledge should be theory-grounded, and development of reusable “designer-digestible” packets will be an important contribution in the future.",

A challenge facing the development of realistic and deployable context-aware services, therefore, is the ability to handle ambiguous context. Although some of this ambiguity may be resolved using automatic techniques, we argue that correct handling of ambiguous context will often need to involve the user. We use the term mediation to refer to the dialogue that ensues between the user and the system. In this article, we describe an architecture that supports the building of context-aware services that assume context is ambiguous and allows for mediation of ambiguity by mobile users in aware environments. We present design guidelines that arise from supporting mediation over space and time, issues not present in the graphical user interface domain where mediation has typically been used in the past. We illustrate the use of our architecture and evaluate it through an example context-aware application, a word predictor system.",

    "abstract": "In order to investigate large information spaces effectively, it is often necessary to employ navigation mechanisms that allow users to view information at different scales. Some tasks require frequent movements and scale changes to search for details and compare them. We present a model that makes predictions about user performance on such comparison tasks with different interface options. A critical factor embodied in this model is the limited capacity of visual working memory, allowing for the cost of visits via fixating eye movements to be compared to the cost of visits that require user interaction with the mouse. This model is tested with an experiment that compares a zooming user interface with a multi-window interface for a multiscale pattern matching task. The results closely matched predictions in task performance times; however error rates were much higher with zooming than with multiple windows. We hypothesized that subjects made more visits in the multi-window condition, and ran a second experiment using an eye tracker to record the pattern of fixations. This revealed that subjects made far more visits back and forth between pattern locations when able to use eye movements than they made with the zooming interface. The results suggest that only a single graphical object was held in visual working memory for comparisons mediated by eye movements, reducing errors by reducing the load on visual working memory. Finally we propose a design heuristic: extra windows are needed when visual comparisons must be made involving patterns of a greater complexity than can be held in visual working memory.",

    "abstract": "The design of robust interfaces that process conversational speech is a challenging research direction largely because users' spoken language is so variable. This research explored a new dimension of speaker stylistic variation by examining whether users' speech converges systematically with the text-to-speech (TTS) heard from a software partner. To pursue this question, a study was conducted in which twenty-four 7 to 10-year-old children conversed with animated partners that embodied different TTS voices. An analysis of children's amplitude, durational features, and dialogue response latencies confirmed that they spontaneously adapt several basic acoustic-prosodic features of their speech 10--50%, with the largest adaptations involving utterance pause structure and amplitude. Children's speech adaptations were relatively rapid, bidirectional, and dynamically readaptable when introduced to new partners, and generalized across different types of users and TTS voices. Adaptations also occurred consistently, with 70--95% of children converging with their partner's TTS, although individual differences in magnitude of adaptation were evident. In the design of future conversational systems, users' spontaneous convergence could be exploited to guide their speech within system processing bounds, thereby enhancing robustness. Adaptive system processing could yield further significant performance gains. The long-term goal of this research is the development of predictive models of human-computer communication to guide the design of new conversational interfaces.",

    "abstract": "A notification represents the proactive delivery of information to a user and reduces the need to visually scan or repeatedly check an external information source. At the same time, notifications often interrupt user tasks at inopportune moments, decreasing productivity and increasing frustration. Controlled studies have shown that linking notification delivery to the perceptual structure of a user's tasks can reduce these interruption costs. However, in these studies, the scheduling was always performed manually, and it was not clear whether it would be possible for a system to mimic similar techniques. This article contributes the design and implementation of a novel system called Oasis that aligns notification scheduling with the perceptual structure of user tasks. We describe the architecture of the system, how it detects task structure on the fly without explicit knowledge of the task itself, and how it layers flexible notification scheduling policies on top of this detection mechanism. The system also includes an offline tool for creating customized statistical models for detecting task structure. The value of our system is that it intelligently schedules notifications, enabling the reductions in interruption costs shown within prior controlled studies to now be realized by users in everyday desktop computing tasks. It also provides a test bed for experimenting with how notification management policies and other system functionalities can be linked to task structure.",

However, while teenage adoption of SMS had led to a series of studies examining the reasons for its popularity, IM use in the teenage population remains understudied. This omission becomes significant given the increasing interest in domestic computing among human-computer interaction (HCI) and computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) researchers. Further, because of the dearth of empirical work on teenage use of IM, we find that IM and SMS are sometimes incorrectly assumed to share the same features of use. To address these concerns, we revisit our own studies of SMS and IM use and reexamine them in tandem with other published studies on teenage chat. We consider similarities and differences in styles of SMS and IM use and how chat technologies enable the pursuit of teenage independence. We examine how differences are born out of technological differences and financial cost structures. We discuss how SMS and IM are used in concert to provide increased awareness and to coordinate inter-household communications, and how privacy is regulated within the individual household as a means of maintaining these communications.",

These approaches use various metrics to measure the Web's accessibility. “Ease of navigation” (navigability) is one of the crucial factors for blind usability, especially for complicated webpages used in portals and online shopping sites. However, it is difficult for automatic checking tools to evaluate the navigation capabilities even for a single webpage. Navigability issues for complete Web applications are still far beyond their capabilities. This study aims at obtaining quantitative results about the current accessibility status of real world Web applications, and analyzes real users' behavior on such websites. In Study 1, an automatic analysis method for webpage navigability is introduced, and then a broad survey using this method for 30 international online shopping sites is described. The next study (Study 2) focuses on a fine-grained analysis of real users' behavior on some of these online shopping sites. We modified a voice browser to record each user's actions and the information presented to that user. We conducted user testing on existing sites with this tool. We also developed an analysis and visualization method for the recorded information. The results showed us that users strongly depend on scanning navigation instead of logical navigation. A landmark-oriented navigation model was proposed based on the results. Finally, we discuss future possibilities for improving navigability, including proposals for voice browsers.",

We have found, however, that older adults are equally if not more interested in the activities of younger family members. The major obstacle preventing them from participating in information sharing is the technology itself. Therefore, we developed a multi-layered interface approach that offers simple interaction to older users. In our system, users can choose to enter information into a computerized calendar or write it by hand on digital paper calendars. All of the information is automatically shared among everyone in the distributed family. By making the interface more accessible to older users, we promote symmetrical sharing of information among both older and younger family members. We present our participatory design process, describe the user interface, and report on an exploratory field study in three households of an extended family.",

    "abstract": "Paper persists as an integral component of active reading and other knowledge-worker tasks because it provides ease of use unmatched by digital alternatives. Paper documents are light to carry, easy to annotate, rapid to navigate, flexible to manipulate, and robust to use in varied environments. Interactions with paper documents create rich webs of annotation, cross reference, and spatial organization. Unfortunately, the resulting webs are confined to the physical world of paper and, as they accumulate, become increasingly difficult to store, search, and access. XLibris [Schilit et al. 1998] and similar systems address these difficulties by simulating paper with tablet PCs. While this approach is promising, it suffers not only from limitations of current tablet computers (e.g., limited screen space) but also from loss of invaluable paper affordances. In this article, we describe PapierCraft, a gesture-based command system that allows users to manipulate digital documents using paper printouts as proxies. Using an Anoto [Anoto 2002] digital pen, users can draw command gestures on paper to tag a paragraph, e-mail a selected area, copy selections to a notepad, or create links to related documents. Upon pen synchronization, PapierCraft executes the commands and presents the results in a digital document viewer. Users can then search the tagged information and navigate the web of annotated digital documents resulting from interactions with the paper proxies. PapierCraft also supports real time interactions across mix-media, for example, letting users copy information from paper to a Tablet PC screen. This article presents the design and implementation of the PapierCraft system and describes user feedback from initial use.",

    "abstract": "In recent years there has been an introduction of sophisticated new video conferencing technologies (e.g., HP Halo, Cisco Telepresence) that have led to enhancements in the collaborative user experience over traditional video conferencing technologies. Traditional video conferencing set-ups often distort the shared spatial properties of action and communication due to screen and camera orientation disparities and other asymmetries. These distortions affect access to the common resources used to mutually organize action and communication. By contrast, new systems, such as Halo, are physically configured to reduce these asymmetries and orientation disparities, thereby minimizing these spatial distortions. By creating appropriate shared spatial geometries, the distributed spaces become “blended” where the spatial geometries of the local space continue coherently across the distributed boundary into the remote site, providing the illusion of a single unified space. Drawing on theories of embodied action and workplace design we discuss the importance of this geometric “blending” of space for distributed collaboration and how this is achieved in systems such as Halo. We then extend these arguments to explore the concept of Blended Interaction Spaces : blended spaces in which interactive groupware is incorporated in ways spatially consistent with the physical geometries of the video-mediated set-up. We illustrate this discussion through a system called BISi that introduces interactive horizontal and vertical multipoint surfaces into a blended video-mediated collaboration space. In presenting this system, we highlight some of the particular challenges of creating these systems arising from the spatial consequences of different interaction mechanisms (e.g., direct touch or remote control) and how they affect movement and spatial configuration of people in these spaces.",

We explored the use of contextual information, such as events, places, and people, to support reflection on the factors that affect physical activity. We present three findings from our studies. First, users make associations between physical activity and contextual information that help them become aware of factors that affect their physical activity. Second, reflecting on physical activity and context can increase people's awareness of opportunities for physical activity. Lastly, automated tracking of physical activity and contextual information benefits long-term reflection, but may have detrimental effects on immediate awareness.",

    "abstract": "Supporting social interactions is a long-term focus for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). However, understanding how social and emotional skills are learned, and how this process can be supported by technology, is an important but underresearched area in HCI so far. To address this gap, we review existing approaches to social and emotions skills learning (SEL) in other fields, with a specific focus on SEL in education, in which a large number of evidence-based programs is widely deployed. In doing so, the primary aim of this article is to provide a foundation and set an agenda for future research on the design of technology that would support, and help teach, social and emotional skills. We identify the key challenges to successful learning shared by SEL programs in education—such as embedding skills learned in class also into everyday situations, promoting reflection, and providing additional opportunities for practice—and outline how these could be addressed by digital technology. Overall, our key argument is that much existing HCI work could be used in support of social and emotional skills learning in education, and possibly other domains, but that the topic has not been explored so far. We also highlight how the focus on supporting SEL would bring novel opportunities and challenges for HCI, as well as provide a basis for a strong HCI research agenda in this space.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating creativity support environments is challenging. Some approaches address people’s experiences of creativity. The present method measures creativity, across conditions, in the products that people make. This research introduces information-based ideation (IBI), a paradigm for investigating open-ended tasks and activities in which users develop new ideas. IBI tasks span imagining, planning, and reflecting on a weekend, vacation, outfit, makeover, paper, internship, thesis, design, campaign, crisis response, career, or invention. What products do people create through engagement in IBI? Curation of digital media incorporates conceptualization, finding and choosing information objects, annotation, and synthesis. Through engagement in IBI tasks, people create curation products. This article formulates a quantitative methodology for evaluating IBI support tools, building on prior creative cognition research in engineering design to derive a battery of ideation metrics of curation. Elemental ideation metrics evaluate creativity within curated found objects. Holistic ideation metrics evaluate how a curation puts elements together. IBI support environments are characterized by their underlying medium of curation. Curation media include lists, such as listicles, and grids, such as the boards of Pinterest. An in-depth case study investigates information composition , an art-based medium representing a curation as a freeform visual semantic connected whole. We raise two creative cognition challenges for IBI. One challenge is overcoming fixation—for instance, when a person gets stuck in a counterproductive mental set. The other challenge is to bridge information visualization’s synthesis gap , by providing support for connecting findings. To address the challenges, we develop mixed-initiative information composition (MI 2 C), integrating human curation of information composition with automated agents of information retrieval and visualization. We hypothesize that MI 2 C generates provocative stimuli that help users overcome fixation to become more creative on IBI tasks. We hypothesize that MI 2 C’s integration of curation and visualization bridges the synthesis gap to help users become more creative. To investigate these hypotheses, we apply ideation metrics of curation to interpret results from experiments with 44 and 49 participants.",

    "abstract": "In pervasive and ubiquitous computing systems, human activity recognition has immense potential in a large number of application domains. Current activity recognition techniques (i) do not handle variations in sequence, concurrency and interleaving of complex activities; (ii) do not incorporate context; and (iii) require large amounts of training data. There is a lack of a unifying theoretical framework which exploits both domain knowledge and data-driven observations to infer complex activities. In this article, we propose, develop and validate a novel Context-Driven Activity Theory (CDAT) for recognizing complex activities. We develop a mechanism using probabilistic and Markov chain analysis to discover complex activity signatures and generate complex activity definitions. We also develop a Complex Activity Recognition (CAR) algorithm. It achieves an overall accuracy of 95.73% using extensive experimentation with real-life test data. CDAT utilizes context and links complex activities to situations, which reduces inference time by 32.5% and also reduces training data by 66%.",

This opens up new ways of working together. We examined the data traces of collaborative writing behavior in student teams’ use of Google Docs to discover how they are writing together now. We found that student teams write both synchronously and asynchronously, take fluid roles in the writing and editing of the documents, and show a variety of styles of collaborative writing, including writing from scratch, beginning with an outline, pasting in a related example as a template to organize their own writing, and three more. We also found that the document serves as a place where they share a number of things not included in the final document, including links or references to related materials, the assignment requirements from the instructor, and informal discussions to coordinate the collaboration or to structure the document. We computed a number of measures to depict a group's collaboration behavior and asked external graders to score these documents for quality. We found that the documents that included balanced participation and/or exhibited leadership were judged higher in quality, as were those that were longer. We then suggested system design implications and behavioral guidelines to support people writing together better, and concluded the paper with future research directions.",

These interfaces need to provide sufficient expressiveness to support complex automation, and notations need to be devised that enable less tech-savvy users to express such scenarios. Rule-based and process-oriented paradigms have emerged as opposing ends of the spectrum; however, their underlying concepts have not been studied comparatively. We report on a contextual inquiry study in which we collected qualitative data from 18 participants in 12 households on the current potential and acceptance of home automation, as well as explored the respective benefits and drawbacks of these two notation paradigms for end users. Results show that rule-based notations are sufficient for simple automation tasks but not flexible enough for more complex use cases. The resulting insights can inform the design of interfaces for smart homes to enable usable real-world home automation for end users.",

To help designers explore the richness of social play in exertion games, we present the design dimension “bodily interplay” that gives critical focus to how players’ bodies interact with one another. We offer two broad categories of bodily interplay— parallel and interdependent play —to explain how exertion games can facilitate independent and offensive/defensive-type experiences. These categories can be applied to both the physical and virtual space, and by looking at all permutations of these categories, we articulate four ways of coupling the spaces: comparative, actuated, derived, and projected coupling. This article illustrates the inspirational power of the dimensions by applying them to the analysis of four exertion games. Altogether, we articulate a vocabulary that can guide designers in the creation of social exertion games, helping players profit from the many benefits of exertion.",

    "abstract": "Older adults frequently deploy the concept of distrust when discussing digital technologies, and it is tempting to assume that distrust is largely responsible for the reduced uptake by older adults witnessed in the latest surveys of technology use. To help understand the impact of distrust on adoption behavior, we conducted focus groups with older adults exploring how, in what circumstances, and to what effect older adults articulate distrust in digital technologies. Our findings indicate that distrust is not especially relevant to older adults’ practical decision making around technology (non-)use. The older adults in our study used the language of distrust to open up discussions around digital technologies to larger issues related to values. This suggests that looking to distrust as a predictor of non-use (e.g., in Technology Acceptance Model studies) may be uniquely unhelpful in the case of older adults, as it narrows the discussion of technology acceptance and trust to interactional issues, when their use of distrust pertains to much wider concerns. Likewise, technology adoption should not be viewed as indicative of trust or an endorsement of technology acceptability. Older adults using-while-distrusting offers important insights into how to design truly acceptable digital technologies.",

We study mid-air pointing techniques that can be combined with other, domain-specific interactions. We first explore the limits of existing single-mode remote pointing techniques and demonstrate theoretically that they do not support high-precision pointing on ultra-walls. We then explore solutions to improve mid-air pointing efficiency: a tunable acceleration function and a framework for dual-precision (DP) techniques, both with precise tuning guidelines. We designed novel pointing techniques following these guidelines, several of which outperform existing techniques in controlled experiments that involve pointing difficulties never tested prior to this work. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of our techniques to help interaction designers choose the best technique according to the task and equipment at hand. Finally, we discuss the cognitive mechanisms that affect pointing performance with these techniques.",

    "abstract": "People increasingly live their lives online, accruing large collections of digital possessions, which symbolically represent important relationships, events, and activities. Most HCI research on bereavement focuses on retaining these significant digital possessions to honor the departed. However, recent work suggests that significant digital possessions may complicate moving on; they function as both comforting and painful reminders but currently provide inflexible methods for disposal. A few works have investigated the disposal of digital objects as a means of letting go . To better understand this we interviewed 10 psychotherapists who employ rituals of letting go to help patients overcome loss in situations such as a divorce, a breakup, or a stillbirth. Patients disposed of either natural artifacts or symbolic personal possessions through actions such as burning, burying, or placing in a body of water. Therapists noted that people increasingly have digital possessions, and that the act of deletion does not offer the same cathartic sense of release as disposal of material artifacts. Based on the analysis of this grief therapy, we propose a new conceptual framework for rituals of letting go that highlights temporality, visibility, and force. It provides a vocabulary to talk about disposal. We then offer design implications connecting the rituals of letting go to the disposal of digital things. Based on our interviews and analytic framework, we propose novel technologies that better connect the embodied nature of letting go rituals to the process of digital disposal.",

However, to inform sustainable HCI we also need to understand how practices are part of wider experiential environments and flows of practical activity. In this article, we develop an approach rooted in phenomenological anthropology and sensory ethnography. This approach builds on theories of place, perception and movement and enables us to situate practices, and understand practical activity, as emplaced within complex and shifting ecologies of things. Drawing on an interdisciplinary study of domestic energy consumption and digital media use, we discuss ethnographic and design practice examples. We demonstrate how this theoretical and methodological framework can be aligned with the 3rd paradigm of HCI.",

We have conducted a corpus of studies that explore how various demographics make use of such video chat systems in which this usage moves beyond the paradigm of conversational support to one in which aspects of everyday life are shared over long periods of time, sometimes in an almost passive manner. We describe and reflect on studies of long-distance couples, teenagers, and major life events, along with design research focused on new video communication systems—the Family Window, Family Portals, and Perch—that explicitly support “always-on video” for awareness and communication. Overall, our findings show that people highly value long-term video connections and have appropriated them in a number of different ways. Designers of future video communication systems need to consider: ways of supporting the sharing of everyday life rather than just conversation, providing different design solutions for different locations and situations, providing appropriate audio control and feedback, and supporting expressions of intimacy over distance.",

In this article, we consider motion correlation as an alternative for selection. The principle is to represent available objects by motion in the interface, have users identify a target by mimicking its specific motion, and use the correlation between the system’s output with the user’s input to determine the selection. The resulting interaction has compelling properties, as users are guided by motion feedback, and only need to copy a presented motion. Motion correlation has been explored in earlier work but only recently begun to feature in holistic interface designs. We provide a first comprehensive review of the principle, and present an analysis of five previously published works, in which motion correlation underpinned the design of novel gaze and gesture interfaces for diverse application contexts. We derive guidelines for motion correlation algorithms, motion feedback, choice of modalities, overall design of motion correlation interfaces, and identify opportunities and challenges identified for future research and design.",

Users select keys on the virtual keyboard by imitating the process of single-hand typing on a physical touchscreen display. Our system uses a statistical decoder to infer users’ intended text and to provide error-tolerant predictions. There is also a high-precision fall-back mechanism to support users in indicating which keys should be unmodified by the auto-correction process. A unique advantage of leveraging the well-established touch input paradigm is that our system enables text entry with minimal visual clutter on the see-through display, thus preserving the user’s field-of-view. We iteratively designed and evaluated our system and show that the final iteration of the system supports a mean entry rate of 17.75wpm with a mean character error rate less than 1%. This performance represents a 19.6% improvement relative to the state-of-the-art baseline investigated: A gaze-then-gesture text entry technique derived from the system keyboard on the Microsoft HoloLens. Finally, we validate that the system is effective in supporting text entry in a fully mobile usage scenario likely to be encountered in industrial applications of AR HMDs.",

Because the robots on the market today were designed for use by adults in work settings, they do not necessarily fit children in school settings. We carried out a study of 19 homebound students, interviewing and observing them as well as interviewing their parents, teachers, administrators, and classmates. We organized our findings along the lines of the various tasks and settings the child is in, developing a learner-centered analytic framework , then teacher -, classmate -, and homebound-controller-centered analytic frameworks . Although some features of current robots fit children in school settings, we discovered a number of cases where there was a mismatch or additional features are needed. Our findings are described according to analytic frames that capture user experiences. Based on these user-centered findings, we provide recommendations for designing the robot and user interface to better fit children using robots for school and learning activities.",

However, as we will uncover through a detailed account of our process, these first-person engagements are deeply entangled with second- and third-person perspectives, sometimes even overlapping. The analysis furthermore reveals some strategies for bridging the body-mind divide by attending to our inner universe and dissolving or traversing dichotomies between inside and outside ; individual and social ; body and technology . By detailing the creative process, we show how soma design becomes a process of designing with and through kinesthetic experience, in turn letting us confront several dualisms that run like fault lines through HCI’s engagement with embodied interaction.",

    "abstract": "The concurrent think-aloud protocol—in which participants verbalize their thoughts when performing tasks—is a widely employed approach in usability testing. Despite its value, analyzing think-aloud sessions can be onerous because it often entails assessing all of a user's verbalizations. This has motivated previous research on developing categories to segment verbalizations into manageable units of analysis. However, the way in which a category might relate to usability problems is currently unclear. In this research, we sought to address this gap in our understanding. We also studied how speech features might relate to usability problems. Through two studies, this research demonstrates that certain patterns of verbalizations are more telling of usability problems than others and that these patterns are robust to different types of test products (i.e., physical devices and digital systems), access to different types of information (i.e., video and audio modality), and the presence or absence of a visualization of verbalizations. The implication is that the verbalization and speech patterns can potentially reduce the time and effort required for analysis by enabling evaluators to focus more on the important aspects of a user's verbalizations. The patterns could also potentially be used to inform the design of systems to automatically detect when in the recorded think-aloud sessions users experience problems.",

The system comprises a pair of remotely connected mitts, which enable users in different locations to communicate through tactile messages, by orchestrating duration and level of three haptic sensations: vibration, pressure and temperature. Qualitative analysis shows the nuanced ways in which 68 participants configured these elements to make meaning from touch messages they sent and received. It points to the affect and emotion of touch, its sensoriality and ambiguity, the significance of context, social norms and expectations of touch participants. Findings suggest key design considerations for digital touch communication, where the emphasis shifts from generating ‘recognizable touches’ to tools that allow people to shape their touches and establish common understanding about their meaning.",

High WPM variability across fonts suggests that one font does not fit all.

Through critical reflection on a range of issues associated with post-colonialism and post-development, I examine the possibilities that various historical tropes might offer to the reinvention of the African perspective on innovation. This leads to the consideration of how engaging in critical discussions about the future dimensions of African HCI can allow for grappling with the effect of the coloniality of being, power, and knowledge. Developing on the ideas of futuring as a way of dealing with the complexities of the present—in this case, the coloniality of the imagination—the article ends by discussing three tactical propositions for “remembering” future identities of African innovation where the values of autonomy are known and acted upon.",

First, through the lens of the monster, we articulate how the wearer can adopt or reject the garment, resulting in either harmonious or disconcerting experiences of touch. Second, it can be experienced as an organic “other”-with its own agency-resulting in uncanny experiences of touch. Through mirroring the wearer’s breathing, the garment can also be experienced as a twisted version of one’s own body. We suggest that a gradual sensitisation of designers-through soma design and reflection on the emerging human-technology relations-may serve as a pathway for uncovering and articulating novel, machine-like, digital touch experiences.",

Participants used LGBTQ-specific online spaces to enact individual, interpersonal, and collective resilience. However, those with multiple marginalized identities (e.g., people of color and non-partnered individuals), faced barriers in finding support within LGBTQ-specific spaces compared to those holding privileged identities (e.g., White and married). Non-LGBTQ spaces were beneficial for some informational needs, but not community and emotional needs due to pervasive heteronormativity, cisnormativity, and a perceived need to educate.

However, we argue here that this overlooks the important part played by organisational accountability in how people reason about and trust AI in socio-technical settings. To illustrate the importance of organisational accountability, we present findings from ethnographic studies of breast cancer screening and cancer treatment planning in multidisciplinary team meetings to show how participants made themselves accountable both to each other and to the organisations of which they are members. We use these findings to enrich existing understandings of the requirements for trustworthy AI and to outline some candidate solutions to the problems of making AI accountable both to individual users and organisationally. We conclude by outlining the implications of this for future work on the development of trustworthy AI, including ways in which our proposed solutions may be re-used in different application settings.",

In this article, we examine how “physicalization” is part of a broader ecology—the “physecology”—with properties that go beyond the scope of the working definition. Through analyzing 60 representative physicalization papers, we derived six design dimensions of a physecology: (i) represented data type, (ii) way of information communication, (iii) interaction mechanisms, (iv) spatial input–output coupling, (v) physical setup, and (vi) audiences involved. Our contribution is the extension of the definition of physicalization to the broader concept of “physecology,” to provide conceptual clarity on the design of physicalizations for future work.",

The other project, Future Design Studio, invited audience members at a futurist festival to create artifacts from the future and then invited improvisational actors to build worlds around them.

Our findings suggest that while using a shared AI model as a mediator among coders could improve CQA efficiency and foster agreement more quickly in the early coding stage, it might affect the final code diversity. We also emphasize the need to consider the independence level when using AI to assist human-to-human collaboration in various CQA scenarios.

We build from these findings to argue that future digital fabrication systems should support the exploration of material and machine behavior alongside geometry, that simulation is insufficient for understanding the design space, and that material constraints and resource management are meaningful design dimensions to support.

Our work focuses on a particular form of integration in which the user and the computational machine share agency over the user's body, that is, can simultaneously (in contrast to a traditional turn-taking approach) control the user's body. The result is a user experience where the agency of the user and the computational machine is so intertwined that it is often no more discernable who contributed what to what extent; we call this “intertwined integration”. Due to the recency of advanced technologies enabling intertwined integration systems, we find that little understanding and documented design knowledge exist. To begin constructing such an understanding, we use three case studies to propose two key dimensions (“awareness of machine's agency” and “alignment of machine's agency”) to articulate a design space for intertwined integration systems. We differentiate four roles that computational machines can assume in this design space (angel, butler, influencer, and adversary). Based on our craft knowledge gained through designing such intertwined integration systems, we discuss strategies to help designers create future systems. Ultimately, we aim at advancing the HCI field's emerging understanding of sharing agency.",

    "abstract": "Most social media platforms implement content moderation to address interpersonal harms such as harassment. Content moderation relies on offender-centered, punitive approaches, e.g., bans and content removal. We consider an alternative justice framework, restorative justice, which aids victims in healing, supports offenders in repairing the harm, and engages community members in addressing the harm collectively. To assess the utility of restorative justice in addressing online harm, we interviewed 23 users from Overwatch gaming communities, including moderators, victims, and offenders; such communities are particularly susceptible to harm, with nearly three quarters of all online game players suffering from some form of online abuse. We study how the communities currently handle harm cases through the lens of restorative justice and examine their attitudes toward implementing restorative justice processes. Our analysis reveals that cultural, technical, and resource-related obstacles hinder implementation of restorative justice within the existing punitive framework despite online community needs and existing structures to support it. We discuss how current content moderation systems can embed restorative justice goals and practices and overcome these challenges.",

    "abstract": "Hybridity in immersive technologies has not been studied for factors that are likely to influence engagement. A noticeable factor is the spatial enclosure that defines where users meet. This involves a mutual object of interest, contents that the users may generate around the object, and the proximity between users. This study examines these factors, namely how object interactivity, user-generated contents (UGC) and avatar proximity influence engagement. We designed a Hybrid Virtual and Augmented Reality (HVAR) environment that supports paired users to experience cultural heritage in both Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) . A user study was conducted with 60 participants, providing assessments of engagement and presence via questionnaires, together with mobile electroencephalogram (mEEG) and user activity data that measures VR user engagement in real-time. Our findings provide insights into how engagement between users can occur in HVAR environments for the future hybrid reality with multi-device connectivity.",

The analysis of these data is opening exciting new avenues for both studying and supporting learning. Yet, practical and logistical challenges commonly appear while deploying MMLA innovations “in-the-wild”. These can span from technical issues related to enhancing the learning space with sensing capabilities, to the increased complexity of teachers’ tasks. These practicalities have been rarely investigated. This article addresses this gap by presenting a set of lessons learnt from a 2-year human-centred MMLA in-the-wild study conducted with 399 students and 17 educators in the context of nursing education. The lessons learnt were synthesised into topics related to (i) technological/physical aspects of the deployment; (ii) multimodal data and interfaces; (iii) the design process; (iv) participation, ethics and privacy; and (v) sustainability of the deployment.",

    "abstract": "Designing new technologies to support synchronous interaction across distances has for many years focused on creating symmetry for participation between geographically distributed actors. Symmetry in synchronous interaction has, to some extent, been achieved technologically (while multiple social, historical, political, and hierarchical concerns continue to exist) and proven empirically in the increased use of remote-work technologies that were used during the pandemic. However, synchronous interaction in hybrid work is achieved differently, since the asymmetry produced by some participants being collocated while others geographically distributed introduces increased complexities for such interactions. Focusing on this challenge, we ask: To what extent can symmetry in cooperative work engagements be achieved in hybrid work contexts? We explore this question by interrogating multiple different empirical examples of synchronous hybrid interaction collected across different organizations, activities, and events. We found that the effort required to accomplish hybrid work includes additional articulation work necessary for bounding multiple intertwined artefacts across sites, devices, and applications. Further, the multiple artefacts setup across sites, combined with asymmetric collocation across participants, produce incongruence in technological frames of reference for each participant. All participants in hybrid work have only partial access to the hybrid setup, and no single person has access to the complete setup. The incongruence in technological frames produces insurmountable gaps in collaboration, causing all hybrid work situations to be characterized fundamentally by asymmetric relationships. We argue that symmetry in hybrid synchronous interaction is impossible to attain in attempts to solve this problem through design. Instead, we propose that designers of cooperative technologies for hybrid work shift towards developing artefact-ecologies supporting hybrid work, focusing on asymmetry as a necessary feature. Fundamentally, the design strategy should explore novel ways of taking advantage of the multiple different artefact-ecologies which serve as the foundation for the hybrid collaboration. Instead of striving for symmetry, we propose to feature asymmetric conditions in future technology designs for hybrid interaction.",

The interaction styles were experimentally compared to determine if either method was superior to the other in terms of speed, error rate, or user preference, for children. The two interaction styles were also compared based on children's achievement and motivation, within a commercial software environment. Experiment I used an interactive learning environment as children played two versions of an educational puzzle-solving game, each version utilizing a different mouse interaction style; experiment II used a mouse-controlled software environment modeled after the educational game. The results were similar to previous results reported for adults: the point-and-click interaction style was faster; fewer errors were committed using it; and it was preferred over the drag-and-drop interaction style. Within the context of the puzzle-solving game, the children solved significantly fewer puzzles, and they were less motivated using the version that utilized a drag-and-drop interaction style as compared to the version that utilized a point-and-click interaction style. These results were also explored through the use of state-transition diagrams and GOMS models, both of which supported the experimental data gathered.",

Making the object held in the hand have the same physical shape as the object being visually manipulated was not found to be a significant factor.

The system also provides users direct manipulation of digital information by using the users' own hands and fingers for more natural and more intuitive interaction. Based on the experiments with our first prototype system, some critical issues on augmented desk systems were identified when trying to pursue rapid and fine recognition of hands and fingers. To overcome these issues, we developed a novel method for realtime finger tracking on an augmented desk system by introducing a infrared camera, pattern matching with normalized correlation, and a pan-tilt camera. We then show an interface prototype on EnhancedDesk. It is an application to a computer-supported learning environment, named Interactive Textbook. The system shows how effective the integration of paper and digital information is and how natural and intuitive direct manipulation of digital information with users' hands and fingers is.",

    "abstract": "Patterns of Cooperative Interaction are regularities in the organisation of work, activity, and interaction among participants, and with, through, and around artifacts. These patterns are organised around a framework and are inspired by how such regularities are highlighted in ethnomethodologically-informed ethnographic studies of work and technology. They comprise a high level description and two or more comparable examples drawn from specific studies. Our contention is that these patterns form a useful resource for reusing findings from previous field studies, for enabling analysis and considering design in new settings. Previous work on the relationship between ethnomethodology and design has been concerned primarily in providing presentation frameworks and mechanisms, practical advice, schematisations of the ethnomethodologist's role, different possibilities of input at different stages in development, and various conceptualisations of the relationship between study and design. In contrast, this article seeks to first discuss the position of patterns relative to emergent major topics of interest of these studies. Subsequently it seeks to describe the case for the collection of patterns based on findings , their comparison across studies and their general implications for design problems, rather than the concerns of practical and methodological interest outlined in the other work. Special attention is paid to our evaluations and to how they inform how the patterns collection may be read, used and contributed to, as well as to reflections on the composition of the collection as it has emerged. The paper finishes, first, with a discussion of how our work relates to other work on patterns, before some closing comments are made on the role of our patterns and ethnomethodology in systems design.",

However, supporting undo in collaborative applications is technically challenging and none of the existing group undo solutions is able to offer such a capability. In this article, we contribute an undo solution with such a capability for group text editors. The basic idea is to interpret an undo command as a concurrent inverse operation by means of operational transformation. To cope with the high complexity of group undo, a generic undo framework has been adopted to separate undo policy from the undo mechanism and to separate transformation control algorithms from transformation functions. The proposed undo solution consists of a generic transformation control algorithm that is capable of generating, transforming, and representing valid inverse operations in any context, and a set of transformation functions that are capable of preserving undo-related transformation conditions and properties. Formal proofs are provided to show the correctness of the undo transformation control algorithm in achieving the required undo effect, undo property, and consistency properties. Solutions to the known undo puzzles are provided to show soundness of the transformation functions. A Web-based group text editor REDUCE (REal-time Distributed Unconstrained Cooperative Editing) has been implemented to demonstrate the feasibility and usability of the proposed undo and other technical solutions. The proposed undo solution is generally applicable to collaborative applications that support concurrent insertion and deletion on shared documents consisting of one or multiple dimensions of linearly ordered data objects with positional references.",

Various elaborate inventions have been proposed to get around this problem but none have found wide use. The alternative explored here is that these expensive alternatives may be unnecessary. Users of conventional desktop video equipment may, under the right conditions, be able to learn to interpret what is at first sight inappropriate apparent gaze direction as signalling that the other person is \"looking at me.\"Data are presented from two experiments where an estimator judges where a gazer is looking. The gazer may be looking either at the desktop video image of the estimator or some point to the side. Experiment 1 compared two image sizes and two camera positions. While the size of the image (352 × 288 pixels versus 176 × 144) had no significant effect on participants' ability to judge where the gazer was looking, horizontally offsetting the position of the camera inhibited performance. Experiment 2 examined the effect of reducing the image size further. The smallest image size (88 × 72 pixels) resulted in poorer performance than the intermediate (176 × 144). The results show that it is possible for users of low cost desktop video conferencing to learn to interpret gaze direction to a very high degree of accuracy if the equipment is configured optimally. The practical and theoretical implications of these results are discussed.",

Twenty subjects wrote essays and answered questions about scientific documents using an overview+detail, a fisheye, and a linear interface. We study reading patterns by progression maps that visualize the progression of subjects' reading activity, and by visibility maps that show for how long different parts of the document are visible. The reading patterns help explain differences in usability between the interfaces and show how interfaces affect the way subjects read. With the overview+detail interface, subjects get higher grades for their essays. All but one of the subjects prefer this interface. With the fisheye interface, subjects use more time on gaining an overview of the document and less time on reading the details. Thus, they read the documents faster, but display lower incidental learning. We also show how subjects only briefly have visible the parts of the document that are not initially readable in the fisheye interface, even though they express a lack of trust in the algorithm underlying the fisheye interface. When answering questions, the overview is used for jumping directly to answers in the document and to already-visited parts of the document. However, subjects are slower at answering questions with the overview+detail interface. From the visualizations of the reading activity, we find that subjects using the overview+detail interface often explore the document further even when a satisfactory answer to the given question has already been read. Thus, overviews may grab subjects' attention and possibly distract them.",

    "abstract": "Ideally, software toolkits for collaborative applications should provide generic, reusable components, applicable in a wide range of circumstances, which software developers can assemble to produce new applications. However, the nature of CSCW applications and the mechanics of group interaction present a problem. Group interactions are significantly constrained by the structure of the underlying infrastructure, below the level at which toolkits typically offer control. This article describes the design features of Prospero, a prototype CSCW toolkit designed to be much more flexible than traditional toolkit techniques allow. Prospero uses a metalevel architecture so that application programmers can have control over not only how toolkit components are combined and used, but also over aspects of how they are internally structured and defined. This approach allows programmers to gain access to “internal” aspects of the toolkit's operation that affect how interaction and collaboration proceed. This article explains the metalevel approach and its application to CSCW, introduces two particular metalevel techniques for distributed data management and consistency control, shows how they are realized in Prospero, and illustrates how Prospero can be used to create a range of collaborative applications.",

As well, users were able to create a useful, usable social space; however, through an analysis of the social norms that the participants formulated, we show that they had to take into account being in an audio-only environment. Within the field study, then, audio by itself was sufficient for a usable media space and a useful social space, but users were forced to adapt to many audio-only and system conditions. The article also considers audios implications for privacy.",

    "abstract": "For many purposes, the Web page is too small a unit of interaction and analysis. Web sites are structured multimedia documents consisting of many pages, and users often are interested in obtaining and evaluating entire collections of topically related sites. Once such a collection is obtained, users face the challenge of exploring, comprehending and organizing the items. We report four innovations that address these user needs: (1) we replaced the Web page with the Web site as the basic unit of interaction and analysis;(2) we defined a new informationstructure, the clan graph , that groups together sets of related sites; (3) we augment the representation of a site with a site profile , information about site structure and content that helps inform user evaluation of a site; and (4) we invented a new graph visualization, the auditorium visualization , that reveals important structural and content properties of sites within a clan graph. Detailed analysis and user studies document the utility of this approach. The clan graph construction algorithm tends to filter out irrelevant sites and discover additional relevant items. The auditorium visualization, augmented with drill-down capabilities to explore site profile data, helps users to find high-quality sites as well as sites that serve a particular function.",

We report an empirical study of expert Smalltalk programmers reusing user interface classes in small graphical applications. Our primary goal was to develop a qualitative characterization of expert reuse strategies that could be used to identify requirements for teaching and supporting reuse programming. A secondary interest was to demonstrate to these experts the Reuse View Matcher—a prototype reuse tool—and to collect some initial observations of this tool in use during reuse programming. We observed extensive “reuse of uses” in the programmers' work: they relied heavily on code in expample applications that provided an implicit specification for reuse of the target class. We called this implicit specification a “usage context.” The programmers searched for relevant usage contexts early. They repeatedly evaluated the contextualized information to develop solution plans, and they borrowed and adapted it when the sample context suited their immediate reuse goals. The process of code development was highly dynamic and incremental; analysis and implementation were tightly interleaved, frequently driven by testing and debugging. These results are considered in terms of the tradeoffs that inhere in the reuse of uses and the teaching and tool support that might improve the efficiency and accuracy of this approach to reuse.",

To evaluate a scientific collaboratory system, we conducted a repeated-measures controlled experiment that compared the outcomes and process of scientific work completed by 20 pairs of participants (upper level undergraduate science students) working face-to-face and remotely. We collected scientific outcomes (graded lab reports) to investigate the quality of scientific work, post-questionnaire data to measure the adoptability of the system, and post-interviews to understand the participants' views of doing science under both conditions. We hypothesized that study participants would be less effective, report more difficulty, and be less favorably inclined to adopt the system when collaborating remotely. Contrary to expectations, the quantitative data showed no statistically significant differences with respect to effectiveness and adoption.The qualitative data helped explain this null result: participants reported advantages and disadvantages working under both conditions and developed work-arounds to cope with the perceived disadvantages of collaborating remotely. While the data analysis produced null results, considered as a whole, the analysis leads us to conclude there is positive potential for the development and adoption of scientific collaboratory systems.",

As interface work has increasingly become a focus of attention for the social sciences, we have expanded our appreciation of the importance of issues such as work practice, adaptation, and evolution in interactive systems. The reorientation in our view of interactive systems has been accompanied by a call for a new model of design centered around user needs and participation. This article argues that a new process of design is not enough and that the new view necessitates a similar reorientation in the structure of the systems we build. It outlines some requirements for systems that support a deeper conception of interaction and argues that the traditional system design techniques are not suited to creating such systems. Finally, using examples from ongoing work in the design of an open toolkit for collaborative applications, it illustrates how the principles of computational reflection and metaobject protocols can lead us toward a new model based on open abstraction that holds great promise in addressing these issues.",

The article briefly reviews techniques for presenting depth information and examples of applying semitransparency in computer interface design. We hypothesize that when the user moves a semitransparent surface in a 3D environment, the “partial-occlusion” effect introduced through semitransparency acts as an effective cue in target localization—an essential component in many 3D interaction tasks. This hypothesis was tested in an experiment in which subjects were asked to capture dynamic targets (virtual fish) with two versions of a 3D box cursor, one with and one without semitransparent surfaces. Results showed that the partial-occlusion effect through semitransparency significantly improved users' performance in terms of trial completion time, error rate, and error magnitude in both monoscopic and stereoscopic displays. Subjective evaluations supported the conclusions drawn from performance measures. The experimental results and their implications are discussed, with emphasis on the relative, discrete nature of the partial-occlusion effect and on interactions between different depth cues. The article concludes with proposals of a few future research issues and applications of semitransparency in human-computer interaction.",

Sixty-four undergraduates interacted with two different embodied agents: in one case the agent was designed to look somewhat similar to the user, and in the other case the agent was designed to look dissimilar. We varied between subjects how helpful the agent was for a given task. Results showed that the facial similarity manipulation sometimes affected participants' responses, even though they did not consciously detect the similarity. Specifically, when the agent was helpful, facial similarity increased participantsi ratings of involvement. However, when exposed to unhelpful agents, male participants had negative responses to the similar-looking agent compared to the dissimilar one. These results suggest that using facially similar embodied agents has a potential large downside if that embodied agent is perceived to be unhelpful.",

    "abstract": "Modern work is a highly social process, offering many cues for people to organize communication and access information. Shared physical workplaces provide natural support for tasks such as (a) &lt;i&gt;social reminding&lt;/i&gt; about communication commitments and keeping track of collaborators and friends, and (b) &lt;i&gt;social data mining&lt;/i&gt; of local expertise for advice and information. However, many people now collaborate remotely using tools such as email and voicemail. Our field studies show that these tools do not provide the social cues needed for group work processes. In part, this is because the tools are organized around &lt;i&gt;messages&lt;/i&gt;, rather than &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt;. In response to this problem, we created ContactMap, a system that makes &lt;i&gt;people&lt;/i&gt; the primary unit of interaction. ContactMap provides a structured social desktop representation of users' important contacts that directly supports social reminding and social data mining. We conducted an empirical evaluation of ContactMap, comparing it with traditional email systems, on tasks suggested by our fieldwork. Users performed better with ContactMap and preferred ContactMap for the majority of these tasks. We discuss future enhancements of our system and the implications of these results for future communication interfaces and for theories of mediated communication.",

    "abstract": "Tangible interaction shows promise to significantly enhance computer-mediated support for activities such as learning, problem solving, and design. However, tangible user interfaces are currently considered challenging to design and build. Designers and developers of these interfaces encounter several conceptual, methodological, and technical difficulties. Among others, these challenges include: the lack of appropriate interaction abstractions, the shortcomings of current user interface software tools to address continuous and parallel interactions, as well as the excessive effort required to integrate novel input and output technologies. To address these challenges, we propose a specification paradigm for designing and implementing Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs), that enables TUI developers to specify the structure and behavior of a tangible user interface using high-level constructs which abstract away implementation details. An important benefit of this approach, which is based on User Interface Description Language (UIDL) research, is that these specifications could be automatically or semi-automatically converted into concrete TUI implementations. In addition, such specifications could serve as a common ground for investigating both design and implementation concerns by TUI developers from different disciplines. Thus, the primary contribution of this article is a high-level UIDL that provides developers from different disciplines means for effectively specifying, discussing, and programming a broad range of tangible user interfaces. There are three distinct elements to this contribution: a visual specification technique that is based on Statecharts and Petri nets, an XML-compliant language that extends this visual specification technique, as well as a proof-of-concept prototype of a Tangible User Interface Management System (TUIMS) that semi-automatically translates high-level specifications into a program controlling specific target technologies.",

However, current network solutions are derived from the world of work (and initially the military) and provide poor support for the needs of the home. We present the key findings to emerge from empirical studies of home networks in the UK and US. The studies reveal two key kinds of work that effective home networking relies upon: one, the technical work of setting up and maintaining the home network, and the other, the collaborative and socially organized work of the home which the network is embedded in and supports. The two are thoroughly intertwined and rely upon one another for their realization, yet neither is adequately supported by current networking technologies and applications. Explication of the “work to make the home network work” opens up the design space for the continued integration of the home network in domestic life and elaboration of future support. Key issues for development include the development of networking facilities that do not require advanced networking knowledge, that are flexible and support the local social order of the home and the evolution of its routines, and which ultimately make the home network visible and accountable to household members.",

    "abstract": "A variety of approaches have emerged in HCI that grapple with the ineffable, ill-defined, and idiosyncratic nature of aesthetic experience. The most straightforward approach is to transform the ineffable aspects of these experiences into precise representations, producing systems that are well-defined and testable but may miss the fullness of the experienced phenomenon. But without formal models and codified methods, how can we design and evaluate for a phenomenon we aren't sure can be adequately captured? In this article, we present a case study of a system for reflection and awareness of emotional presence that was, in a sense, lived into being. Through system design, use, and evaluation we recount how the system evolved into something that enhanced rather than impoverished the sympathetic awareness of another. In discussing the strategies and results of the case study, we examine what it means for the HCI community to not only design for aesthetic experiences but also bring aesthetics into the practice of HCI.",

We hypothesized that the attentional demands of input devices are intricately linked to whether the device matches the input requirements of the on-screen task. Further, matching task and device should be more important for attentionally reduced groups, such as older adults. Younger and older adults used either a direct (touch screen) or indirect (rotary encoder) input device to perform matched or mismatched input tasks under a spectrum of attention allocation conditions. Input devices required attention—more so for older adults, especially in a mismatch situation. In addition, task performance was influenced by the match between task demands and input device characteristics. Though both groups benefited from a match between input device and task input requirements, older adults benefited more, and this benefit increased as less attention was available. We offer an a priori method to choose an input device for a task by considering the overlap between device attributes and input requirements. This data should affect design decisions concerning input device selection across age groups and task contexts.",

We thus introduce friendsourcing, a form of crowdsourcing aimed at collecting accurate information available only to a small, socially-connected group of individuals. Our approach to friendsourcing is to design socially enjoyable interactions that produce the desired information as a side effect. We focus our analysis around Collabio, a novel social tagging game that we developed to encourage friends to tag one another within an online social network. Collabio encourages friends, family, and colleagues to generate useful information about each other. We describe the design space of incentives in social tagging games and evaluate our choices by a combination of usage log analysis and survey data. Data acquired via Collabio is typically accurate and augments tags that could have been found on Facebook or the Web. To complete the arc from data collection to application, we produce a trio of prototype applications to demonstrate how Collabio tags could be utilized: an aggregate tag cloud visualization, a personalized RSS feed, and a question and answer system. The social data powering these applications enables them to address needs previously difficult to support, such as question answering for topics comprehensible only to a few of a user's friends.",

Multitasking research is important in order to improve the design of systems and applications. Since people typically use computers to perform multiple tasks at the same time, insights into this type of behavior can help develop better systems and ideal types of computer environments for modern multitasking users. In this paper, we define multitasking based on the principles of task independence and performance concurrency and develop a set of metrics for computer-based multitasking. The theoretical foundation of this metric development effort stems from an application of key principles of Activity Theory and a systematic analysis of computer usage from the perspective of the user, the task and the technology. The proposed metrics, which range from a lean dichotomous variable to a richer measure based on switches, were validated with data from a sample of users who self-reported their activities during a computer usage session. This set of metrics can be used to establish a conceptual and methodological foundation for future multitasking studies.",

    "abstract": "Keyphrases aid the exploration of text collections by communicating salient aspects of documents and are often used to create effective visualizations of text. While prior work in HCI and visualization has proposed a variety of ways of presenting keyphrases, less attention has been paid to selecting the best descriptive terms. In this article, we investigate the statistical and linguistic properties of keyphrases chosen by human judges and determine which features are most predictive of high-quality descriptive phrases. Based on 5,611 responses from 69 graduate students describing a corpus of dissertation abstracts, we analyze characteristics of human-generated keyphrases, including phrase length, commonness, position, and part of speech. Next, we systematically assess the contribution of each feature within statistical models of keyphrase quality. We then introduce a method for grouping similar terms and varying the specificity of displayed phrases so that applications can select phrases dynamically based on the available screen space and current context of interaction. Precision-recall measures find that our technique generates keyphrases that match those selected by human judges. Crowdsourced ratings of tag cloud visualizations rank our approach above other automatic techniques. Finally, we discuss the role of HCI methods in developing new algorithmic techniques suitable for user-facing applications.",

    "abstract": "We present a semantic imitation model of social tagging and exploratory search based on theories of cognitive science. The model assumes that social tags evoke a spontaneous tag-based topic inference process that primes the semantic interpretation of resource contents during exploratory search, and the semantic priming of existing tags in turn influences future tag choices. The model predicts that (1) users who can see tags created by others tend to create tags that are semantically similar to these existing tags, demonstrating the social influence of tag choices; and (2) users who have similar information goals tend to create tags that are semantically similar, but this effect is mediated by the semantic representation and interpretation of social tags. Results from the experiment comparing tagging behavior between a social group (where participants can see tags created by others) and a nominal group (where participants cannot see tags created by others) confirmed these predictions. The current results highlight the critical role of human semantic representations and interpretation processes in the analysis of large-scale social information systems. The model implies that analysis at both the individual and social levels are important for understanding the active, dynamic processes between human knowledge structures and external folksonomies. Implications on how social tagging systems can facilitate exploratory search, interactive information retrievals, knowledge exchange, and other higher-level cognitive and learning activities are discussed.",

    "abstract": "We consider practices that sustain social and physical environments beyond those dominating sustainable HCI discourse. We describe links between walking, sociality, and using resources in a case study of community-based, solar, cellphone charging in villages in South Africa's Eastern Cape. Like 360 million rural Africans, inhabitants of these villages are poor and, like 25% and 92% of the world, respectively, do not have domestic electricity or own motor vehicles. We describe nine practices in using the charging stations we deployed. We recorded 700 people using the stations, over a year, some regularly. We suggest that the way we frame practices limits insights about them, and consider various routines in using and sharing local resources to discover relations that might also feature in charging. Specifically, walking interconnects routines in using, storing, sharing and sustaining resources, and contributes to knowing, feeling, wanting and avoiding as well as to different aspects of sociality, social order and perspectives on sustainability. Along the way, bodies acquire literacies that make certain relationalities legible. Our study shows we cannot assert what sustainable practice means a priori and, further, that detaching practices from bodies and their paths limits solutions, at least in rural Africa. Thus, we advocate a more “alongly” integrated approach to data about practices.",

In war environments however, societal trust can be affected and people may develop distrust of the institutions and associated individuals that provide and resolve breakdowns in infrastructure. This article reports on an ethnographic study of the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) by citizens experiencing ongoing disruption in a conflict zone. We conducted 90 semistructured interviews with Iraqi civilians who experienced the 2 nd Gulf War beginning in March 2003. We show how citizens used ICTs to continuously resolve breakdowns in infrastructure during ongoing disruption caused by the conflict, by creating new, reliable technology-mediated social arrangements that enabled people to maintain daily routines for travel, education, and obtaining information. We then discuss new ways to think about infrastructure and implications for the disaster relief effort.",

    "abstract": "This article presents an empirical comparison of four models from manual control theory on their ability to model targeting behaviour by human users using a mouse: McRuer’s Crossover, Costello’s Surge, second-order lag (2OL), and the Bang-bang model. Such dynamic models are generative, estimating not only movement time, but also pointer position, velocity, and acceleration on a moment-to-moment basis. We describe an experimental framework for acquiring pointing actions and automatically fitting the parameters of mathematical models to the empirical data. We present the use of time-series, phase space, and Hooke plot visualisations of the experimental data, to gain insight into human pointing dynamics. We find that the identified control models can generate a range of dynamic behaviours that captures aspects of human pointing behaviour to varying degrees. Conditions with a low index of difficulty (ID) showed poorer fit because their unconstrained nature leads naturally to more behavioural variability. We report on characteristics of human surge behaviour (the initial, ballistic sub-movement) in pointing, as well as differences in a number of controller performance measures, including overshoot, settling time, peak time, and rise time . We describe trade-offs among the models. We conclude that control theory offers a promising complement to Fitts’ law based approaches in HCI, with models providing representations and predictions of human pointing dynamics, which can improve our understanding of pointing and inform design.",

This article presents the design and construction of such a system.

    "abstract": "Our surroundings are becoming infused with sensors measuring a variety of data streams about the environment, people and objects. Such data can be used to make the spaces that we inhabit responsive and interactive. Personal data in its different forms are one important data stream that such spaces are designed to respond to. In turn, one stream of personal data currently attracting high levels of interest in the HCI community is physiological data (e.g., heart rate, electrodermal activity), but this has seen little consideration in building architecture or the design of responsive environments. In this context, we developed a prototype mapping a single occupant’s respiration to its size and form, while it also sonifies their heartbeat. The result is a breathing building prototype, formative trials of which suggested that it triggers behavioral and physiological adaptations in inhabitants without giving them instructions and it is perceived as a relaxing experience. In this paper, we present and discuss the results of a controlled study of this prototype, comparing three conditions: the static prototype, regular movement and sonification and a biofeedback condition, where the occupant’s physiological data directly drives the prototype and presents this data back to them. The study confirmed that the biofeedback condition does indeed trigger behavioral changes and changes in participants’ physiology, resulting in lower respiration rates as well as higher respiration amplitudes, respiration to heart rate coherence and lower frequency heart rate variability. Self-reported state of relaxation is more dependent on inhabitant preferences, their knowledge of physiological data and whether they found space to ‘let go’. We conclude with a discussion of ExoBuilding as an immersive but also sharable biofeedback training interface and the wider potential of this approach to making buildings adapt to their inhabitants.",

We empirically validate the model with data gathered from 603 customers of a telecommunication operator, and find that: (1) extroversion , conscientiousness , and intellect have a significant impact on customer satisfaction—positively for the first two traits and negatively for the latter; (2) extroversion positively influences mobile phone usage; and (3) extroversion and conscientiousness positively influence the users' perceived usability of mobile services. Interestingly, usability has the strongest positive impact on satisfaction, whereas mobile phone usage has a negative impact on satisfaction.

    "abstract": "Older adults are a notable group among the exponentially growing population of online health information consumers. In order to better support older adults’ health-related information seeking on the Internet, it is important to understand how they judge the credibility of such information when compared to younger users. We conducted two laboratory studies to explore how the credibility cues in message contents, website features, and user-generated comments differentially impact younger (19 to 26 years of age) and older adults’ (58 to 80 years of age) credibility judgments. Results from the first experiment showed that older adults were less sensitive to the credibility cues in message contents and those in website features than younger adults. Verbal protocol analysis revealed that these differences could be caused by the higher tendency of older adults to passively accept web information, and their lack of deliberation on its quality and attention towards contextual web features (e.g., design look, source identity). In the second experiment, we studied how credibility cues from user reviews might differentially impact older and younger adults’ credibility judgments of online health information. Results showed that consistent credibility cues in user reviews and message contents could facilitate older adults’ credibility judgments. When the two were inconsistent, older adults, as compared to younger ones, were less swayed by highly appraising user reviews given to low credibility information. These results provided important implications for designing health information technologies that better fit the older population.",

The RDM framework includes factors related to the self, poster, and disclosure context (i.e., relational, temporal, social). Our findings include how people's decisions are complicated by balancing their own needs (e.g., privacy, wellbeing) as well as the posters’ (e.g., support) when seeing what they consider sensitive posts on social media. We identify empirically grounded insights and information that social media designs could surface to support both potential disclosers and responders.

In an HCI course, we have been exploring a studio-based learning activity called the prototype walkthrough , in which a student project team simulates its evolving user interface prototype while a student audience member acts as a test user. The audience is encouraged to ask questions and provide feedback. We have observed that prototype walkthroughs create excellent conditions for learning about user interface design. In order to better understand the educational value of the activity, we performed a content analysis of a video corpus of 16 prototype walkthroughs held in two HCI courses. We found that the prototype walkthrough discussions were dominated by relevant design issues. Moreover, mirroring the justification behavior of the expert instructor, students justified over 80 percent of their design statements and critiques, with nearly one-quarter of those justifications having a theoretical or empirical basis. Our findings suggest that PWs provide valuable opportunities for students to actively learn HCI design by participating in authentic practice, and provide insight into how such opportunities can be best promoted.",

    "abstract": "Managing the privacy of online information can be a complex task often involving the configuration of a variety of settings. For example, Facebook users determine which audiences have access to their profile information and posts, how friends can interact with them through tagging, and how others can search for them—and many more privacy tasks. In most cases, the default privacy settings are permissive and appear to be designed to promote information sharing rather than privacy. Managing privacy online can be complex and often users do not change defaults or use granular privacy settings. In this article, we investigate whether default privacy settings on social network sites could be more customized to the preferences of users. We survey users' privacy attitudes and sharing preferences for common SNS profile items. From these data, we explore using audience characterizations of profile items to quantify fit scores that indicate how well default privacy settings represent user privacy preferences. We then explore the fit of various schemes, including examining whether privacy attitude segmentation can be used to improve default settings. Our results suggest that using audience characterizations from community data to create default privacy settings can better match users' desired privacy settings.",

To understand what makes a gesture expressive, we need to consider not only its spatial placement and orientation but also its dynamics and the mechanisms enacting them. We start by defining gesture and gesture expressivity, and then we present fundamental aspects of muscle activity and ways to capture information through electromyography and mechanomyography. We present pilot studies that inspect the ability of users to control spatial and temporal variations of 2D shapes and that use muscle sensing to assess expressive information in gesture execution beyond space and time. This leads us to the design of a study that explores the notion of gesture power in terms of control and sensing. Results give insights to interaction designers to go beyond simplistic gestural interaction, towards the design of interactions that draw on nuances of expressive gesture.",

We draw from four empirical studies and two case studies to contribute descriptions of the 11 everyday transportation models currently used by residents of low-income and underserved communities to enhance their access to health-enhancing resources. These models fell into personal, private, public, and interpersonal categories. We contribute insights regarding the following barriers and facilitators associated with these models: (1) affordability; (2) individual capabilities; (3) interpersonal trust, care and/or reciprocity; (4) trust in technology; (5) service availability/eligibility; (6) spatial and temporal matches; (7) match between transportation mode and physical needs; (8) service reliability and quality; and (9) infrastructure access. To address these barriers and build on these facilitators, we contribute six supportive policy and design principles. Operationalizing these principles, we propose four new ICT-enhanced models: (1) smart jitneys; (2) generalized, favor-based models; (3) expanded resource pooling; and (4) transportation clubs. The focus of these models on socio-technical integration with current capabilities and resources holds promise for enhancing access to jobs, food, and health care for residents of low-income communities.",

Envy occurs when individuals compare themselves unfavorably to others and desire to benefit from the others’ advantage. In both cases, these emotions motivate people to act and change the status quo: following guilt, people try to make amends for the perceived transgression, and following envy, people try to harm envied others. In this article, we present two experiments that study participants’ experience of guilt and envy when engaging in social decision making with machines and humans. The results showed that, though experiencing the same level of envy, people felt considerably less guilt with machines than with humans. These effects occurred both with subjective and behavioral measures of guilt and envy, and in three different economic games: public goods, ultimatum, and dictator game. This poses an important challenge for human-computer interaction because, as shown here, it leads people to systematically exploit machines, when compared to humans. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for the design of human-machine interaction systems that hope to achieve the kind of efficiency -- cooperation, fairness, reciprocity, etc. -- we see in human-human interaction.",

The level of system autonomy plays a vital role in the development of smart systems as it profoundly affects how people and these systems interact with each other. However, to date, there are very few studies on human interaction with such systems. This paper presents findings from two field studies where two different prototypes for automating energy tariff-switching were developed and evaluated in the wild. Both prototypes offer flexible autonomy by which users can shift the system's level of autonomy among three options: suggestion-only, semi-autonomy, and full autonomy, whenever they like. Our findings based on thematic analysis show that flexible autonomy is a promising way to sustain users' engagement with smart systems, despite their occasional mistakes. The findings also suggest that users take responsibility for the undesired outcomes of automated actions when delegation of autonomy can be adjusted flexibly.",

In such situations, two or more people can have conflicting privacy preferences; thus, an appropriate sharing policy may not be apparent. We identify such situations as multiuser privacy scenarios . Current approaches propose finding a sharing policy through preference aggregation. However, studies suggest that users feel more confident in their decisions regarding sharing when they know the reasons behind each other’s preferences. The goals of this paper are (1) understanding how people decide the appropriate sharing policy in multiuser scenarios where arguments are employed, and (2) developing a computational model to predict an appropriate sharing policy for a given scenario. We report on a study that involved a survey of 988 Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) users about a variety of multiuser scenarios and the optimal sharing policy for each scenario. Our evaluation of the participants’ responses reveals that contextual factors, user preferences, and arguments influence the optimal sharing policy in a multiuser scenario. We develop and evaluate an inference model that predicts the optimal sharing policy given the three types of features. We analyze the predictions of our inference model to uncover potential scenario types that lead to incorrect predictions, and to enhance our understanding of when multiuser scenarios are more or less prone to dispute.",

Thereafter, we illustrate the application of OwI's through the design case of Fizzy, a robotic ball used to stimulate hospitalized children to engage in physical play.

Following this quantifiable decision making, users are allowed to refine several decision factors in order to make decisions of high quality and with low difficulty levels. A case study of driving route selection is used to set up an experiment to test our hypotheses. In this study, GSR features exhibit the best performance in indexing decision quality.

By drawing from self-assessment theories in psychology, we show that crowd workers often lack awareness about their true level of competence. Due to this, although workers intend to maintain a high reputation, they tend to participate in tasks that are beyond their competence. We reveal the diversity of individual worker competencies, and make a case for competence-based pre-selection in crowdsourcing marketplaces. We show the implications of flawed self-assessments on real-world microtasks, and propose a novel worker pre-selection method that considers accuracy of worker self-assessments. We evaluated our method in a sentiment analysis task and observed an improvement in the accuracy by over 15%, when compared to traditional performance-based worker pre-selection. Similarly, our proposed method resulted in an improvement in accuracy of nearly 6% in an image validation task. Our results show that requesters in crowdsourcing platforms can benefit by considering worker self-assessments in addition to their performance for pre-selection.",

Learning to recognize, modify, and regulate brain states is critical to all children's development and can improve learning, and emotional and mental health outcomes. How can we design usable and effective NF BCIs that help children learn and practice brain state self-regulation? Our contribution is a list of challenges for this emerging design space and a conceptual framework that addresses those challenges. The framework is composed of five interrelated strong concepts that we adapted from other design spaces. We derived the concepts reflectively, theoretically, and empirically through a design research process in which we created and evaluated a NF BCI, called Mind-Full , designed to help children living in Nepal who had suffered from complex trauma learn to self-regulate anxiety and attention. We add rigor to our derivation methodology by horizontally and vertically grounding our concepts, that is, relating them to similar concepts in the literature and instantiations in other artifacts. We illustrate the generative power of the concepts and the inter-relationships between them through the description of two new NF BCIs we created using the framework for urban and indigenous children with anxiety and attentional challenges. We then show the versatility of our framework by describing how it inspired and informed the conceptual design of three NF BCIs for different types of self-regulation: selective attention and working memory, pain management, and depression. Last, we discuss the contestability, defensibility, and substantiveness of our conceptual framework in order to ensure rigor in our research design process.

Leveraging this perspective, we propose the use of design-based implementation research as a potential approach in identified learning ecologies, given its emphasis on long-term engagement with multiple stakeholders in the learning process.

Such feedback is easy to compute but might not provide the student enough help. Our first contribution is a novel way to automatically compute alternative conceptual hints. Our second contribution is a rigorous evaluation of feedback with 377 students. We find that providing either counterexamples or hints is judged as helpful, increases student perseverance, and can improve problem completion time.

Yet, the currently received analysis is incomplete and unsatisfactory: There is no explicit communication model for pointing; there is a confusion between central concepts of capacity (a mathematical limit), throughput (an average performance measure), and bandwidth (a physical quantity); and there is also a confusion between source and channel coding so that Shannon’s Theorem 17 can be misinterpreted. We develop an information-theoretic model for pointing tasks where the index of difficulty (ID) is the expression of both a source entropy and a zero-error channel capacity. Then, we extend the model to include misses at rate ε and prove that ID should be adjusted to (1−ε)ID. Finally, we reflect on Shannon’s channel coding theorem and argue that only minimum movement times, not performance averages, should be considered.",

We then examine how the imminent availability and potential adoption of consumer VR HMDs could affect preferences toward how synchronous at-a-distance media consumption is conducted, in a laboratory study of 12 pairs, by enhancing media immersion and supporting embodied telepresence for communication. Finally, we discuss the implications these studies have for the near-future of consumer synchronous at-a-distance media consumption. When combined, these studies begin to explore a design space regarding the varying ways in which at-a-distance media consumption can be supported and experienced (through music, TV content, augmenting existing TV content for immersion, and immersive VR content), what factors might influence usage and adoption and the implications for supporting communication and telepresence during media consumption.",

    "abstract": "The human body has unique electrical characteristics. These characteristics have been investigated in various studies in human-computer interaction (HCI) and related research fields. Such studies include applications for using the body as a conductive lead for transmission or electric field sensing and activating human muscles or organs. However, electricity is not completely safe for the human body; therefore, to avoid harming users, careful consideration is essential when developing such devices. The knowledge required for such consideration is spread throughout a large number research fields, and it can be difficult for researchers in the HCI field to comprehend all of them. The purpose of this article is to support researchers in developing systems that apply electricity to the human body and to serve as a basis for further research. This article reviews previous research pertaining to HCI in which users come into contact with electricity. In addition, considerations of how and where this type of research can be expanded, along with guidelines grounded in other fields for designing systems safely and addressing ethical concerns, are presented. An understanding of the field and of the related safety issues will enhance the understanding of limitations and potential and can clarify the design space.",

In this article, we set the standard by analysing how the major affective factors in chronic pain (pain, fear/anxiety, and low/depressed mood) interfere with everyday physical functioning. Further, based on discussion of the modality that should be used to track these states to enable technology to address them, we investigated the possibility of using movement behaviour to automatically detect the states. Using two body movement datasets on people with chronic pain, we show that movement behaviour enables very good discrimination between two emotional distress levels (F1=0.86), and three pain levels (F1=0.9). Performance remained high (F1=0.78 for two pain levels) with a reduced set of movement sensors. Finally, in an overall discussion, we suggest how technology-provided encouragement and awareness can be personalised given the capability to automatically monitor the relevant states, towards addressing the barriers that they pose. In addition, we highlight movement behaviour features to be tracked to provide technology with information necessary for such personalisation.",

We think that a different take, focusing on the internal aspects of change, may integrate and extend what has been done using this behavioral model. We conducted 20 interviews exploring how individuals live, account for, and manage life changes. Then, we outlined five tentative patterns we identified across different kinds of changes reported by the interviewees, pointing out that change might be internalistic, multiple, intentional, holistic, and continuous. This led us to propose a set of design considerations for the evolution of the current behavior change technologies. Finally, we suggested some preliminary lines of future research, which aim to open the design space of technologies for change.",

    "abstract": "Since the introduction of the iconic Aware Home project [39] in 1999, the notion of “living laboratory” has been taken up and developed in HCI research. Many of the underpinning assumptions have evolved over the past two decades in various directions, while the same nomenclature is employed—inevitably in ambiguous ways. This contribution seeks to elicit an organized understanding of what we talk about and when we talk about living lab studies in HCI. This is accomplished through the methods of discourse analysis [66, 69], a combination of coding, hypothesis generation, and inferential statistics on the coded data. Analysing the discursive context within which the term living laboratory (or lab) appears in 152 SIGCHI and TOCHI articles, we extracted five divergent strands with overlapping but distinct conceptual frameworks, labeled as “Visited Places,” “Instrumented Places,” “Instrumented People,” “Lived-in Places,” and “Innovation Spaces.” In the first part of this article, we describe in detail the method and outcome of our analysis that draws out the five strands. Building on the results of the first part, in the second part of this article, each of the five types of living lab is discussed using some of the prototypical examples of that kind presented in the literature. Finally, we discuss the raison d’être and future position of the living lab as a method within HCI research and design and in relation to advances in sensing technologies and the emerging world of intelligent built environments (e.g., smart city and smart home).",

Over the course of 20 months, we developed a participatory socio-technical process designed to create collaborative spaces between communities and institutions to re-envision and re-shape the city's public parks service.

Our process and the resulting analysis expose the practical complexities of transformation and co-creation processes and the troubles that come with opening spaces for wider participation within highly contested and political settings.

In an initial online survey ( N = 227), we assessed HMD owners’ demographics, their VR setups and their attitudes toward remote participation. We then identified different approaches to running remote studies and conducted two case studies for an in-depth understanding. We synthesize our findings into a framework for remote VR studies, discuss strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches, and derive best practices.

    "abstract": "Voice assistants have become hugely popular in the home as domestic and entertainment devices. Recently, there has been a move towards developing them for work settings. For example, Alexa for Business and IBM Watson for Business were designed to improve productivity, by assisting with various tasks, such as scheduling meetings and taking minutes. However, this kind of assistance is largely limited to planning and managing user's work. How might they be developed to do more by way of empowering people at work? Our research is concerned with achieving this by developing an agent with the role of a facilitator that assists users during an ongoing task. Specifically, we were interested in whether the modality in which the agent interacts with users makes a difference: How does a voice versus screen-based agent interaction affect user behavior? We hypothesized that voice would be more immediate and emotive, resulting in more fluid conversations and interactions. Here, we describe a user study that compared the benefits of using voice versus screen-based interactions when interacting with a system incorporating an agent, involving pairs of participants doing an exploratory data analysis task that required them to make sense of a series of data visualizations. The findings from the study show marked differences between the two conditions, with voice resulting in more turn-taking in discussions, questions asked, more interactions with the system and a tendency towards more immediate, faster-paced discussions following agent prompts. We discuss the possible reasons for why talking and being prompted by a voice assistant may be preferable and more effective at mediating human-human conversations and we translate some of the key insights of this research into design implications.",

    "abstract": "In the development of robotics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for healthcare, human-centered approaches seek to meet the requirements of healthcare practice and address social and ethical aspects proactively. In this work, an important but neglected aspect of human-computer interaction (HCI) is how engineers understand and envision the healthcare context. Drawing on insights from STS on engineers’ imaginaries and their role in shaping research and development of new technologies, we propose engineers’ imaginaries of healthcare as a point of analysis and intervention for ethical and social aspects of AI and robotics for healthcare. To illustrate the utility of this lens, we use it to on report a case study of an engineering project that develops robotic and AI applications for healthcare. We followed and sought to advance an embedded ethics and social science approach, where ethicists and social scientists accompanied this engineering project using direct interdisciplinary collaboration, observations, and in-depth qualitative interviews with the project’s engineers (n = 18). We analyze how the engineers imagine healthcare as an environment for robots, healthcare workers as potential users, and healthcare practices, and how these imaginaries connect to the design narratives that guide their work. Our findings provide pertinent input for HCI, STS, and engineering ethics related to healthcare AI and robotics, as they speak to prevalent narratives of “assistance” systems, aspects of how human healthcare practices are reframed and valued in the face of new technologies, questions of division of labor between machines and healthcare practitioners, and the implications of ‘acceptance’ as a frame for user-centered design.",

Then we demonstrated the challenges and potentials of leveraging user actions to help predict notification preferences. Specifically, we showed that a model personalized using user actions achieved a performance gain of 39% than a generic model. This improvement is similar to the 42% performance gain using labels solicited from the user while using observable user actions causes no extra disruption.",

Here we contribute the first end-to-end system for analogical search on scientific articles and evaluate its effectiveness with scientists’ own problems. Using a human-in-the-loop AI system as a probe we find that our system facilitates creative ideation, and that ideation success is mediated by an intermediate level of matching on the problem abstraction (i.e., high versus low). We also demonstrate a fully automated AI search engine that achieves a similar accuracy with the human-in-the-loop system.

We call these conversations, polylogues, of which the aim is to co-speculate on a range of new possible relations by which to consider living with technological things. The contributions of our article are two-fold. Firstly, through our polylogues, we offer descriptions of three relations with things. These include (1) non-anthropocentric care: care that is non-anthropocentric and existential; (2) non-presumptive relations: not-knowing in relating to and engaging with things; and (3) ideologized relations: ideologies that frame relations with technologies.

    "abstract": "Technology-supported movement learning has received increased attention in HCI. Previous design research has mostly focused on individual experiences, even though the social and situated context is essential to movement learning practices. Based on the experiences from two design projects in the fitness domain featuring open-ended biofeedback artefacts, we propose Intercorporeal Biofeedback as a strong concept to support the design and use of biofeedback in such practices. We ground the concept in situated movement learning theory, phenomenology of social cognition, and HCI work on biofeedback. We articulate four key characteristics of intercorporeal biofeedback: it provides participants with a shared frame of reference , upon which they engage in fluid meaning allocation and use it to guide attention and action , becoming an interactional resource . Intercorporeal biofeedback can serve to guide future design work for situated, social movement practices.",

However, we know little about how impacted individuals approach their reproductive privacy in this new landscape. We conducted interviews with 15 individuals who may get/were pregnant to address this gap. While nearly all reported deleting period tracking apps, they were not willing to go much further, even while acknowledging the risks of generating data. Quite a few considered a more inhospitable, Handmaid's Tale like climate in which their medical history and movements would put them in legal peril but felt that, by definition, this reality was insuperable, and also that they were not the target—the notion that privileged location, stage of life did not make them the focus of government or vigilante efforts. We also found that certain individuals (often younger and/or with reproductive risks) were more attuned to the need to modify their technology or equipped to employ high and low-tech strategies. Using an intersectional lens, we discuss implications for media advocacy and propose privacy intermediation to frame our thinking about reproductive privacy.",

Few prior studies explore the lived experiences of non-engagers, because reaching this population is inherently difficult. We present an observational inquiry into the barriers to sign-up and early use of a DMHI, along with reasons for initial interest in the DMHI. We collected 205 online questionnaire responses and 20 interviews from self-referring participants across four healthcare ecosystems in the UK and US. Questionnaire results revealed that uncertainty about DMHI usefulness and usability were the main barriers to uptake, whereas forgetting about it, not finding time for it and not finding it useful were the main barriers to early engagement. Participants reported multiple reasons for considering the DMHI, reflecting the contextual, subjective nature of mental health. Our thematic analysis generated themes around (1) the need for human connection, (2) the impact of self-stigma on help-seeking, (3) the lack of knowledge around DMHIs and psychological therapy, (4) the desire for personally relevant care, and (5) the fluctuating, perennial nature of mental health. We discuss implications for DMHI design, implementation and future research, as well as transdisciplinary opportunities.",

In this article, we first chart the design space of feedforward in VR and illustrate how to design feedforward for specific VR interactions. We discuss starting the feedforward, previewing actions and outcomes, and returning the virtual world to its state before the feedforward. Second, we implement three real-world VR applications to show how feedforward can be applied to multistep interactions, perceived interactivity, and discoverability. Third, we conduct an evaluation of the design space with 14 VR experts to understand its usefulness. Finally, we summarize the findings of our work on VR feedforward in 15 guidelines.",

Using latent profile analysis, we identify 5 distinct patterns of motivation in technology use — “motivational profiles” — associated with significant differences in need satisfaction, affect, and usability. Users’ descriptions of these experiences also reveal qualitative differences between profiles: from intentional, purposive engagement, to compulsive use which users themselves consider unhealthy. Our results complicate exclusively positive notions of intrinsic motivation, and clarify how extrinsic motivation can contribute to positive UX. Based on these findings we identify open questions for UX and SDT: addressing “hedonic amotivation” — negative experiences in activities which are intrinsically motivated but not otherwise valued — and “design for internalisation” — scaffolding healthy and sustainable patterns of engagement over time.",

Prior work has taxonomized these ACDPs, but we have yet to measure how the presence of ACDPs impacts perceived distraction nor how mechanisms that suppress ACDPs reduce distraction. We conducted a two-week, mixed-methods field study with 29 participants to model how people get distracted when browsing social media websites, and how ACDPs might play a role. In the first week of the study, we sample participants’ in-situ perceptions of distraction, subjective perceptions of the browsing session (e.g., satisfaction), and the presence/absence of ACDPs. Participants reported feeling distracted 28% of the time, and that subjective perceptions and some ACDPs (e.g., notifications) highly correlated with when they felt distracted. In the second week of the study, participants were given access to Purpose Mode — a browser extension that allows users to “toggle off” ACDPs. Participants reported feeling distracted only 7% of the time and spent 21 fewer daily minutes browsing these websites. We discovered that Purpose Mode empowered users to feel more in control over their social media browsing and made participants feel less irritated and frustrated.",

This study uniquely grounds the AI design insights in the comprehensive characterisation of diagnostic work across multiple geographical and institutional contexts. Building on ideas articulated by interviewed radiologists (N=18), we conceptualised five visions that transcend the traditional notions of AI support. These visions emphasise that the clinical usefulness of AI-based systems depends on their configurability and flexibility across three dimensions: type of clinical site, expertise of medical professionals, and situational and patient contexts. Addressing these dependencies requires expanding the clinical AI design space by envisioning futures rooted in the realities of practice rather than solely following the trajectory of AI development.",

Yet we know relatively little about how, why, and when funding outcomes are impacted by signaling between funders. We conduct two studies of \\(N=500\\) and \\(N=750\\) participants involved in crowdfunding to investigate the effect of “crowd signals,” i.e., certain characteristics deduced from the amounts and timing of contributions, on the decision to fund. In our first study, we find that, under a variety of conditions, contributions of heterogeneous amounts arriving at varying time intervals are significantly more likely to be selected than homogeneous contribution amounts and times. The impact of signaling is strongest among participants who are susceptible to social influence. The effect is remarkably general across different project types, fundraising goals, participant interest in the projects, and participants’ altruistic attitudes. Our second study using less strict controls indicates that the role of crowd signals in decision-making is typically unrecognized by participants. Our results underscore the fundamental nature of social signaling in crowdfunding. They highlight the importance of designing around these crowd signals and inform user strategies both on the project creator and funder side .",

However, existing prompt engineering instructions often lack focused training on requirement articulation and instead tend to emphasize increasingly automatable strategies (e.g., tricks like adding role-plays and “think step-by-step”). To address the gap, we introduce Requirement-Oriented Prompt Engineering (ROPE), a paradigm that focuses human attention on generating clear, complete requirements during prompting. We implement ROPE through an assessment and training suite that provides deliberate practice with LLM-generated feedback. In a randomized controlled experiment with 30 novices, ROPE significantly outperforms conventional prompt engineering training (20% vs. 1% gains), a gap that automatic prompt optimization cannot close. Furthermore, we demonstrate a direct correlation between the quality of input requirements and LLM outputs. Our work paves the way to empower more end-users to build complex LLM applications.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive models are computer programs that simulate human performance of cognitive skills. They have been useful to HCI by predicting task times, by assisting users, and by acting as surrogate users. If cognitive models could interact with the same interfaces that users do, the models would be easier to develop and would be easier to apply as interface testers. This approach can be encapsulated as a cognitive model interface management system (CMIMS), which is analogous to and based on a user interface management system (UIMS). We present five case studies using three different UIMSes. These show how models can interact with interfaces using an interaction mechanism that is designed to apply to all interfaces generated within a UIMS. These interaction mechanisms start to support and constrain performance in the same ways that human performance is supported and constrained by interaction. Most existing UIMSes can and should be extended to create CMIMSes, and models can and should use CMIMSes to look at larger and more complex tasks. CMIMSes will help to further exploit the synergy between the disciplines of cognitive modeling and HCI by supporting cognitive models as users.",

    "abstract": "The Hyperbolic Tree is a focus + context information visualization that has been developed to amplify users' ability to navigate large tree-structured information systems. Information scent is a theoretical construct that captures one kind of interaction between task and display. Information scent is provided by task-relevant display cues, such as node labels on a tree that influence a user's visual search behavior and navigation decisions. An empirical Accuracy of Scent (AOS) score was developed to characterize a set of tasks that required users to find (Retrieval Tasks) or compare (Comparison Tasks) information in tree structures. Two experiments investigated the effect of information scent (tasks with different AOS scores) on performance with the Hyperbolic Tree Browser and the Microsoft Windows File Browser, which is a widely available conventional browser. Experiment 1 found no overall difference in performance time between the two browsers, but did reveal a marginal interaction of information scent with browser performance on Retrieval Tasks. On high AOS tasks the Hyperbolic showed faster performance, but on low AOS tasks the Windows File Browser showed faster performance. Experiment 2 focused only on the Retrieval tasks and revealed that Hyperbolic Tree users examined more tree nodes at a faster rate and visually searched through the tree hierarchy at a faster rate than users of a Windows File Browser lookalike, however, visual search paths were shortened in dense areas of the Hyperbolic Tree display when information scent was low. Two processes appear to affect visual search in the Hyperbolic display: strong information scent improves visual search, and the crowding of targets in a compressed region degrades visual search especially when there is weak information scent.",

    "abstract": "Communication theories and technology have tended to focus on extended, formal meetings and have neglected a prevalent and vital form of workplace communication—namely, lightweight communication. Unlike formal, extended meetings, lightweight interaction is brief, informal, unplanned, and intermittent. We analyze naturalistic data from a study of work-place communication and derive five design criteria for lightweight interaction systems. These criteria require that systems for lightweight interaction support conversational tracking, rapid connection , the ability to leave a message, context management, and shared real-time objects . Using these criteria, we evaluate existing interpersonal communications technologies. We then describe an implementation of a system (TeleNotes) that is designed to support lightweight interaction by meeting these criteria. The interface metaphor allows communications to be based around desktop objects, resembling “sticky notes.” These objects are also organized into “desktop piles” to support conversational threads and provide mechanisms for initiating real-time audio, video, and application sharing. We conducted informal user testing of several system prototypes. Based on our findings, outstanding issues concerning theory and systems design for communication systems are outlined—in particular, with regard to the issue of managing conversations over time.",

    "abstract": "This research investigates the role of interface manipulation style on reflective cognition and concept learning through a comparison of the effectiveness of three verisons of a software application for learning two-dimensional transformation geometry. The three versions respectively utilize a Direct Object Manipulation (DOM) interface in which the user manipulates the visual representation of objects being transformed; a Direct Concept Manipulation (DCM) interface in which the user manipulates the visual representation of the transformation being applied to the object; and a Reflective Direct Concept Manipulation (RDCM) interface in which the DCM approach is extended with scaffolding. Empirical results of a study showed that grade-6 students using the RDCM version learned significantly more than those using the DCM version, who is turn learned significantly more than those using the DOM version. Students using the RDCM version had to process information consciously and think harder than those using the DCM and DOM versions. Despite the relative difficulty when using the RDCM interface style, all three groups expressed a similar (positive) level of liking for the software. This research suggests that some of the educational deficiencies of Direct Manipulation (DM) interfaces are not necessarily caused by their “directness,” but by what they are directed at—in this case directness toward objects rather than embedded educational concepts being learned. This paper furthers our understanding of how the DM metaphor can be used in learning- and knowledge-centered software (i.e., learnware) by proposing a new DM metaphor (i.e., DCM), and the incorporation of scaffolding to enhance the DCM approach to promote reflective cognition and deep learning.",

We describe ”Satchel,“ a system that is designed specifically to support the distinctive features of mobile document work. Satchel is designed to meet the following five high-level design goals (1) easy access to document services; (2) timely document access; (3) streamlined user interface; (4) ubiquity; and (5)compliance with security policies. Our current prototype uses a Nokia 9000 Communicator as the mobile device; it communicates to the rest of the Satchel system using wireless communications, both infrared and radio. A fundamental Satchel concept is the use of tokens, or small secure references, to represent documents on the mobile device. The mobile client only transmits small tokens over te wireless channels, leaving the wired network to transmit the contents of documents when, and only when, they are required. Another fundmental Satchel concept is the highly speclized and context-sensitive user interface on the mobile device. The user's interactions ae streamlined because of this specialization and though the use of contextual information gained by uing infrared communications. We report the results of a trial of Satchel that was carried out within our own company, and discuss how well Satchel met our design goals. We call Satchel a ”document appliance” because it provides a streamlined soultion to the problem of remote document access—it aims to support only a limited set of activities, but supports them very well.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the use of a 2D cursor presented to one eye for target selection in Fish Tank VR and other stereo environments. It is argued that 2D selection of 3D objects should be less difficult than 3D selection. Vision research concerning binocular rivalry and the tendency we have to project images onto surfaces suggests that this mode of viewing will not seem particularly unnatural. A Fitt's Law experiment was done to directly compare target acquisition with a one-eyed 2D cursor and target acquisition using a 3D cursor. In both cases we used the same input device (Polhemus Fastrak) so that the device lag and gain parameters were exactly matched. The results show a large improvement in target acquisition time using the 2D cursor. The practical implications of this is that the 2D selection method using a one-eyed cursor in preferable to the 3D selection method. Theoretical implications relate to methods for extending Fitts' Law from the one-dimensional task for which it was designed to 2D and 3D tasks. We conclude that the existing approaches to this problem are not adequate.",

We report the results of an experiment designed to evaluate the effects of these factors on user performance in a table look-up task. Two backgrounds were used. A dynamic moving background was provided by a large screen TV and an untidy bookshelf was used to provide a complex static background. With the TV background large effects were found attributable to both rivalry and visual interference. These two effects were roughly additive. Smaller effects were found with the bookshelf. In conclusion we suggest that monocular transparent HMDs may be unsuitable for use in visually dynamic environments. However when backgrounds are relatively static, having a transparent display may be preferable to having an opaque display.",

We first study the spread of hits in a rapid approximate pointing task at varied distances and movement angles. Consistent with the literature, our results show that the spread of hits along the movement direction deviate more than the spread of hits in the direction perpendicular to movement, and both spreads increase with distance. Based on the distribution of this spread of hits, we propose and validate a new probabilistic model that describes two-dimensional pointing. Unlike previous models, our model accounts for more variables of two-dimensional pointing and can be generalized to any target shape, size, orientation, location, and dimension. In contrast to previous work, which suggests that target height has minimal impact on performance when it is larger than the width, our results show that, even when height is greater than width, it can significantly impact movement time.",

Four modes of TeSS were compared: (1) browsing, (2) conventional boolean retrieval, (3) boolean retrieval based on Venn diagrams, and (4) these three combined. Further, the modes of TeSS were compared to the use of printed manuals. The subjects observed were 87 computing new to them. In the experiment the use of printed manuals is faster and provides answers of higher quality than any of the electronic modes. Therefore, claims about the effectiveness of computer-based text retrieval have to by vary in situations where printed manuals are manageable to the user. Among the modes of TeSS, browsing is the fastest and the one causing the fewest operational errors. On the same two variables, time and operational errors, the Venn diagram mode performs better than conventional boolean retrieval. The combined mode scores worst on the objective performance measures; nonetheless nearly all subject prefer this mode. Concerning the interaction process, the subjects tend to manage the complexities of the information retrieval tasks by issuing series of simple commands and exploiting the interactive capabilities of TeSS. To characterize the dynamics of the interaction process two concepts are introduced; threads and sequences of tactics. Threads in a query sequence describes the continuity during retrieval. Sequences of tactics concern the combined mode and describe how different retrieval modes succeed each other as the retrieval process evolves.",

    "abstract": "The idea of social navigation is to aid users to navigate information spaces through making the collective, aggregated, or individual actions of others visible and useful as a basis for making decisions on where to go next and what to choose. These social markers should also help in turning the navigation experience into a social and pleasurable one rather than the tedious, boring, frustrating, and sometimes even scary experience of a lonely traveler. To evaluate whether it is possible to design for social navigation, we built the food recipe system Kala s. It includes several different forms of aggregated trails of user actions and means of communication between users: recommender system functionality (recommendations computed from others' choices), real-time broadcasting of concurrent user activity in the interface, possibilities to comment and vote on recipes, the number of downloads per recipe, and chatting facilities. Recipe author was also included in the recipe description.Kalas was tried with 302 users during six months, and 73 of the users answered a final questionnaire. The overall impression was that users liked and acted on aggregated trails and navigated differently because of them. 18% of the selected recipes came from the list of recommended recipes. About half of the 73 users understood that recommendations were computed from their own and others actions, while the rest had not reflected upon it or had erroneous beliefs. Interestingly, both groups selected a large proportion of their recipes from the recommendations.Unfortunately, there were not enough users to populate the space at every occasion, and thus both chatting and following other users moving in the space was for the most part not possible, but when possible, users move to the space where most other users could be found. Of the other social textures, users themselves claimed to be most influenced by other users' comments attached to the recipes and less by recipe author or number of downloads. Users are more positive to the possibility of expressing themselves in terms of comments and voting than seeing the comments and votes of others.It was noted that users did not pick more recommended recipes towards the end of the study period when the accuracy of recommendations should have been higher. More or less from the start, they picked recommended recipes and went on doing so throughout the whole period.",

Two studies were conducted to examine what users do when faced with this decision on e-commerce Web sites, and how users go about deciding which method to attempt. An exploratory study revealed a wide distribution of searching and browsing behavior across sites and users. Counter to some predictions, use of the site search functions did not yield faster or more accurate performance in locating products. Questionnaire data suggested that factors relevant to the menu structure, interface element prominence, information scent and user dispositions all influenced the decision of whether to browse or search a site for a product. A second experiment utilizing novel e-commerce sites and allowing for more control of factors found to be important in the first study found that browsing behavior was influenced by both the breadth and information scent of the menus. These results suggest that providing site search should not be used to compensate for poor menu design, and provide further evidence regarding the design of effective menu structures.",

The wifsid structure is demonstrated and 4 types of wifsids are analyzed. Developed software applications are to be operated by single-switch activations that are captured through the wifsids, with the employment of several modes of the scanning technique. We also demonstrate the \"Autonomia\" software application, that has been developed according to the specific methodology. The basic snapshots of this application are analyzed, in order to demonstrate how the wifsids cooperate with the scanning process in a user-friendly environment that enables a quadriplegic person to access an ordinary computer system.",

The results show that users of a direct-manipulation interface and a menu-based interface did not differ in the total amount of time used to perform a task. However, with the direct-manipulation interface, more time is devoted to performing motor actions , but this is offset by shorter nonmotor time .

We introduce a “knowledege/usability graph,” which shows the impact of even a smaller amount of knowledge for the user, and the extent to which designers' knowledge may bias their views of usability. Markov models can be built into design tools, and can therefore be made very convenient for designers to utilize.

Subjects used several different displays varying in the amount of detail presented. Frame rate, object location, subject input method, and order of display use were all controlled.

Our view is that the foreground concerns deliberate user activity where the user is attending to the device, while the background is the realm of inattention or split attention, using naturally occurring user activity as an input that allows the device to infer or anticipate user needs. The five questions for sensing systems of Bellotti et al. [2002] proposed as a framework for this special issue, primarily address the foreground, but neglect critical issues with background sensing. To support our perspective, we discuss a variety of foreground and background sensing techniques that we have implemented for sensor-enhanced mobile devices, such as powering on the device when the user picks it up, sensing when the user is holding the device to his ear, automatically switching between portrait and landscape display orientations depending on how the user is holding the device, and scrolling the display using tilt. We also contribute system architecture issues, such as using the foreground/background model to handle cross-talk between multiple sensor-based interaction techniques, and theoretical perspectives, such as a classification of recognition errors based on explicitly considering transitions between the foreground and background. Based on our experiences, we propose design issues and lessons learned for foreground/background sensing systems.",

These are defined as where users can perceive each other (Level 1), individually change the scene (Level 2), or simultaneously act on and manipulate the same object (Level 3). Despite representing the highest level of cooperation, multiuser object manipulation has rarely been studied. This paper describes a behavioral experiment in which the piano movers' problem (maneuvering a large object through a restricted space) was used to investigate object manipulation by pairs of participants in a VE. Participants' interactions with the object were integrated together either symmetrically or asymmetrically. The former only allowed the common component of participants' actions to take place, but the latter used the mean. Symmetric action integration was superior for sections of the task when both participants had to perform similar actions, but if participants had to move in different ways (e.g., one maneuvering him/herself through a narrow opening while the other traveled down a wide corridor) then asymmetric integration was superior. With both forms of integration, the extent to which participants coordinated their actions was poor and this led to a substantial cooperation overhead (the reduction in performance caused by having to cooperate with another person).",

By entering into contractual relationships with service-providers, and by using network-based services, users interact with a larger system ---one that has social and technological components. The operation of the wireless telephone requires the assimilation of heterogeneous sources of information from the device manufacturer, sales people, customer service representatives, marketing people, and members of the popular media, among others, which can easily confound users' understanding of this new class of technology. Opportunities for usability problems therefore scale beyond the handset, as do opportunities for better design. We report the results of a study of 19 novice wireless phone users who were closely tracked for the first 6 weeks after service acquisition. Taking a technology-as-system analytical approach, we describe the wireless telephony system as four socio-technical components: hardware, software, \"netware,\" and \"bizware.\" This particular organization of the system is intended for the practical application of designing for usability.",

However, the dominance of visual design on the Web leaves visually disabled people at a disadvantage. Although assistive technologies, such as screen readers, usually provide basic access to information, the richness of the Web experience is still often lost. In particular, traversing the Web becomes a complicated task since the richness of visual objects presented to their sighted counterparts are neither appropriate nor accessible to visually disabled users. To address this problem, we have proposed an approach called Dante in which Web pages are annotated with semantic information to make their traversal properties explicit. Dante supports usage of different annotation techniques and as a proof-of-concept in this article, pages are annotated manually which when transcoded become rich. We first introduce Dante and then present a user evaluation which compares how visually disabled users perform certain travel-related tasks on original and transcoded versions of Web pages. We discuss the evaluation methodology in detail and present our findings, which provide useful insights into the transcoding process. Our evaluation shows that, in tests with users, document objects transcoded with Dante have a tendency to be much easier for visually disabled users to interact with when traversing Web pages.",

The applications were designed to augment formal conference paper sessions and informal breaks. A mixture of qualitative observation and survey response data are used to frame the impacts from both individual and group perspectives. Respondents reported on their interactions and serendipitous findings of shared interests with other attendees. However, some respondents also identify distracting aspects of the augmentation. Our discussion relates these results to existing theory of group behavior in public places and how these social space augmentations relate to awareness as well as the problem of shared interaction models.",

    "abstract": "As driver distraction from in-vehicle devices becomes an increasingly critical issue, researchers have aimed to establish better scientific understanding of distraction along with better engineering tools to build less distracting devices. This article presents a new system, Distract-R, that allows designers to rapidly prototype and evaluate new in-vehicle interfaces. The core engine of the system relies on a rigorous cognitive model of driver behavior which, when integrated with models of task behavior on the prototyped interfaces, generate predictions of driver performance and distraction. Distract-R allows a designer to prototype basic interfaces, demonstrate possible tasks on these interfaces, specify relevant driver characteristics and driving scenarios, and finally simulate, visualize, and analyze the resulting behavior as generated by the cognitive model. The article includes three modeling studies that demonstrate the system's ability to account for various aspects of driver performance for several types of in-vehicle interfaces. More generally, Distract-R illustrates how cognitive models can be used as internal simulation engines for design tools intended for nonmodelers, with the ultimate goal of helping to understand and predict user behavior in multitasking environments.",

Selected materials from an ethnographically informed study of home life are used to detail the ways in which families contain their clutter in bowls and drawers. Clutter, within these containers, is found to be made up of a heterogeneous collection of things that, for all manner of reasons, hold an ambiguous status in the home. It is shown that bowls and drawers provide a “safe” site of containment for clutter, giving the miscellany of content the “space” to be properly dealt with and classified, or to be left unresolved. The shared but idiosyncratic practices families use to contain their clutter are seen to be one of the ways in which the home, or at least the idea of home, is collectively produced. It is also part of the means by which families come to make their homes distinct and unique. These findings are used to consider what it might mean to design for the home, and to do so in ways that are sensitive to the idiosyncratic systems of household organization. In conclusion, thought is given to how we design for people's ideas of home, and how we might build sites of uncertainty into homes, where physical as well as digital things might coalesce.",

Devices such as Tivo do not simply replace videotapes; TV watching becomes more active as programs are gathered from the schedules, played from a stored collection and fast forwarded and paused during playback. Downloads users exploit the Internet to view shows and movies not broadcast, yet this watching is not fundamentally different from recording shows using a PVR, since both involve selection of shows from a limited range and a wait before the shows can be watched.",

We confirm a strong departure from Fitts' Law for small target acquisition using a mouse and investigate three potential sources of problems: motor accuracy, legibility, and quantization. We find that quantization is not a problem, but both motor and visual sizes are limiting factors. This suggests that small targets should be magnified in both motor and visual space to facilitate pointing. Since performance degrades exponentially as targets get very small, we further advocate the exploration of uniform, target-agnostic magnification strategies. We also confirm Welford's 1969 proposal that motor inaccuracy can be modeled by subtracting a “tremor constant” from target size. We argue for the adoption of this model, rather than Fitts' law, when reflecting on small target acquisition.",

    "abstract": "People’s daily lives have become increasingly sedentary, with extended periods of time being spent in front of a host of electronic screens for learning, work, and entertainment. We present research into the use of an adaptive persuasive technology, which introduces bursts of physical activity into a traditionally sedentary activity: computer game playing. Our game design approach leverages the playfulness and addictive nature of computer games to motivate players to engage in mild physical activity. The design allows players to gain virtual in-game rewards in return for performing real physical activity captured by sensory devices. This article presents a two-stage analysis of the activity-motivating game design approach applied to a prototype game. Initially, we detail the overall acceptance of active games discovered when trialing the technology with 135 young players. Results showed that players performed more activity without negatively affecting their perceived enjoyment of the playing experience. The analysis did discover, however, a lack of balance between the amounts of physical activity carried out by players with various gaming skills, which prompted a subsequent investigation into adaptive techniques for balancing the amount of physical activity performed by players. An evaluation of additional 90 players showed that adaptive techniques successfully overcame the gaming skills dependence and achieved more balanced activity levels. Overall, this work positions activity-motivating games as an approach that can potentially change the way players interact with computer games and lead to healthier lifestyles.",

After developing a taxonomic classification of calibration functions, we examined over 400,000 models and evaluated the validity of several conventional assumptions.

Zero-fidelity simulation develops and invokes the principle of abstraction, focusing on human-information and human-human transfers of meaning, to derive design from work practice. Our principal hypothesis is that crisis responders will experience zero-fidelity simulation as effective simulation of team coordination.

We adapt Herzberg's methodology to analyze 303 events where users felt good or bad about their smartphone and derive factors that may work as hygienes or motivators. We identified technical quality and price as hygienes, and utility and convenience as motivators. These factors do not correspond to those mentioned as typical examples of hygienes and motivators in the UX literature (i.e., instrumental qualities such as usability for hygienes and non-instrumental qualities such as beauty for motivators).

In this study, we report results of a large-scale survey on Chinese Internet users' experiences with Internet censorship. The results show that users' demographic backgrounds, Internet usage experience, and personality influence their attitudes toward censorship. Those who score high on authoritarian personality measures tend to support censorship. Attitudes toward censorship change so that over time it is viewed as more normal, which suggests a “normalization” process.

    "abstract": "Reacting to the discussion on global warming, the HCI community has started to explore the design of tools to support responsible energy consumption. An important part of this research focuses on motivating energy savings by providing feedback tools which present consumption metrics interactively. In this line of work, the configuration of feedback has been mainly discussed using cognitive or behavioral factors. This narrow focus, however, misses a highly relevant perspective for the design of technology that supports sustainable lifestyles: to investigate the multiplicity of forms in which individuals or collectives actually consume energy. In this article, we broaden this focus, by taking a phenomenological lens to study how people use off-the-shelf eco-feedback systems in private households to make energy consumption accountable and explainable. By reconstructing accounting practices, we delineate several constitutive elements of the phenomenon of energy usage in daily life. We complement these elements with a description of the sophisticated methods used by people to organize their energy practices and to give a meaning to their energy consumption. We describe these elements and methods, providing examples coming from the fieldwork and uncovering observed strategies to account for consumption. Based on our results, we provide a critical perspective on existing eco-feedback mechanisms and describe several elements for a design rationale for designing support for responsible energy consumption. We argue that interactive feedback systems should not simply be an end, but rather a resource for the construction of the artful practice of making energy consumption accountable.",

These principles are justified through empirical studies that evaluate the impact of graphical features on task performance. Linear diagrams represent sets using straight line segments, with line overlaps corresponding to set intersections. This study builds on recent empirical research, which establishes that linear diagrams can be superior to prominent set visualization techniques, namely Euler and Venn diagrams. We address the problem of how to best visualize overlapping sets using linear diagrams. To solve the problem, we investigate which graphical features of linear diagrams significantly impact user task performance. To this end, we conducted seven crowdsourced empirical studies involving a total of 1,760 participants. These studies allowed us to identify the following design principles, which significantly aid task performance: use a minimal number of line segments, use guidelines where overlaps start and end, and draw lines that are thin as opposed to thick bars. We also evaluated the following graphical properties that did not significantly impact task performance: color, orientation, and set order. The results are brought to life through a freely available software implementation that automatically draws linear diagrams with user-controlled graphical choices. An important consequence of our research is that users are now able to create effective visualizations of sets automatically, thus improving human--computer interaction.",

We found that BubbleView clicks can both (i) successfully approximate eye fixations on different images, and (ii) be used to rank image and design elements by importance. BubbleView is designed to collect clicks on static images, and works best for defined tasks such as describing the content of an information visualization or measuring image importance. BubbleView data is cleaner and more consistent than related methodologies that use continuous mouse movements. Our analyses validate the use of mouse-contingent, moving-window methodologies as approximating eye fixations for different image and task types.",

    "abstract": "Moving home in later life is an experience born of necessity for many older people. Yet, although a good deal of research has considered how to support “ageing in place,” relatively little attention has been given to the transition of moving to a new home, or how a feeling of belonging is accomplished once there. We present findings from two studies that explore “placing in age.” The first looks at downsizing one's home and the second at living in a residential care home. We reflect on what placing in age means in these two circumstances, and how technology might be used to support it. We highlight the importance of continuity through change and the ability to “design” everyday life. Rather than support for stability or reminiscing about the past, the aim is to address the need for change and to enable the meaningful spending of time now and in the future.",

    "abstract": "People all over the world are regularly affected by disasters and emergencies. Besides official emergency services, ordinary citizens are getting increasingly involved in crisis response work. They are usually present on-site at the place of incident and use social media to share information about the event. For emergency services, the large amount of citizen-generated content in social media, however, means that finding high-quality information is similar to “finding a needle in a haystack”. This article presents an approach to how a dynamic and subjective quality assessment of citizen-generated content could support the work of emergency services. First, we present results of our empirical study concerning the usage of citizen-generated content by emergency services. Based on our literature review and empirical study, we derive design guidelines and describe a concept for dynamic quality measurement that is implemented as a service-oriented web-application “Social Haystack.” Finally, we outline findings of its evaluation and implications thereof.",

    "abstract": "Educational games and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) both support learning by doing, although often in different ways. The current classroom experiment compared a popular commercial game for equation solving, DragonBox and a research-based ITS, Lynnette with respect to desirable educational outcomes. The 190 participating 7th and 8th grade students were randomly assigned to work with either system for 5 class periods. We measured out-of-system transfer of learning with a paper and pencil pre- and post-test of students’ equation-solving skill. We measured enjoyment and accuracy of self-assessment with a questionnaire. The students who used DragonBox solved many more problems and enjoyed the experience more, but the students who used Lynnette performed significantly better on the post-test. Our analysis of the design features of both systems suggests possible explanations and spurs ideas for how the strengths of the two systems might be combined. The study shows that intuitions about what works, educationally, can be fallible. Therefore, there is no substitute for rigorous empirical evaluation of educational technologies.",

This article therefore examines interactional work around the use of money in making financial transactions: we call this moneywork . We report on an empirical study of the patterns of behavior of users of a mixed media (digital and analog) currency that supports mobile device payments—the Bristol Pound—exploring the impacts of its users’ understanding of the systems that underlie these transactions, the technical constraints on their potential for action, their practices of use, and the social interactions that these activities lie within.

We use an image composition model to evaluate picture quality and suggest providing audiovisual feedback to improve users’ aiming position. With our particular framework implementation, blind participants were able to take pictures of similar quality to those taken by low vision participants without assistance. Likewise, our system helped low vision participants take pictures as good as those taken by fully sighted users. Our results also show a positive trend in favor of spoken directions to assist visually impaired users in comparison to tone and silent feedback. Positive usefulness ratings provided by full vision users further suggest that assisted photography has universal appeal.",

Attention checks are often used to mitigate this problem, but, because the roots of inattention are poorly understood, checks often compel attentive contributors to complete unnecessary work. We investigated a potential source of inattentiveness during crowdwork: multitasking. We found that workers switched to other tasks every 5 minutes, on average. There were indications that increasing switch frequency negatively affected performance. To address this, we tested an intervention that encouraged workers to stay focused on our task after multitasking was detected. We found that our intervention reduced the frequency of task switching. It also improves on existing attention checks because it does not place additional demands on workers who are already focused. Our approach shows that crowds can help to overcome some of the limitations of laboratory studies by affording access to naturalistic multitasking behavior.",

We achieve this by first providing a research overview of the development of PD approaches since they originated in the 1970s, identifying different PD generations and associated concepts, contexts, and challenges, and then relating them to current public sector trends. Next, we link the overview to a practical example by presenting a case of applying PD to a civic engagement project that takes place in the Swedish emergency response system. Our example findings sustain previously identified needs to return to broad change processes and balance this with ICT re-configuration and structuration of the collaborative processes, the related stakeholders, and their needs, this time in a context where work tasks and responsibilities are not yet defined, known or experienced among stakeholders. We then suggest methodological ways to handle this by (1) applying an interdisciplinary PD approach, (2) replacing the traditional design group with a combination of various qualitative methods and PD techniques, e.g., focus groups, modified scenario-based future workshops, exercises, and after-action-reviews, and (3) support PD activities with context-specific frameworks. We argue that applying PD concepts to the governance forms that are emerging in resource-constrained public sector organizations poses a number of challenges, many of them relating directly to the unknown character of the work setting and the practical difficulties of involving civil citizens as end-users. However, if they are addressed and handled adequately, making civic engagement initiatives work processes and ICT support to work smoothly, this can contribute to a re-politicization of PD in terms of space, action, and the empowerment of citizens both by enhancing their skills and by having them represented in design activities.",

    "abstract": "Personal data is increasingly collected and used by companies to tailor services to users, and to make financial, employment, and health-related decisions about individuals. When personal data is inappropriately collected or misused, however, individuals may experience violations of their privacy. Historically, government regulators have relied on the concept of risk in energy, aviation and medicine, among other domains, to determine the extent to which products and services may harm the public. To address privacy concerns in government-controlled information technology, government agencies are advocating to adapt similar risk management frameworks to privacy. Despite the recent shift toward a risk-managed approach for privacy, to our knowledge, there are no empirical methods to determine which personal data are most at-risk and which contextual factors increase or decrease that risk. To this end, we introduce an empirical framework in this article that consists of factorial vignette surveys that can be used to measure the effect of different factors and their levels on privacy risk. We report a series of experiments to measure perceived privacy risk using the proposed framework, which are based on expressed preferences, and which we define as an individual's willingness to share their personal data with others given the likelihood of a potential privacy harm. These experiments control for one or more of the six factors affecting an individual's willingness to share their information: data type, computer type, data purpose, privacy harm, harm likelihood, and individual demographic factors, such as age range, gender, education level, ethnicity, and household income. To measure likelihood, we introduce and evaluate a new likelihood scale based on construal level theory in psychology. The scale frames individual attitudes about risk likelihood based on social and physical distance to the privacy harm. The findings include predictions about the extent to which the above factors correspond to risk acceptance, including that perceived risk is lower for induced disclosure harms when compared to surveillance and insecurity harms as defined in Solove's Taxonomy of Privacy. We also found that participants are more willing to share their information when they perceive the benefits of sharing. In addition, we found that likelihood was not a multiplicative factor in computing privacy risk perception, which challenges conventional theories of privacy risk in the privacy and security community.",

The results show that the measurement model is only partially culturally invariant, indicating that social media users in different countries interpret the same instruments in different ways. Also, cross-national comparisons of the structural model show that causal pathways from collective privacy management strategies to privacy-related outcomes vary significantly across countries. The findings suggest significant cultural variations in privacy management practices, both with regard to the conceptualization of its theoretical constructs, and with respect to causal pathways.",

This multi-faceted tool provides opportunities for users to adapt the system to their needs, leading us to refocus the goal of treatment adherence toward a relatively new phenomenon in HCI, concordance, which has not previously been examined in the HCI literature in relation to online mental-health tools. Concordance shares important links with the development of therapeutic alliance, which is centrally important to mental health therapy, and to Self-Determination Theory (SDT), which informed our approach to design. We present a three-month user study, which provides initial encouraging support for both the suitability of concordance as a lens for viewing user engagement and the idea that users can develop a therapeutic alliance with an online support system. This latter result is surprising as the phenomenon of therapeutic alliance generally describes a relationship between client and (human) clinician. Therapeutic alliance has previously been explored for face-to-face groups, and between individuals and online systems, but not for online groups. We show how even automated system behavior can encourage engagement from users and contribute to alliance formation, if the non-human parts of an online system are interactive. We argue that a design approach involving peer/moderator support as well as automated feedback, and which takes account of SDT, can provide support for therapeutic alliance.",

This situation requires VR usability evaluation methods that can be applied quickly, even after a first release of an application. In this article, we describe such an approach, which is fully automated and does not ask users to perform predefined tasks in a fixed test setting. Instead, it works on recordings of the actual usage of a VR application from which it generates task trees. Afterwards, it analyzes these task trees to search for usability smells, i.e., user behavior indicating usability issues. Our approach provides detailed descriptions of the usability issues that have been found and how they can be solved. We performed a large case study to evaluate our approach and show that it is capable of correctly identifying usability issues. Although our approach is applicable for different VR interaction modalities, such as gaze, controller, or hand interaction, it also has limitations. For example, it can detect diverse issues related to user efficiency, but specific misunderstandings of users cannot be uncovered.",

We conducted three studies that focused on the design of custom interactions to understand the mismatches between their processes, tools, and representations. We found that current practices induce unnecessary rework and cause discrepancies between design and implementation. We identified three recurring types of breakdowns: omitting critical details, ignoring edge cases, and disregarding technical limitations. We propose four design principles to create tools that mitigate these problems: Provide multiple viewpoints , maintain a single source of truth , reveal the invisible, and support design by enaction . We applied these principles to create E NACT , a live environment for prototyping touch-based interactions. We conducted two studies to assess E NACT and to compare designer–developer collaboration with E NACT versus current tools.

    "abstract": "With ever more everyday objects becoming “smart” due to embedded processors and communication capabilities, the provisioning of intuitive user interfaces to control smart things is quickly gaining importance. We present a model-based interface description scheme that enables automatic, modality-independent user interface generation. User interface description languages based on our approach carry enough information to suggest intuitive interfaces while still being easily producible for developers. This is enabled by describing the atomic interactive components of a device and capturing the semantics of interactions with the device. We propose a taxonomy of abstract sensing and actuation primitives and present a smartphone application that can act as a ubiquitous device controller. An evaluation of the mobile application in a laboratory setup, home environments, and an educational setting as well as the results of a user study highlight the accessibility of the proposed scheme for application developers and its suitability for controlling smart devices.",

Outreach workers are e-government intermediaries who assist clients with accessing and using e-government online applications, systems, and services. E-government intermediaries are not typical end users; they use e-government systems on behalf of clients, and as such their challenges differ from those of primary users. We detail social and technical aspects of these challenges to develop a nuanced understanding of access and trust in the ecosystems surrounding e-government systems. First, we describe how the practical accomplishment of access involves multiple stakeholders, actors, and practices. Second, we highlight how trust emerges through the e-government intermediaries’ work to project themselves as professional and competent through their technical practice. Last, we propose design implications sensitive to both the social and technical aspects of these challenges.",

    "abstract": "Technology increasingly allows us to capture and revisit rich digital records of our lives, processes which we call Technology-Mediated Memory (TMM). We explore whether TMM alters unmediated remembering and also whether such changes affect psychological well-being. Human memory biases promote well-being by adaptively editing our memories, making them more positive. In contrast, TMM often provides rich records of what people actually did and felt, which could disrupt adaptive edits. To explore this, we developed a smartphone-based personal TMM application, Echo, that allows participants to record and later reflect on everyday events. In a month-long deployment, 64 users made over 3200 recordings and reflections. We found that although Echo TMM alters how we remember, these changes remain adaptive. Instead of compromising adaptive biases, Echo TMM helps well-being and benefits are sustained long-term. Logfile analysis shows that participants use Echo strategically to prospectively edit by initially reporting events positively to anticipate future viewing. Participants also distance themselves from past negative events by reflecting more positively than at recording. We discuss design and theoretical implications.",

Twenty-seven pairs of apprentices in logistics ( N = 54) interacted with an interactive simulation of a warehouse. Their task was to discover efficient design principles for building storehouses. In a between-subjects experimental design, half of the participants used 3D physical shelves, whereas the other half used 2D paper shelves. This manipulation allowed us to control for the “representational effect” of 3D tangibles: the first group saw the warehouse as a small-scale model with realistic shelves, whereas the second group had access to a more abstract layout with rectangular pieces of paper. Both groups interacted with the system in the same way. We found that participants in the first group (i.e., who used 3D realistic shelves) better memorized a warehouse layout, built a more efficient model, and scored higher on a learning test. Additionally, students wore eye-tracking goggles while completing those tasks; preliminary results suggest that 3D interfaces increased joint visual attention, which was found to be a significant predictor for participants’ task performance and learning gains. Implications for designing TUIs in collaborative settings are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Eye tracking systems have greatly improved in recent years, being a viable and affordable option as digital communication channel, especially for people lacking fine motor skills. Using eye tracking as an input method is challenging due to accuracy and ambiguity issues, and therefore research in eye gaze interaction is mainly focused on better pointing and typing methods. However, these methods eventually need to be assimilated to enable users to control application interfaces. A common approach to employ eye tracking for controlling application interfaces is to emulate mouse and keyboard functionality. We argue that the emulation approach incurs unnecessary interaction and visual overhead for users, aggravating the entire experience of gaze-based computer access. We discuss how the knowledge about the interface semantics can help reducing the interaction and visual overhead to improve the user experience. Thus, we propose the efficient introspection of interfaces to retrieve the interface semantics and adapt the interaction with eye gaze. We have developed a Web browser, GazeTheWeb, that introspects Web page interfaces and adapts both the browser interface and the interaction elements on Web pages for gaze input. In a summative lab study with 20 participants, GazeTheWeb allowed the participants to accomplish information search and browsing tasks significantly faster than an emulation approach. Additional feasibility tests of GazeTheWeb in lab and home environment showcase its effectiveness in accomplishing daily Web browsing activities and adapting large variety of modern Web pages to suffice the interaction for people with motor impairment.",

Our study identifies domestic circumstances where background technologies are raised to the foreground, visible devices are hidden, unwanted distractions become desired, and ordinary technologies are integrated into mealtime experiences. We identify four patterns of arrangement between technologies and family members during mealtimes, and we discuss how technologies contribute to mealtime satiety and commensality. Finally, we present implications of our findings and directions for technological advancements focusing on the social and celebratory nature of family mealtimes.",

We used action research, both participating in the organization and studying it. We use the Freirean model of participatory communication theory to unpack the movement-building process of SftP-Atlanta. The Freirean model provides a three-step, iterative process for sustainable movement building: forming a collective identity, moving toward collective action, and engaging in reflexive dialog. We analyze both the perceived strengths and weaknesses of their sociotechnical practices in supporting the organization as they iteratively go through the phases of the Freirean model. Finally, we identify inclusivity , privacy/security , and social translucence as three values desirable for sociotechnical practices of grassroots organizing.",

In this work, we study the question of local decision making in an IML context around feature selection for a sentiment classification task. Specifically, we characterize the utility of interactive feature selection through a combination of human-subjects experiments and computational simulations. We find that, in expectation, interactive modification fails to improve model performance and may hamper generalization due to overfitting. We examine how these trends are affected by the dataset, learning algorithm, and the training set size. Across these factors we observe consistent generalization issues. Our results suggest that rapid iterations with IML systems can be dangerous if they encourage local actions divorced from global context, degrading overall model performance. We conclude by discussing the implications of our feature selection results to the broader area of IML systems and research.",

Hospitals, medical centres and other healthcare organisations are a special case where the challenge is to enable patients and families feel less anxious when waiting. One approach has been to design for distraction – where displays, surfaces, and interactive installations are created to draw visitor's attention away from their immediate thoughts. However, little is known as to how people respond to such interventions. We present the findings of an ethnographic study that examined the social and psychological effects of using distraction as a design principle in a children's hospital reception area. We discuss the challenges of designing to distract, in relation to how it can be combined with other architectural and HCI ones, when developing new human–building interfaces.",

We use quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate how this notion has been used across 35 years of proceedings from the ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing (CHI). Using natural language processing, we extract 53,568 occurrences of the word “interaction” across 4,604 papers. In these occurrences, we categorize 2,668 unique words that modify how “interaction” is used in a sentence. We show that the use of “interaction” is both increasing and diversifying, suggesting the importance of the notion, but also the difficulty in developing theory about interaction. Our findings show that styles of interaction are closely associated with changes in technology and that modalities and characteristics of interaction are becoming more of a topic than specific devices or widgets. Interaction qualities, relating to structure, feel, effectiveness, and efficiency, are consistently prominent, and the quality of novelty is increasingly frequent. From this analysis, we identify open questions about interaction, including how to build knowledge across changing technologies, how to work toward a model of quality for interaction, and what the core of a science of interaction could be.",

    "abstract": "Expressions of territoriality have been positioned as one of the main reasons users alter their behaviors and perceptions of spatiality and sociality while engaging with location-based social networks (LBSN). Despite the potential for this interplay to further our understanding of LBSN usage in the context of identity, very little work has actually been done toward this. Addressing this gap in the literature is one of the chief aims of the article. Drawing on an original 6-week study with 42 participants utilizing a bespoke LBSN entitled “GeoMoments,” our research explores the following: (1) the way that territoriality is linked to self-identity; and (2) how this interplay affects the interactions between users as well as the environments they inhabit. Our findings suggest that participants affirmed their self-identity by selectively posting and claiming ownership of their neighborhood through the LBSN. Here, the locative decisions are made related to risk, hierarchies, and the users’ relationship to the area. This practice then led participants to discover and interact with the digital information overlaying their physical environments in a playful manner. These interactions demonstrate the perceived power structures that are facilitated by identity claims over a virtual area. In the main, our results reaffirm that territoriality is a central concept in understanding LBSN use, while also drawing attention to the temporality involved in user-to-user and user-to-place interactions pertaining to physical place mediated by LBSN.",

    "abstract": "Women account for over half of the global population, however, continue to be subject to systematic and systemic disadvantage, particularly in terms of access to health and education. At every intersection, where systemic inequality accounts for greater loss of life or limitations on full and healthy living, women are more greatly impacted by those inequalities. The design of technologies is no different, the very definition of technology is historically cast in terms of male activities, and advancements in the field are critical to improve women’s quality of life. This article views HCI, a relatively new field, as well positioned to act critically in the ways that technology serve, refigure, and redefine women’s bodies. Indeed, the female body remains a contested topic, a restriction to the development of women’s health. On one hand, the field of women’s health has attended to the medicalization of the body and therefore is to be understood through medical language and knowledge. On the other hand, the framing of issues associated with women’s health and people’s experiences of and within such system(s) remain problematic for many. This is visible today in, e.g., socio-cultural practices in disparate geographies or medical devices within a clinic or the home. Moreover, the biological body is part of a great unmentionable, i.e., the perils of essentialism. We contend that it is necessary, pragmatically and ethically, for HCI to turn its attention toward a woman-centered design approach. While previous research has argued for the dangers of gender-demarcated design work, we advance that designing for and with women should not be regarded as ghettoizing, but instead as critical to improving women’s experiences in bodily transactions, choices, rights, and access to and in health and care. In this article, we consider how and why designing with and for woman matters. We use our design-led research as a way to speak to and illustrate alternatives to designing for and with women within HCI.",

We designed a series of personalized vibrotactile pacing patterns, and evaluated them on three body sites, in terms of self-reported and psychophysiological measures including skin conductance and breath wave parameters. The results show that personalization plays an important role in PIV’s pattern and placement design choices. We concluded that the choice of frequency based, strong-exhale-phased patterns and abdomen placement are appropriate for future studies.",

In doing so, these technologies subtly dictate the forms of knowledge and types of relationships menstruators are expected to establish with their bodies (i.e., transactional or instrumentalized). Through historical analysis and a series of participatory experiments, we offer a vision for menstrual sensemaking that expands on these forms of interaction and ways of knowing to emphasize multiplicity and dimensionality rather than models, predictability, or a user's relation to averages or norms.",

    "abstract": "The gap between research and design practice has long been a concern for the HCI community. In this article, we explore how different translations of HCI knowledge might bridge this gap. A literature review characterizes the gap as having two key dimensions—one between general theory and particular artefacts and a second between academic HCI research and professional UX design practice. We report on a 5-year engagement between HCI researchers and a major media company to explore how a particular piece of HCI research, the trajectories conceptual framework , might be translated for and with UX practitioners. We present various translations of this framework and fit them into the gap we previously identified. This leads us to refine the idea of translations , suggesting that they may be led by researchers, by practitioners or co-produced by both as boundary objects . We consider the benefits of each approach.",

Connection at a distance has been of sustained interest to the CHI community, and the social connection of older people is of increasing importance in recognition of ageing populations globally. However, very few novel designs in this domain have been investigated in situ or over the long term to examine whether their use sustains, and if so, how they impact communication in a relationship. The Messaging Kettle was trialled with four pairs of dispersed older mothers and adult daughters over timeframes that lasted between two months to more than two years. We observed the phenomenon of collaborative habituation wherein each party creatively made the technology work for them both through a combination of the gradual transformation of their everyday practices, arrangements, and living. Through developing these joint practices over time, participants expressed feelings of everyday togetherness that nurture their relationship at a distance. Three of the four couples continued to use the prototype for years, beyond the initial trial. We reflect on the artful integration of features of the Messaging Kettle and the way in which these features supported collaborative habituation . We also reflect on lessons and implications for the design of such relational technologies.",

The projects use design and HCI methods to relate blockchains to a range of topics, including global supply chains, delivery infrastructure, smart grids, volunteering and charitable giving, through engaging public, exploring ideas and speculating on possible futures. Based on an extensive annotated portfolio we draw out learning for the design of blockchain systems, broadening participation and surfacing questions around imaginaries, social implications and engagement with new technology.

We observed pathologists’ examination and discovered that the main hindering factor to integrate AI is its incompatibility with pathologists’ workflow. To bridge the gap between pathologists and AI, we developed a human-AI collaborative diagnosis tool— xPath —that shares a similar examination process to that of pathologists, which can improve AI’s integration into their routine examination. The viability of xPath is confirmed by a technical evaluation and work sessions with 12 medical professionals in pathology. This work identifies and addresses the challenge of incorporating AI models into pathology, which can offer first-hand knowledge about how HCI researchers can work with medical professionals side-by-side to bring technological advances to medical tasks towards practical applications.",

This analysis reveals variance in how authors report experiments, which creates challenges to understand, reproduce, and build on that research. It then describes an overarching experiment model that provides a formal structure for reporting HCI research with brain signals, including definitions, terminology, categories, and examples for each aspect. Multiple distinct reporting styles were identified through factor analysis and tied to different types of research. The paper concludes with recommendations and discusses future challenges. This creates actionable items from the abstract model and empirical observations to make HCI research with brain signals more reproducible and reusable.",

Control has been investigated mainly at a high level, using subjective questionnaire data, but also at a low level, using objective data on participants’ sense of agency. However, it remains unclear how differences in higher level, experienced control reflect lower level sense of control. We study that link in two experiments. In the first one we measure the low-level sense of agency with button, touchpad, and on-skin input. The results show a higher sense of agency with on-skin input. In the second experiment, participants played a simple game controlled with the same three inputs. We find that on-skin input results in both increased sense and experience of control compared to touchpad input. However, the corresponding difference is not found between on-skin and button input, whereas the button performed better in the experiment task. These results suggest that other factors of user experience spill over to the experienced control at rates that overcome differences in the sense of control. We discuss the implications for using subjective measures about the sense of control in evaluating qualities of interaction.",

The academic literature has, for example, highlighted the dangers of black-box decision-making and biased datasets.

We present the MAP model to understand and describe the three stages through which medical observations are interpreted and handled by AI systems. These stages are Measurement, in which information is gathered and converted into data points that can be stored and processed; Algorithm, in which computational processes transform the collected data; and Presentation, where information is returned to the user for interpretation. For each stage, we highlight possible challenges that need to be overcome to develop Human-Centred AI systems. We illuminate our MAP model through complementary case studies on colonoscopy practice and dementia diagnosis, providing examples of the challenges encountered in real-world settings. By defining Human-AI interaction across these three stages, we untangle some of the inherent complexities in designing AI technology for clinical decision-making, and aim to overcome misalignment between medical end-users and AI researchers and developers.",

Building on our formative interviews with 20 academics and professionals with vision impairments, we developed auditory representations that indicate comments and edits using non-speech audio (e.g., earcons, tone overlay), multiple text-to-speech voices, and contextual presentation techniques. We then performed a systematic evaluation study with 48 screen reader users that indicated that non-speech audio, changing voices, and contextual presentation can potentially improve writers’ collaboration awareness.

Building on the theoretical lenses of social response theory and the “Computers Are Social Actors” paradigm, we develop a research model to investigate how cultural appropriateness of avatar design is a vital driver for users’ trust. We evaluate our research model by means of an online experiment ( n = 313) in the context of online health advice for users from Saudi Arabia. The avatars differed in appearance (Arab, non-Arab), gender (male, female), and clothing (athletic, medical, everyday). Our results show that Arab avatars exhibited significantly higher cultural appropriateness than non-Arab avatars. Furthermore, participants were more inclined to select an Arab avatar (88.2%) that matched their gender (77.3%). Confirming the critical role of cultural appropriateness, our study demonstrates the importance of carefully considering the target audience in designing user interfaces.",

We present the results of action-oriented research with a grassroots movement committed to sustainable food practices at a local, communal level, thereby demonstrating the role of ICT in making food resource sharing a viable practice. We suggest that the current focus on food sharing might usefully be supplemented by attention to food resource sharing, an approach that aligns with a paradigm shift from surplus to abundance. We argue for a design that aims to encourage food resource sharing at a local level but that also has wider ramifications.

As a consequence, much potential in the breadth of existing empirical SE research and in its mapping to the actual cognitive processes it aims to measure is left untapped. In this work, we carry out a systematic review of 169 articles investigating overall 735 hypotheses in the field of empirical SE research, focusing on experimental characteristics and core cognitive features from both attacker and target perspectives. Our study reveals that experiments only partially reproduce real attacks and that the exploitable SE attack surface appears much larger than the coverage provided by the current body of research. Factors such as targets’ context and cognitive processes are often ignored or not explicitly considered in experimental designs. Similarly, the effects of different pretexts and varied targetization levels are overall marginally investigated.

By examining the relationship between empirical material and its representations by HCI researchers, we explore how to carefully unmake HCI research, thus maintaining and repairing our research community.

Lastly, we discuss the broader design implications and limitations, as well as the more-than-human values that emerge from designing for biodegradation via biomaterials. Through this, we aim to provide design researchers with practical tools and insights for engaging with biodegradation to unmake anthropocentric hierarchies between humans, non-humans, and biomaterials, which in turn can promote environmental sustainability and support more-than-human collaboration and care.",

We conclude by proposing that designers not only bear the responsibility of grappling critically with the complexities of AI but also possess the opportunity to creatively harness the limitations of technology to craft a reflexive data curation that encourages profound reflections and awareness within design processes.",

    "abstract": "Providing asynchronous feedback is a critical step in the 3D design workflow. A common approach to providing feedback is to pair textual comments with companion reference images, which helps illustrate the gist of text. Ideally, feedback providers should possess 3D and image editing skills to create reference images that can effectively describe what they have in mind. However, they often lack such skills, so they have to resort to sketches or online images which might not match well with the current 3D design. To address this, we introduce MemoVis , a text editor interface that assists feedback providers in creating reference images with generative AI driven by the feedback comments. First, a novel real-time viewpoint suggestion feature, based on a vision-language foundation model, helps feedback providers anchor a comment with a camera viewpoint. Second, given a camera viewpoint, we introduce three types of image modifiers, based on pre-trained 2D generative models, to turn a text comment into an updated version of the 3D scene from that viewpoint. We conducted a within-subjects study with \\(14\\) feedback providers, demonstrating the effectiveness of MemoVis. The quality and explicitness of the companion images were evaluated by another eight participants with prior 3D design experience.",

However, giving due consideration to the fact that everyday use of technology involves a process of evolution, we set out to investigate how the design of the technology may be used to support this. Based on a long-term empirical study of television use in the homes of two families, we illustrate how use continuously develops in a complex interplay between the users' expectations---as they are formed and triggered by the design---and the needs and context of use per se . We analyze the empirical data from the perspective of activity theory. This framework serves to highlight how use develops, and it supports our analysis and discussion about how design, the users' backgrounds, previous experience, and needs, and the specific context of use supports or hinders the development of use. Moreover, we discuss how the characteristics of the home settings, in which the televisions studied were situated, represent a challenge to usability work. The concluding discussion leads to a set of hypotheses relevant to designers and researchers who wish to tackle some of the aspects of usability of particular importance to development in the use of home technology.",

The analysis is based around the introduction and use of digital libraries in four different settings, three clinical and one academic. Across the four settings, in-depth interview and focus group data was collected from 144 users and analyzed with reference to “communities of practice”. The four settings represent three different approaches to digital library implementation: making digital library resources available from existing computer systems in people's offices and the library (a traditional approach); making computer systems, and hence digital libraries, available in shared spaces (in this case, hospital wards); and employing information intermediaries to work with staff and library resources. These different approaches engendered different perceptions of the technology. The traditional approach produced perceptions of technology as being irrelevant for current needs and community practices. Making technology available within shared physical space but with poor design, support, and implementation procedures was widely perceived as a threat to current organizational structures. In contrast, technology implemented within the community which could adapt and change practices according to individual and group needs, supported by an information intermediary, was seen as empowering to both the community and the individual. We relate the findings to a discussion of evolutionary and revolutionary approaches to design and to the concept of communities of practice.",

    "abstract": "Interruptions are a central aspect of working life. The prevalence of remote co-workers and the use of mobile technology mean that interruptions are more prevalent, and workers have to learn to manage availability. To understand general issues in availability management, we carried out a naturalistic study of how interruptions are handled in face-to-face situations. We found that availability management requires negotiation, that it is also highly dependent on awareness about the availability of others, and that it demands cognitive effort to shift attention to the interruption. On the basis of these observations, we developed a technology, named. The Negotiator, that embodies three main design requirements: (a) support for negotiation, (b) contextual information about when a recipient is available for a call, (c) lightweightness to reduce attention overhead. We carried out an experimental study of interruption management using this technology. The interface satisfied the original design requirements, that is, people, were able to use it effectively to negotiate times to talk, while successfully carrying out an intellectually demanding activity. Contrary to our expectations, however, people preferred to take responsibility for returning calls rather than delegating them, and they preferred to schedule calls as soon as possible rather than deferring them. We suggest that there are social reasons why people do this. They feel a social obligation to return calls as soon as possible so as not to inconvenience others and also to be responsible for making these calls themselves. They also take calls sooner to avoid having to remember future conversational commitments. We discuss the theoretical and technical implications of these findings.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a new model for coupling the user interfaces of a multiuser program. It is based on an interaction model and a user interface framework that allow users and programmers, respectively, to view applications as editors of data. It consists of a semantics model, a specification model, and an implementation model for coupling. The semantics model determines (1) which properties of interaction entities created for a user are shared with corresponding interaction entities created for other users and (2) when changes made by a user to a property of an interaction entity are communicated to other users sharing it. It divides the properties of an interaction entity into multiple coupling sets and allows users to share different coupling sets independently. It supports several criteria for choosing when a change made by a user to a shared property is communicated to other users. These criteria include how structurally complete the change is, how correct it is, and the time at which it was made. The specification model determines how users specify the desired semantics of coupling. It associates interaction entities with inheritable coupling attributes, allows multiple users to specify values of these attributes, and does a runtime matching of the coupling attributes specified by different users to derive the coupling among their user interfaces. The implementation model determines how multiuser programs implement user-customizable coupling. It divides the task of implementing the coupling between system-provided modules and application programs. The modules support automatically a predefined semantics and specification model that can be extended by the programs. We have implemented the coupling model as part of a system called Suite. This paper describes and motivates the model using the concrete example of Suite, discusses how aspects of it can be implemented in other systems, compares it with related work, discusses its shortcomings, and suggests directions for future work.",

    "abstract": "Much of the recent research in software visualization has been polarized toward two opposite domains. In one domain that we call data structure and program visualization , low-level canonical views of program structures are generated automatically. These types of views, which do not require programmer input or intervention, can be useful for testing and debugging software. Often, however, their generic, low-level views are not expressive enough to convey adequately how a program functions. In the second domain called algorithm animation , designers handcraft abstract, application-specific views that are useful for program understanding and teaching. Unfortunately, since algorithm animation development typically requires time-consuming design with a graphics package, it will not be used for debugging, where timeliness is a necessity. However, we speculate that the application-specific nature of algorithm animation views could be a valuable debugging aid for software developers as well, if only the views could be easy and rapid to create. We have developed a system called Lens that occupies a unique niche between the two domains discussed above and explores the capabilities that such a system may offer. Lens allows programmers to build rapidly (in minutes) algorithm animation-style program views without requiring any sophisticated graphics knowledge and without using textual coding. Lens also is integrated with a system debugger to promote iterative design and exploration.",

In the experiment reported here, we compared dynamic and static peephole navigation in otherwise similar conditions. Subjects viewed a spatial layout containing two lines on a static display screen. Only a part of the screen---the peephole---was visible. Subjects had to discriminate line length by either moving a dynamic peephole across a static layout of the lines or by moving a dynamic layout behind a static peephole. In both conditions, they used mouse-cursor control to move either the peephole or the lines.Results show significant differences in discrimination performance between conditions when lines are larger than the size of the peephole. Discrimination thresholds for static peephole navigation were 50--75% higher than for dynamic peephole navigation. Furthermore, static peephole navigation took 24% more time than dynamic peephole navigation.",

The defining features of these diagrams are nodes, represented by a circle or rectangle connected by links usually represented by some form of line or arrow. We investigate the proposition that drawing three-dimensional shaded elements instead of using simple lines and outlines will result in diagrams that are easier to interpret. A set of guidelines for such diagrams is derived from perception theory and these collectively define the concept of the geon diagram. We also introduce a new substructure identification task for evaluating diagrams and use it to test the effectiveness of geon diagrams. The results from five experiments are reported. In the first three experiments geon diagrams are compared to Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams. The results show that substructures can be identified in geon diagrams with approximately half the errors and significantly faster. The results also show that geon diagrams can be recalled much more reliably than structurally equivalent UML diagrams. In the final two experiments geon diagrams are compared with diagrams having the same outline but not constructed with shaded solids. This is designed to specifically test the importance of using 3D shaded primitives. The results also show that substructures can be identified much more accurately with shaded components than with 2D outline equivalents and remembered more reliably.

Our main advance is to use context-sensitive speech recognition in a general way, with a representation of dialogue context that is rich and flexible enough to support conversation about multiple interleaved topics, as well as the interpretation of corrective fragments. We explain, by use of worked examples, the use of our \"Conversational Intelligence Architecture\" (CIA) to represent conversational threads, and how each thread can be associated with a language model (LM) for more robust speech recognition. The CIA uses fine-grained dynamic representations of dialogue context, which supersede those used in finite-state or form-based dialogue managers. In an evaluation of a dialogue system built using this architecture we found that 87.9% of recognized utterances were recognized using a context-specific language model, resulting in an 11.5% reduction in the overall utterance recognition error rate, and a 13.4% reduction in concept error rate. Thus we show that by using context-sensitive recognition based on the predicted type of the user's next dialogue move, a more flexible dialogue system can also exhibit an improvement in speech recognition performance.",

A considerable amount of work has been done to make the web accessible to those with sensory or motor disability, with an increasing number of government and enterprise intranet webs being “accessible”, and also with some consortiums and groups seriously approaching this commitment. Some authors, such as Harrysson, have already highlighted the need for a cognitively accessible web. However, in spite of good intentions, there has been little work to date that has tackled this task. At least until now, the existing WAI and NI4 recommendations about cognitive disability are extremely difficult (if not impossible) to test, as they are only general recommendations. This article explains an alternative Web that has been constructed and tested on a sample of participants with cognitive disabilities (N = 20) with positive results encouraging us to dedicate more effort to fine tune their requirements regarding specific cognitive deficits and automating the process of creating and testing cognitively accessible web content. This alternative web implies the use of a simplified web browser and an adequate web design. Discussion of the need to have several levels of cognitive accessibility, equivalent (although not identical) content for this collective and the need for testable protocols of accessibility that support these people's needs is also included. This article finishes with conclusions about the potential impact of accessible pages in the daily life of people suffering from cognitive deficits, outlining the features to be considered within a user profile specification that support cognitive difficulties and with reflections about the suitability of Semantic Web Technologies for future developments in this field.",

We present a new technique (MOT) that guides inspection by metaphors of human thinking. The metaphors concern habit, the stream of thought, awareness and associations, the relation between utterances and thought, and knowing. The main novelty of MOT is its psychological basis combined with its use of metaphors to stimulate inspection. The first of three experiments shows that usability problems uncovered with MOT are more serious and more complex to repair than problems found with heuristic evaluation. Problems found with MOT are also judged more likely to persist for expert users. The second experiment shows that MOT finds more problems than cognitive walkthrough, and has a wider coverage of a reference collection of usability problems. Participants prefer using MOT over cognitive walkthrough; an important reason being the wider scope of MOT. The third experiment compares MOT, cognitive walkthrough, and think aloud testing, in the context of nontraditional user interfaces. Participants prefer using think aloud testing, but identify few problems with that technique that are not found also with MOT or cognitive walkthrough. MOT identifies more problems than the other techniques. Across experiments and measures of usability problems' utility in systems design, MOT performs better than existing inspection techniques and is comparable to think aloud testing.",

To address this question, we designed a new direct manipulation programming interface for novices, and conducted an experimental study to compare the programming processes and outcomes promoted by the direct manipulation interface against those promoted by a textual programming interface. We found that the direct manipulation interface promoted significantly better initial programming outcomes, positive transfer to the textual interface, and significant differences in programming processes.

The effect of perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness was stronger for high-utilitarian than for low-utilitarian functions.

While these relationships are typically intermittent, previous research has used network representations that aggregate the relationships at discrete intervals. However, such an aggregation discards important temporal information, thus inhibiting our understanding of the networks dynamic behaviour and evolution. We have recorded patterns of human urban encounter using Bluetooth technology thus retaining the temporal properties of this network. Here we show how this temporal information influences the structural properties of the network. We show that the temporal properties of human urban encounter are scale-free, leading to an overwhelming proportion of brief encounters between individuals. While previous research has shown preferential attachment to result in scale-free connectivity in aggregated network data, we found that scale-free connectivity results from the temporal properties of the network. In addition, we show that brief encounters act as weak social ties in the diffusion of non-expiring information, yet persistent encounters provide the means for sustaining time-expiring information through a network.",

    "abstract": "Persons suffering from motor disorders have limited possibilities for communicating and normally require assistive technologies to fulfill this primary need. Promising means of providing basic communication abilities to subjects affected by severe motor impairments include brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), that is, systems that directly translate brain signals into device commands, bypassing any muscle or nerve mediation. To date, the use of BCIs for effective verbal communication is yet an open issue, primarily due to the low rates of information transfer that can be achieved with this technology. Still, performance of BCI spelling applications could be considerably improved by a smart user interface design and by the adoption of natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text prediction. The objective of this work is to suggest an approach and a user interface for BCI spelling applications combining state-of-the-art BCI and NLP techniques to maximize the overall communication rate of the system. The BCI paradigm adopted is motor imagery, that is, when the subject imagines moving a certain part of the body, he/she produces modifications to specific brain rhythms that are detected in real-time through an electroencephalogram and translated into commands for a spelling application. By maximizing the overall communication rate, our approach is twofold: on one hand, we maximize the information transfer rate from the control signal, on the other hand, we optimize the way this information is employed for the purpose of verbal communication. The achieved results are satisfactory and comparable with the latest works reported in literature on motor-imagery BCI spellers. For the three subjects tested, we obtained a spelling rate of respectively 3 char/min, 2.7 char/min, and 2 char/min.",

This article demonstrates that these benefits can also be realized when these plans are created by others or reused from similar tasks. Four experiments test these approaches, finding that people indeed complete more tasks when they receive externally-created action plans. To automatically provide plans, we introduce the Genies workflow that combines benefits of crowd wisdom, collaborative refinement, and automation. We demonstrate and evaluate this approach through the TaskGenies system, and introduce an NLP similarity algorithm for reusing plans. We demonstrate that it is possible for people to create action plans for others, and we show that it can be cost effective.",

    "abstract": "We present McSig, a multimodal system for teaching blind children cursive handwriting so that they can create a personal signature. For blind people handwriting is very difficult to learn as it is a near-zero feedback activity that is needed only occasionally, yet in important situations; for example, to make an attractive and repeatable signature for legal contracts. McSig aids the teaching of signatures by translating digital ink from the teacher's stylus gestures into three non-visual forms: (1) audio pan and pitch represents the x and y movement of the stylus; (2) kinaesthetic information is provided to the student through a force-feedback haptic pen that mimics the teacher's stylus movement; and (3) a physical tactile line on the writing sheet is created by the haptic pen. McSig has been developed over two major iterations of design, usability testing and evaluation. The final step of the first iteration was a short evaluation with eight visually impaired children. The results suggested that McSig had the highest potential benefit for congenitally and totally blind children and also indicated some areas where McSig could be enhanced. The second prototype incorporated significant modifications to the system, improving the audio, tactile and force-feedback. We then ran a detailed, longitudinal evaluation over 14 weeks with three of the congenitally blind children to assess McSig's effectiveness in teaching the creation of signatures. Results demonstrated the effectiveness of McSig—they all made considerable progress in learning to create a recognizable signature. By the end of ten lessons, two of the children could form a complete, repeatable signature unaided, the third could do so with a little verbal prompting. Furthermore, during this project, we have learnt valuable lessons about providing consistent feedback between different communications channels (by manual interactions, haptic device, pen correction) that will be of interest to others developing multimodal systems.",

    "abstract": "The debate concerning how many participants represents a sufficient number for interaction testing is well-established and long-running, with prominent contributions arguing that five users provide a good benchmark when seeking to discover interaction problems. We argue that adoption of five users in this context is often done with little understanding of the basis for, or implications of, the decision. We present an analysis of relevant research to clarify the meaning of the five-user assumption and to examine the way in which the original research that suggested it has been applied. This includes its blind adoption and application in some studies, and complaints about its inadequacies in others. We argue that the five-user assumption is often misunderstood, not only in the field of Human-Computer Interaction, but also in fields such as medical device design, or in business and information applications. The analysis that we present allows us to define a systematic approach for monitoring the sample discovery likelihood, in formative and summative evaluations, and for gathering information in order to make critical decisions during the interaction testing, while respecting the aim of the evaluation and allotted budget. This approach -- which we call the Grounded Procedure -- is introduced and its value argued.",

Information and communication technologies have a great potential to promote a greater awareness and appreciation of cultural heritage. This article presents some findings on how mobile technology can be used to foster a better understanding of an archaeological site by reconstructing the ancient environment and life. Children aged 11--13 years old are the target of our research. To motivate and engage them, a pervasive educational game has been developed and implemented in Explore! , a system aimed at supporting children exploring sites of cultural interest. Special attention has been devoted to the design of a soundscape that may improve players’ navigation in degraded physical environments and enrich their overall experience. A field study indicated that children judged their experience both useful and entertaining: not only did they enjoy playing the game, but they also learned historical notions and facts related to ancient Roman life. Contextual sounds were found to have a facilitating effect on space navigation, reducing the need for map reading and improving spatial orientation. This work provides insights into the design of educational games for use with cultural heritage and a model to enrich historical sites through the creation of soundscapes which can help visitors to navigate a site and feel its historical atmosphere.",

    "abstract": "This article presents two studies investigating how computer interface affordances influence basic cognition, including ideational fluency, problem solving, and inferential reasoning. In one study comparing interfaces with different input capabilities, students expressed 56% more nonlinguistic representations (diagrams, symbols, numbers) when using pen interfaces. A linear regression confirmed that nonlinguistic communication directly mediated a substantial increase (38.5%) in students' ability to produce appropriate science ideas. In contrast, students expressed 41% more linguistic content when using a keyboard-based interface, which mediated a drop in science ideation. A follow-up study pursued the question of how interfaces that prime nonlinguistic communication so effectively facilitate cognition. This study examined the relation between students' expression of nonlinguistic representations and their inference accuracy when using analogous digital and non-digital pen tools. Perhaps surprisingly, the digital pen interface stimulated construction of more diagrams, more correct Venn diagrams, and more accurate domain inferences. Students' construction of multiple diagrams to represent a problem also directly suppressed overgeneralization errors, which were the most common inference failure. These research results reveal that computer interfaces have communications affordances which elicit communication patterns that can substantially stimulate or impede basic cognition. Implications are discussed for designing new digital tools for thinking, with an emphasis on nonlinguistic and especially spatial representations that are most poorly supported by current keyboard-based interfaces.",

In addition to individual differences, a common pattern emerges: an extended preparation is carried out by the hosting household over a few weeks to set up the celebration and build expectations; preparation gives way to a short but intense celebration shared with the family or intimate friends; then decorations are stored and there is a return to normal life. The celebration is across generations, and everyone takes part. We note examples of new and evolving rituals. Starting from the three identified phases, we discuss the theoretical and technical implications of our findings for the design of more sympathetic technology that holds potential for augmenting family rituals sensitively and possibly creating new ones.",

We present two new two-handed multistroke marking menu variants in which users either draw strokes with both hands simultaneously or alternate strokes between hands. In a pair of studies we find that using two hands simultaneously is faster than using a single, dominant-handed marking menu by 10--15%. Alternating strokes between hands doubles the number of accessible menu items for the same number of strokes, and is similar in performance to using a one-handed marking menu. We also examine how stroke direction affects performance. When using thumbs on an iPod Touch, drawing strokes upwards and inwards is faster than other directions. For two-handed simultaneous menus, stroke pairs that are bilaterally symmetric or share the same direction are fastest. We conclude with design guidelines and sample applications to aid multitouch application developers interested in using one- and two-handed marking menus.",

Through a reanalysis of data from related work we demonstrate that one-part formulations are fragile in describing pointing performance, and that this fragility is present for various devices and techniques. We show that this same data can be significantly better described using two-part models. Finally, we demonstrate through further analysis of previous work and new experimental data that k increases linearly with gain. Our primary contribution is the demonstration that Fitts’s Law is more limited in applicability than previously appreciated, and that more robust models, such as Welford’s formulation, should be adopted in many cases of practical interest.",

One way to support stronger end users’ engagement with such complex technologies is by involving them in the design process and, with the advent of Arduino prototyping platform, even in their making. While DIY practice offers the potential for stronger user engagement with physical artifacts, we know little about end users’ DIY practice of making complex electronic technologies and their potential to ensure engagement with such devices. In this article, we report on interviews with 18 participants from two green communities who built and used an open source DIY energy monitor, with the aim to explore the end users DIY practices of making such complex electronic devices. Findings indicate four key qualities of DIY monitors: transparent modularity, open-endedness, heirloom, and disruptiveness, and how they contribute to more meaningful engagement with the DIY monitors, elevating them from the status of unremarkable objects to that of things . We conclude with three implications for design for supporting end user development of complex electronic DIY: designing transparent open hardware technologies, standardizing communication protocols for the current and future DIY of IoT, and deliberately calling for personal investment and labor in the assembling of DIY kits.",

As the goal of offering this course was to experiment with this type of instruction, we performed extensive evaluation including surveys of demographics, self-assessed skills, and learning intent; we also designed a knowledge-assessment tool specifically for the subject matter in this course, administering it before and after the course to measure learning, and again 5 months later to measure retention. We also tracked students through the course, including separating out students enrolled for credit from those enrolled only for the free, open course. Students had significant knowledge gains across all levels of prior knowledge and across all demographic categories. The main predictor of knowledge gain was effort expended in the course. Students also had significant knowledge retention after the course. Both of these results are limited to the sample of students who chose to complete our knowledge tests. Student completion of the course was hard to predict, with few factors contributing predictive power; the main predictor of completion was intent to complete. Students who chose a concepts-only track with hand exercises achieved the same level of knowledge of recommender systems concepts as those who chose a programming track and its added assignments, though the programming students gained additional programming knowledge. Based on the limited data we were able to gather, face-to-face students performed as well as the online-only students or better; they preferred this format to traditional lecture for reasons ranging from pure convenience to the desire to watch videos at a different pace (slower for English language learners; faster for some native English speakers).

In this paper, we report on a controlled experiment with 67 children, 4--8 years old, that examines the effect of observing physical phenomena and collaboration (pairs vs. solo). A follow-up experiment with 92 children tests whether adding simple physical control, such as shaking a tablet, improves learning and enjoyment. Our results indicate that observing physical phenomena in the context of a mixed-reality game leads to significantly more learning and enjoyment compared to screen-only versions. However, there were no significant effects of adding simple physical control or having students play in pairs vs. alone.

Given the prevalence of smartphones, mindfulness applications have attracted growing global interest. However, the majority of existing applications use guided meditation that is not adaptable to each user's unique needs or pace. This article proposes a novel framework called Attention Regulation Framework (ARF) , which studies how more flexible and adaptable mindfulness applications could be designed, beyond guided meditation and toward self-regulated meditation. ARF proposes mindfulness interaction design guidelines and interfaces whereby practitioners naturally and constantly bring their attention back to the present moment and develop non-judgmental awareness. This is achieved by the performance of subtle movements, which are supported by non-intrusive detection-feedback mechanisms. We used two design cases to demonstrate ARF in static and kinetic meditation conditions. We conducted four user evaluation studies in unique situations where ARF is particularly effective, vis-à-vis mindfulness practice in busy environments and mindfulness interfaces that adapt to the pace of the user. The studies show that the design cases, compared with guided meditation applications, are more effective in improving attention, mindfulness, mood, well-being, and physical balance. Our work contributes to the development of self-regulated mindfulness technologies.",

We propose infrastructural accessibility as a method to identify available and absent infrastructures in concrete trans-local situations. Infrastructural accessibility leads us to identify multiple dimensions of critical infrastructures necessary for the success of tech startups. This includes infrastructures related to location, community, funding, digital platforms, politics, and history. Our study shows how these multiple dimensions of infrastructural accessibility shape the everyday practices of tech entrepreneurs. Furthermore, our study reveals how Palestinian tech entrepreneurship is characterized by infrastructural inaccessibility due to missing infrastructures related to mobility, legal frameworks, payment gateways, and mobile Internet. Infrastructural inaccessibility seriously limits tech entrepreneurs’ potential to succeed in creating a long-term sustainable tech industry.",

    "abstract": "As architects usually decide on the shape and look of windows during the design of buildings, opportunities for interactive windows have not been systematically explored yet. In this work, we extend the vision of sustainable and comfortable adaptive buildings using interactive smart windows. We systematically explore the design space of interactive windows to chart requirements, constraints, and challenges. To that end, we built proof-of-concept prototypes of smart windows with fine-grained control of transparency. In two studies, we explored user attitudes towards interactive windows and elicited control methods. We found that users understand and see potential for interactive windows at home. We provide specific usage contexts and specify interactions that may facilitate domestic applications. Our work illustrates the concept of interactive smart windows and provides insights regarding their design, development, and user controls for adaptive walls. We identify design dimensions and challenges to stimulate further development in the domain of adaptive buildings.",

Changes in information and communications technology have enabled widespread sharing of personal photos, increasing access to aspects of private life previously less observable. Most studies of privacy online explore differences in individual privacy preferences. Here we examine privacy perceptions of online photos considering both social norms, collectively—shared expectations of privacy and individual preferences. We conducted an online factorial vignette study on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk ( n = 279). Our findings show that people share common expectations about the privacy of online images, and these privacy norms are socially contingent and multidimensional. Use of digital technologies to share personal photos is influenced by social context as well as individual preferences, while such sharing can affect the social meaning of privacy.",

    "abstract": "This study proposes a novel coping model of privacy that extends prior privacy work in two important ways: first, the reconceptualization of privacy coping reflecting both problem- and emotion-focused strategies, and second, the incorporation of discrete emotions as a driver of privacy coping. Results from online survey data ( N = 605) show that Facebook users’ adaptation to privacy risks consists of multifaceted coping strategies that are problem-focused, emotion-focused, and communication-focused. These coping strategies have selective relationships with theoretical antecedents such as cognitive appraisals (i.e., threat appraisals and coping appraisals) and negative emotions (i.e., anger, frustration, regret, and anxiety/fear). Discrete emotions play a crucial functional role in determining users’ coping responses to privacy risks by selectively activating (or deactivating) emotionally congruent (or incongruent) coping strategies. Specifically, approach-associated emotions such as frustration and regret lead to problem-focused privacy coping strategies, whereas avoidance-associated emotions such as anxiety and fear lead to emotion-focused strategies. We also find a new type of privacy coping strategy: communication-focused coping strategies that are affected by regret and anxiety/fear.",

We partner with CaringBridge.org—a prominent online health community for journaling about health crises—to conduct a study of instrumental support in the following two phases: a content analysis of 641 journal updates; and a survey of 991 users. Quantitative results show that: (1) patients and family caregivers prefer to receive different types of support than their care networks prefer to provide; (2) people generally have more trust in their closest social connections than acquaintances or businesses to provide instrumental support; and (3) users rate “prayer support” as the most important support category to them. Building on these results, we discuss design implications to accommodate divergent preferences and to expand instrumental support networks. We also discuss the need for future work to empower family caregivers and to support spirituality, an understudied topic in HCI.",

    "abstract": "Present day ideals of good parenting are socio-technical constructs formed at the intersection of medical best practices, cultural norms, and technical innovation. These ideals take shape in relation to the fundamental uncertainty that parents/mothers face, an uncertainty that comes from not knowing how to do what is best for one's children, families, and selves. The growing body of parent-focused smart devices and data-tracking platforms emerging from this intersection frame the responsible parent as one who evaluates, analyzes, and mitigates data-defined risks for their children and family. As these devices and platforms proliferate, whether from respected medical institutions or commercial interests, they place new demands on families and add an implicit emphasis on how humans (often mothers) can be augmented and improved by data-rich technology. This is expressed both in the actions they support (e.g., breastfeeding, monitoring food intake), as well as in the emotions they render marginal (e.g., rage, struggle, loss, and regret). In this article, we turn away from optimization and self-improvement narratives to attend to our own felt experiences as mothers and designers. Through an embodied practice of creating Design Memoirs, we speak directly to the HCI community from our position as both users and subjects of optimized parenting tools. Our goal in this work is to bring nuance to a domain that is often rendered in simplistic terms or frames mothers as figures who could endlessly do more for the sake of their families. Our Design Memoirs emphasize the conflicting and often negative emotions we experienced while navigating these tools and medical systems. They depict our feelings of being at once powerful and powerless, expressing rage and love simultaneously, and struggling between expressing pride and humility. The Design Memoirs serve us in advocating that designers should use caution when considering a problem/solution focus to the experiences of parents. We conclude by reflecting on how our shared practice of making memoirs, as well as other approaches within feminist and queer theory, suggest strategies that trouble these optimization and improvement narratives. Overall, we present a case for designing for mothers who feel like they are just making do or falling short, in order to provide relief from the anxiety of constantly seeking improvement.",

We focus on a 16-month, full-scale media architecture design project and zero in on seven of its component events, and use design-space schemas to shed light on the dynamics of the design space with respect to informing and filtering the design space. Our concluding contribution is to propose design-space thinking as a sub-discipline of design research. We argue that this research perspective serves to address the creative aspects of the design process, the generative potential of design-space thinking, and the tools that support design-space thinking and research.",

To achieve this, interfaces actuate the user’s to touch involuntarily (using exoskeletons or electrical-muscle-stimulation); we refer to this as computer-driven touch. Unfortunately, forcing users to touch causes a loss of their sense of agency. While researchers found that delaying the timing of computer-driven touch preserves agency, they only considered the naïve case when user-driven touch is aligned with computer-driven touch. We argue this is unlikely as it assumes we can perfectly predict user-touches. But, what about all the remainder situations: when the haptics forces the user into an outcome they did not intend or assists the user in an outcome they would not achieve alone? We unveil, via an experiment, what happens in these novel situations. From our findings, we synthesize a framework that enables researchers of digital-touch systems to trade-off between haptic-assistance vs. sense-of-agency.",

To address these research gaps, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 autistic and 16 non-autistic teenagers assessing their privacy- and safety-related attitudes and behaviors on SNS, and factors affecting them. We used videos demonstrating relevant SNS scenarios as prompts to engage participants in conversation. Through our thematic analyses, we found evidence that autistic teenagers may be more averse to taking risks on SNS than non-autistic teenagers. Yet, several personal, social, and SNS design factors may make autistic teenagers more vulnerable to cyberbullying and social exclusion online. We provide recommendations for making SNS safer for autistic teenagers. Our research highlights the need for more inclusive usable privacy and security research with this population.",

However, in the case of optimisation, it is difficult for the end-user to understand the underlying algorithms or to judge the quality of the solution. Through two controlled user studies, we explore whether the user is better able to calibrate their trust in the system when: (a) They are provided feedback on the system operation in the form of visualisation of intermediate solutions and their quality; (b) They can interactively explore the solution space by modifying the solution returned by the system.

I explore how autistics on Twitter interact with non-autistic researchers and how the tenor of these interactions varies according to which research paradigm a particular researcher subscribes. I conclude with a discussion of how HCI researchers interested in autism can operationalize these findings by approaching their work through the framework of crip technoscience.",

As work contexts have shifted amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become important to understand how these tools are continuing or failing to support peoples’ work-related and personal needs. In this article, we examine and probe practices for managing task-related information across the work–life boundary. We report findings from an online survey deployed to 150 information workers during Summer 2019 (i.e., pre-pandemic) and 70 information workers at the same organization during Summer 2020 (i.e., mid-pandemic). Across both survey cohorts, we characterize these cross-boundary task management practices, exploring the central role that physical and digital tools play in managing task-related information that arises at inopportune times. We conclude with a discussion of the opportunities and challenges for future productivity tools that aid people in managing task-related information across their personal and work contexts.",

We investigate how collaborative technology can be designed to support young neurodivergent and neurotypical children in playing together. By integrating theories and methods from design, HCI, and the learning sciences, we iteratively designed, developed, and evaluated a novel tablet application called Incloodle-Classroom (Incloodle in short), that takes into account the needs of neurodiverse groups of children and the adults who support them during play. We deployed Incloodle in a kindergarten classroom of 15 neurodivergent and 16 neurotypical children over a 10-week period. Using interaction analysis, we present rich empirical understandings of how children interacted with each other, with adults, and with Incloodle. In doing so, we contribute new theoretical underpinnings to collaborative and accessible technology design, extending joint media engagement to encompass inclusivity and equity.",

Using Karen Barad's agential realism as a guide, we explore how data is fundamentally entangled with the tools and theories of its measurement. We examine data-enabled artefacts acting as Baradian apparatuses: they do not exist independently of the phenomenon they seek to measure, but rather collect and co-produce observations from within their entangled state: the phenomenon and the apparatus co-constitute one another. Connecting Barad's quantum view of indeterminacy to the prevailing HCI discourse on the opportunities and challenges of ambiguity, we suggest that the very act of trying to stabilise a conceptual interpretation of data within an artefact has the paradoxical effect of amplifying and shifting ambiguity in interaction. We illustrate these ideas through three case studies from our own practices of designing digital musical instruments (DMIs). DMIs necessarily encode symbolic and music-theoretical knowledge as part of their internal operation, even as conceptual knowledge is not their intended outcome. In each case, we explore the nature of the apparatus, what phenomena it co-produces, and where the ambiguity lies to suggest approaches for design using these abstract theoretical frameworks.",

Both physical and digital prototypes are commonly adopted by designers to support ideation and creativity, providing intuitive perception and rapid iteration, respectively. In recent advancements, large-scale generation models are able to offer data-enabled creativity support by generating high-quality solutions comparable to human designers. This opens up an imaginary space for designers and brings new possibilities for design tools. In this study, we proposed a hybrid prototype method that synergistically combines physical models and generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the conceptual design stage. Correspondingly, we developed a hybrid prototype system to implement the proposed method. We conducted a comparative user study with 45 designers who completed a design task using the physical prototype method, standalone generative AI, and the hybrid prototype method, respectively. Our results verified the effectiveness of the hybrid prototype method and investigated its mechanism in supporting creativity.

To simplify the creation of TAP rules, many studies have proposed various levels of requirements abstraction, yet the connections between them remain unclear. In this paper, we employ a mixed-methods study to identify the preferred way of expressing end users’ requirements in practical scenarios. Subsequently, from the perspective of requirements engineering, we categorize the needs of smart home into three hierarchical levels of abstraction. Accordingly, we propose an innovative multi-level requirements description language called SH-RDL . We also address potential challenges and conduct an evaluation to validate SH-RDL ’s usability, understandability and error-prevention.

Many students experience excessive anxiety when giving presentations in front of other people, which can negatively impact their academic performance and overall mental well-being. With limited access to human coaches and interventions, there is a need for innovative technological solutions, including social robots, to extend and enhance mental health support and accessibility. In this paper, we first outline a co-design study with five mental health professionals and a participatory design study with six university students, aiming to design a robotic mental well-being coach to help university students manage public speaking anxiety. Afterwards, we detail a user study with 50 university students to evaluate the usability and acceptability of the developed robotic mental well-being coach system. The findings showed that the robotic coach system, which includes the robot and a tablet, received a usability score of 84.05 and had high acceptability among participants who perceived the robot as knowledgeable and competent. Moreover, participants’ self-reported moods significantly improved following the study. Overall, conducting qualitative and quantitative analysis in this study yields promising results on the potential use of robotic coaches to help university students manage their public speaking anxiety.",

Using an enactment methodology in a transit scenario involving disparate devices, our study (N=21) reveals that asymmetric passenger experiences create a sense of disconnection among passengers, especially with varying device immersion capabilities. When interactions require more than a basic response, for example complex verbal exchanges relying on social cues like gaze, adoption is further hindered. The incorporation of cues from reality addresses safety concerns but requires further refinement to support interactions that require complex or extended user involvement. This research advances the understanding of asymmetric passenger dynamics, contributing to the design of immersive technologies for transit settings.",

Through confirmatory factor analysis, we confirm that the PMQ scale consists of three factors: communicative competence and dependability, human-likeness in communication, and communicative flexibility. Our studies show that the measure consistently demonstrates good internal reliability, strong test-retest reliability over 4- and 12-week intervals, and predictable convergent/divergent validity. Based on our findings, we discuss the multidimensional nature of partner models, whilst identifying key future research avenues that the development of the PMQ facilitates.

To investigate this, we surveyed 458 English-speaking U.S. participants, analyzing key motivations and barriers underlying online counterspeech engagement. We presented each participant with three hate speech examples from a set of 900, spanning race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and disability, and requested counterspeech responses. Subsequent questions assessed their satisfaction, perceived difficulty, and the effectiveness of their counterspeech. Our findings show that having been a target of online hate is a key driver of frequent online counterspeech engagement. People differ in their motivations and barriers towards engaging in online counterspeech across different demographic groups. Younger individuals, women, those with higher education levels, and regular witnesses to online hate are more reluctant to engage in online counterspeech due to concerns around public exposure, retaliation, and third-party harassment. Varying motivation and barriers in counterspeech engagement also shape how individuals view their own self-authored counterspeech and the difficulty experienced writing it. Additionally, our work explores people’s willingness to use AI technologies like ChatGPT for counterspeech writing.

    "abstract": "A framework of complementary behavior has been proposed which maintains that direct-manipulation and speech interfaces have reciprocal strengths and weaknesses. This suggests that user interface performance and acceptance may increase by adopting a multimodal approach that combines speech and direct manipulation. This effort examined the hypothesis that the speed, accuracy, and acceptance of multimodal speech and direct-manipulation interfaces will increase when the modalities match the perceptual structure of the input attributes. A software prototype that supported a typical biomedical data collection task was developed to test this hypothesis. A group of 20 clinical and veterinary pathologists evaluated the prototype in an experimental setting using repeated measures. The results of this experiment supported the hypothesis that the perceptual structure of an input task is an important consideration when designing a multimodal computer interface. Task completion time, the number of speech errors, and user acceptance improved when interface best matched the perceptual structure of the input attributes.",

    "abstract": "If judiciously applied, animation techniques can enhance the look and feel of computer applications that present a graphical human interface. Such techniques can smooth the rough edges and abrupt transitions common in many current graphical interfaces, and strengthen the illusion of direct manipulation that many interfaces strive to present. To date, few applications include such animation techniques. One possible reason is that animated interfaces are difficult to implement: they are difficult to design, place great burdens on programmers, and demand high-performance from underlying graphics systems.This article describes how direct manipulation human computer interfaces can be augmented with techniques borrowed from cartoon animators. In particular, we wish to improve the visual feedback of a direct manipulation interface by smoothing the changes of an interface, giving manipulated objects a feeling of substance and providing cues that anticipate the result of a manipulation. Our approach is to add support for animation techniques such as object distortion and keyframe interpolation, and to provide prepackaged animation effects such as animated widgets for common user interface interactions.To determine if these tools and techniques are practical and effective, we built a prototype direct manipulation drawing editor with an animated interface and used the prototype editor to carry out a set of human factors experiments. The experiments show that the techniques are practical even on standard workstation hardware, and that the effects can indeed enhance direct manipulation interfaces.",

    "abstract": "In the past, attempts to extend the spreadsheet paradigm to support graphical objects, such as colored circles or user-defined graphical types, have led to approaches featuring either a direct way of creating objects graphically or strong compatibility with the spreadsheet paradigm, but not both. This inability to conveniently go beyond numbers and strings without straying outside the spreadsheet paradigm has been a limiting factor in the applicability of spreadsheet languages. In this article we present graphical definitions, an approach that removes this limitation, allowing both simple and complex graphical objects to be programmed directly using direct manipulation and gestures, in a manner that fits seamlessly within the spreadsheet paradigm. We also describe an empirical study, in which subjects programmed such objects faster and with fewer errors using this approach than when using a traditional approach to formula specification. Because the approach is expressive enough to be used with both built-in and user-defined types, it allows the directness of demonstrational and spreadsheet techniques to be used in programming a wider range of applications than has been possible before.",

Two structures are examined---labeled visual hierarchies (groups of objects with one label per group) and unlabeled visual hierarchies (groups without labels). Search and selection times were separated by imposing a point-completion deadline that discouraged participants from moving the mouse until they found the target. The observed search times indicate that labeled visual hierarchies can be searched much more efficiently than unlabeled visual hierarchies, and suggest that people use a fundamentally different strategy for each of the two structures. The results have implications for screen layout design and cognitive modeling of visual search. The observed mouse-pointing times suggest that people use a slower and more accurate speed-accuracy operating characteristic to select a target with a mouse when visual distractors are present, which suggests that Fitts' law coefficients derived from standard mouse-pointing experiments may under-predict mouse-pointing times for typical human-computer interactions. The observed mouse-pointing times also demonstrate that mouse movement times for a two-dimensional pointing task can be most-accurately predicted by setting the w in Fitts' law to the width of the target along the line of approach.",

Contact negotiation is especially problematic for distributed group members who are separated by distance and thus do not share many of the cues needed to help mediate interaction. An understanding of what resources and cues people use to negotiate making contact when face-to-face identifies ways to design support for contact negotiation in new technology to support remote collaboration. This perspective is used to analyze the design and use experiences with three communication prototypes: Desktop Conferencing Prototype, Montage, and Awarenex. These prototypes use text, video, and graphic indicators to share the cues needed to gracefully start and end conversations. Experiences with using these prototypes focused on how these designs support the interactional commitment of the participants---when they have to commit their attention to an interaction and how flexibly that can be negotiated. Reviewing what we learned from these research experiences identifies directions for future research in supporting contact negotiation in computer-mediated communication.",

To determine the nature of teamwork errors, we conducted an observational study in a trauma center over a two-year period. While eventually successful in treating the patients, trauma teams had problems tracking and integrating information in a longitudinal trajectory, which resulted in inefficiencies and near-miss errors. As an initial step in system design to support trauma teams, we proposed a model of teamwork and a novel classification of team errors. Four types of team errors emerged from our analysis: communication errors, vigilance errors, interpretation errors, and management errors. Based on these findings, we identified key information structures to support team cognition and decision making. We believe that displaying these information structures will support distributed cognition of trauma teams. Our findings have broader applicability to other collaborative and dynamic work settings that are prone to human error.",

We draw on studies of everyday interaction to reveal how embodied conduct is embedded in the environment.

We describe four ways that players can engage with framing structures, which we classify in terms of whether players conform to explore, transgress, or (re)create them. Through the examples of three case studies, we illustrate how this model has been useful in design: as an analytical tool for deconstructing player behavior, to articulate design goals and support specific design choices, and for shaping the design process.",

    "abstract": "Analytics in professional sports has experienced a dramatic growth in the last decade due to the wide deployment of player and ball tracking systems in team sports, such as basketball and soccer. With the massive amount of fine-grained data being generated, new data-points are being generated, which can shed light on player and team performance. However, due to the complexity of plays in continuous sports, these data-points often lack the specificity and context to enable meaningful retrieval and analytics. In this article, we present an intelligent human--computer interface that utilizes trajectories instead of words, which enables specific play retrieval in sports. Various techniques of alignment, templating, and hashing were utilized by our system and they are tailored to multi-agent scenario so that interactive speeds can be achieved. We conduct a user study to compare our method to the conventional keywords-based system and the results show that our method significantly improves the retrieval quality. We also show how our interface can be utilized for broadcast purposes, where a user can draw and interact with trajectories on a broadcast view using computer vision techniques. Additionally, we show that our method can also be used for interactive analytics of player performance, which enables the users to move players around and see how performance changes as a function of position and proximity to other players.",

We present an exploration of modelling an example ubiquitous system, the Savannah game, using the mathematical formalism of bigraphs, which are based on a universal process algebra that encapsulates both dynamic and spatial behaviour of autonomous agents that interact and move among each other, or within each other. We establish a modelling approach based on four perspectives on ubiquitous systems—Computational, Physical, Human, and Technology—and explore how these interact with one another. We show how our model explains observed inconsistencies in user trials of Savannah, and then, how formal analysis reveals an incompleteness in design and guides extensions of the model and/or possible system re-design to resolve this.",

Despite a consensus that SNS enhance people's social capital, prior studies on SNS have provided inconsistent evidence on this process. In a multipronged study, we analyze personality, social capital, and Facebook data from a cohort of participants to model the extent to which one's SNS reflects aspects of his or personality and affects his bridging social capital. Our empirically validated model shows that empathy and conscientiousness influence the structural holes in one's social network, which in turn affects bridging social capital. These findings highlight the importance of network structure as an intermediary between one's personality and the social benefits one reaps from using SNS. Our work demonstrates how the implicit structural information embedded in users’ social networks can provide key insights into users’ personality and social capital.",

As a case study for investigating the impact of theoretical work in HCI, we present our evaluation of the impact of the Reality Based Interaction (RBI) framework, introduced by the authors in 2008. We provide our findings about the impact of the framework both on contemporary research, through content-based citation analysis, and in HCI education, through a survey we conducted on emerging interaction frameworks. The article contributes a comprehensive methodology for evaluating the impact of frameworks through our twofold approach: content-based citation analysis, including the design of a new citation typology; and a survey on the use of frameworks in education using a taxonomy of learning goals. We also consider the role of frameworks in HCI as well as the future of the RBI framework.",

Results suggest that work and leisure experiences as well as positive and negative experiences differ in terms of need fulfillment.

To some extent, the emerging technological infrastructures around them exemplify ways how digitalization will change production machines and lines, in general, in the Internet of Things (IoT). From an End-User Development perspective, the main question is how users can be supported in managing those complex digital production lines. To reach a better understanding, we carefully analyzed 3D printers as an example of highly digitalized production machines with regard to the creative activities of their users that help them to make these machines work for their practices. In our study of appropriation processes, we are concerned with situational and social aspects of the configuration and practice challenges associated with making digitalization work and how IoT technologies can support these collaborative appropriation activities of end users by making these machines more “sociable.” We therefore conceptualize the idea of “Sociable Technologies” and implement a prototype that provides hardware-integrated affordances for communicating and documenting practices of usage. Based on the findings of our evaluation, we derive lessons learnt when aiming at making complex technologies more usable.",

    "abstract": "The sustainability of food is a significant global concern with a drastic change required to mitigate complex social, environmental, and economic issues like climate change and food security for an ever increasing population. In this article, we set out to understand the place of food in people's lives, their mundane yet surprisingly complex ways of sourcing their food, and the processes of transition, past and ongoing, that shape these choices. Our goal is to understand the potential role for digital interactions in supporting the various ways that food consumption can be made more sustainable. To inform this exercise, we specifically set out to contrast the journeys of committed sustainable “food pioneers” with more conventional mainstream consumers recruited in branches of a UK supermarket. This contrast highlights for both groups the various values, and “meaningfulness” attached to foods and meals in people's lives, and suggests ways in which food choice and pro-sustainable practices can be supported at least in part by new digital technologies.",

    "abstract": "This article addresses itself to two developments in recent HCI research. One is the rising emphasis on women's health, a topic that is often seen as at least partly political. The other development in HCI research is the ongoing interest in supporting democracy and political activism. We present the case of a menstrual cup design project in Taiwan, called the Formoonsa Cup, whose product development led to the change in the legal status of menstrual cups and forcefully challenged a traditional value of hymen maintenance as an expression of “pure” and morally upright womanhood. We argue that this project is significant to HCI research for the following two reasons: first, because the design project is a successful, if complicated, case of political activism, and second, because the design and legalization processes were in part mediated by platform technologies, including social networking, crowdfunding, and direct democracy platforms. Using philosopher Michel Foucault's notion of “subjugated knowledge,” we analyze the case to improve understandings of how design can engage in emancipatory politics in the domain of women's health in HCI. In this case study, we begin with the idea that women's freedom of self-care is the knowledge that is subjugated, though by the end we suggest that subjugated knowledge is a more complex, and troubling, category than this initial evaluation suggests. We also argue that design can critique and intervene when it materializes previously subjugated knowledges and renders them both socially intelligible and politically efficacious.",

    "abstract": "Usability testing has long been a core interest of HCI research and forms a key element of industry practice. Yet our knowledge of it harbours striking absences. There are few, if any detailed accounts of the contingent, material ways in which usability testing is actually practiced . Further, it is rare that industry practitioners’ testing work is treated as indigenous and particular (instead subordinated as a ‘compromised’ version). To service these problems, this article presents an ethnomethodological study of usability testing practices in a design consultancy. It unpacks how findings are produced in and as the work of observers analysing the test as it unfolds between moderators taking participants through relevant tasks. The study nuances conventional views of usability findings as straightforwardly ‘there to be found’ or ‘read off’ by competent evaluators. It explores how evaluators/observers collaboratively work to locate relevant troubles in the test's unfolding. However, in the course of doing this work, potential candidate troubles may also routinely be dissipated and effectively ‘ignored’ in one way or another. The implications of the study suggest refinements to current understandings of usability evaluations, and affirm the value to HCI in studying industry practitioners more deeply.",

Drawing on video recordings of a face-scanning activity in family homes, we investigate how humans make sense of a Cozmo robot’s delays on a moment-by-moment basis. Cozmo’s sounds and embodied actions are recognized as indicators of delay but encourage human participants to act in ways that undermine the scanning process. In comparing the robot’s delay management strategies with human-human vocal and embodied practices, we demonstrate key differences in the sequences that impact how the robot is understood. The study demonstrates how delay events are accomplished as embodied displays that are distributed across co-participants. We present a framework for making delay transparent through situated explanations, particularly in the form of non-lexical sounds and bodily actions.",

    "abstract": "Human–computer interaction (HCI) is increasingly interested in supporting exertion experiences so more people can benefit from physical activity. So far, most systems have focused on sensing and presenting information to the user via screens to support the exertion experience. Interestingly, emerging technology can also act on the exerting user's body based on sensed information, granting researchers the potential to develop technology that not only “presents” but also “acts” on information throughout an integrated exertion experience. As a result, design opportunities surrounding computing machinery as contextually aware exertion partners are now available. However, there are currently no frameworks to guide the design of human–computer integration in an exertion context. To contribute to closing this gap, we designed three eBike systems to investigate different forms of integration with the exerting user and we studied the resulting user experiences. Based on the results of these three case studies, we present the first framework, including associated design tactics, to offer guidance on how to design human–computer integration in an exertion context.",

Three experimental conditions were tested: in-person collaboration, remote collaboration, and single user. We hypothesized that collaboration focuses users’ attention on key information facilitating decision-making. Collaborating participants dwelt longer on key elements of the simulation than single users. Moreover, in-person collaboration and single users yielded a strategy of decision-making similar to an optimal strategy. Finally, in-person collaboration was less cognitively demanding and of higher quality. The contribution of this article is a deeper understanding of how in-person collaboration on a large display can help users focus their visual attention on the most important areas. With this novel understanding, we believe collaborative systems designers will be better equipped to design more effective attention-guiding mechanisms in remote collaboration systems. The present work has the potential to advance the study of collaborative, interactive technologies.",

We found that this knowledge-building fills an epistemic gap resulting from bisexuality often being poorly understood. When individuals do not possess knowledge key to understanding their own lives, this can be seen as hermeneutical injustice —a type of epistemic injustice. We use the lens of hermeneutical injustice to shed light on participants’ experiences on r/bisexual. Our work contributes to recent research on epistemic injustice in HCI by looking at how members of r/bisexual mitigate epistemic injustice by reclaiming residuality—the space outside the gay-straight binary.

Researchers overlook a significant space—when devices are no longer “useful” to the user such as after breakdown or obsolescence. We argue that HCI can learn from experts who upcycle e-waste and give it second lives in electronics projects, art projects, educational workshops, and more. To acquire and translate this knowledge to HCI, we interviewed experts who unmake e-waste. We explore their practices through the lens of unmaking both when devices are physically unmade and when the perception of e-waste is unmade once waste becomes, once again, useful . Last, we synthesize findings into takeaways for how HCI can engage with the issue of e-waste.",

A cognitive model of diagram integration was proposed, and an experimental study was conducted, both to explore the effects of representa-tional features of diagrams on the cognitive process of diagram integration. Results of the experiment show that the representational features of the diagrams acted as the criteria for selecting among various methods for analyzing and designing the integrated diagram.

This article discusses how pointer variables can be integrated into one-way constraint models and indicates how these constraints can be usefully employed in user interfaces. Pointer variables allow constraints to model a wide array of dynamic application behavior, simplify the implementation of structured objects and demonstrational systems, and improve the storage and efficiency of constraint-based applications. This article presents two incremental algorithms—one lazy and one eager— for solving constraints with pointer variables. Both algorithms are capable of handling (1) arbitrary systems of one-way constraints, including constraints that involve cycles, and (2) editing models that allow multiple changes between calls to the constraint solver. These algorithms are fault tolerant in that they can handle and recover gracefully from formulas that crash due to programmer error. Constraints that use pointer variables have been implemented in a comprehensive user interface toolkit, Garnet, and our experience with applications written in Garnet have proven the usefulness of pointer variable constraints. Many large-scale applications have been implemented using these constraints.",

On the other hand, more rigidly structured information supports machine interpretation and exchange; these approaches have been explored in the ubiquitous computing community. The system presented here, dubbed Intermezzo, represents an exploration of a space between these two extremes. Intermezzo combines a loose data structuring with a number of unique features designed to allow applications to embed specialized semantic interpretations of data into the infrastructure, allowing them to be reused by other applications. This approach can enable the construction of applications that can take advantage of rich, layered interpretations of context without requiring that they understand all aspects of that context.

While researchers have suggested that confidence scores could prove useful during the error correction process, the focus is typically on error detection. More importantly, empirical studies have failed to confirm any measurable benefits when confidence scores are used in this way within dictation-oriented applications. In this article, we provide data that explains why confidence scores are unlikely to be useful for error detection. We propose a new navigation technique for use when speech-only interactions are strongly preferred and common, desktop-sized displays are available. The results of an empirical study that highlights the potential of this new technique are reported. An informal comparison between the current study and previous research suggests the new technique reduces time spent on navigation by 18%. Future research should include additional studies that compare the proposed technique to previous non-speech and speech-based navigation solutions.",

First we describe a study in which we establish that goal crossing is dependent on an index of difficulty analogous to Fitts' law, and that in some settings, goal crossing completion time is shorter or comparable to pointing performance under the same index of difficulty. We then demonstrate the expressiveness of the crossing-based interaction paradigm by implementing CrossY, an application which only uses crossing for selecting commands. CrossY demonstrates that crossing-based interactions can be more expressive than the standard point and click approach. We also show how crossing-based interactions encourage the fluid composition of commands. Finally after observing that users' performance could be influenced by the general direction of travel, we report on the results of a study characterizing this effect. These latter results led us to propose a general guideline for dialog box interaction. Together, these results provide the foundation for the design of effective crossing-based interactions.",

    "abstract": "Fisheye menus have become a prominent example of fisheye interfaces, yet contain several nonfisheye elements and have not been systematically evaluated. This study investigates whether fisheye menus are useful, and tries to untangle the impact on usability of the following properties of fisheye menus: use of distortion, index of letters for coarse navigation, and the focus-lock mode for accurate movement. Twelve participants took part in an experiment comparing fisheye menus with three alternative menu designs across known-item and browsing tasks, as well as across alphabetical and categorical menu structures. The results show that for finding known items, conventional hierarchical menus are the most accurate and by far the fastest. In addition, participants rate the hierarchical menu as more satisfying than fisheye and multifocus menus, but do not consistently prefer any one menu. For browsing tasks, the menus neither differ with respect to accuracy nor selection time. Eye-movement data show that participants make little use of nonfocus regions of the fisheye menu, though these are a defining feature of fisheye interfaces. Nonfocus regions are used more with the multifocus menu, which enlarges important menu items in these regions. With the hierarchical menu, participants make shorter fixations and have shorter scanpaths, suggesting lower requirements for mental activity and visual search. We conclude by discussing why fisheye menus are inferior to the hierarchical menu and how both may be improved.",

Here we synthesize earlier work in human-computer interaction, sociology and architecture in order to deliberately influence the design of digital systems with an understanding of their built and social context of use. We propose, illustrate, and evaluate a multidisciplinary approach combining rapid ethnography, architectural analysis, design sketching, and paper prototyping. Following the approach we are able to provide empirically grounded representations of the socio-physical context of use, in this case people socializing in urban spaces. We then use this understanding to influence the design of a context aware system to be used while out on the town. We believe that the approach is of value more generally, particularly when achieving powerfully situated interactions is the design ambition.",

This article introduces a data mining system that extracts complex behavioral patterns from logged user actions to discover users' high-level strategies. Our application domain is an HCI study aimed at revealing users' strategies in an end-user debugging task and understanding how the strategies relate to gender and to success. We cast this problem as a sequential pattern discovery problem, where user strategies are manifested as sequential behavior patterns. Problematically, we found that the patterns discovered by standard data mining algorithms were difficult to interpret and provided limited information about high-level strategies. To help interpret the patterns as strategies, we examined multiple ways of clustering the patterns into meaningful groups. This collectively led to interesting findings about users' behavior in terms of both gender differences and debugging success. These common behavioral patterns were novel HCI findings about differences in males' and females' behavior with software, and were verified by a parallel study with an independent data set on strategies. As a research endeavor into the interpretability issues faced by data mining techniques, our work also highlights important research directions for making data mining more accessible to non-data-mining experts.",

    "abstract": "Science in general, and biomedical research in particular, is becoming more collaborative. As a result, collaboration with the right individuals, teams, and institutions is increasingly crucial for scientific progress. We propose Research Networking Systems (RNS) as a new type of system designed to help scientists identify and choose collaborators, and suggest a corresponding research agenda. The research agenda covers four areas: foundations, presentation, architecture, and evaluation. Foundations includes project-, institution- and discipline-specific motivational factors; the role of social networks; and impression formation based on information beyond expertise and interests. Presentation addresses representing expertise in a comprehensive and up-to-date manner; the role of controlled vocabularies and folksonomies; the tension between seekers' need for comprehensive information and potential collaborators' desire to control how they are seen by others; and the need to support serendipitous discovery of collaborative opportunities. Architecture considers aggregation and synthesis of information from multiple sources, social system interoperability, and integration with the user's primary work context. Lastly, evaluation focuses on assessment of collaboration decisions, measurement of user-specific costs and benefits, and how the large-scale impact of RNS could be evaluated with longitudinal and naturalistic methods. We hope that this article stimulates the human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and related communities to pursue a broad and comprehensive agenda for developing research networking systems.",

    "abstract": "Design and evaluation of user-generated media production and sharing in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) often focus on formal and informal media sharing, such as communication within social networks, automatic notifications of activities, and the exchange of digital artifacts. However, conceptual tools for understanding how people relate to the audiences they reach through these systems are limited. The increasing interest in user-generated content in HCI demands the infusion of new methods and theories that explicitly engage the construction and use of media within and among large groups of individuals and systems. In this paper, we suggest that the notion of “publics,” drawn from media theory, provides useful insights into user-driven, social, and cultural forms of technology use and digital content creation. We illustrate this by employing the notion of publics to the findings from a two-month deployment of a mobile photo sharing platform in a youth housing community. The results of this empirical work coupled with a theoretical examination of publics stimulate reflection on prevailing interpretations of user-designer-reader roles. The paper provides an outlook for potentially new and productive ways of understanding interdependencies within those activities. Implications that can be drawn from this work concern the role of digital media creation and sharing for the formation of collectives and how people position themselves collectively in relation to larger social groups and societal norms. The analysis suggests fruitful crossovers among HCI, Media Theory and New Media Research by approaching the user as both consumer and producer of digital content.",

Evidence from 140 participants, within three “in-the-wild” field-based learning case studies (for mobile, distributed, sensor and augmented reality systems), conceptualise the researchers’ “boundary creature” role in managing design process tensions. Stakeholders, including participants, expected the research projects to produce ready to wear (prêt-à-porter) boundary objects for current practices even when researchers sought to take catwalk approaches by innovating technologies and changing practices. The researcher design role (RDR) model articulates researchers’ narratives with the design team, stakeholders and users around what is innovated (e.g., technology, activities) and how the intervention changes or sustains current practices.",

We situate ideas of habit in relation to user experience and usefulness in interaction design, and draw on critical approaches to the concept of habit from cultural theory to understand the embedded, embodied, and situated contexts in our interactions with technologies. We argue that understanding technology habits as a process of reciprocal habituation in which people and technologies adapt to each other over time through design, adoption, and appropriation offers opportunities for research on user experience and interaction design within human-computer interaction, especially as newer gestural and motion control interfaces promise to reshape the ways in which we interact with computers.",

These programming environments, however, provide no support for tracking versions or provenance of mashups. We believe that versioning support can help end users create, understand, and debug mashups. To investigate this belief, we have added versioning support to a popular wire-oriented mashup environment, Yahoo! Pipes. Our enhanced environment, which we call “Pipes Plumber,” automatically retains versions of pipes and provides an interface with which pipe programmers can browse histories of pipes and retrieve specific versions. We have conducted two studies of this environment: an exploratory study and a larger controlled experiment. Our results provide evidence that versioning helps pipe programmers create and debug mashups. Subsequent qualitative results provide further insights into the barriers faced by pipe programmers, the support for reuse provided by our approach, and the support for debugging provided.",

    "abstract": "Highly reliable organizations (HROs) are those organizations, which by nature or design, cannot or must not fail; the consequences of failure in such systems are usually catastrophic. Systems that combine the characteristics of highly reliable operations and distributed, virtual organizations are known as highly reliable virtual organizations (HRVOs)—distributed and electronically linked groups of organizations that excel in high-consequence settings. Tsunami warning systems (TWS) are one example of virtual organizations that operate under enormous expectations for reliability. Adaptive structuration theory suggests that, in complex systems, technology and organizational structures co-evolve, and users adapt technology to their needs, creating shared meaning about the role and utility of technology in various settings. In this article, we consider how the shared meaning that develops in the social shaping of technology in one HRVO, tsunami warning systems, contributes to reliability enhancement. Following Poole and DeSanctis [2000], this study is a structuration study in a particular context, exploring how structuration occurs, the conditions that influence it, and its consequences or outcomes. We begin by describing HRVOs and the co-adaptive roles that technology and organizational structures play in such organizations. We then describe a global tsunami warning system as an illustrative case of a globally distributed sociotechnical system for which use of technology and distributed organizational structures should enhance reliability. We describe how social media plays a role in adaptive structuration in tsunami warning systems, and then return to consider the nature of HRVOs and their characteristics, en route to identifying challenges in the co-adaptation of technology and organizational structures in highly reliable tsunami warning systems.",

Two empirical studies were conducted with 280 students. The application domain was computer programming. Study 1 compared three DEGs of the Mini-Game genre, differing in a single GEAM attribute—time pressure vs. puzzle solving and abstract vs. realistic settings. Study 2 compared DEGs of different genres, which vary in the implementation of several GEAM attributes. None of the player characteristics were found to be statistically significant factors.

This interaction strategy is attracting increasing interest within sustainable HCI studies. While most of these consider how interactive technology can change household behavior, only a few report on how shifting is experienced in everyday life when assisted by automation. In this study, we investigate an interactive technology that assists households to shift electricity consumption to times when electricity is cheap or more sustainable. Our study was conducted as a long-term field deployment for 6--18 months with eight households, each living with an interactive prototype that shifts running times for a heat pump within user-defined boundaries. Our findings show that managing heat pumps toward assisted shifting was well-received by all households because it was a convenient way to shift electricity consumption. Shifting electricity use facilitated price savings of 6.8–16.9%. Nevertheless, our findings also reveal a conflict between the system design, and how householders actually interact with their heating system and experience assisted shifting. Based on the eight households’ experiences, we present three overall themes of convenience, control, and complexity that each describes different aspects of long-term real-life use of automatic technology assisting households to shift electricity use. We discuss the broader implications of these findings and the role of design and future sustainability technology in everyday life.",

    "abstract": "Assisted living technologies may help people live independently while also—potentially—reducing health and care costs. But they are notoriously difficult to implement at scale and many devices are abandoned following initial adoption. We report findings from a study of global positioning system (GPS) tracking devices intended to support the independent living of people with cognitive impairment. Our aims were threefold: to understand (through ethnography) such individuals’ lived experience of GPS tracking; to facilitate (through action research) the customization and adaptation of technologies and care services to provide effective, ongoing support; and to explore the possibilities for a co-production methodology that would enable people with cognitive impairment and their families to work with professionals and technical designers to shape these devices and services to meet their particular needs in a sustainable way. We found that the articulation work needed for maintaining the GPS technology in “working order” was extensive and ongoing. This articulation work does not merely supplement formal procedures, a lot of it is needed to get round them, but it is also often invisible and thus its importance goes largely unrecognized. If GPS technologies are to be implemented at scale and sustainably, methods must be found to capitalize on the skills and tacit knowledge held within the care network (professional and lay) to resolve problems, improve device design, devise new service solutions, and foster organizational learning.",

    "abstract": "Based on case studies from a heritage/museum context, I present and illustrate the notion of “spatio-contextual embedding,” which conceptualizes installation designs that augment real objects and environments while keeping these primary focuses of attention. Key for this “embeddedness” is that interaction is contextualized within a meaningful setting, creating relationships between system and environment. While retaining a focus on original objects or environments, it supports user's active engagement and sense making by inviting, enticing, or forcing them to draw connections. At the heart of this is “indexing”: mindful acts of referencing back-and-forth between here and there, connecting objects or representations. Analysis of case studies provides a repertoire of examples of “indexing,” and examples for high- and low-tech installation designs that foster drawing of connections. Two core values for design underpin the argument: (1) primacy of real objects and environments and (2) supporting human agency. The case examples highlight how technological arrangements may support or hinder indexing activity. This is condensed into potential design strategies. This article contributes to design knowledge on design for human agency, sense making, and mindful engagement with our environment. “Indexing” is relevant beyond the heritage setting domain, as part of HCI design in support of human agency.",

Employing a Research Through Design approach, we developed a portfolio of four hybrid gifting experiences: an augmented advent calendar; edible music tracks; personalized museum tours; and a narrated city walk. Our reflection addresses three concepts: hybrid wrapping where physical gifts become wrapped in digital media and vice versa; the importance of effortful interactions that are visible and pleasurable; and the need to consider social obligation, including opportunities for acknowledgement and reciprocation, dealing with embarrassment, and recognizing the distinction between giving and sharing. Our concepts provide guidance to practitioners who wish to design future gifting experiences while helping HCI researchers engage with the concept of gifting in a nuanced way.",

Our analysis supports the outcomes of earlier studies, but also furnishes novel insights into the scale and urgency of addressing the problem—with implications for user-centred design within this community.

We use a parameter optimisation approach to identify the parameters of an intermittent controller from experimental data, where users performed one-dimensional mouse movements in a reciprocal pointing task. Compared to previous published work with continuous control models, based on the Kullback–Leibler divergence from the experimental observations, IC is better able to generatively reproduce the distinctive dynamical features and variability of the pointing task across participants and over repeated tasks. IC is compatible with current physiological and psychological theory and provides insight into the source of variability in HCI tasks.",

In a randomised eye-tracking trial with 45 7-to-8-year-olds, we found that the readiness mechanic increased S&amp;T duration, that motion and colour cues proved equally effective at promoting S&amp;T, that combining symbolic colour with the readiness mechanic may have a cumulative effect, and that rewards/penalties may have distracted children from S&amp;T. Additionally, S&amp;T duration was related to in-game performance.

Through an 11-week mixed-method case study in an interaction design course with 40 undergraduate students and follow-up interviews, we found that activities based on the CIDER technique may have helped students identify increasingly many types of design bias over time and reflect on their unconscious biases about users. The activities also had lasting impacts, encouraging some students to adopt more inclusive approaches in subsequent design work. We discuss the implications of these findings, namely that educational techniques like CIDER can help designers learn to create equitable technology designs.",

    "abstract": "Optimal feedback control (OFC) is a theory from the motor control literature that explains how humans move their body to achieve a certain goal, e.g., pointing with the finger. OFC is based on the assumption that humans aim to control their body optimally, within the constraints imposed by body, environment, and task. In this paper, we explain how this theory can be applied to understanding Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in the case of pointing. We propose that the human body and computer dynamics can be interpreted as a single dynamical system. The system state is controlled by the user via muscle control signals, and estimated from observations. Between-trial variability arises from signal-dependent control noise and observation noise. We compare four different models from optimal control theory and evaluate to what degree these models can replicate movements in the case of mouse pointing. We introduce a procedure to identify parameters that best explain observed user behavior. To support HCI researchers in simulating, analyzing, and optimizing interaction movements, we provide the Python toolbox OFC4HCI. We conclude that OFC presents a powerful framework for HCI to understand and simulate motion of the human body and of the interface on a moment by moment basis.",

Results show that regardless of movement direction, ascending pitch enhances several body feelings and overall experience quality, while descending pitch increases movement acceleration. These effects were moderated by exercise physical demand. Sound and vibrotactile feedback enhanced flexibility and strength feelings, respectively, and contributed to exercise completion in different ways.

To supplement manual testing, automated tools can help developers and QA testers find basic accessibility issues, but they can be laborious to use or require writing dedicated tests. To motivate our work, we interviewed eight accessibility QA professionals at a large technology company. From these interviews, we synthesized three design goals for accessibility report generation systems. Motivated by these goals, we developed a system to generate whole app accessibility reports by combining varied data collection methods (e.g., app crawling, manual recording) with an existing accessibility scanner. Many such scanners are based on single-screen scanning, and a key problem in whole app accessibility reporting is to effectively de-duplicate and summarize issues collected across an app. To this end, we developed a screen grouping model with 96.9% accuracy (88.8% F1-score) and UI element matching heuristics with 97% accuracy (98.2% F1-score). We combine these technologies in a system to report and summarize unique issues across an app, and enable a unique pixel-based ignore feature to help engineers and testers better manage reported issues across their app’s lifetime. We conducted a user study where 19 accessibility engineers and testers used multiple tools to create lists of prioritized issues in the context of an accessibility audit. Our system helped them create lists they were more satisfied with while addressing key limitations of current accessibility scanning tools.",

We prioritized exploring this topic with families in low-socioeconomic status (SES) neighborhoods because they face increased barriers to being active due to inequities. Through our systems development, qualitative studies, and theoretical foundation, we developed the Socio-Cognitive Framework for Personal Health Informatics systems that shows how five socio-cognitive concepts (aspirations, data exposure, stories, belongingness, and impediments) influence self-efficacy and outcome expectations that are linked to health behavior. We then provide recommendations on how to design and evaluate such systems.

With the advent of multiuser interfaces, there is a need to provide access control in the user interface. We have developed a general framework for supporting access control in multiuser interfaces. It is based on the classical notion of an access matrix, a generalized editing-based model of user-application interaction, and a flexible model of user-user coupling. It has been designed to support flexible control of all significant shared operations, high-level specification of access control policies, and automatic and efficcent implementation of access control in a multiuser interface. It supports several new kinds of protected objects including sessions, windows, and hierarchical active variables; a large set of rights including not only the traditional semantic rights but also interaction and coupling rights; a set of inference rules for deriving default permissions; and a programming interface for implementing access control in multiuser interfaces. We have implemented the framework as part of a system called Suite.

    "abstract": "To define a hypermedia system's ease of use from the user's point of view, we propose three evaluation metrics: an interface shallowness metric, a downward compactness metric, and a downward navigability metric. These express both the cognitive load on users and the structural complexity of the hypermedia contents. We conducted a field study at the National Museum of Ethnology (NME) in Osaka, Japan, to evaluate our hypermedia system and to assess the suitability of our hypermedia metrics from the viewpoint of visiting members of the public. After developing a spreadsheet-type authoring system named HyperEX, we built prototype systems for use by members of the public visiting a special exhibition held at the museum. Questionnaires, interviews, automatic recording of users' navigation operations, and statistical analysis of 449 tested users yielded the following results. First, the suitability of the metrics was found to be satisfactory, indicating that they are useful for developing hypermedia systems. Second, there is a strong relationship between a system's enjoyability and its usability. Transparency and the friendliness of the user interface are the key issues in enjoyability. Finally, the quality of the video strongly affects the overall system evaluation. Video quality is determined by optimum selection of scenes, the length of the video, and appropriate audio-visual expression of the content. This video quality may become the most important issue in developing hypermedia for museum education.",

    "abstract": "Increasingly, people are being required to perform open-ended intellectual tasks that require discretionary decision making. These demands require a relatively unique approach to the design of computer-based support tools. A review of the characteristics associated with the global knowledge-based economy strongly suggests that there will be an increasing need for workers, managers, and organizations to adapt to change and novelty. This is equivalent to a call for designing computer tools that foster continuous learning. There are reasons to believe that the need to support adaptation and continuous learning will only increase. Thus, in the new millennium HCI should be concerned with explicitly designing for worker adaptation. The cognitive work analysis framework is briefly described as a potential programmatic approach to this practical design challenge.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have shown that many users do not acquire the knowledge necessary for the effective and efficient use of computer applications such as spreadsheets and Web-authoring tools. While many cognitive, cultural, and social reasons have been offered to explain this phenomenon, there have been few systematic attempts to address it. This article describes how we identified a framework to organize effective and efficient strategies to use computer applications and used an approach called strategy-based instruction to teach those strategies over five years to almost 400 students. Controlled experiments demonstrated that the instructional approach (1) enables students to learn strategies without harming command knowledge, (2) benefits students from technical and nontechnical majors, and (3) is robust across different instructional contexts and new applications. Real-world classroom experience of teaching strategy-based instruction over several instantiations has enabled the approach to be disseminated to other universities. The lessons learned throughout the process of design, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination should allow teaching a large number of users in many organizations to rapidly acquire the strategic knowledge to make more effective and efficient use of computer applications.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in rapid prototyping techniques such as 3D printing and laser cutting are changing the perception of physical 3D models in architecture and industrial design. Physical models are frequently created not only to finalize a project but also to demonstrate an idea in early design stages. For such tasks, models can easily be annotated to capture comments, edits, and other forms of feedback. Unfortunately, these annotations remain in the physical world and cannot easily be transferred back to the digital world. Our system, ModelCraft, addresses this problem by augmenting the surface of a model with a traceable pattern. Any sketch drawn on the surface of the model using a digital pen is recovered as part of a digital representation. Sketches can also be interpreted as edit marks that trigger the corresponding operations on the CAD model. ModelCraft supports a wide range of operations on complex models, from editing a model to assembling multiple models, and offers physical tools to capture free-space input. Several interviews and a formal study with the potential users of our system proved the ModelCraft system useful. Our system is inexpensive, requires no tracking infrastructure or per object calibration, and we show how it could be extended seamlessly to use current 3D printing technology.",

    "abstract": "As e-commerce has evolved into its second generation, where the available products are becoming more complex and their abundance is almost unlimited , the task of locating a desired choice has become too difficult for the average user. Therefore, more effort has been made in recent years to develop recommender systems that recommend products or services to users so as to assist in their decision-making process. In this article, we describe crucial experimental results about a novel recommender technology, called the preference-based organization (Pref-ORG), which generates critique suggestions in addition to recommendations according to users' preferences. The critique is a form of feedback (“I would like something cheaper than this one”) that users can provide to the currently displayed product, with which the system may better predict what the user truly wants. We compare the preference-based organization technique with related approaches, including the ones that also produce critique candidates, but without the consideration of user preferences. A simulation setup is first presented, that identified Pref-ORG's significantly higher algorithm accuracy in predicting critiques and choices that users should intend to make, followed by a real-user evaluation which practically verified its significant impact on saving users' decision effort.",

    "abstract": "Sociological appropriations of practice theory as applied to sustainable design have successfully problematized overly simplistic and individualistic models of consumer choice and behavior change. By taking everyday practices as the principal units of analysis, they move towards acknowledging the socially and materially structured nature of human activity. However, to inform sustainable HCI we also need to understand how practices are part of wider experiential environments and flows of practical activity. In this article, we develop an approach rooted in phenomenological anthropology and sensory ethnography. This approach builds on theories of place, perception and movement and enables us to situate practices, and understand practical activity, as emplaced within complex and shifting ecologies of things. Drawing on an interdisciplinary study of domestic energy consumption and digital media use, we discuss ethnographic and design practice examples. We demonstrate how this theoretical and methodological framework can be aligned with the 3rd paradigm of HCI.",

Devices are often unable to distinguish between intended touch (i.e., interaction on the screen intended for action) and unintended touch (i.e., incidental interaction from the palm, forearm, or fingers). This often results in stray ink strokes and accidental navigation, frustrating users. We present a data collection experiment where participants performed inking tasks, and where natural tablet and stylus behaviors were observed and analyzed from both digitizer and behavioral perspectives. An analysis and comparison of novel and existing unintended touch algorithms revealed that the use of stylus information can greatly reduce unintended touch. Our analysis also revealed many natural stylus behaviors that influence unintended touch, underscoring the importance of application and ecosystem demands, and providing many avenues for future research and technological advancement.",

    "abstract": "Empowering end-users to wire Internet of Things (IoT) objects (things and services) together would allow them to more easily conceive and realize interesting IoT solutions. A challenge lies in devising a simple end-user development approach to support the specification of transformations, which can bridge the mismatch in the data being exchanged among IoT objects. To tackle this challenge, we present Visual Simple Transformations (ViSiT) as an approach that allows end-users to use a jigsaw puzzle metaphor for specifying transformations that are automatically converted into underlying executable workflows. ViSiT is explained by presenting meta-models and an architecture for implementing a system of connected IoT objects. A tool is provided for supporting end-users in visually developing and testing transformations. Another tool is also provided for allowing software developers to modify, if they wish, a transformation's underlying implementation. This work was evaluated from a technical perspective by developing transformations and measuring ViSiT's efficiency and scalability and by constructing an example application to show ViSiT's practicality. A study was conducted to evaluate this work from an end-user perspective, and its results showed positive indications of perceived usability, learnability, and the ability to conceive real-life scenarios for ViSiT.",

    "abstract": "This essay has three parts. In Part 1, I review six biases that frame the way architects and human–computer interaction (HCI) practitioners think about their design problems. These arise from differences between working on procedurally complex tasks in peripersonal space like writing or sketching and being immersed in larger physical spaces where we dwell and engage in body-sized activity like sitting, chatting, and moving about. In Part 2, I explore three types of interface: classical HCI, network interfaces such as context-aware systems, and socio-ecological interfaces. An interface for an architect is a niche that includes the very people who interact with it. In HCI, people are still distinct from the interface. Because of this difference, architectural conceptions may be a fertile playground for HCI. The same holds for interactivity. In Part 3, I discuss why interactivity in HCI is symmetric and transitive. Only in ecological and social interaction is it also reflexive. In ecological interfaces, people co-create bubbles of joint awareness where they share highly situated values, experience, and knowledge.",

Findings from our study of the self-reported associations and meaningfulness of technological possessions revealed that the digital contents of these possessions were often the primary source of meaning. Technological possessions were frequently perceived as systems of products rather than as singular devices. We identified several design opportunities for materialising the associations ascribed to the digital information contained within technological products to more meaningfully integrate their physical and digital components.",

We build on the literature on UX, in particular UX at work, and extend it to ordinary UX at work. In a ten-day diary study, we collected data with a general UX instrument (AttrakDiff), a domain-specific instrument, and interviews. We find that AttrakDiff is valid at work; its three-factor structure of pragmatic quality, hedonic identification quality, and hedonic stimulation quality is recognizable in the growers’ responses. In this paper, UX at work is understood as interactions among technology, tasks, structure, and actors. Our data support the recent proposal for the ordinariness of UX at work. We find that during continued use UX at work is middle-of-the-scale, remains largely constant over time, and varies little across use situations. For example, the largest slope of the four AttrakDiff constructs when regressed over the ten days was as small as 0.04. The findings contrast existing assumptions and findings in UX research, which is mainly about extraordinary and positive experiences. In this way, the present study contributes to UX research by calling attention to the mundane, unremarkable, and ordinary user experiences at work.",

We found that experts perform around 800 keyboard shortcuts per day, which are not available on smartphones. Interviews revealed the lack of shortcuts as a major limitation that prevents mobile text editing. Therefore, we elicited gestures for the 22 most important shortcuts for smartphones that are touch-sensitive on the whole device surface. We implemented the gestures for a fully touch-sensitive smartphone using deep learning and evaluated them in realistic scenarios to gather feedback. We show that the developed prototype is perceived as intuitive and faster than recent commercial approaches.",

Cross-case analysis interpreted collaborative appropriation to encompass two interrelated processes of creating and adapting technological practices and negotiating and augmenting care relationships . Four driving forces were also proposed: motivating meanings that actors ascribe to the technology and its use; the learnability of the technology and actors’ resourcefulness ; the establishment of responsive and cooperative care practices ; and the qualities of empathy and shared power in care relationships . The importance of technological literacy, learning, meaning-making, and the nature and quality of care relationships are discussed.

The research involved experts performing real work (pathologists diagnosing cancer), using datasets that were up to 3,150 times larger than those used in previous studies that involved navigating images. The evaluation provides evidence about the effectiveness of the interfaces and characterizes how experts navigate gigapixel images when performing real work. Similar interfaces could be adopted in applications that use other types of high-resolution images (e.g., remote sensing or high-throughput microscopy).",

In this study, we focus on two of these techniques, i.e., offering tangible rewards and sending motivational messages to users. Past research has demonstrated the effects of these techniques in nudging recipients to increase their physical activity levels. However, the effect of these interventions on the intrinsic motivation of the participants has not yet been studied. We conducted a 10-month study involving 208 participants; this research consisted of a 3-month baseline (pre-phase), a 4-month experiment and a 3-month follow-up (post-phase). The participants were randomly assigned to one of the following three interventions: either they receive money ((i.) through a fixed incentive or (ii.) a lottery), or (iii.) informative messages. Their daily goal was to walk 10K steps. Through their smart phones, we recorded how many steps they walked every day. These interventions had no effect on the main outcome variable (i.e., the number of steps). However, the manipulations produced a detrimental effect on the intrinsic motivation of the participants, measured through a standardized questionnaire. This negative effect extended into the follow-up period. Our study reveals that tangible rewards and motivational messages decrease the intrinsic motivation of the participants, hence their connected physical activity. In our findings, we highlight the importance of intrinsic motivation in setting up healthy exercise routines that will be carried on autonomously by the participants after the period of the intervention. Finally, we present implications for the design of persuasive apps.",

Early detection of latent user interface problems can be facilitated by user-centered design methods that integrate formal verification technologies. This article considers the role that formal verification technologies can play in the context of user-centered design by considering the following three existing tools: CIRCUS, PVSio-web, and IVY. These tools have been developed to support the model based analysis of critical user interfaces. They have their foundations in existing formal verification technologies, but each of them is focused towards particular issues relating to user interface design. The article explores the different phases of the user-centered design process and the extent to which each of these tools supports these phases. Criteria are developed for assessing their role at each stage of the design process. The results of the evaluation provide guidance to developers to help choose the most appropriate tool based on their analysis needs while at the same time setting challenges for future developments.",

    "abstract": "Existing voice-based interfaces have limited support for text editing, especially when seeing the text is difficult, e.g., while walking or cooking. This research develops voice interaction techniques for eyes-free text editing. First, with a Wizard-of-Oz study, we identified two primary user strategies: using commands, e.g., “&lt;scps&gt;replace&lt;/scps&gt; go with goes ” and re-dictating over an erroneous portion, e.g., correcting “he go there” by saying “he goes there.” To support these user strategies with an actual system implementation, we developed two eyes-free voice interaction techniques, Commanding and Re-dictation , and evaluated them with a controlled experiment. Results showed that while Re-dictation performs significantly better for more semantically complex edits, Commanding is more suitable for making one-word edits, especially deletions. We developed VoiceRev to combine both the techniques in the same interface and evaluated it with realistic tasks. Results showed improved usability of the combined techniques over either of the two techniques used individually.",

    "abstract": "Upper-limb impairments due to stroke can severely affect the quality of life in patients. Scientific evidence supports that repetitive rehabilitation exercises can improve motor ability in stroke patients. Rehabilitation games gained tremendous interest among researchers and clinicians because of their potential to make the seemingly mundane, enduring rehabilitation therapies more engaging. However, routine and longitudinal use of rehabilitation games in real-world clinical settings has not been investigated in depth. Particularly, we know little about current practices, challenges, and their potential impacts on therapeutic outcomes. To address this gap, we established a partnership with a rehabilitation hospital where game-assisted rehabilitation was routinely employed over a 2-year period. We then conducted an observational study, in which we observed 11 game-assisted therapy sessions and interviewed 15 therapists who moderated the therapy. Significant findings include (1) different engagement patterns of stroke patients in game-assisted therapy, (2) imperative roles of therapists in moderating games and challenges that therapists face during game-assisted therapy, and (3) lack of support for therapists in delivering patient-centered, personalized therapy to individual stroke patients. Furthermore, we discuss design implications for more effective rehabilitation game therapies that take into consideration both patients and therapists and their specific needs.",

Even so, some places remain at the periphery, participating in this system without being fully absorbed by it. In this article, we take a detailed look at the economic life of such a “pericapitalist” [161] community in the Brazilian Amazon region. We detail how the community increasingly participates in global systems and supply chains, yet also organizes economic life around local and traditional values. We pay special attention to the role of digital technologies in the community, including mobile phones and internet. The contribution of the article is as follows: firstly, it provides a detailed analysis of the material practices of a community at the edge . Secondly, it draws attention to the heterogeneous nature of responses to global capitalism, formed from the relationship between specific material practices, new technology, and elements of cultural identity. Thirdly, it argues for an increased sensibility towards these different relations to capitalism when considering design implications. We argue that close attention to material practice goes some way towards resolving those tensions and, further, provides for an appeal to a more pluralistic views of culture and development [61].",

To address these problems, we adapted both formative and summative HCI methods to make them more suitable for programming language design. We integrated these methods into a new process, PLIERS, for designing programming languages in a user-centered way. We assessed PLIERS by using it to design two new programming languages. Glacier extends Java to enable programmers to express immutability properties effectively and easily. Obsidian is a language for blockchains that includes verification of critical safety properties. Empirical studies showed that the PLIERS process resulted in languages that could be used effectively by many programmers and revealed additional opportunities for language improvement.",

We present a self-observation of Tonglen , a Buddhist meditation technique for compassion, conducted over 12 weeks. We found that to keenly observe and document the practice, it is important to go through preparatory stages of stabilising attention and observing the mind. For the practitioner-cum-researcher, the technique should be embedded into a framework training self-observation and developing meta-awareness, supported by documentation of somatic snapshots and reflective journal writing. The first-person method of self-enquiry and account of self-evidence offer insight and directions for refining first-person approaches for future HCI research in body and mind cultivation, and design implications for interactive technologies supporting any practice with a contemplative component.",

For the analysis, we used the Think4EmCoDe research framework, a tool to foreground key aspects of an embodied co-design technique for children.

This is becoming increasingly relevant in services and operating systems. Previous research often focuses on specific recommendation tasks with data captured from interactions with an individual application. The quality of recommendations is also often evaluated addressing only computational measures of accuracy, without investigating the usefulness of recommendations in realistic tasks. The aim of this work is to synthesize the research in this area through a novel approach by (1) demonstrating comprehensive digital activity monitoring, (2) introducing entity-based computing and interaction, and (3) investigating the previously overlooked usefulness of entity recommendations and their actual impact on user behavior in real tasks. The methodology exploits context from screen frames recorded every 2 seconds to recommend information entities related to the current task. We embodied this methodology in an interactive system and investigated the relevance and influence of the recommended entities in a study with participants resuming their real-world tasks after a 14-day monitoring phase. Results show that the recommendations allowed participants to find more relevant entities than in a control without the system. In addition, the recommended entities were also used in the actual tasks. In the discussion, we reflect on a research agenda for entity recommendation in context, revisiting comprehensive monitoring to include the physical world, considering entities as actionable recommendations, capturing drifting intent and routines, and considering explainability and transparency of recommendations, ethics, and ownership of data.",

The flip side is that the integrity of the election can be compromised by adversarial attacks and malfunctioning voting infrastructure. Individual verifiability aims to protect against such risks by letting voters verify that their votes are correctly registered in the electronic ballot box. Therefore, voters need to carry out additional tasks making human factors crucial for security. In this article, we establish a categorization of individually verifiable Internet voting schemes based on voter interactions. For each category in our proposed categorization, we evaluate a voting scheme in a user study with a total of 100 participants. In our study, we assessed usability, user experience, trust, and further qualitative data to gain deeper insights into voting schemes. Based on our results, we conclude with recommendations for developers and policymakers to inform the choices and design of individually verifiable Internet voting schemes.",

The input factors include editors, their motivations, and the tools they use to support their work. The mediating factors include coordination, governance, leadership, conflict, newcomer socialization, and roles. The outcome focuses on measuring and predicting contribution quantity and quality. We hope our work serves as a road map for researchers who are interested in Wikipedia to learn about prior research and identify future research directions.",

    "abstract": "We introduce RadarHand, a wrist-worn wearable with millimetre wave radar that detects on-skin touch-based proprioceptive hand gestures. Radars are robust, private, small, penetrate materials, and require low computation costs. We first evaluated the proprioceptive and tactile perception nature of the back of the hand and found that tapping on the thumb is the least proprioceptive error of all the finger joints, followed by the index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and pinky finger in the eyes-free and high cognitive load situation. Next, we trained deep-learning models for gesture classification. We introduce two types of gestures based on the locations of the back of the hand: generic gestures and discrete gestures. Discrete gestures are gestures that start at specific locations and end at specific locations at the back of the hand, in contrast to generic gestures, which can start anywhere and end anywhere on the back of the hand. Out of 27 gesture group possibilities, we achieved 92% accuracy for a set of seven gestures and 93% accuracy for the set of eight discrete gestures. Finally, we evaluated RadarHand’s performance in real-time under two interaction modes: Active interaction and Reactive interaction. Active interaction is where the user initiates input to achieve the desired output, and reactive interaction is where the device initiates interaction and requires the user to react. We obtained an accuracy of 87% and 74% for active generic and discrete gestures, respectively, as well as 91% and 81.7% for reactive generic and discrete gestures, respectively. We discuss the implications of RadarHand for gesture recognition and directions for future works.",

Based on our analysis, we distinguish between manipulable and less manipulable criteria and compare politically diverse laypeople as end users and journalists as expert users. We discuss 11 widely recognized criteria, including the following 6 criteria that are difficult to manipulate: content, political alignment, authors, professional standards, what sources are used, and a website's reputation.

We identified two criteria that cognitive aids must satisfy to support these alerts: (1) context information must be entered in a timely, accurate, and standardized manner, and (2) task status must be accurately documented. Using co-design sessions and near-live simulations, we created two checklist features to satisfy these criteria: a form for entering the pre-hospital information and a progress slider for documenting the progression of a multi-step task. We evaluated these two features in the wild, contributing guidelines for designing these features on cognitive aids to support alerts and recommendations in time- and safety-critical scenarios.",

During reading, Marvista helps the user reflect on their understanding of each paragraph with AI-generated questions. After reading, Marvista generates an explainable human-AI summary that combines AI’s processing of the text, the user’s reading behavior, and user-generated data in the reading process.

    "abstract": "Videoconferencing has become a ubiquitous medium for collaborative work. It does suffer however from various drawbacks such as zoom fatigue. This paper addresses the quality of user experience by exploring an enhanced system concept with the capability of conveying gaze and attention. Gazing Heads is a round-table virtual meeting concept that uses only a single screen per participant. It enables direct eye contact, and signals gaze via controlled head rotation. The technology to realise this novel concept is not quite mature though, so we built a camera-based simulation for four simultaneous videoconference users. We conducted a user study comparing Gazing Heads with a conventional “Tiled View” video conferencing system, for 20 groups of 4 people, on each of two tasks. The study found that head rotation clearly conveys gaze and strongly enhances the perception of attention. Measurements of turn-taking behaviour did not differ decisively between the two systems (though there were significant differences between the two tasks). A novel insight in comparison to prior studies is that there was a significant increase in mutual eye contact with Gazing Heads, and that users clearly felt more engaged, encouraged to participate and more socially present. Overall, participants expressed a clear preference for Gazing Heads. These results suggest that fully implementing the Gazing Heads concept, using modern computer vision technology as it matures, could significantly enhance the experience of videoconferencing.",

In this work, we analyze the contemporary lifecycle of polymers consumed in FDM, a common and accessible fabrication technique. Then we outline the points of design intervention to reduce wasted polymers in fabrication. Specifically, we discuss the design intervention of Filament Wiring , a set of hybrid craft techniques to promote sustainable prototyping and robust applications by highlighting left-over filaments. Our techniques aim to enhance the understanding of filaments as a unique material for hybrid fabrication, fostering creativity. Through our computational design system, end users can generate 3D printable frames, for exploring the possibilities of filament-based fabrication beyond 3D printing. We hope to provoke thought about filament as its own form of material, having capabilities to be made, unmade, and remade repeatedly into various artifacts. With this outlook, we discuss future research avenues and urge makers and practitioners to value material in any form, quantity, or stage of its lifecycle.",

The versatility of this manufacturing technique, which readily supports a multi-layered structure, inclusion of several yarn types, malleability, and other valuable characteristics, has attracted attention from HCI researchers intrigued by its potential to expand the interaction capabilities of e-textiles. Research nonetheless has barely scratched the surface of the wealth of weaving techniques and woven structures available. Therefore, a design-research project anchored in practice investigated how touch-sensitive e-textiles’ capabilities might be enriched via advanced multi-layer weaving techniques. The research process, which drew inspiration from literature both on textile design and on woven e-textiles, produced 25 distinct e-textile samples. Results from evaluating the structural properties, electrical capabilities, and overall utility of each point to numerous unexplored opportunities from woven multi-layer e-textiles.

This aligns particularly well with practice-based design research and research through design (RtD), where uncertainties are pervasive and unavoidable due to the approach's interest in open-ended problems, contexts under transformation, and unknown futures. Building on the idea that uncertainties drive design activity, we describe the design process as framing acts where a designer-researcher moves along perceived uncertainties. We identify three dynamics for a generative mode of working with uncertainties that can make designers aware of uncertainties, circle in towards those that appear essential while seeking to avoid others, and stay with those that offer new perspectives. We exemplify these dynamics by drawing from our experiences from three RtD projects and highlight this viewpoint's value in providing new reflective tools for designer-researchers.",

Our online experiment () compared the effectiveness of a threat appeal (highlighting the negative consequences after passwords were breached) and a coping appeal (providing instructions on changing the breached password) in a 2 2 factorial design. Compared to the control condition, participants receiving the threat appeal were more likely to intend to change their passwords, and participants receiving both appeals were more likely to end up changing their passwords. Participants' password change behaviors are further associated with other factors, such as their security attitudes (SA-6) and time passed since the breach, suggesting that PMT-based interventions are useful but insufficient to fully motivate users to change their passwords. Our study contributes to PMT's application in security research and provides concrete design implications for improving compromised credential notifications.",

A crucial problem for these repositories remains timely and appropriate document access. In this article, we borrow a model from psychological research on human memory, which has long studied retrieval of memory items based on frequency and recency rates of past item occurrences. Specifically, the model uses frequency and recency rates of prior document accesses to predict future document requests. The model is illustrated by analyzing the log file of document accesses to the Georgia Institute of Technology World Wide Web (WWW) repository, a large multimedia respository exhibiting high access rates. Results show that the model predicts document access rates with a reliable degree of accuracy. We describe extensions to the basic approach that combine the recency and frequency analyses and which incorporate respository structure and document type. These results have implications for the formulation of descriptive user models of information access in large repositories. In addition, we sketch applications in the areas of design of information systems and interfaces and their document-caching algorithms.",

    "abstract": "A lot of research has been done within the area of mobile computing and context-awareness over the last 15 years, and the idea of systems adapting to their context has produced promising results for overcoming some of the challenges of user interaction with mobile devices within various specialized domains. However, today it is still the case that only a limited body of theoretically grounded knowledge exists that can explain the relationship between users, mobile system user interfaces, and their context. Lack of such knowledge limits our ability to elevate learning from the mobile systems we develop and study from a concrete to an abstract level. Consequently, the research field is impeded in its ability to leap forward and is limited to incremental steps from one design to the next. Addressing the problem of this void, this article contributes to the body of knowledge about mobile interaction design by promoting a theoretical approach for describing and understanding the relationship between user interface representations and user context. Specifically, we promote the concept of indexicality derived from semiotics as an analytical concept that can be used to describe and understand a design. We illustrate the value of the indexicality concept through an analysis of empirical data from evaluations of three prototype systems in use. Based on our analytical and empirical work we promote the view that users interpret information in a mobile computer user interface through creation of meaningful indexical signs based on the ensemble of context and system.",

As the demand for ubiquitous access to the web grows, potential benefits of mobile RAs have been recognized, albeit with little supporting empirical evidence. We investigate whether and how mobile RAs enhance users' decisions in retail stores by reducing the effort to make purchase decisions while augmenting the accuracy of the decisions. In addition, to identify potential design principles for mobile RAs, we compare and evaluate two interaction styles of mobile RAs: alternative-driven (RA-AL) versus attribute-driven (RA-AT) interactions. The results of a laboratory experiment conducted in a simulated store indicate that mobile RAs reduced users' perceived effort and increased accuracy of their decisions. Furthermore, RA-AL users made more accurate decisions than RA-AT users due to the RA-AL's interaction style, which was compatible with the way in which users processed information and made decisions in the store. These empirical results support the notion that mobile RAs should be designed to fit the user's task undertaken in the particular context.",

We further propose a new scheme for real-time two-dimensional visualization of classification outcomes using Wachspress coordinate interpolation. It allows us to represent classification outcomes for n classes in simple regular polygons. Our objective is to devise a BCI system that constitutes a practical interaction modality that can be deployed rapidly and used on a regular basis. We apply our system to an event-based control task in the form of a simple shooter game in which we evaluate the learning effect induced by our architecture compared to a classical approach. We also evaluate how much user feedback and our visualization method contribute to the performance of the system.",

To explain these findings, we present an inductive analysis of the data through a phenomenological lens to pinpoint what causes such behavior. Our analysis extends our understanding of how to design for social embodied interaction, pointing to how we need to embrace the tension between self-reflection and shared experience, making inward listening and social expression visible acts, accessible to social construction and understanding. It entails experiencing our embodied self as others experience us in order to build a dialogue.",

However, the book uses examples from a laboratory study and contains criticisms of ethnography. This article explores how and why Suchman carried out a laboratory study. Based upon this exploration, it argues that social analysis in HCI does not necessitate fieldwork outside the laboratory. More broadly, the paper argues that an appreciation of Plans and Situated Actions can help in moving towards forms of social analysis that span both the laboratory and the world outside. If there is to be a “turn to the wild” in HCI, this should not be a turn away from the laboratory but a turn away from research methods that ignore human practice. This is not to defend laboratory experiments, but to defend laboratory-based studies that explicate technology in practice.",

    "abstract": "A multi-user tabletop interface was designed to support reconciliation of a conflict aimed at shifting hostile attitudes and achieving a greater understanding of another viewpoint. The interface provided a setting for face-to-face shared narration and support for the management of disagreements. The interface allows for escalation and de-escalation of the conflict emerging in the shared narration and requires that participants perform joint actions when a contribution to the story is to be removed from the overall narration. A between-subjects experiment compared the tabletop interface and a desktop multimedia interface with mixed pairs (male Israeli-Jewish and Palestinian-Arab youth). The results demonstrated that the experience with the tabletop interface appears to be motivating and, most importantly, produces at least a short-term shift of attitude toward the other.",

This involves adorning them with decorative patterns that enhance their beauty while triggering digital interactions when scanned with cameras. These are realized using an existing augmented reality technique that embeds computer readable codes into the topological structures of hand-drawn patterns. We describe a research through design process that engaged artisans to craft a portfolio of interactive artefacts, including ceramic bowls, embroidered gift cards, fabric souvenirs, and an acoustic guitar. We annotate this portfolio with reflections on the crafting process, revealing how artisans addressed pattern, materials, form and function, and digital mappings throughout their craft process. Further reflection on our portfolio reveals how they bridged between human and system perceptions of visual patterns and engaged in a deep embedding of digital interactions into physical materials. Our findings demonstrate the potential for interactive decoration, distilling the craft knowledge involved in creating aesthetic and functional decoration, highlight the need for transparent computer vision technologies, and raise wider issues for HCI’s growing engagement with craft.",

Implementing and prototyping such games present non-trivial technical challenges to interaction and game designers; this hampers iterative prototyping and testing cycles that are core to user-centred design and game development processes. This insight has motivated the development of RaPIDO (Rapid prototyping of Physical Interaction Design for Outdoor games), a prototyping platform for physical computing, targeting interaction designers with limited electronics or software skills. RaPIDO has been evaluated in a user test, evaluating RaPIDOs software library, and in a case study involving two designers who used it to develop outdoor games for children. We illustrate how RaPIDO enabled broader exploration of the design space and faster iterations than would otherwise be possible, allowing designers to focus on the core game concepts rather than complex and low-level engineering issues.",

The novice model has 29 rules and 1,152 declarative memory task elements (chunks)—it learns to create procedural knowledge to perform the task. The expert model has 617 rules and 614 task chunks (that it does not use) and 538 command string chunks—it gets slightly faster through limited declarative learning of the command strings and some further production compilation; there are a range of intermediate models. These models were tested against aggregate and individual human learning data, confirming the models’ predictions.

Less attention, however, has focused on the role of the environment in fabrication processes. By understanding how interactions with tools, fixtures, materials, and spaces shape workflows, we can better determine how to design the next generation of workshops, design tools, and fabrication equipment to support personal fabrication activities. To build this understanding, site visits and interviews at local makerspaces, fabrication studios, and workshops were conducted. These visits uncovered the rich practices and roadblocks generated by workshops today. The observations identified the importance of spatial layouts, territoriality and occupant agency, distributed knowledge, and organizational flux, among others, to design and fabrication processes. These observations were further synthesized into one possible direction for such spaces: hybrid workshops (i.e., environments that can leverage computation and responsive architecture to enhance a maker's ability to design and fabricate). This work identifies how such spaces could harness the rich practices and eliminate the challenges found with workshops today and discusses the technical innovations and philosophical questions that hybrid workshops will pose to the future of personal fabrication.",

    "abstract": "Human--building interaction (HBI) is converging the fields of architecture and interaction design, leading to new and interesting tensions in perspectives and methodological approaches. One such tension is related to temporal constraints. Architecture and interaction design typically produce outcomes with very different lifetime expectancies and, predominantly, use methods with very different pace. As an example, fast, iterative approaches of contemporary interaction design, consisting of frequent updates and redesigns, contrasts with much slower, plan-driven and long-term vision driven approaches within architecture. One question emerging from this tension is how to meaningfully combine perspectives and approaches. One suggestion, among others, has been that interaction design methods such as participatory design can be used to heighten the involvement of inhabitants and other stakeholders in continuous adaptations of the buildings they inhabit. While an interesting proposal, we believe that methodological considerations only partly address the complexity of the tension at play from the different lifetime expectancies of buildings and interactive computer systems. Unfolding this complexity further, we therefore propose a framework of temporal constraints at three levels of abstraction: (1) rationale, (2) method, and (3) outcome. Inspired by previous work, we discuss temporal constraints in HBI at these levels. We argue that designing for HBI requires an understanding of temporally constrained design conventions that apply meaningfully to both the short term and long term.",

In many situations, a visual feedback is provided during the delay to manage expectations. This feedback is usually provided through progress bars, percentages, or countdowns, depending on design limitations such as screen size. In this article, we use 15-second delays and examine (a) how delays affect users’ decision-making and task satisfaction, and (b) how to manipulate time perception to reduce the negative consequences of delays. Experiment 1 ( N =421) shows that faster countdowns increase task satisfaction and lead to more rational decisions in the subsequent task. In Experiment 2, we investigate the effect of countdown speed on delay perception and recall ( N =531). We show that faster countdowns lead to shorter perceived delays, while the delay will be recalled as longer after the task. The opposite is obtained for slower countdowns. We also increased the countdown rate and found a limit for the effect of increased speed. Thus, designers have to trade-off between how delays are perceived at the moment of experience and how they are recalled. We discuss the implications of these findings for user interface design.",

Second, we found the key motives inspiring online sports viewing include the following: sharing feelings/thoughts, wanting to be entertained, sharing information, and wanting to feel membership in a group. Third, these motives were significantly related to specific usage patterns.

This article presents a concept to provide precise micro-navigation instructions through a tactile around-the-head display. Our system presents four tactile patterns for fundamental navigation instructions in conjunction with continuous directional guidance. We followed an iterative, user-centric approach to design the patterns for the fundamental navigation instructions, combined them with a continuous directional guidance stimulus, and tested our system with 13 sighted (blindfolded) and 2 blind participants in an obstacle course, including stairs. We optimized the patterns and validated the final prototype with another five blind participants in a follow-up study. The system steered our participants successfully with a 5.7 cm average absolute deviation from the optimal path. Our guidance is only a little less precise than the usual shoulder wobbling during normal walking and an order of magnitude more precise than previous tactile navigation systems. Our system allows various new use cases of micro-navigation for people with visual impairments, e.g., preventing collisions on a sidewalk or as an anti-veering tool. It also has applications in other areas, such as personnel working in low-vision environments (e.g., firefighters).",

We conduct two experiments to demonstrate that reliance on a predictive algorithm following a substantial error is affected by (i) when the error occurs and (ii) how the algorithm is used in the decision-making process. We find that the impact of an error on reliance depends on whether the error occurs early (i.e., when users first start using the algorithm) or late (i.e., after users have used the algorithm for an extended period). While an early error results in substantial and persistent reliance reduction, a late error affects reliance only temporarily and to a lesser extent. However, when users have more control over how to use the algorithm’s predictions, error timing ceases to have a significant impact. Our work advances the understanding of algorithm aversion and informs the practical design of algorithmic decision-making systems.",

In this article, we present the results of semi-structured interviews with 46 older adults aged 65+ about their views on information collection, transmission, and sharing. We develop a detailed model of the contextual factors that combine in complex ways to affect older adults’ decision making about information sharing.

We recruited 35 patients of the UK’s National Health Service and evaluated their acceptance through three online questionnaires and a post-study interview. We assessed the clinical feasibility of the Mood Monitor by comparing clinical, usage, and acceptance metrics obtained from the 35 patients with a smartwatch with those from an additional 34 patients without a smartwatch (digital treatment as usual). Findings showed that the smartwatch app was highly accepted by patients, revealed which factors facilitated and impeded this acceptance, and supported clinical feasibility. We provide guidelines for the design of self-monitoring on a smartwatch and reflect on the conduct of human-computer interaction research evaluating user acceptance of mental health technologies.",

We describe a series of experiments with inhabited television, beginning with the NOWninety6 poetry performance, The Mirror, and Heaven &amp; Hell—Live. These early experiments raised fundamental questions for inhabited television concerning the extent to which it is possible to establish fast-paced social interaction within a CVE, and to which it is possible to produce a coherent and engaging broadcast of this action. We then present a fourth more recent experiment, Out of This World, that directly addressed these questions. We describe how the formulation of inhabited television design principles, combined with the use of dedicated production software for scripting and directing a show and for controlling virtual cameras, enabled us to create a fast-moving and more coherent experience.",

These techniques include separating the control-flow aspects of the application and user interface: they are concurrent and may contain many threads. Chiron also separates windowing and look-and-feel issues from dialogue and abstract presentation decisions via mechanisms employing a client-server architecture. To separate application code from user interface code, user interface agents called artists are attached to instances of application abstract data types (ADTs). Operations on ADTs within the application implicitly trigger user interface activities within the artists. Multiple artists can be attached to ADTs, providing multiple views and alternative forms of access and manipulation by either a single user or by multiple users. Each artist and the application run in separate threads of control. Artists maintain the user interface by making remote calls to an abstract depiction hierarchy in the Chiron server, insulting the user interface code from the specifics of particular windowing systems and toolkits. The Chiron server and clients execute in separate processes. The client-server architecture also supports multilingual systems: mechanisms are demonstrated that support clients written in programming languages other than that of the server while nevertheless supporting object-oriented server concepts. The system has been used in several universities and research and development projects. It is available by anonymous ftp.",

We used a computational model of phone-based interaction (PBI USER) to generate predictions about the impact of three factors on WM failure:PBI features (i.e. menu structure), individual differences (i.e., WM capacity), and task characteristics (i.e., number of tasks). Our computational model stipulates that both the storage and the processing of information contribute to WM failure. In practical terms the model and the empirical results indicate that, contrary to guidelines for the design of phone-based interfaces, deep menu hierarchies (no more than three options per menu) do not reduce WM error rates in PBI. At a more theoretical level, the study shows that the use of a computational model in HCI research provides a systematic approach for explaining complex empirical results.",

We report here on TopicShop , a system that mines information from the structure and content of Web pages and provides an exploratory information workspace interface. We carried out experiments that yielded positive answers to both evaluation questions. First, a number of automatically computable features about Web sites do a good job of predicting expert quality judgments about sites. Second, compared to popular Web search interfaces, the TopicShop interface to this information lets users select significantly more high-quality sites, in less time and with less effort, and to organize the sites they select into personally meaningful collections more quickly and easily. We conclude by discussing how our results may be applied and considering how they touch on general issues concerning quality, expertise, and consensus.",

Conceptually, our approach uses a set of “meta-interfaces”—agreements on how to exchange new behaviors necessary to achieve compatibility at runtime , rather than requiring that communication specifics be built in at development time —to allow devices on the network to interact with one another. While this approach to interoperability can remove many of the system-imposed constraints that prevent fluid, ad hoc use of devices now, it imposes its own limitations on the user experience of systems that use it. Most importantly, since devices may be expected to work with peers about which they have no detailed semantic knowledge, it is impossible to achieve the sort of tight semantic integration that can be obtained using other approaches today, despite the fact that these other approaches limit interoperability. Instead, under our model, users must be tasked with performing the sense-making and semantic arbitration necessary to determine how any set of devices will be used together. This article describes the motivation and details of our infrastructure, its implications on the user experience, and our experience in creating, deploying, and using applications built with it over a period of several years.",

We coin the term Computer Supported Access Control (CSAC) to emphasize this perspective. On a methodological level, we discuss empirical investigations of access control behavior from a situated action perspective. We discovered a differentiated set of social practices around traditional access control systems.

Experimental evaluation showed the system effectiveness using variable or one-time passwords. All of these attributes qualify the proposed system to be effectively deployed as a static authentication mechanism. Extensive experimentation was done using 2740 sessions collected from 274 users. To measure the performance, a computational statistics model was specially designed and used; a statistical classifier based on Weighted-Sum produced an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 2.11%.",

Drawing on theories of practice, it proposes that practice-oriented design approaches should: involve bodily performance, create crises of routine and generate a variety of performances. These guidelines were integrated into a Generative Improv Performances (GIP) approach, entailing a series of performances by improvisation actors with low-fidelity prototypes in a lab environment. The approach was implemented in an empirical study on bathing. Although the empirical example does not deal with common types of interactive technologies, the guidelines and GIP approach offer sustainable HCI a way to think beyond immediate interactions and to conceptualize change on a practice level.",

Evaluating such applications requires testing a large pool of participants to capture the diversity of experience, but traditional usability testing can be prohibitively expensive. To address this problem, this article contributes a new usability evaluation method called backtracking analysis, designed to automate the process of detecting and characterizing usability problems in creation-oriented applications. The key insight is that interaction breakdowns in creation-oriented applications often manifest themselves in backtracking operations that can be automatically logged (e.g., undo and erase operations). Backtracking analysis synchronizes these events to contextual data such as screen capture video, helping the evaluator to characterize specific usability problems. The results from three experiments demonstrate that backtracking events can be effective indicators of usability problems in creation-oriented applications, and can yield a cost-effective alternative to traditional laboratory usability testing.",

In a controlled experiment, we test the performance implications of using single computer-generated Text-To-Speech (TTS) voice and multiple matching TTS voices while users respond to e-mails with varying levels of complexity during driving. Our results indicate that the number of voices used has a significant effect on both driving performance and handling e-mail--related activities.

    "abstract": "The busyness of daily life makes it difficult to find time for informal learning. Yet, learning requires significant time and effort, with repeated exposures to educational content on a recurring basis. Despite the struggle to find time, there are numerous moments in a day that are typically wasted due to waiting, such as while waiting for the elevator to arrive, wifi to connect, or an instant message to arrive. We introduce the concept of wait-learning : automatically detecting wait time and inviting people to learn while waiting. Our approach is to design seamless interactions that augment existing wait time with productive opportunities. Combining wait time with productive work opens up a new class of software systems that overcome the problem of limited time. In this article, we establish a design space for wait-learning and explore this design space by creating WaitSuite, a suite of five different wait-learning apps that each uses a different kind of waiting. For one of these apps, we conducted a feasibility study to evaluate learning and to understand how exercises should be timed during waiting periods. Subsequently, we evaluated multiple kinds of wait-learning in a two-week field study of WaitSuite with 25 people. We present design implications for wait-learning, and a theoretical framework that describes how wait time, ease of accessing the learning task, and competing demands impact the effectiveness of wait-learning in different waiting scenarios. These findings provide insight into how wait-learning can be designed to minimize interruption to ongoing tasks and maximize engagement with learning.",

    "abstract": "As computing devices become increasingly ubiquitous, it is now possible to combine the unique capabilities of different devices or Internet of Things to accomplish a task. However, there is currently a high technical barrier for creating cross-device interaction. This is especially challenging for end users who have limited technical expertise—end users would greatly benefit from custom cross-device interaction that best suits their needs. In this article, we present Improv, a cross-device input framework that allows a user to easily leverage the capability of additional devices to create new input methods for an existing, unmodified application, e.g., creating custom gestures on a smartphone to control a desktop presentation application. Instead of requiring developers to anticipate and program these cross-device behaviors in advance, Improv enables end users to improvise them on the fly by simple demonstration, for their particular needs and devices at hand. We showcase a range of scenarios where Improv is used to create a diverse set of useful cross-device input. Our study with 14 participants indicated that on average it took a participant 10 seconds to create a cross-device input technique. In addition, Improv achieved 93.7% accuracy in interpreting user demonstration of a target UI behavior by looking at the raw input events from a single example.",

We then dissimulate the synchronicity in the game mechanics by using priming to mask the training instruction (implicit stimuli). We conduct an evaluation of the effects on game experience compared to standard BCI training on 36 subjects. We use the game experience questionnaire (GEQ) coupled with reliability analysis (Cronbach's alpha). The integration does not change the feeling of competence (3/4). However, flow and immersion increase sizably with explicit training integration (2.78 and 2.67/4 from 1.79/4 and 1.52/4) and even more with the implicit training integration (3.27/4 and 3.12/4).",

    "abstract": "Novices learn innovation best through project-based learning (PBL), working in face-to-face teams to tackle real-world problems. Yet, real-world projects are complex, stressful, and especially challenging for novices. Online communities could provide social support to motivate novices, but it is unclear how to design online communities to support face-to-face PBL teams. Here we ask: How might we design an online system that enlists external supporters to provide online social support to motivate PBL students? Our need-finding study found that PBL students received infrequent social support, rarely engaged in help-seeking, and perceived little progress until the end of their projects. Based on these findings, we designed CheerOn , an online social support system that prompts novice student teams to externalize progress allowing external, online supporters to offer social support. We tested CheerOn with 3 PBL teams and 15 external supporters over a 6-week course. We found that external supporters provided instrumental, informational, and emotional support that strengthened students’ bonds to the community, which increased help-seeking. Supporters also provided appraisal support, which increased students’ perceived value of their work. Supporters were more likely to offer informational and instrumental support when they were promoted or saw a clear need for help; supporters who received gratitude from students were more likely to offer emotional support in return; and supporters who were closely connected to the community were more likely to offer appraisal and instrumental support. Theoretically, this research contributes to our understanding of how hybrid face-to-face and online communities can impact the behavior of PBL students, specifically towards the facilitation of help-seeking behavior, as well as increased understanding of how different types of social support (i.e., appraisal, emotional, informational, and instrumental) can impact the participation of PBL students and supporters. Practically, this research contributes to our understanding of how to design socio-technical systems that facilitate social support for offline novice PBL students working, expanding the instructional resources available for preparing novices in PBL environments.",

    "abstract": "Researchers are building Internet of Things (IoT) systems that aim to raise users’ privacy awareness, so that these users can make informed privacy decisions. However, there is a lack of empirical research on the practical implications of informed privacy decision-making in IoT. To gain deeper insights into this question, we conducted an online study ( N = 488) of people’s privacy decision-making as well as their levels of privacy awareness toward diverse IoT service scenarios. Statistical analysis on the collected data confirmed that people who are well aware of potential privacy risks in a scenario tend to make more conservative and confident privacy decisions. Machine learning (ML) experiments also revealed that individuals overall privacy awareness is the most important feature when predicting their privacy decisions. We verified that ML models trained on privacy decisions made with confidence can produce highly accurate privacy recommendations for users (area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 87%). Based on these findings, we propose functional requirements for privacy-aware systems to facilitate well-informed privacy decision-making in IoT, which results in conservative and confident decisions that enjoy high consistency.",

One method that has not yet seen widespread use is the educational campaign: large-scale, short-term events focused on a specific educational topic, such as the Hour of Code campaign. These are designed to generate media coverage and lend themselves nicely to collaborative or competitive goals, thus potentially leveraging social effects and community excitement to increase engagement and reach students who otherwise would not participate. In this article, we present a case study of three such campaigns that we ran to encourage students to play an algebra game—DragonBox Adaptive: the Washington, Norway, and Minnesota Algebra Challenges.

    "abstract": "In this article, a design research approach is taken to investigate expressive design of tactile interactions. Most research efforts to date on designing and exploring the representational aspects of tactile interfaces have focused on usability and task-oriented scenarios. Yet, there is limited knowledge on how to aid the design of tactile interfaces that support the design of expressive or user-experience-oriented tactile interactions. We address this gap by studying tactile designs in a multisensory context, where the tactile interface augments works of visual art. The expressive and artistic context introduces new opportunities to extend on previous work, and identify new design and interaction potentials with tactile interfaces in graphical multisensory scenarios. During one-on-one guided design sessions, visual artists were asked to create tactile design prototypes that augmented one of their existing works. Each element of the overall tactile design, regarded as a tactile feature , was analyzed using both the bottom-up and top-down approaches. The results discovered through grounded theory are presented and discussed with respect to semiotic theory. Accordingly, tactile constructs and tactile intents define the “form” and “meaning” components of each tactile feature, respectively. Overall analysis of the findings indicates associations among the identified categories and between the two components, leading to design implications for expressive tactile interfaces. Insights from the tactile intents suggest a set of affordances for expressive visuotactile interactions, which we introduce under the notion of expressive roles . Additionally, implications from the tactile constructs indicate a design space for an expressive tactile augmentation design tool, based on which a user interface architecture is proposed. Findings from this research can assist in developing systems and tools for expressive tactile interface design and inspire research in user experience and behavior in multisensory tactile interaction scenarios.",

This research captures the interactions between older adult couples where one or both have memory concerns—a primary feature of cognitive decline—as they make decisions on how to safeguard their online activities using a Safety Setting probe we designed, and over the course of several informal interviews and a diary study. Throughout, couples demonstrated a collaborative mentality to which we apply a frame of citizenship in opensource collaboration, specifically (a) histories of participation , (b) lower barriers to participation, and (c) maintaining ongoing contribution. In this metaphor of collaborative enterprise, one partner (or member of the couple) may be the service provider and the other may be the participant, but at varying moments, they may switch roles while still maintaining a collaborative focus on preserving shared assets and freedom on the internet. We conclude with a discussion of what this service provider-contributor mentality means for empowerment through citizenship, and implications for vulnerable populations’ cybersecurity.",

The potential of this paradigm is demonstrated through three prototypes: Inter-Dream, a system that integrates with the brain's autonomic physiological processes to drive users toward healthy sleep states; Neo-Noumena, a system that integrates with the user's affective neurophysiology to augment the interpersonal communication of emotion; and PsiNet, a system that integrates interpersonal brain activity to amplify human connection. Studies of these prototypes demonstrate the benefits of the integration paradigm in realizing the multifaceted benefits of BCI systems, and this work presents the brain-computer integration framework to help guide designers of future BCI integrations.",

The results showed that all visualized gaze cues facilitated the initiation of informal communication more effectively than the non-visualized gaze cue. For one-sided gaze, overall, bubbles had more positive effects on the gaze receiver's behaviors and experiences than the other two visualized gaze cues, although the only statistically significant difference was in the verbal reaction rates. For joint gaze, all three visualized gaze cues had positive effects on the receiver's behaviors and experiences. The design implications of the gaze visualization and the confederate-based evaluation method contribute to research on informal communication and social virtual reality.",

In addition, we developed head-worn demonstration prototypes to practically explore the concept of active VNC with selected scenarios in a user study.

We propose a scene taxonomy based on the visual structure and task within a VE by drawing on literature from cognitive psychology and computer vision, as well as virtual reality (VR) applications. We demonstrate how the taxonomy can be used by applying it to an accessibility problem, namely limited head mobility. We used the taxonomy to classify existing scene-viewing techniques and generate three new techniques that do not require head movement. In our evaluation of the techniques with 16 participants, we discovered that participants identified trade-offs in design considerations such as accessibility, realism, and spatial awareness, that would influence whether they would use the new techniques. Our results demonstrate the potential of the scene taxonomy to help designers reason about the relationships between VR interactions, tasks, and environments.",

To this end, we carried out a study with 11- to 12-year-old Scottish children to reveal their mental models of dark patterns. They were acutely aware of online deception, referring to deployers as being ‘up to no good.’ Yet, they were overly vigilant and construed worst-case outcomes, with even a benign warning triggering suspicion. We recommend that rather than focusing on specific instances of dark patterns in awareness raising, interventions should prioritise improving children’s understanding of the characteristics of, and the motivations behind, deceptive online techniques.

This automates the development of graphical editors that support the intelligent diagram metaphor. It takes a grammatical specification of a particular diagram language and generates an editor specialized for the creation, manipulation and parsing of diagrams in that visual language. We extend previous research in this area by allowing more expressive grammars, performing automatic error correction, and detailing how efficient incremental parsing has been achieved. We also provide an empirical evaluation of the system. This shows that the system can be used to generate customized editors for a wide variety of diagram languages, ranging from state transition diagrams to mathematical equations, with real-time incremental parsing and error correction.",

    "abstract": "This article proposes a cognitive framework describing the software development process in object-oriented design (OOD) as building internal representations and developing rules. Rule development (method construction) is performed in two problem spaces: a rule space and an instance space. Rules are generated, refined, and evaluated in the rule space by using three main cognitive operations: Infer, Derive, and Evoke. Cognitive activities in the instance space are called mental simulations and are used in conjunction with the Infer operation in the rule space. In an empirical study with college students, we induced different representations to the same problem by using problem isomorphs. Initially, subjects built a representation based on the problem description. As rule development proceeded, the initial internal representation and designed objects were refined, or changed if necessary, to correspond to knowledge gained during rule development. Differences in rule development processes among groups created final designs that are radically different in terms of their level of abstraction and potential reusability. The article concludes by discussing the implications of these results for object-oriented design.",

These requirements can become problems in that the web is visually centric with regard to presentation and information order/layout. Finding semantic information already encoded directly into documents can help to alleviate these problems. Our approach can be loosely described as follows. For a particular cascading stylesheet (CSS), we provide an extension to an upper-level ontology which represents the interface between web documents and the programmatic transformation mechanism. This extension gives the particular characteristics of the elements appearing in that specific CSS. We can consider this extension to be an annotation of the CSS elements implicitly encoded into the web document. This means that one ontology can be used to accuratly transform every web document that references the CSS used to generate that ontology. Simply one ontology accuratly transforms an entire site using a generalized programmatic machinery able to cope with all sites using CSS.

The need for interoperability in emergency communication systems has hastened the development of interoperable communication technology that is an enabling technology to automatically identify environmental variables including appropriate radio frequencies and to connect different networks used by different organizations. Even though the technology has been researched from many perspectives and has shown that is possible to connect different organizations, there still remain many issues in terms of socio-cognitive aspects. Thus, this study examines the socio-cognitive dimensions of interoperability, which equal the technical dimensions of the problem in importance. The existential-phenomenological study reported here used semistructured interviews to reconceptualize interoperability in the public safety communication domain. Based on 11 interviews with public safety workers, five important factors were identified that have a major impact on the effectiveness of interoperable groups: information sharedness, operational awareness, communication readiness, adaptiveness, and coupledness. Based on these main concepts, high-level suggestions are provided to guide the design of a new public safety communication system. The results can be directly applied to identify the requirements of communication systems and can be extended to design collaboration systems under stressful environments.",

We describe links between walking, sociality, and using resources in a case study of community-based, solar, cellphone charging in villages in South Africa's Eastern Cape. Like 360 million rural Africans, inhabitants of these villages are poor and, like 25% and 92% of the world, respectively, do not have domestic electricity or own motor vehicles. We describe nine practices in using the charging stations we deployed. We recorded 700 people using the stations, over a year, some regularly. We suggest that the way we frame practices limits insights about them, and consider various routines in using and sharing local resources to discover relations that might also feature in charging. Specifically, walking interconnects routines in using, storing, sharing and sustaining resources, and contributes to knowing, feeling, wanting and avoiding as well as to different aspects of sociality, social order and perspectives on sustainability. Along the way, bodies acquire literacies that make certain relationalities legible. Our study shows we cannot assert what sustainable practice means a priori and, further, that detaching practices from bodies and their paths limits solutions, at least in rural Africa. Thus, we advocate a more \"alongly\" integrated approach to data about practices.",

With continuous ambiguous text entry methods, letter selections are treated as ambiguous due to expected imprecision rather than due to discretized letter groupings. We investigate the simple case of a one-dimensional character layout to demonstrate the potential of techniques designed for imprecise entry. Our rotation-based sight-free technique, Rotext, maps device orientation to a layout optimized for disambiguation, motor efficiency, and learnability. We also present an audio feedback system for efficient selection of disambiguated word candidates and explore the role that time spent acknowledging word-level feedback plays in text entry performance. Through a user study, we show that despite missing on average by 2.46--2.92 character positions, with the aid of a maximum a posteriori (MAP) disambiguation algorithm, users can average a sight-free entry speed of 12.6wpm with 98.9% accuracy within 13 sessions (4.3 hours). In a second study, expert users are found to reach 21wpm with 99.6% accuracy after session 20 (6.7 hours) and continue to grow in performance, with individual phrases entered at up to 37wpm. A final study revisits the learnability of the optimized layout. Our modeling of ultimate performance indicates maximum overall sight-free entry speeds of 29.0wpm with audio feedback, or 40.7wpm if an expert user could operate without relying on audio feedback.",

    "abstract": "Many studies have identified gender differences in communication related to spatial navigation in real and virtual worlds. Most of this research has focused on single-party communication (monologs), such as the way in which individuals either give or follow route instructions. However, very little work has been reported on spatial navigation dialogs and whether there are gender differences in the way that they are conducted. This article will address the lack of research evidence by exploring the dialogs between partners of the same and of different gender in a simulated Human-Robot Interaction study. In the experiments discussed in this article, pairs of participants communicated remotely; in each pair, one participant (the instructor) was under the impression that s/he was giving route instructions to a robot (the follower), avoiding any perception of gendered communication. To ensure the naturalness of the interaction, the followers were given no guidelines on what to say, however, each had to control a robot based on the user's instructions. While many monologe-based studies suggest male superiority in a multitude of spatial activities and domains, this study of dialogs highlights a more complex pattern of results. As anticipated, gender influences task performance and communication. However, the findings suggest that it is the interaction—the combination of gender and role (i.e., instructor or follower)—that has the most significant impact. In particular, pairs of female users/instructors and male “robots”/followers are associated with the fastest and most accurate completion of the navigation tasks. Moreover, dialoge-based analysis illustrates how pairs of male users/instructors and female “robots”/followers achieved successful communication through “alignment” of spatial descriptions. In particular, males seem to adapt the content of their instructions when interacting with female “robots”/followers and employ more landmark references compared to female users/instructors or when addressing males (in male-male pairings). This study describes the differences in how males and females interact with the system, and proposes that any female “disadvantage” in spatial communication can disappear through interactive mechanisms. Such insights are important for the design of navigation systems that are equally effective for users of either gender.",

    "abstract": "Competition is useful in game-based learning, although it can also generate negative influences. To expand the potential for competition models in game-based learning, this study proposes the notion of surrogate competition, which eliminates direct competition between students. Such surrogates could be employed as buffers so that the competition between students is more relaxed. To explore the possible benefits of a surrogate approach to competition, the My-Pet-My-Arena system has been developed and evaluated. Two empirical studies were conducted to examine the effects of the surrogate competition. The results revealed that surrogate competition enhanced students’ learning achievement as well as increased their motivation. Furthermore, the surrogate competition might also assist students in attributing competitive failures to a lack of effort. Working from the results obtained in these two studies, a general model of surrogate competition is proposed to help designers implement forms of surrogate competition in other systems for game-based learning.",

    "abstract": "Designing interactive technology entails several objectives, one of which is identifying and selecting appropriate functionality. Given candidate functionalities such as “print,” “bookmark,” and “share,” a designer has to choose which functionalities to include and which to leave out. Such choices critically affect the acceptability, productivity, usability, and experience of the design. However, designers may overlook reasonable designs because there is an exponential number of functionality sets and multiple factors to consider. This article is the first to formally define this problem and propose an algorithmic method to support designers to explore alternative functionality sets in early stage design. Based on interviews of professional designers, we mathematically define the task of identifying functionality sets that strike the best balance among four objectives: usefulness, satisfaction, ease of use, and profitability. We develop an integer linear programming solution that can efficiently solve very large instances (set size over 1,300) on a regular computer. Further, we build on techniques of robust optimization to search for diverse and surprising functionality designs. Empirical results from a controlled study and field deployment are encouraging. Most designers rated computationally created sets to be of the comparable or superior quality than their own. Designers reported gaining better understanding of available functionalities and the design space.",

In BotMap, small robots represent landmarks and move to their correct position whenever the map is refreshed. Users can interact with the robots to retrieve the names of the landmarks they represent. We designed two interfaces, named Keyboard and Sliders, which enable users to pan and zoom. Two evaluations were conducted with, respectively, ten blindfolded and eight VI participants. Results show that both interfaces were usable, with a slight advantage for the Keyboard interface in terms of navigation performance and map comprehension, and that, even when many panning and zooming operations were required, VI participants were able to understand the maps. Most participants managed to accurately reconstruct maps after exploration.

While imminent collapse is far from certain, it is prudent to consider now how to develop sociotechnical systems for use in these scenarios. We introduce the notion of collapse informatics—the study, design, and development of sociotechnical systems in the abundant present for use in a future of scarcity.

In this article, we investigate the use of multilevel auditory displays to enable eyes-free mobile interaction with indoor location-based information in non-guided audio-augmented environments.

A secondary interactive layer is used to evaluate three different conditions that varied in the presentation (sequential versus simultaneous) and spatialisation (non-spatialised versus egocentric/exocentric spatialisation) of multiple auditory sources. Our findings show that (1) participants spent significantly more time interacting with spatialised displays; (2) using the same design for primary and interactive secondary display (simultaneous exocentric) showed a negative impact on the user experience, an increase in workload and substantially increased participant movement; and (3) the other spatial interactive secondary display designs (simultaneous egocentric, sequential egocentric, and sequential exocentric) showed an increase in time spent stationary but no negative impact on the user experience, suggesting a more exploratory experience. A follow-up qualitative and quantitative analysis of user behaviour support these conclusions. These results provide practical guidelines for designing effective eyes-free interactions for far richer auditory soundscapes.",

The editor builds on two key ideas (a) contextual information is used to evaluate and minimize logical expressions; (b) logical expressions are presented in a disjunctive normal form (DNF) thus applying a principle established in mental model theory. User tests reveal situations in which the theory regarding the intuitiveness of the DNF needs to be extended with a new element: Logical terms are easier to comprehend and formulate when grouped according to their semantic affinity. We report two experiments that demonstrate the intuitiveness of this approach and how it improves performance of non-programmers in specifying context sensitive system behaviour.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we argue that an approach informed by practice theory coupled with design fiction provides useful insights into the role of interaction design with respect to environmental sustainability. We argue that a practice-oriented approach can help interaction designers step away from models of individual behavior and studies of artifacts towards seeing sustainable behaviors as part of multidimensional and interrelated practices and practice elements. We analyze two previously conducted studies. The first study of everyday repair focuses on how people repair their broken objects. The second study of green-DIY examines how green enthusiasts facilitate their practices of making sustainable DIY (do-it-yourself) projects. We describe the practices of everyday repairers and green enthusiasts in terms of materials, competences, and meanings, and the interrelations among those elements, using the framework of Shove et al. [2012]. We argue that understanding the dynamics of practice and their unique configurations is a starting point to redefine the roles of sustainable interaction design (SID). We propose that designers design towards resources and tools in ways that reflect on the challenges of intelligibility of their design interventions in practices. In addition to considering SID in the light of practice theories, we reveal how design fictions are readily incorporated into green practices in ways that transform those practices and hold implications for transformations of design as well. We bring forward opportunities for designers to co-design with DIY enthusiasts, targeted as practitioners in their own right, designing toward or within a design fiction. As a result, we conclude with the possibility for sustainable interaction designers to become practice-oriented designers who design with transparent open strategies and accessible materials and competences.",

This article presents two studies that investigated the effect of visual, auditory, and haptic sensory feedback modalities presented by a virtual button in a 3D environment on task performance (time on task and task errors) and user rating. Although we expected task performance to improve for conditions that combined two or three feedback modalities over a single modality, we instead found a significant emergent behavior that decreased performance in the trimodal condition. We found a significant increase in the number of presses when a user released the button before closing the virtual switch, suggesting that the combined visual, auditory, and haptic feedback led participants to prematurely believe they actuated a button. This suggests that in the design of virtual buttons, considering the effect of each feedback modality independently is not sufficient to predict performance, and unexpected effects may emerge when feedback modalities are combined.",

In this article, we investigate whether giving people feedback on how long they are away from their task influences their self-interruption behaviour. We conducted a contextual inquiry on self-interruption behaviour in an office workplace. Participants were observed to postpone physical interruptions until a convenient moment in the task if they were expected to take time. In contrast, observations revealed that digital interruptions were addressed immediately; participants reported these were presumed to be quick to deal with. To increase awareness of time spent on digital interruptions, we developed TimeToFocus, a notification tool showing people the duration of their interruptions while working on a task. A field study deployment of TimeToFocus in an office workplace found that feedback on the duration of interruptions made participants reflect on what they were doing during interruptions. They reported that they used this insight to avoid task-irrelevant activities. To confirm whether participants’ perceptions of the benefit of the tool could be measured, we conducted an online experiment, where participants had to retrieve information from an email sent to their personal email addresses and enter it into a spreadsheet. Participants who used our tool made shorter interruptions, completed the spreadsheet task faster and made fewer data entry errors. We conclude that feedback on the length of interruptions can assist users in focusing on their primary task and thus improve productivity.",

The current research used these models, extending them to differentiate between interpersonal synergy and audience design. Few studies have tested multiple common ground models against tasks representative of envisioned human--computer interaction (HCI) applications. We report on four such tests, which allowed examination of generalizability of findings. Results supported the complementarity models over the alignment model, and were suggestive of the audience design variant of complementarity, providing guidance for HCI design that differs from contemporary approaches.",

The effectiveness of robot-assisted interventions designed for social skill learning presumably depends on the interplay between robot predictability, engagement in learning, and the individual differences between different autistic children. To better understand this interplay, we report on a study where 24 autistic children participated in a robot-assisted intervention. We manipulated the variance in the robot’s behaviour as a way to vary predictability, and measured the children’s behavioural engagement, visual attention, as well as their individual factors. We found that the children will continue engaging in the activity behaviourally, but may start to pay less visual attention over time to activity-relevant locations when the robot is less predictable. Instead, they increasingly start to look away from the activity. Ultimately, this could negatively influence learning, in particular for tasks with a visual component. Furthermore, severity of autistic features and expressive language ability had a significant impact on behavioural engagement. We consider our results as preliminary evidence that robot predictability is an important factor for keeping children in a state where learning can occur.",

Finally, we speculated how these principles might be applied through interactive, voice-based technologies. First-person methods enabled us to access the implicit knowledge embedded in radio production and translate it to technologies of interest to the human–computer-interaction community, such as voice user interfaces that rely on auditory display. Traditionally, sonification practitioners have focused more on generating sounds than on teaching people how to listen; our process, however, treated sound and narrative as a holistic, sonic-narrative experience. Our first-person retrospection illuminated the role of narrative in designing to support people as they learn to listen to data.",

Our focus lies with ethics in the process of conducting research and its implications for the plants involved.

    "abstract": "Extant literature has proposed an important role for trust in moderating people’s willingness to disclose personal information, but there is scant HCI literature that deeply explores the relationship between privacy and trust in apparent privacy paradox circumstances. Attending to this gap, this article reports a qualitative study examining how people account for continuing to use services that conflict with their stated privacy preferences, and how trust features in these accounts. Our findings undermine the notion that individuals engage in strategic thinking about privacy, raising important questions regarding the explanatory power of the well-known privacy calculus model and its proposed relationship between privacy and trust. Finding evidence of hopeful trust in participants’ accounts, we argue that trust allows people to morally account for their “paradoxical” information disclosure behavior. We propose that effecting greater alignment between people’s privacy attitudes and privacy behavior—or “un-paradoxing privacy”—will require greater regulatory assurances of privacy.",

Motivated by this challenge, accessibility and HCI researchers have called for voice-based communities to support aging and disability. This paper extends prior work on voice community design and short-term use by providing empirical data on how people interact with voice communities over time and intentional instances of non-use. We conducted a one-year study with 43 blind and low vision older adults, of whom 21 used a voice-based community. We use vignettes to unpack five different voice community member roles - the obligatory poster, routine poster, cross-platform lurker, busy socialite, and visual expertise seeker - and discuss community interactions over time. Findings show how participation varied based on engagement in other communities and ways that participants sought interaction. We discuss (1) how to design voice communities for member roles and (2) the implications of synchronous and asynchronous voice community interaction in voice-only communities.",

    "abstract": "Participatory budgeting is a democratic innovation increasingly supported by digital platforms. Like any technology, participatory budgeting platforms are not value-free or politically neutral; their design, configuration, and deployment display assumptions and configure participant behaviour. To understand what kinds of configurations occur and what kinds of democratic values they hold, we studied 31 digital participatory budgeting cases in Spain, France, and Finland. These cases were all supported by the same technical platform, Decidim , allowing us to focus on the variations in their configurations. We examined the data from these cases and identified 25 different technical configurations and 15 participatory budgeting configurations. The configurations observed in our cases exhibit individual and community-centred assumptions about expected state-society interactions, as well as open vs managerial approaches to participatory budgeting. Based on these findings, we highlight a dilemma for civic technology designers: to what degree should platforms be open to configuration and customisation, and which political values should be enforced by platform design?",

For the first time, we reveal an almost-perfect overlap between image-schematic metaphors used by the younger and older groups, despite the two groups showing significant differences in prior technological knowledge. This finding provides empirical evidence for the near-universality of image-schematic metaphor use across age groups.

This study reviews the studies that compare CTA and RTA to investigate what is gained and lost by using one or the other variant in a usability test. A total of 29 studies, reporting from 42 comparisons of CTA and RTA, matched the inclusion criteria and were included in the meta-analyses. The main differences are that for CTA task time is longer, but total time shorter, whereas for RTA the users verbalize more explanations, problem formulations, and design recommendations. In addition, CTA users probably experience the evaluator’s presence as less disturbing than RTA users do.",

Using Lindström and Ståhl’s notion of the double movement in un/making, we analyze a series of workshops focused on designing with AI, annotating what was un/made and de/centered during the workshops’ activities. Through this analysis, we introduce two key contributions that highlight some opportunities in the diffractive alignment between unmaking and more-than-human design: firstly, the notion of ‘unmaking-with’ as an emergent concept to describe a posthumanist unmaking practice, and secondly, three decentering tactics–situating, materializing, and enacting–that instantiate this practice through design. Finally, we discuss how unmaking can enrich more-than-human design and, conversely, how more-than-human design can help define the epistemological scope of unmaking.",

    "abstract": "Head pointing is widely used for hands-free input in head-mounted displays (HMDs). The primary role of head movement in an HMD is to control the viewport based on absolute mapping of head rotation to the 3D environment. Head pointing is conventionally supported by the same 1:1 mapping of input with a cursor fixed in the centre of the view, but this requires exaggerated head movement and limits input granularity. In this work, we propose to adopt dynamic gain to improve ergonomics and precision and introduce the HeadShift technique. The design of HeadShift is grounded in natural eye-head coordination to manage control of the viewport and the cursor at different speeds. We evaluated HeadShift in a Fitts' Law experiment and on three different applications in VR, finding the technique to reduce error rate and effort. The findings are significant as they show that gain can be adopted effectively for head pointing while ensuring that the cursor is maintained within a comfortable eye-in-head viewing range.",

Like all AI-powered tools, these code completion tools are not always accurate and can introduce bugs or even security vulnerabilities into code if not properly detected and corrected by a human programmer. One technique that has been proposed and implemented to help programmers locate potential errors is to highlight uncertain tokens. However, little is known about the effectiveness of this technique. Through a mixed-methods study with 30 programmers, we compare three conditions: providing the AI system's code completion alone, highlighting tokens with the lowest likelihood of being generated by the underlying generative model, and highlighting tokens with the highest predicted likelihood of being edited by a programmer. We find that highlighting tokens with the highest predicted likelihood of being edited leads to faster task completion and more targeted edits, and is subjectively preferred by study participants. In contrast, highlighting tokens according to their probability of being generated does not provide any benefit over the baseline with no highlighting. We further explore the design space of how to convey uncertainty in AI-powered code completion tools and find that programmers prefer highlights that are granular, informative, interpretable, and not overwhelming. This work contributes to building an understanding of what uncertainty means for generative models and how to convey it effectively.",

As the concept gains prominence in HCI, this special issue specifically explores the interplay between uncertainty and prototyping in Research through Design (RTD). We first outline three histories of uncertainty in design, in relation to its philosophical significance, its role in statistical and algorithmic processes, and its importance in prototyping. The convergence of these aspects is crucial as design evolves towards more agentive and entangled systems, introducing challenges such as Design As A Probabilistic Outcome. We then investigate the design spaces for engaging with ‘being uncertain’ that emerge from the papers: from nuancing the relationship between designers and quantitative data to blurring the line between humans, fungi, and algorithms. Finally, we illuminate some preliminary threads for how RtD can navigate and engage with these shifting technological and design landscapes thoughtfully.",

We conducted 25 qualitative interviews with nannies and 16 with parents who employed nannies, in the US, to explore and compare their views on and privacy threat models for smart home devices. We found device-specific purposes of use inspired different perspectives among nanny participants. Most were comfortable with employers’ smart speakers and smart TVs, whose purpose had nothing to do with them. However, with indoor smart cameras, nanny participants were often not just bystanders but targets of monitoring; in such situations, they had a wider range of attitudes. In contrast, parent participants tended to have more similar views across devices. We found notable disconnects regarding disclosure, where nanny participants often hesitated to ask about cameras, but parent participants assumed nannies just didn’t care.

An empirical study was carried out to compare exploration, exercises, and a combined format consisting of an exercise followed by exploration. Subjects of both high and low computer experience were included in the study. It was thought that the combined format might lead to superior training outcomes because it would both structure learning through an exercise and allow learners to go beyond the simple procedures in the training manual through exploration. The results showed that the performance of the low-experience subjects at test did not differ based on the type of practice. However, high-experience subjects who were trained using exercises or the combined format did significantly better than those trained using exploration alone. The similarity of performance of subjects in the exercise and combined practice conditions suggests that the exercise component of the practice explains their success.",

Communication medium was varied using a face-to-face GSS and a dispersed GSS setting. Task type was varied using an intellective and a preference task. Group decision outcome variables of interest were (actual and perceived) decision quality, decision time, decision satisfaction, and decision process satisfaction. With the intellective task, there were no significant differences between face-to-face GSS and dispersed GSS groups for all group decision outcome variables. With the preference task, face-to-face GSS groups performed significantly better than dispersed GSS groups for all group decision outcome variables. These findings suggest that group decision outcomes in a GSS environment tend to be adversely affected when the communication medium is too lean for the task but not when the communication medium is too rich for the task. Consequences of providing groups with too rich and too lean a communication medium for their task are discussed. Implications of these findings, and other related results, for practice and for future revisions of media richness theory are explored.",

The run-time behavior of all these objects can be specified ina straightforward way using constraints, demonstration, and dialog boxes that allow the designer to provide abstract descriptions of the interactive response to the input devices. Lapidary generalizes from these specific example pictures and behaviors to create prototype objects and behaviors from which instances can be made at run-time. A novel feature of Lapidary's implementation is its use of constraints that have been explicitly specified by the designer to help it generalize example objects and behaviors and to guide it in making inferences.",

We also reveal how, under particular conditions, such elements provide people with opportunities to encounter coincidence.

    "abstract": "Dynamic micro-content—interactive or updating widgets and features—is now widely used on the Web, but there is little understanding of how people allocate attention to it. In this article we present the results of an eye-tracking investigation examining how the nature of dynamic micro-content influences whether or not the user views it. We propose and validate the Dynamic Update Viewing-likelihood (DUV) model, a CHi-squared Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) model that predicts with around 80% accuracy whether users view dynamic updates as a function of how they are initiated, their size, and their duration. The model is constructed with data from live Web sites and does not rely on knowledge of the user's task to make its predictions, giving it a high level of external validity. We discuss one example of its application: informing how dynamic content should be presented in audio via assistive technology for people with visual impairments.",

    "abstract": "Expert interaction techniques enable users to greatly improve their performance; however, to realize these advantages, the user must first acquire the skill necessary to use a technique, then choose to use it over competing novice techniques. This article investigates several factors that may influence whether use of an expert technique persists when the context of use changes. Two studies examine the effect of changing performance requirements, and find that a high performance requirement imposed in a training context can effectively push users to adopt an expert technique, and that use of the technique is maintained when the requirement is subsequently reduced or removed. In a final study, performance requirement, high-level task, and environment of use are changed—participants played a training game to learn the menu for a drawing application, which they then used to complete a series of drawings over the following week. Participants exhibited a somewhat surprising “all-or-nothing” effect, using the expert technique nearly exclusively or not at all, and maintaining this behavior over a range of qualitatively different tasks. This suggests that switching to an expert technique involves a global change by the user, rather than an incremental change as suggested by previous work.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new action-transferred design approach by which the benefits of embodied cognition and activity can be realized to enhance spatial learning and usability for navigating virtual spaces. The action-transferred design approach is supported by theories of learning, action-perception, and neuropsychology. These theories help us understand how human action can be transferred to different body parts for improving the usability of interaction techniques and why the acquired spatial knowledge using the transferred action may remain the same independent of the used body parts. The finger-walking-in-place (FWIP) navigation technique is used as a design example to demonstrate the concept of the action-transferred design approach. Leveraging 3D immersive virtual reality technology, we performed an empirical study to evaluate the performance of the action-transferred FWIP navigation technique in terms of spatial knowledge acquisition. The FWIP navigation technique was compared with a full-body-based walking-like (sensor-fusion walking-in-place; SF-WIP) navigation technique and a well-known, convenient (Joystick) navigation technique using a common input device, that is, a wand with a joystick. Both the action-transferred and the full-body-based navigation techniques were more effective for spatial learning than the navigation technique using the common input device. However, only the action-transferred FWIP navigation technique can provide users with the convenience of navigating with their fingers. These results suggest that the action-transferred design approach is useful in designing a navigation technique supporting users' spatial learning performance more effectively and conveniently. Possible design implications for broader applications are discussed and indicate that the action-transferred design approach is worth further study.",

Previous studies identified the important role of community leaders in maintaining the health and vitality of their communities. One of their key means for doing so is by contributing relevant content to the community. In this paper, we study the effects of recommending social media content on enterprise community leaders. We conducted a large-scale user survey with four recommendation rounds, in which community leaders indicated their willingness to share social media items with their communities. They also had the option to instantly share these items. Recommendations were generated based on seven types of community interest profiles that were member-based, content-based, or hybrid. Our results attest that providing content recommendations to leaders can help uplift activity within their communities.",

I generated data in interviews and observations of rural CNs in seven countries in the Global South and in multi-sited ethnography of international advocacy for CNs. Male biases in technoculture and rural governance limit women's participation in CNs, and women adopt different approaches to performing their communal identity while using technology. This situation contributes to detaching CNs from relations that are produced in women's commoning. It also illustrates processes that co-opt the commons in rural technology endeavours and the diverse ways commoners express their subjectivities in response.",

The S-BAN is a new handheld haptic interface that utilizes a parallel kinematic structure to deliver 2-DOF spatial information over a continuous workspace, with a form factor suited to integration with other travel aids. The ability to pivot, extend and retract its body opens possibilities and questions around spatial data representation. We present a static study to understand user perception of absolute pose and relative motion for two spatial mappings, showing the highest sensitivity to relative motions in the cardinal directions. We then present an embodied navigation experiment in virtual reality (VR). User motion efficiency when guided by the S-BAN was statistically equivalent to using a vision-based tool (a smartphone proxy). Although haptic trials were slower than visual trials, participants’ heads were more elevated with the S-BAN, allowing greater visual focus on the environment.",

Postgraduate research (PGR) students are at risk of experiencing mental health concerns and this, with the often isolated and competitive nature of their work, can impact their sense of community and social connectedness. In response to these concerns, we designed Pears, a system to connect PGR students for regular “pearings” (in-person meetings) and provide activities to promote reflection and conversation. A four-week evaluation of Pears with 15 students highlighted its potential to sometimes, but not always, facilitate peer support. Some participants would instead meet formally and according to their needs, others instead used the system to make new social connections. Additionally, some participants who faced work-related difficulties during the study found using the system contributed to their stress levels. We conclude by noting how technologies that encourage peer support can help build social relationships, providing an avenue to share similar PhD experiences and guidance for those new to the experience, while importantly raising awareness and an understanding for the need to take time for self-care. However, these technologies must be utilised carefully, and are not a replacement for other sources of student support in universities.",

    "abstract": "Research on recommender systems has noted that the ranking of recommended items may play an important role in the performance of recommendation algorithms. To advance recommender systems research beyond the traditional approach that ranks recommended products in descending, it is crucial to understand the cognitive processes that online consumers experience when they evaluate products in a sequence. Drawing on evaluability theory and the order effects perspective, we formulate a scenario in which two products are presented sequentially and each product has two attributes, one of which can be evaluated independently while the other is difficult to evaluate without comparison. Analyses show that in two out of the three cases examined, presenting the most recommended product in the second place will result in stronger consumer purchase intentions and willingness to pay. Research hypotheses are proposed based on the results of the scenario analyses and are empirically tested through three laboratory experiments. In Study 1, evidence for the hypothesized order effects is found for the settings with randomly assigned product recommendations. In Study 2, the same effects are observed for the settings with personalized recommendations generated by a collaborative filtering algorithm. In Study 3, it is shown that such order effects also exist in terms of the recommendation strength of recommender systems. These findings provide novel insights into the behavioral implications of using recommender systems in e-commerce, shedding light on additional means of improving the design of such systems.",

Starting from understanding interaction from an Optimal Feedback Control (OFC) perspective, we assume that users aim at minimizing an internalized cost function, subject to the constraints imposed by the human body and the interactive system. Unlike previous approaches used in HCI, MPC can compute optimal controls for nonlinear systems. This allows to use state-of-the-art biomechanical models and handle nonlinearities that occur in almost any interactive system. Instead of torque actuation, our model employs second-order muscles acting directly at the joints. We compare three different cost functions and evaluate the simulation against user movements in a pointing study. Our results show that the combination of distance, control, and joint acceleration cost matches individual users’ movements best, and predicts movements with an accuracy that is within the between-user variance. To aid HCI researchers and designers in applying our approach for different users, interaction techniques, or tasks, we make our SimMPC framework, including CFAT, a tool to identify maximum voluntary torques in joint-actuated models, publicly available, and give step-by-step instructions.",

These platforms sanction communities that frequently violate platform policies; however, public perceptions of such sanctions remain unclear. In a pre-registered survey conducted in the US, I explore bystander perceptions of content moderation for communities that frequently feature hate speech, violent content, and sexually explicit content. Two community-wide moderation interventions are tested: (1) community bans, where all community posts are removed, and (2) community warning labels, where an interstitial warning label precedes access. I examine how third-person effects and support for free speech influence user approval of these interventions on any platform. My regression analyses show that presumed effects on others are a significant predictor of backing for both interventions, while free speech beliefs significantly influence participants’ inclination for using warning labels. Analyzing the open-ended responses, I find that community-wide bans are often perceived as too coarse, and users instead value sanctions in proportion to the severity and type of infractions. I report on concerns that norm-violating communities could reinforce inappropriate behaviors and show how users’ choice of sanctions is influenced by their perceived effectiveness.

The rhythmic nature of running establishes a connection between mind and body to promote mindfulness and improve the overall experience and benefits of running. The use of technology-supported meditation is gaining attention in the fields of mental and physical wellness. However, existing meditation technologies primarily focus on one-way stimuli for sitting or walking meditation, with little emphasis on adaptive design and development for running meditation. To address this issue, we present the design framework and system development of RunMe, an adaptive sound system specifically designed for running meditation. RunMe integrates stimulation and regulation mechanisms to enhance adaptive data interactions between the sounds and runners’ biodata. We compared the significance of the RunMe group with three other groups: use of non-adaptive sound, use of favorite music and use of no music/sound. The results show that the RunMe group outperforms the other groups in attention regulation, body awareness, exercise motivation, and mindfulness. Importantly, RunMe has the potential to allow users to engage in running meditation without specialized equipment, making it accessible for daily practice. We also discuss the design framework and practical distinctions of RunMe, as well as the design implications and future directions for advancing running meditation.",

Activities were typically only moderately routinized and followed cyclical activity patterns joined by sequential or concurrent interdependence.

    "abstract": "The HCI research community has traditionally considered digital wellbeing an end-user responsibility, designing tools for digital self-control that support them to self-regulate their usage of apps and websites. Yet, these attempts are often ineffective in the long term, as many tech companies still adopt “attention-capture” designs that compromise users’ sense of agency and self-control. Taking a complementary perspective, this paper presents a set of eight heuristics to create user interfaces that preserve and respect user attention by design . The heuristics stem from a systematic literature review and are grounded in the three fundamental psychological needs defined by the self-determination theory, i.e., autonomy, competence, and relatedness. In addition to being informed by theory and research, each heuristic is accompanied by practical strategies and real-world examples, offering designers actionable guidelines to value people’s attention in user interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Smart home devices, such as security cameras and voice assistants, have seen widespread adoption due to the utility and convenience they offer to users. The deployment of these devices in homes, however, raises privacy concerns for bystanders—people who may not necessarily have a say in the deployment and configuration of these devices, and yet are exposed to or affected by their data collection. Examples of bystanders include guests, short-term tenants, and domestic workers. Prior work has studied the privacy concerns of different bystander groups and proposed design solutions for addressing these concerns. In this paper, we present a systematic review of previous studies, describing how smart home bystanders are defined and classified, and illuminating the range of concerns and solutions proposed in the existing academic literature. We also discuss limitations in prior work, barriers to the uptake of research-based solutions by industry, and identify avenues for future research.",

    "abstract": "The force modality fundamentally transforms the interaction space of traditional touch input. When paired with compliant devices, which deform under force and provide immediate haptic feedback, there is potential to enhance user interactions significantly. However, the effects of compliance on force-input remain under-explored, with limited understanding of their full potential. This paper presents the first systematic investigation of the impact of deformable, movable, and rigid surfaces on user performance and experience through three rigorous studies (each N = 28). The results reveal previously unreported effects, including 1) higher maximum comfortable forces on deformable surfaces, 2) user preference for soft and deformable surfaces over rigid surfaces, and 3) improved ability to maintain force input on softer surfaces. These results highlight the benefits of compliant surfaces, contrasting with the dominant use of force-input on rigid devices. These findings guide researchers and designers in optimising user experience and performance of force-input interactions.",

To this end, 1,768 participants from Germany and the UK answered our online-questionnaire about their perceptions of five different actors’ possibilities , intentions , and legal bases to commit five privacy violations: data access, data inference, overhearing conversations, secondary use, and passing data along. Participants expressed mild concerns about the main user but greater worry about manufacturers and the state. We observe growing concern among younger people, especially in the UK and that users who do not own the smart speaker are the least concerned group.

However, practitioners often use less efficient methods, such as grid search, potentially resulting in under-optimized models. This discrepancy suggests that HPO method selection may be influenced by practitioner-specific motives, which remain insufficiently understood—hindering the user-centered advancement of HPO tools. To uncover these motives, we conducted 20 semi-structured interviews and an online survey with 49 ML practitioners. We revealed six primary goals (e.g., increasing ML model understanding) and fourteen contextual factors (e.g., available computational resources) that influence practitioners’ choices of HPO methods. This study provides a conceptual foundation for understanding real-world HPO practices and informs the development of more user-centered and context-adaptive HPO tools in automated ML (AutoML).",

In two experiments, we explore the effects of different audio feedback (surface materials, musical instruments) and reverb parameters (mixing, depth) on perceived simultaneity, unity, agency, and object properties (object size, material, room size), along with their recognition. We found that audio feedback had a significant but small effect on interaction and altered perceived object properties. Mixing in reverb reduced audio recognition but boosted reverb determination.

Through in-situ observations, focus groups, and one-on-one interviews with 22 participants, we examine how users collaborate and communicate within the game. Our findings reveal that while verbal communication predominates, non-verbal cues are often overlooked by collocated participants, and users initially struggle to recognize the expansive virtual space and the need for physical movement. Over time, users adapt to the hybrid environment, demonstrating increasing spatial awareness and more dynamic collaboration. Based on these insights, we present a suite of design recommendations for enhancing spatial awareness, supporting multi-modal communication, and fostering engaging group dynamics in future Shared AR applications.",

To instantiate the concept, we implemented a headphone-based prototype with multi-user tracking and audio streaming. Our preregistered in-lab study with 64 participants showed that audio personas influenced how participants formed impressions. Individuals with positive audio personas were rated as more socially attractive, more likable, and less threatening than those with negative audio personas.

Generally, some precautions, like avoiding real-time location sharing, are common. While many protection strategies are similar, some are shaped by local factors like internet shutdowns and different adversaries’ capabilities. The findings demonstrate that some tools and features, such as VPN, may offer protection but also pose risks, e.g., in the case of criminalization, highlighting the crucial role of local context.

While prior research has investigated uncertainty as a monolithic concept, the distinct effects of communicating aleatoric or epistemic uncertainty on humans and their reliance behavior remain unexplored. In this work, we present two behavioral experiments that systematically examine how participants rely on AI advice when faced with different types of uncertainty. While the first experiment manipulates the source of uncertainty, specifying it as either aleatoric or epistemic, the second decomposes uncertainty into its individual components, presenting aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty simultaneously.

With new AI capabilities being deployed in different contexts, human-centered explainability is crucial to ensure people can interact with novel AI systems safely and effectively. To address evolving explainability needs, the field of Explainable AI (XAI) has produced numerous frameworks. But what do these frameworks entail and how can they be used in practice? What drives their development? As AI systems continue to grow in complexity, it is important to understand and reflect upon the value of these frameworks and their potential to address upcoming human-centered needs for XAI. Towards this, we performed a scoping review following the PRISMA-ScR procedure, gathering and analyzing a corpus of 73 papers to understand how XAI frameworks can support different stages of human-centered XAI design. We present a unified model and a set of guiding questions to help identify, compare and select relevant XAI frameworks across various design stages, making it easier for designers and researchers to apply human-centered approaches in real-world XAI contexts.

    "abstract": "Freehand pointing is a fundamental gesture commonly used for cursorless interactions. Prior work in HCI often elicits the same pointing behaviour – facing the target with an outstretched dominant arm and index finger. However, freehand pointing outside of HCI shows more variability across hand pose, usage, and coordination with gaze. To understand what variability exists and how it affects pointing performance, we collected data (N=23) using a hybrid motion capture system. To elicit a wide variety of pointing behaviours we included different levels of user effort and attention, as well as the widest range of target placements studied. We systematically characterised and described three distinct pointing behaviours, each with three different traits, ranging from accurate stereotypical pointing observed in prior works to more casual hip fire-style pointing. Our analysis demonstrates how different pointing behaviours affect pointing performance and highlights their importance when designing interactive systems for more naturalistic freehand pointing.",

In response to these challenges, we found that labor organizers want data to help them advocate for legislation to increase the transparency and accountability of these platforms. To address this need, we collaborated with a Colorado-based rideshare union to develop FairFare, a tool that crowdsources and analyzes workers’ data to estimate the “take rate” — the percentage of the rider price retained by the rideshare platform. We deployed FairFare with our partner organization that collaborated with us in collecting data on 76,000+ trips from 45 drivers over 18 months. During evaluation interviews, organizers reported that FairFare helped influence state-level advocacy. Finally, we reflect on the complexities of translating quantitative data into policy outcomes, the nature of community-based audits, and the design implications for future transparency tools.",

    "abstract": "Diverse teams tend to be more productive and creative and the same is said to hold for science, with evidence that diverse groups of authors publish in more impactful journals. Within human-computer interaction (HCI), there have been several investigations into the diversity of such author teams, but it is unclear whether more diverse groups of co-authors also produce more impactful HCI papers, and which diversity dimensions matter the most. We investigate this relationship using a dataset of all CHI papers and estimate gender, ethnicity, location, sector, and experience measures of diversity. Through a regression analysis on citations and awards, we determine that co-author diversity indeed affects paper impact, but only some forms of it. Where diversity in experience, ethnicity, sector, and location result in more impactful CHI papers, this does not look to be the case for gender diversity. Through follow-up analysis we further investigate three potential ways how author diversity could be influencing paper impact, by examining research area, novelty, and positionality of these papers. This shows that a paper's research area also factors into impact, while varying by diversity dimensions, indicating a link between the two.",

The control gate led to a larger study (39 participants of different ethnicities) to assess the effectiveness of the disguises in bypassing 3 open-source FR models using 3 different distance metrics and 4 backends. We compare our real-life evaluation of design-generated disguises against previous and current computing research: while maliciously crafted digital perturbation attacks work well, they do not capture the complexity of live FRT opening up opportunities for future research.",

We developed “Sketching Snapshots,” an activity to elicit student perspectives on high-level concepts. To evaluate this activity, we ran pre- and post-semester workshops in two HCI courses in the US and UK. We analyze 68 sketches from 41 students, 9 student interviews, and 2 instructor interviews, and find that sketching is effective for supporting student and instructor reflection. We then report case studies in two additional contexts and synthesize recommendations for deploying reflective sketching. We propose incorporating Sketching Snapshots in courses can facilitate reflection on complex concepts, improve teaching, and spark conversations about what HCI means to us and our students.",

To facilitate the study, we developed and deployed NeuroWorld DTx v1.0 , a suite of five games that train children to improve their attention capacity. Our analysis found that children demonstrated self-efficacy, engagement, and adherence despite NeuroWorld being less fun than entertainment games. Additionally, most caregivers emphasized the importance of educational aspects over entertainment aspects.

    "abstract": "Mobile computing has been an active area of research for the past decade, but its importance will increase substantially in the decade to come. One problem faced by designers of mobile systems is that of maintaining the illusion of connectivity even when network performance is poor or non-existent. The Coda file system uses its cache to maintain this illusion. Extensive experience with the system suggests that, although users find the functionality provided by the system extremely valuable, new users face an arduous learning curve and even experienced users are sometimes confused by the system's behavior. The fundamental problem is that the lack of a strong network connection causes the system to violate a key property of caching: transparency. To overcome this problem, we have built an interface, called the CodaConsole, that makes caching translucent to users through controlled exposure of cache management internals. The interface exposes critical aspects of caching to support the mobile user while hiding noncritical details to preserve usability. This article presents the design, implementation, and usability evaluation of this interface. The CodaConsole successfully makes caching translucent in the presence of disconnected or weakly connected operation. The most surprising result was that novice Coda users performed almost as well as experienced Coda users.",

This study introduces a novel application of multifractal statistical methods to distinguish users via patterns of variability within high frequency pupillary response behavior (PRB) data collected during computer-based interaction. PRB was measured from older adults, including two groups diagnosed with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) maintaining a range of visual acuities (n = 14), and one visually healthy control group (i.e., disease-free, 20/20--20/32 acuity) (n = 14). Three measures of the multifractal spectrum, the distribution of regularity indices extracted from time series data, distinguished the user groups, including: 1) Spectral Mode; 2) Broadness; and 3) Left Slope. The results demonstrate a clear relationship between the values of these measures and the level of visual capabilities. These analytical techniques leverage the inherent complexity and richness of this high frequency physiological response data, which can be used to meaningfully differentiate individuals whose sensory and cognitive capabilities may be affected by aging and visual impairment. Multifractality analysis provides an objective, quantifiable means of uncovering and examining the underlying signatures in physiological behavior that may account for individual differences in interaction needs and behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Mobile information technologies are theoretically well-suited to digitally accomodate informal note-taking, with the notes often recorded quickly and under less than ideal circumstances. Unfortunately, user adoption of mobile support for informal note-taking has been hindered in large part by slow text entry techniques. Building on research confirming people's ability to recognize erroneous text, this study explores two simple modifications to Graffiti-based text entry with the goal of increasing text entry speed: disabling text correction and disabling visual feedback. As expected, both modifications improved text entry speed at the cost of recognizability. To address the decrease in recognizability, a multiapproach text-enhancement algorithm is introduced with the goal of modifying the erroneous note to facilitate the process of recalling the event or activity that originally motivated the note. A study with 75 participants confirmed that the proposed approach of discouraging user-initiated error correction during note-taking, enhancing the resulting erroneous notes, and facilitating recall with enhanced alternative lists, increased note-taking speed by 47% with no negative impact on the participants' ability to recall important details about the scenarios which prompted the note-taking activities. This research highlighs the importance and efficacy of shifting the focus from accuracy to recallability when examining the overall efficacy of informal notes. The proposed modifications and adaptations produce significant benefits and have important implications for how mobile technologies are designed to support both informal note-taking and text entry in general.",

Using data from a controlled laboratory study, the results presented here demonstrate that exposure to a text visualization can mitigate framing effects. Furthermore, it also shows a transfer effect, where participants who saw the visualization remained uninfluenced by framing in subsequent texts, even when the visualization was absent. These results carry implications for the methods used to evaluate information visualization systems, for understanding the cognitive and interpretive mechanisms by which framing effects occur, and for exploring the design space of interactive text visualization.",

    "abstract": "Communication during touch provides a seamless and natural way of interaction between humans and ambient intelligence. Current techniques that couple wireless transmission with touch detection suffer from the problem of selectivity and security, i.e., they cannot ensure communication only through direct touch and not through close proximity. We present BodyWire-HCI , which utilizes the human body as a wire-like communication channel, to enable human–computer interaction, that for the first time, demonstrates selective and physically secure communication strictly during touch. The signal leakage out of the body is minimized by utilizing a novel, low frequency Electro-QuasiStatic Human Body Communication (EQS-HBC) technique that enables interaction strictly when there is a conductive communication path between the transmitter and receiver through the human body. Design techniques such as capacitive termination and voltage mode operation are used to minimize the human body channel loss to operate at low frequencies and enable EQS-HBC. The demonstrations highlight the impact of BodyWire-HCI in enabling new human–machine interaction modalities for variety of application scenarios such as secure authentication (e.g., opening a door and pairing a smart device) and information exchange (e.g., payment, image, medical data, and personal profile transfer) through touch (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwrig2XQIH8).",

Game scholar Caillois calls such experiences “vertigo play,” elucidating that these enjoyable activities are a result of confusion between sensory channels. In HCI, designers are often cautious to avoid deliberately causing sensory confusion in players, but we believe there is an opportunity to transition and extend Caillois’ thinking to the digital realm, allowing designers to create novel and intriguing digital bodily experiences inspired by traditional vertigo play activities. To this end, we present the Digital Vertigo Experience framework. Derived from four case studies and the development of three different digital vertigo experiences, this framework aims to bring the excitement of traditional vertigo play experiences to the digital world, allowing designers to create more engaging and exciting body-based games, and provides players with more possibilities to enjoy novel and exciting play experiences.",

Discovery rates were high regardless of conditions that vary the familiarity and saliency of modifier keys. However, familiarity with desktop hotkeys boosted discoverability. Our third study focused on how prior knowledge of hotkeys could be leveraged and resulted in a 5% selection time improvement and identified the role of spatial memory in retention. Finally, we compared our soft keyboard layout with a grid layout similar to FastTap. The latter offered a 12–16% gain on selection speed, but at a high cost in terms of screen estate and low spatial stability.",

This three-part study includes a participatory design workshop, application redesign, and subsequent field deployment to understand how wearable devices can support self-regulation. Twenty-seven youth designed activities that revealed interest in and models of self-regulation that became part of a smartwatch app. Researchers revisited and redesign the application based on youth feedback, and then released the redesigned application (some of whom participated in workshops, some of whom did not). Redesigning the application to be responsive to youth needs resulted in higher levels of satisfaction than previously observed. Youth also used this application more often and reported higher use. Three design tensions persisted: (1) Breath counting applications as attention grabbing vs. attention cultivating and (2) breath counting activities as a relaxation activity vs. a mental workout, and (3) exposing youth to meditation and breath counting as a strategy for developing healthy minds vs. an institutionalized or compulsory required action. Activity occupied positions along these continua, which creates associated challenges for researchers. A fruitful design space exists for researchers to integrate attention focusing into activities that youth value, which can include stress reduction or mindfulness training, but also could be simply to improve their academic work.",

The findings highlight where predictive insights could be usefully deployed to reconfigure care and facilitate more proactive management of hypotension.

    "abstract": "Research suggests that the temporal flexibility advertised to crowdworkers by crowdsourcing platforms is limited by both client-imposed constraints (e.g., strict completion times) and crowdworkers’ tooling practices (e.g., multitasking). In this article, we explore an additional contributor to workers’ limited temporal flexibility: the design of crowdsourcing platforms, namely requiring crowdworkers to be ‘on call’ for work. We conducted two studies to investigate the impact of having to be ‘on call’ on workers’ schedule control and job control. We find that being ‘on call’ impacted (1) participants’ ability to schedule their time and stick to planned work hours, and (2) the pace at which participants worked and took breaks. The results of the two studies suggest that the ‘on-demand’ nature of crowdsourcing platforms can limit workers’ temporal flexibility by reducing schedule control and job control. We conclude the article by discussing the implications of the results for (a) crowdworkers, (b) crowdsourcing platforms, and (c) the wider platform economy.",

    "abstract": "In the rapidly evolving landscape of cross-device computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), there is a need for intuitive and user-friendly solutions empowering end users to create and tailor their applications. To address this need, we analysed the different metaphors for end-user development (EUD) of cross-device and IoT applications. A key observation is the lack of addressing end user’s mental models when designing interactions among devices, resulting in less intuitive EUD tools. To fill this gap, we introduce eSPACE, an end-user authoring tool facilitating the development of cross-device and IoT applications. In contrast to most existing tools, eSPACE is grounded on strong theoretical foundations, including a conceptual model, reference framework as well as design guidelines and suitable metaphors. The effectiveness of these theoretical foundations in creating an intuitive and user-friendly EUD platform has been validated in a user study. Our study confirms eSPACE’s potential as a useful and easy to use tool for end-user application development. In addition, we present potential future research directions, including automation functionality, intelligibility and human-AI interaction. In discussing these future directions, we aim to foster and advance EUD research towards more end-user-accessible authoring environments for cross-device and IoT applications.",

We use concepts from a machine learning technique, reinforcement learning, to elicit user needs, through directed content analysis of user interviews, and uncover practical data constraints, through analysis of \"in the wild\" user engagement logs from a self-monitoring app. We gather and triangulate human-machine-data requirements for a self-management tool for individuals with endometriosis - a poorly understood, complex chronic condition with no reliable treatment.

These data include detailed attributes of the contributors and the states the tasks go through. The methodology adopts a quantitative approach, including descriptive and inferential statistics, and standard process mining techniques. Our results indicate that, in general terms, in humanitarian mapping, a group of contributors from outside the area of interest perform straightforward mapping tasks with limited collaboration among them. The “wisdom” of advanced contributors is the cornerstone that sustains the system. The discussion section elaborates on (1) how these findings suggest that humanitarian mapping projects effectively meet their short-term mapping objectives but fall short if more sustainable mapping objectives are sought and (2) possible strategies for better harnessing the collective intelligence of these efforts.",

A transface has five dimensions: alterity (1) because, as a medium, the transface establishes a relation with something other than itself, and the operations (2) it enables. Being a relation, a transface is perceived only by these three effects: as a traversable (3) with flows (4) that traverse it, providing a traversal experience (5). We present an exploration of the transface concept with concrete examples from the literature and interviews with five designers. Finally, we explore and experiment, through a deck of cards, how the transfaces framework might translate into practical design questions.",

These service-industry workers contend with pressures from algorithmic management and other workplace technologies, yet they typically do not benefit from technologies that might help foster mutual support in the way that white-collar workers do. Recently, Starbucks, a major service-industry employer, has garnered media attention for issues with understaffing, labor law violations, and algorithm-based operations. We conducted interviews with sixteen Starbucks employees about their workplace issues, interactions with technology, and communication practices. These interviews illustrate how workplace technologies worsen existing issues for service-industry workers and how challenges to worker-to-worker communication reduce their capacity to rectify these issues, especially at the cross-store level. Our participants want better communication with other workers, such as through labor unions or new information and communication technologies (ICTs), to help improve their working conditions. We discuss how HCI scholars can use action research to help design localized, worker-driven ICTs to facilitate more connectivity and collaborative practices outside of the workplace. We conclude by outlining our ongoing work studying and designing ICTs for service-industry workers.",

The question, however, is how to design post-anthropocentric technology that engages humans and nature. Based on the PRISMA-ScR guidelines, we conducted a scoping review and analyzed 53 papers, from which we extracted 114 post-anthropocentric artifacts that enable human-nature engagement. We identified seven design strategies, such as recognizing, exploring, and empowering that can guide the future design of post-anthropocentric artifacts. Most of the artifacts included support human agency, fewer support nature's agency, or advocate for nature to achieve an equitable human-nature relation. We identified opportunities for the field, such as empowering nature and further exploring the implications of post-anthropocentric design for addressing environmental problems.",

We employed reflexive analysis that centered our situated knowledges of the trans community. We found that LLMs return pro-trans responses, even when presented with highly transphobic user prompts. While we also found highly transphobic LLM responses, we found that anti-trans sentiment in LLMs was often subtle, requiring a deep positional understanding from diverse trans stakeholders to interpret. Based on these findings, we recommend diverging from current “value-neutral” approaches that validate transphobia by taking an “all sides” approach. We provide considerations for both the evaluation and design of LLMs that center positional expertise.",

    "abstract": "Many interactive systems require users to navigate through large sets of data and commands using constrained input devices—such as scroll rings, rocker switches, or specialized keypads—that provide less power and flexibility than traditional input devices like mice or touch screens. While performance with more traditional devices has been extensively studied in human-computer interaction, there has been relatively little investigation of human performance with constrained input. As a result, there is little understanding of what factors govern performance in these situations, and how interfaces should be designed to optimize interface actions such as navigation and selection. Since constrained input is now common in a wide variety of interactive systems (such as mobile phones, audio players, in-car navigation systems, and kiosk displays), it is important for designers to understand what factors affect performance. To aid in this understanding, we present the Constrained Input Navigation (CIN) model, a predictive model that allows accurate determination of human navigation and selection performance in constrained-input scenarios. CIN identifies three factors that underlie user efficiency: the performance of the interface type for single-level item selection (where interface type depends on the input and output devices, the interactive behavior, and the data organization), the hierarchical structure of the information space, and the user's experience with the items to be selected. We show through experiments that, after empirical calibration, the model's predictions fit empirical data well, and discuss why and how each of the factors affects performance. Models like CIN can provide valuable theoretical and practical benefits to designers of constrained-input systems, allowing them to explore and compare a much wider variety of alternate interface designs without the need for extensive user studies.",

We argue that digital technologies are typically created with a design lens firmly focused on “first world” populations, assuming a base set of cultural norms, resource availabilities, and technological experience levels that do not strongly align with those of emergent users. We discuss and argue for inclusive technology design methods, present our approach, and detail indicative results and case studies as an example of the potential of these perspectives in uncovering radical innovations. Distilling findings and lessons learned, we present a methodology—itinerative design—that pivots between emergent user communities across multiple regions, driving digital innovation through the periphery of mainstream design’s current remit.",

    "abstract": "Drag-and-drop has become ubiquitous, both on desktop computers and touch-sensitive surfaces. It is used to move and edit the geometry of elements in graphics editors, to adjust parameters using controllers such as sliders, or to manage views (e.g., moving and resizing windows, panning maps). Reverting changes made via a drag-and-drop usually entails performing the reciprocal drag-and-drop action. This can be costly as users have to remember the previous position of the object and put it back precisely. We introduce the D n D −1 model that handles all past locations of graphical objects. We redesign the Dwell-and-Spring widget to interact with this history, and explain how applications can implement D n D −1 to enable users to perform reciprocal drag-and-drop to any past location for both individual objects and groups of objects. We report on two user studies, whose results show that users understand D n D −1 , and that Dwell-and-Spring enables them to interact with this model effectively.",

    "abstract": "We present a study of children collaborating around interactive tabletops in three different countries: India, the United Kingdom and Finland. Our data highlights the key distinctive physical strategies used by children when performing collaborative tasks during this study. Children in India employ dynamic positioning with frequent physical contact and simultaneous object movement. Children in the UK tend to prefer static positioning with minimal physical contact and simultaneous object movement. Children in Finland use a mixture of dynamic and static positioning with minimal physical contact and object movement. Our findings indicate the importance of understanding collaboration strategies and behaviours when designing and deploying interactive tabletops in heterogeneous educational environments. We conclude with a discussion on how designers of tabletops for schools can provide opportunities for children in different countries to define and shape their own collaboration strategies for small group learning that take into account their different classroom practices.",

In this article, we propose to investigate artificial agents using deep reinforcement learning to explore parameter spaces in partnership with users for sound design.

Preliminary studies observing users’ exploration strategies with parametric interfaces and testing different agent exploration behaviours led to the design of a fully-functioning prototype, called Co-Explorer, that we evaluated in a workshop with professional sound designers. We found that the Co-Explorer enables a novel creative workflow centred on human–machine partnership, which has been positively received by practitioners. We also highlight varied user exploration behaviours throughout partnering with our system. Finally, we frame design guidelines for enabling such co-exploration workflow in creative digital applications.",

We find two key, divergent types of work in rural areas that leverage the Internet: (1) telework and (2) work to market and sell goods and services online. We consider why these two forms of Internet-enabled work are pursued by different segments of the rural population, attending to the socio-demographic variation within and between these two broad categories. Some key differences include whether workers are urban transplants or rural-originating, in “white-collar” or “blue-collar” occupations, and whether they are men or women. We argue that deficit framings that focus on inadequate infrastructure or absent skills are insufficient to understand such patterns of differentiated use. Instead a sociocultural explanation is needed: one that draws connections between work cultures, occupational values, skills, and practices.",

    "abstract": "Today, industry practitioners (e.g., data scientists, developers, product managers) rely on formal privacy reviews (a combination of user interviews, privacy risk assessments, etc.) in identifying potential customer acceptance issues with their organization’s data practices. However, this process is slow and expensive, and practitioners often have to make ad-hoc privacy-related decisions with little actual feedback from users. We introduce Lean Privacy Review (LPR), a fast, cheap, and easy-to-access method to help practitioners collect direct feedback from users through the proxy of crowd workers in the early stages of design. LPR takes a proposed data practice, quickly breaks it down into smaller parts, generates a set of questionnaire surveys, solicits users’ opinions, and summarizes those opinions in a compact form for practitioners to use. By doing so, LPR can help uncover the range and magnitude of different privacy concerns actual people have at a small fraction of the cost and wait-time for a formal review. We evaluated LPR using 12 real-world data practices with 240 crowd users and 24 data practitioners. Our results show that (1) the discovery of privacy concerns saturates as the number of evaluators exceeds 14 participants, which takes around 5.5 hours to complete (i.e., latency) and costs 3.7 hours of total crowd work ( <?TeX $\\approx$?> $80 in our experiments); and (2) LPR finds 89% of privacy concerns identified by data practitioners as well as 139% additional privacy concerns that practitioners are not aware of, at a 6% estimated false alarm rate.",

    "abstract": "An enormous potential exists for solving certain classes of computational problems through rich collaboration among crowds of humans supported by computers. Solutions to these problems used to involve human professionals, who are expensive to hire or difficult to find. Despite significant advances, fully automatic systems still have much room for improvement. Recent research has involved recruiting large crowds of skilled humans (“crowdsourcing”), but crowdsourcing solutions are still restricted by the availability of those skilled human participants. With translation, for example, professional translators incur a high cost and are not always available; machine translation systems have been greatly improved recently but still can only provide passable translation; and crowdsourced translation is limited by the availability of bilingual humans. This article describes crowdsourced monolingual translation, where monolingual translation is translation performed by monolingual people. Crowdsourced monolingual translation is a collaborative form of translation performed by two crowds of people who speak the source or the target language, respectively, with machine translation as the mediating device. This article describes a general protocol to handle crowdsourced monolingual translation and analyzes three systems that implemented the protocol. These systems were studied in various settings and were found to supply significant improvement in quality over both machine translation and monolingual editing of machine translation output (“postediting”).",

    "abstract": "Touch-sensitive surfaces have become a predominant input medium for computing devices. In particular, multitouch capability of these devices has given rise to developing rich interaction vocabularies for “real” direct manipulation of user interfaces. However, the richness and flexibility of touch interaction often comes with significant complexity for programming these behaviors. Particularly, finger touches, though intuitive, are imprecise and lead to ambiguity. Touch input often involves coordinated movements of multiple fingers as opposed to the single pointer of a traditional WIMP interface. It is challenging in not only detecting the intended motion carried out by these fingers but also in determining the target objects being manipulated due to multiple focus points. Currently, developers often need to build touch behaviors by dealing with raw touch events that is effort consuming and error-prone. In this article, we present Touch, a tool that allows developers to easily specify their desired touch behaviors by demonstrating them live on a touch-sensitive device or selecting them from a list of common behaviors. Developers can then integrate these touch behaviors into their application as resources and via an API exposed by our runtime framework. The integrated tool support enables developers to think and program optimistically about how these touch interactions should behave, without worrying about underlying complexity and technical details in detecting target behaviors and invoking application logic. We discuss the design of several novel inference algorithms that underlie these tool supports and evaluate them against a multitouch dataset that we collected from end users. We also demonstrate the usefulness of our system via an example application.",

We present a study into the design space of an abbreviated style of text input called C-PAK (Correcting and completing variable-length Prefix-based Abbreviated Keystrokes) for text entry on mobile devices. Given a variable length and potentially inaccurate input string (e.g., “li g t m”), C-PAK aims to expand it into a complete phrase (e.g., “looks good to me”). We develop a C-PAK prototype keyboard, PhraseWriter , based on a current state-of-the-art mobile keyboard consisting of 1.3 million n -grams and 164,000 words. Using computational simulations on a large dataset of realistic input text, we found that, in comparison to conventional single-word suggestions, PhraseWriter improves the maximum keystroke savings rate by 6.7% (from 46.3% to 49.4,), reduces the word error rate by 14.7%, and is particularly advantageous for common phrases. We conducted a lab study of novice user behavior and performance which found that users could quickly utilize the C-PAK style abbreviations implemented in PhraseWriter, achieving a higher keystroke savings rate than forward suggestions (25% vs. 16%). Furthermore, they intuitively and successfully abbreviated more with common phrases. However, users had a lower overall text entry rate due to their limited experience with the system (28.5 words per minute vs. 37.7). We outline future technical directions to improve C-PAK over the PhraseWriter baseline, and further opportunities to study the perceptual, cognitive, and physical action trade-offs that underlie the learning curve of C-PAK systems.",

To characterize digital behaviors, we collected 24/7 screen recordings, input behavior, and operating system data from the laptops of 20 adults for two weeks. We use cognitive test results from the same individuals to characterize their cognitive abilities: psychomotor speed, processing speed, selective attention, working memory, and fluid intelligence. Our results from regression analysis, path modeling, and machine learning experiments show that cognitive abilities are associated with differences in digital behavior and that naturalistic behavioral data can predict the cognitive abilities of individuals with small error rates.

By synthesizing our findings from two user studies, we construct a sensemaking model which highlights how uncertainty related to data qualities, visualization parameters, and the viewer’s background, affects the insight-generation process.

    "abstract": "A large number of studies highlight the importance of regulation in collaborative learning. Nevertheless, only some studies describe how to get or support pupils to learn to regulate group work in school. In this context, we aim to understand if a specifically designed tangible environment can promote a regulated collaboration process during a face-to-face activity in school. Therefore, we conducted a two-year design-based research (DBR) study. This article describes the DBR cycles in detail and the steps we have executed to develop, test, implement, and evaluate a set of tangible artifacts called CalMe (for Collective attention led by a Mediated environment). First, we identified three specific dimensions that interfere with collaborative learning in the classroom: team building and collective decision-making, task regulation awareness, and oversolicitation limitation. Second, we proposed design choices leading to the first iteration of a CalMe device that meets these needs. We then assessed usability and acceptability before the pedagogical validation steps. Third, through a pilot study, we evaluated the pedagogical potential of the second iteration of the CalMe device in a real context of use in an elementary school class. We collected and analyzed data from surveys, focus groups, log data, and video recordings through all the steps. Moreover, to allow for duplication of the study, we propose and detail our methodological approach. This study shows an empirical example of a DBR process that allows responding as closely as possible to the needs of both pupils and teachers. This work also provides input to teachers regarding a better understanding of collaborative problem-solving activities. Although there is still room for improvement on specific dimensions related to task regulation, such as better management of ambient noise or work tempo, the results indicate that the CalMe device allows for a regulated collaboration process in schools. It shows an HCI design process that can be an example of how to influence classroom activities through technology to promote positive collaborative learning experiences.",

Commitment devices, such as reminders and promises, have been found to be effective at reducing procrastination in other domains. In a series of online experiments ( \\(n{\\gt}3{,}000\\) ), we explored the effects of reminders and promises on users’ willingness to change a compromised password. We find that adding an option to delay the task increases the share of people willing to eventually change their password considerably. Critically, the option to delay yields this overall increase without reducing the share of people choosing to change their password immediately. Additionally, most participants who promised to change their password later, or asked to be reminded to do so, indeed followed through on their commitment, leading to a net positive effect. Reminding participants of their previous commitment further increased this effect.",

    "abstract": "New digital tools offer biodesign with unprecedented opportunities for monitoring, fabricating, iterating, and scaling designs. Serving aligned purposes and beyond, the Digital Twin (DT) is an emerging concept in bioindustries including bioprocessing and agri-food. In these fields, DTs enable comprehensive digital representations of a living system or process with continuous bidirectional connection to the physical world. Despite the concept’s potential to address certain challenges of uncertainty in designing (with) living systems, its applications and implications in biodesign and research remain largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a conceptual framework that synthesizes existing instantiations of DTs within bioindustries through a dataflow lens. We mobilize the framework through a proof-of-concept DT for biofabrication with mycelium, by unpacking the dataflows within the identified design and operation cycles. We conclude with a discussion on how DT capabilities respond to uncertainties in designing with living systems, limitations, and future work.",

The selected projects align with the ongoing scholarly interest in alternatives to common perceptions on time, unmaking the normative clock time, and the posthuman discourse. Following an analysis of the theoretical and material expressions of these artworks, we conceptualised four themes through which unmaking was represented: dissecting temporality, the unmaking of the singular, unmaking as messing up , and unmaking the other .

Without a way to view, edit, and share programs, PBD systems will never reach their full potential. We designed and implemented two graphical representation languages for a PBD desktop similar to the Apple Macintosh Finder. Although a user study showed that both languages enabled nonprogrammers to generate and comprehend programs, the study also revealed that the language that more closely reflected the desktop domain doubled users' abilities to accurately generate programs. Trends suggest that the same language was easier for users to comprehend. These findings suggest that it is possible for a PBD system to enable nonprogrammers to construct programs and that the form of the representation can impact the PBD system's effectiveness. A paper-and-pencil evaluation of the two versions of the PBD desktop prior to the study supported these finding and provided interesting feedback on the interaction between usability evaluations and user studies. In particular, the comparison of the paper-and-pencil evaluation with the empirical evaluation suggested that nonempirical evaluation techniques can provide guidance into how to interpret empirical data and, in particular, that PBD systems need to provide support for programming-strategy selection in order to be successful.",

Sixteen people were interviewed to determine how they prepare slides, what software they use to prepare and maintain slides, and how well the software they use supports various aspects of the task. The informants varied in how central slidemaking was to their jobs. The hypotheses driving the study were that: (1) some software applications are task generic, intended for use in a wide variety of tasks, while others are task specific, intended to support very specific tasks; (2) task-specific software is preferable, but is often not used because of cost, learning effort, or lack of availability, and (3) people who infrequently perform a task tend to use generic tools, while people who often perform it tend to use task-specific tools. Our findings suggest that several factors influence choice of slidemaking software, including desired quality, production time, user skill, willingness to use multiple tools, whether people work alone or in teams, and company policy. Furthermore, the task specificity/genericness of an application program is not a simple matter of degree , because it depends on several fairly independent software design issues. We (1) conclude that developing application software that supports all aspects of a task well is extremely difficult and (2) suggest an alternative approach that may be more fruitful: providing collections of interoperable tools and services.",

We conduct a laboratory experiment using 84 computer science students to investigate the impact of these techniques on the accuracy of the subjects' search and recall with entity-relationship diagrams and data flow diagrams. The search tasks involve both vertical and horizontal searches on a moderately complex IS model that consists of multiple diagrams. We also examine the subjects' spatial visualization abilities as a possible covariant for observed search performance.

    "abstract": "Virtual reality simulations of group social interactions are important for many applications, including the virtual treatment of social phobias, crowd and group simulation, collaborative virtual environments (VEs), and entertainment. In such scenarios, when compared to the real world, audio cues are often impoverished. As a result, users cannot rely on subtle spatial audio-visual cues that guide attention and enable effective social interactions in real-world situations. We explored whether gaze-contingent audio enhancement techniques driven by inferring audio-visual attention in virtual displays could be used to enable effective communication in cluttered audio VEs. In all of our experiments, we hypothesized that visual attention could be used as a tool to modulate the quality and intensity of sounds from multiple sources to efficiently and naturally select spatial sound sources. For this purpose, we built a gaze-contingent display (GCD) that allowed tracking of a user’s gaze in real-time and modifying the volume of the speakers’ voices contingent on the current region of overt attention. We compared six different techniques for sound modulation with a base condition providing no attentional modulation of sound. The techniques were compared in terms of source recognition and preference in a set of user studies. Overall, we observed that users liked the ability to control the sounds with their eyes. They felt that a rapid change in attenuation with attention but not the elimination of competing sounds (partial rather than absolute selection) was most natural. In conclusion, audio GCDs offer potential for simulating rich, natural social, and other interactions in VEs. They should be considered for improving both performance and fidelity in applications related to social behaviour scenarios or when the user needs to work with multiple audio sources of information.",

Unexpected vibrations or sounds from the environment may disrupt the perception of such information. Although disruptive effects have been systematically explored in vision and audition, they have been less thoroughly examined in the haptic domain. Here we briefly review the relevant literature from HCI and psychology, distilling principles of when distraction is likely. We then investigate these principles through four experiments, examining how the timing and modality of relatively rare or unexpected stimuli (surprise distractors) affect the detection and recognition of vibrotactile target patterns. At short distractor-target delays (&lt;350 ms), both auditory and vibrotactile surprise distractors impaired performance. At a longer delay (1,050 ms), performance was not affected overall, even being improved with repeated exposure to the vibrotactile distractors. We discuss the importance of our findings in the context of HCI and cognitive psychology, and we provide design guidelines for mitigating the effects of distraction on haptic devices.",

    "abstract": "To improve people’s lives, human-computer interaction researchers are increasingly designing technological solutions based on behavior change theory, such as social comparison theory (SCT). However, how researchers operationalize such a theory as a design remains largely unclear. One way to clarify this methodological step is to clearly state which functional elements of a design are aimed at operationalizing a specific behavior change theory construct to evaluate if such aims were successful. In this article, we investigate how the operationalization of functional elements of theories and designs can be more easily conveyed. First, we present a scoping review of the literature to determine the state of operationalizations of SCT as behavior change designs. Second, we introduce a new tool to facilitate the operationalization process. We term the tool blueprints . A blueprint explicates essential functional elements of a behavior change theory by describing it in relation to necessary and sufficient building blocks incorporated in a design. We describe the process of developing a blueprint for SCT. Last, we illustrate how the blueprint can be used during the design refinement and reflection process.",

Our models, developed for detecting overt (aggression) as well as covert (trolling) behaviors using prior studies’ message-level features and new conversational action features, achieved high accuracies (0.90 and 0.92, respectively).

It involves re-immersing users to a level where emotional responses are comparable to those experienced during actual interaction with a system. To validate whether the robustness of CRD would vary with the time gap between the actual and recalled event and with the affective state preceding the recall, two empirical studies with altogether 100 participants were conducted. Specifically, participants’ emotions were measured in terms of galvanic skin response (GSR) , heart rate (HR) , and self-assessment manikin (SAM) rating when they were interacting with an email client seeded with usability problems. The same measures were taken when they viewed the videoed interactions. Two between-subject variables were ‘intervening time’ (from 0 minutes up to 24 hours) and ‘intervening affect’ (images with different valence and arousal). Advanced computational models were applied to optimise the shifting of GSR/HR waves generated at the actual interaction and recall phases, which were found to be significantly correlated. The shifting process is necessary for addressing the memory effect and is a methodological innovation. Overall, CRD proved to be a robust method that can be deployed to a broad range of HCI research and practice contexts.",

    "abstract": "Annotation is an effective reading strategy people often undertake while interacting with digital text. It involves highlighting pieces of text and making notes about them. Annotating while reading in a desktop environment is considered trivial but, in a mobile setting where people read while hand-holding devices, the task of highlighting and typing notes on a mobile display is challenging. In this paper, we introduce GAVIN, a gaze-assisted voice note-taking application, which enables readers to seamlessly take voice notes on digital documents by implicitly anchoring them to text passages. We first conducted a contextual enquiry focusing on participants' note-taking practices on digital documents. Using these findings, we propose a method which leverages eye-tracking and machine learning techniques to annotate voice notes with reference text passages. To evaluate our approach, we recruited 32 participants performing voice note-taking. Following, we trained a classifier on the data collected to predict text passage where participants made voice notes. Lastly, we employed the classifier to built GAVIN and conducted a user study to demonstrate the feasibility of the system. This research demonstrates the feasibility of using gaze as a resource for implicit anchoring of voice notes, enabling the design of systems that allow users to record voice notes with minimal effort and high accuracy.",

This may introduce serious time delays and an increase in costs. We solve this problem for web-based software through JITL, a post-hoc method to automatically internationalize websites and web-based applications, without having to modify the source code. With JITL, users can pull resource strings out of an arbitrary website and perform on-demand localization tasks. Based on this novel capability, JITL enables a complete infrastructure for collecting, storing, sharing, and delivering website translations, which invokes a number of exciting scenarios. Our studies show that JITL leads to significant savings in terms of user effort and, in consequence, money. With JITL, now it is possible to localize what is needed, when it is needed.",

However, evaluating website aesthetics through user ratings is resource intensive, and extant models to predict website aesthetics are limited in performance and ability. We contribute a novel and more precise approach to predict website aesthetics that considers rating distributions. Moreover, we use this approach as a baseline model to illustrate how future research might be conducted using predictions instead of participants. Our approach is based on a deep convolutional neural network model and uses innovations in the field of image aesthetic prediction. It was trained with the dataset from Reinecke and Gajos [2014] and was validated using two independent large datasets. The final model reached an unprecedented cross-validated correlation between the ground truth and predicted rating of LCC = 0.752. We then used the model to successfully replicate prior findings and conduct original research as an illustration for AI-based research.",

While our event gained reasonable attraction from designers and developers, this article unpacks the challenges in representing and involving people with dementia in these events, which had multiple knock-on effects on participant's outputs. Our analysis presents insights into participants’ motivations, challenges participants faced when constructing their “absent user”, and the design features teams developed to address the social context of the user.

The creation and usability of interactive television is very different from desktop or web-based interaction. The concepts of frameworks and genres provides an approach to learnable interaction in an entertainment rather than task-oriented activity. The concept of a framework defines the tools required for both producing and viewing a particular style of interactive video experience. An interactive framework for televised sports is presented. This framework implements a sports television experience that support play-by-play navigation as well as viewer's interactive choice of camera angles. Tools for creating and viewing interactive sports are developed in parallel. In-home and in-lab experiments give indications of how sports fans will use interactive television in the future. The experiments demonstrate that fans will use the interaction rather than passively watching, can easily learn the interactive features and strongly prefer the new features over tradition rewind/fast-forward. The data indicates that many users will use the interactive controls to enrich and prolong their viewing rather than simply skipping as rapidly as possible through a game. However, there is also indication that some viewers will simply skip rapidly. There are also indications that the skip vs. review interaction depends on the interest level of current game play.",

    "abstract": "The web affords connections by which end-users can receive paid, expert help—such as programming, design, and writing—to reach their goals. While a number of online marketplaces have emerged to facilitate such connections, most end-users do not approach a market to hire an expert when faced with a challenge. To reduce friction in hiring from peer-to-peer expert crowd work markets, we propose Ink, a system that crowd workers can use to showcase their services by embedding tasks inside web tutorials—a common destination for users with information needs. Workers have agency to define and manage tasks, through which users can request their help to review or execute each step of the tutorial, for example, to give feedback on a paper outline, perform a statistical analysis, or host a practice programming interview. In a public deployment, over 25,000 pageviews led 168 tutorial readers to pay crowd workers for their services, most of whom had not previously hired from crowdsourcing marketplaces. A field experiment showed that users were more likely to hire crowd experts when the task was embedded inside the tutorial rather than when they were redirected to the same worker’s Upwork profile to hire them. Qualitative analysis of interviews showed that Ink framed hiring expert crowd workers within users’ well-established information seeking habits and gave workers more control over their work.",

    "abstract": "The Qwerty soft keyboard is widely used on mobile devices. However, keyboards often consume a large portion of the touchscreen space, occluding the application view on the smartphone and requiring a separate input interface on the smartwatch. Such space consumption can affect the user experience of accessing information and the overall performance of text input. In order to free up the screen real estate, this article explores the concept of Sparse Keyboard and proposes two new ways of presenting the Qwerty soft keyboard. The idea is to use users’ spatial memory and the reference effect of spatial landmarks on the graphical interface. Our final design K3-SGK displays only three keys while L5-EYOCN displays only five line segments instead of the entire Qwerty layout. To achieve this, we employ a user-centered computational design method: first study the reference effect of a single landmark key (line segment) from empirical data, then make assumptions to generalize the effect to multiple landmarks, and finally optimize the best designs. To make the text entry function more complete, we also design and implement gestural interactions for editing operations and non-alphabetical characters’ input. User evaluation shows that participants can quickly learn how to type with K3-SGK and L5-EYOCN . After five 15-phrase typing sessions, participants achieve 88.1%--92.8% of the full Qwerty keyboard in terms of words per minute on the smartphone and 98.4%--99.1% on the smartwatch. The differences on character and word error rate between our keyboard designs and the full Qwerty keyboard are not significant. The results of out-of-vocabulary words input are also promising. In addition, participants can quickly recall the typing skills and maintain the input performance even after a few days. User feedbacks in real application contexts show that with the low occlusion keyboard, users can acquire more information and perform less scrolling on the smartphone and achieve a higher input efficiency on the smartwatch with a more fluent input experience.",

Although such physical metaphors help both authors and audiences make sense of material, they also constrain authoring in ways that can negatively impact presentation delivery. In this article, we derive heuristics for the design of presentation media that are independent of any underlying physical metaphors. We use these heuristics to craft a new kind of presentation medium called SlideSpace—one that combines hierarchical outlines, content collections, and design rules to automate the real-time, outline-driven synthesis of hybrid Slide-Canvas visuals. Through a qualitative study of SlideSpace use, we validate our heuristics and demonstrate that such a hybrid presentation medium can combine the advantages of existing systems while mitigating their drawbacks. Overall, we show how a heuristic design approach helped us challenge entrenched physical metaphors to create a fundamentally digital presentation medium with the potential to transform the activities of authoring, delivering, and viewing presentations.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of pitch correction is to assist a musician in playing notes with accuracy and precision, without preventing expressive pitch variations. This study presents and examines a new method for automatic pitch correction: Dynamic Pitch Warping (DPW). The analytic formulation of the warping function is derived. In the context of live playing of continuous pitch trajectories, the dynamics of pitch correction must be considered. Methods for triggering and releasing the correction are discussed, and a performance test is conducted. DPW is evaluated in the context of digital musical instruments that are controlled by a stylus on a graphic tablet. The results show significant improvement in note accuracy and precision with the addition of the correction method. Analyses of various types of modulations (including vibrato, portamento, and glissando) demonstrate that expressive pitch variations are preserved by the DPW correction. Perceptual tests show that the effects of DPW correction are well perceived and positively assessed by listeners. The proposed method allows for accurate pitch target acquisition together with preservation of expressive motion, a result that could be extended to other situations that require dynamic trajectory correction.",

However, accounts of post-WIMP UIs typically do not provide theoretical explanations of why these UIs lead to superior performance. In this article, we use Norman’s 1986 model of interaction to describe how post-WIMP UIs enhance users’ mental representations of UI and task. In addition, we present an empirical study of three UIs; in the study, participants completed a standard three-dimensional object manipulation task. We found that the post-WIMP UI condition led to enhancements of mental representation of UI and task. We conclude that the Norman model is a good theoretical framework to study post-WIMP UIs. In addition, by studying post-WIMP UIs in the context of the Norman model, we conclude that mental representation of task may be influenced by the interaction itself; this supposition is an extension of the original Norman model.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new action-transferred design approach by which the benefits of embodied cognition and activity can be realized to enhance spatial learning and usability for navigating virtual spaces. The action- transferred design approach is supported by theories of learning, action-perception, and neuropsychology. These theories help us understand how human action can be transferred to different body parts for improving the usability of interaction techniques and why the acquired spatial knowledge using the transferred action may remain the same independent of the used body parts. The finger- walking-in-place (FWIP) navigation technique is used as a design example to demonstrate the concept of the action-transferred design approach. Leveraging 3D immersive virtual reality technology, we performed an empirical study to evaluate the performance of the action-transferred FWIP navigation technique in terms of spatial knowledge acquisition. The FWIP navigation technique was compared with a full-body-based walking-like (sensor-fusion walking-in-place ; SF-WIP) navigation technique and a well-known, convenient (Joystick) navigation technique using a common input device, that is, a wand with a joystick. Both the action-transferred and the full-body-based navigation techniques were more effective for spatial learning than the navigation technique using the common input device. However, only the action-transferred FWIP navigation technique can provide users with the convenience of navigating with their fingers. These results suggest that the action- transferred design approach is useful in designing a navigation technique supporting users' spatial learning performance more effectively and conveniently. Possible design implications for broader applications are discussed and indicate that the action- transferred design approach is worth further study.",

In a field study, we examined how process structuring shapes productivity in two sub-studies: design and peer feedback, each with 40 participants (N = 40). The results revealed that process structuring significantly improved both the quantity and quality of productivity. Additionally, process structuring appeared to reduce inhibitory effects of group work, such as negative priming, fixation on familiar ideas, and social comparison.

    "abstract": "People use personal data assistants in the field to collect data and to communicate with others both in the field and office. The individual in the office invariably has a laptop or a high-end personal workstation and thus, significantly more computing power, more screen real estate, and higher volume input devices, such as a mouse and keyboard. These differences give the high-end user the ability to represent and manipulate collaborative tasks more effectively. It is therefore useful to know what impact these differences have on work performance and work communications. Four different platform combinations involving a PC and a PDA were used to examine the effect of communicating via heterogeneous computer platforms. The PC platform used a mouse, a keyboard, and a 3-dimensional screen display. The PDA platform used a stylus, soft buttons, and a 2-dimensional screen display. A variation of the Tetris wall-building game called Slow Tetris was used as the subjects' collaborative task. A second factor in the experiment was role asymmetry. One subject was arbitrarily put in charge of the task solution in all of the combinations. An analysis of the solution times found that subjects with mixed platforms worked slower than their homogeneous counterparts, that is, a person in charge with a PC worked faster if his partner had a PC. An in-depth analysis of the communication patterns found significant differences in the exchanges between heterogeneous and homogenous combinations. The PC-to-PDA combination (with the person on the PC in charge of the solution) took significantly more time than the PC-to-PC combination. This extra time appears to come from the disadvantage of having a partner on the PDA who is unable to help in solving the problems. The PDA-to-PC combination took approximately the same amount of time as the PDA-to-PDA combination despite having one team member with a better representation. This member was, unfortunately, not in charge of the solution. The PDA-to-PC heterogeneous combination exhibited more direction giving, less one-sided collaboration, and more takeover attempts than any of the other combinations. Overall, roles were maintained in the partnerships except for the person with the PDA directing the person with the PC.",

An important example of such personalisation is the use of pervasive displays to show content that matches the requirements of proximate viewers. Despite prior work on prototype systems that use mobile devices to personalise displays, no significant attempts to trial such systems have been carried out. In this article, we report on our experiences of designing, developing and operating the world’s first comprehensive display personalisation service for mobile users. Through a set of rigorous quantitative measures and 11 potential user/stakeholder interviews, we demonstrate the success of the platform in realising display personalisation, and offer a series of reflections to inform the design of future systems.",

This multimodality is embodied in tangible objects named physiopucks, which are driven by biosignals. We hypothesize that multimodality increases users’ motivation in a musical task, compared to the use of a gesture-only tabletop system (the Reactable). We compared motivational aspects in dyads collaborating in three experimental groups (N = 56): the Physio group (one physiology- and one gesture-based user), the Sham group (one prerecorded physiology- and one gesture-based user), and the Control group (two gesture users). Between-group comparisons showed that motivation dimensions of Confidence and Satisfaction were higher in b-Reactable than in the gesture-only tangible interface, and that fake physiology-based feedback significantly reduced these effects. Our study also shows the potential of combined implicit and explicit interaction modes in multiuser HCI scenarios.",

We present four experiments that test 3D perception. We varied projection geometry in three ways: type of projection (perspective/parallel), separation between the observer's point of view and the projection's center (discrepancy), and the presence of motion parallax (with/without parallax). Projection geometry had strong effects different for each task. Reducing discrepancy is desirable for orientation judgments, but not for object recognition or internal angle judgments. Using a fixed center of projection above the table reduces error and improves accuracy in most tasks. The results have far-reaching implications for the design of 3D views on tables, in particular, for multi-user applications where projections that appear correct for one person will not be perceived correctly by another.",

We report a user experiment with 235 participants, testing the effects of happy and unhappy image styles on user perceptions, engagement, and personality traits attributed to personas using a mixed-methods analysis. Results indicate that the participant's perceptions of the persona's realism and pain point severity increase with the use of unhappy pictures. In contrast, personas with happy pictures are perceived as more extroverted, agreeable, open, conscientious, and emotionally stable. The participants’ proposed design ideas for the personas scored more lexical empathy scores for happy personas. There were also significant perception changes along with the gender and ethnic lines regarding both empathy and perceptions of pain points. Implications are the facial expression in the persona profile can affect the perceptions of those employing the personas. Therefore, persona designers should align facial expressions with the task for which the personas will be employed. Generally, unhappy images emphasize realism and pain point severity, and happy images invoke positive perceptions.",

However, little attention has been given to designing the permission request interface to reduce individuals’ perceived uncertainty and to support their informed decisions. Drawing on the principal–agent perspective, our study aims to understand the effects of permission justification, certification, and permission relevance on users’ perceived uncertainty, which in turn influences their permission authorization. Two studies were conducted with vignettes. Our results show that certification and permission relevance indeed reduce users’ perceived uncertainty. Moreover, permission relevance moderates the relationship between permission justification and perceived uncertainty. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.",

We present a new approach to enable participant reflection on past identity transitions, and a means to fill in blanks by eliciting data that may not otherwise come up: showing participants sentiment visualizations of their social media data. After detailing our methods of constructing sentiment visualizations, we discuss our experiences using them in a study on gender transition. For most participants, the visualizations elicited substantial reflection, and enabled recalling forgotten data and new interpretations of transition experiences. We guide researchers on how to use this method when studying other identity transitions; this may be especially powerful for marginalized people who undergo substantial identity changes. This article proposes a way to uncover participants’ personal histories, which can help HCI researchers to better understand and support marginalized people’s experiences.",

We first present and compare three generic benchmark models, inspired by the neuroscience literature, to explain and predict the learning process for shortcut adoption. Results show that they do not account for the complexity of users’ behavior. We then introduce a dedicated model, Transition, combining five cognitive mechanisms: implicit and explicit learning, decay, planning and perseveration. Results show that our model outperforms the three benchmark models both in terms of model fitting and model simulation. Finally, a post-analysis shows that each of the five mechanisms contribute to goodness-of-fit, but the role of perseveration is unclear regarding model simulation.",

    "abstract": "Telemedicine systems that involve the use of video conferencing technologies have been available for more than three decades. Yet, they have primarily been used for specialist appointments or within health care facilities. We are now seeing a shift with the proliferation of commercial technologies, such as smartphone apps that allow people to have appointments with a general practitioner from nearly any location for various reasons. Telemedicine has also seen an uptake due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about how doctors and patients perceive smartphone-based telemedicine systems, what types of medical ailments are best suited for these systems, what sociotechnical challenges might emerge through their usage, and how systems should be designed to best meet the needs of both doctors and patients. Thus, we applied a scenario-based design method by presenting a set of medical situations to both general practitioners and patients, and conducted contextual interviews with them to investigate their thoughts on video-based appointments for a range of medical situations. Results show that video consultations using smartphone apps could raise challenges in delivering appropriate care and utilization, conducting camera work to assist different types of examinations, supporting doctor–patient relationship creation and maintenance, allowing doctors to maintain control over the appointment, as well as protecting patients’ and doctors’ privacy. This suggests the need to create designs that can support particular workflows, relationship building, safety and privacy protection, and camera work for varying contexts.",

Focusing on opt-out decisions, the study found: up to one in three users make errors in decision-making; there is a higher error rate for rejection-framed opt-out decisions; users widely misinterpret decision framing; and failure to read decision text results in rushed and unsighted decisions, even leading users to automatically construe un-ticked checkboxes as opt-in decisions. In talking afterwards about their experiences, users expressed strong negative emotions, feeling confused, manipulated and resentful. Many suggested they would, in practice, steer away from similar encounters toward more unambiguous and honest sites. These findings might alert managers and developers, tempted to use dark patterns, that such a strategy might backfire over time.",

We applied an iterative, expert-driven process to derive and refine our heuristics, starting with an established food literacy framework. We then conducted evaluations with Nutrition and HCI experts to show how the heuristics support the summative and formative design and evaluations of food-related technologies.

Over the last ten years, the Webstrates and Codestrates projects aimed to realize this vision of computational media. Webstrates is a server application that synchronizes the DOM of websites. Codestrates builds on top of Webstrates and adds an authoring environment, which blurs the use and development of applications. Grounded in a chronology of the development of Webstrates and Codestrates, we present eight tensions that we needed to balance during their development. We use these tensions as an analytical lens in three case studies and a game challenge in which participants created games using Codestrates. We discuss the results of the game challenge based on these tensions and present key takeaways for six of them. Finally, we present six lessons learned from our endeavor to realize the vision of computational media, demonstrating the balancing act of weighing the vision against the pragmatics of implementing a working system.",

We analyzed 2,445 log entries by applying an iterative open coding and developed a detailed hierarchical problem-solving model.

We found that patients’ trust in the BP ecosystem and social ties plays a significant role in shaping their perceptions of technology and chronic care. Trust in one actor of the ecosystem fosters trust in another, e.g., trust in BP reading depended on the type of device and the person measuring the BP. We also observed nuanced sharing and intermediation of BP devices. Based on our findings, we recommend designs to boost patients’ trust, familiarity, and access to technologies used in BP management and improve their experience of care in low-resource settings in India.",

    "abstract": "Non-contact, mid-air haptic devices have been utilized for a wide variety of experiences, including those in extended reality, public displays, medical, and automotive domains. In this work, we explore the use of synthetic jets as a promising and under-explored mid-air haptic feedback method. We show how synthetic jets can scale from compact, low-powered devices, all the way to large, long-range, and steerable devices. We built seven functional prototypes targeting different application domains, in order to illustrate the broad applicability of our approach. These example devices are capable of rendering complex haptic effects, varying in both time and space. We quantify the physical performance of our designs using spatial pressure and wind flow measurements, and validate their compelling effect on users with stimuli recognition and qualitative studies.",

    "abstract": "When fabricating, it is common to follow a prescribed set of steps in a tutorial or how-to. While popular, such explicit knowledge resources have many inconsistencies and omissions, use static illustrations, and cannot adapt to drop-in makers or a maker's mistakes. To overcome many of these issues, this work presents Automatics, a novel explicit knowledge resource system that dynamically generates fabrication activities for one or more makers based on their current environmental and fabrication context. Automatics assigns tasks to makers based on the past tools and components the maker was working with, enables makers to recover from mistakes through model regeneration, suggests alternative tools if a needed tool is unavailable or in use, and allows multiple makers to drop-in throughout a fabrication activity. Initial usage and feedback from novice makers showed that Automatics increases the number of tasks that can be completed compared to paper instructions, decreases frustration, and improves one's understanding of the global context of assigned tasks during fabrication activities.",

By examining the introduction of the “Reactions” feature on Facebook, we aim to understand how the introduction of a new engagement feature affects the overall engagement activities and the use of existing engagement features. We found evidence of a positive effect of Reactions on overall engagement levels. Furthermore, the introduction of the Reactions feature had heterogeneous effects on the use of existing engagement features. Posts that received Reactions also ended up receiving more Likes and Comments than what they would have received before the feature change. However, the opposite is true for posts that received no Reactions, although the effect sizes were small. These effects were detected within the first four weeks after the feature introduction, and persisted after six months, indicating long-term structural changes in users’ engagement behaviors.",

We address this gap by advancing Readily Available Learning Experiences, a conceptual approach for transforming all professional web applications into opportunities for authentic learning. This article presents Isopleth, a web-based platform that helps learners make sense of complex code constructs and hidden asynchronous relationships in professional web code. Isopleth embeds sensemaking scaffolds informed by the learning sciences to (1) expose hidden functional and event-driven relationships, (2) surface functionally related slices of code, and (3) support learners manipulating the provided code representations. To expose event-driven relationships, Isopleth implements a novel technique called Serialized Deanonymization to determine and visualize asynchronous functional relationships. To evaluate Isopleth, we conducted a case study across 12 professional websites and a user study with 14 junior and senior developers. Results show that Isopleth’s sensemaking scaffolds helped to surface implementation approaches in event binding, web application design, and complex interactive features across a range of complex professional web applications. Moreover, Isopleth helped junior developers improve the accuracy of their conceptual models of how features are implemented by 31% on average.",

    "abstract": "Rehearsal-based interfaces are designed to encourage a transition from novice to expert, but many users fail to make this transition. Most of these interfaces activate novice mode after a short delay, between 150 and 500 ms. We investigate the impact of delay time on expert usage and learning in three crowdsourced experiments. The first experiment examines an 8-item marking menu with delay times from 200 ms to 2 s. Results show longer delays increase successful expert selections. The second and third experiments generalise this result to a different rehearsal-based menu, a desktop clone of FastTap with 8 items and 15 items. Together, our results show that expert use correlates positively with increased delay time, but can increase errors since users are less risk averse. We also find imperceptible delays of 200 ms can harm long-term retention of menu items. Designers should consider longer delays in rehearsal-based interfaces to encourage a transition to expert usage.",

Web navigation was simulated on the information architecture of two large sites. With the improved labeling system of the information architecture, simulation results showed a significant reduction in navigation problems. The results of two experiments demonstrate that sites with improved information architecture result in better outcomes of user information retrieval.

However, collecting behavior data required to estimate the parameters of such models is often tedious and resource intensive.

In this article, we present a sample size determination method based on Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for a specific Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) model of human behavior, in two cases: (1) pre-hoc experiment design—conducted in the planning stage before any data is collected, to guide the estimation of how many samples to collect; and (2) post-hoc dataset analysis—performed after data is collected, to decide if the existing dataset has sufficient samples and whether more data is needed. We validate our approach in experiments with a realistic model of behaviors of people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and illustrate how to pick a reasonable sample size target. Our work enables model designers to perform a deeper, principled investigation of the effects of dataset size on IRL model parameters.",

Across the nearly 200-year history of domestic photography, this social reminiscence has been accomplished largely through photo albums.

In this article, we explore this metaphor through the 20-year history of proposed digital picture interactions from Human–Computer Interaction research, and compare this to ongoing interactions with modern picture tools. Through these, we reveal that this prominent design metaphor does not create space for social reminiscence, but does fit the novel use of immediate sharing seen across social networking. Furthermore, the endless and ever-growing nature of digital film rolls are not meaningfully browsable for either intended use. We close by reconnecting to the past works that explore the broad potential of digital pictures.",

This disconnect between context of an interaction and processing style can be termed local interference. Personalization of visual stimuli can promote a more accessible computing experience. We describe how technological interventions can support shifting of visual attention from local to global features to make them more accessible. We present two empirical studies.

Hence, we first identify the most promising mappings between the physical features of the referent (edges, faces, corners) and the STC dimensions. Then, we design three data selection techniques using the physical referent and compare them to mid-air gestures when performing selection tasks on the STC. Overall, our work demonstrates that using the physical referent to support input interaction with embedded data representations is an efficient and comfortable approach for data selection in standing and sitting situations.",

We used a negative binomial regression to investigate whether a message’s linguistic characteristics (degree of concreteness, emotional arousal, and sentiment) and user characteristics (political ideology and number of followers) may influence users’ decisions to reshare tweets related to the COVID-19 vaccine. We analyzed US English-language tweets related to the COVID-19 vaccine between May 2020 and October 2021 ( N = 236,054). Tweets with positive and high-arousal words were more often retweeted than negative, low-arousal tweets. Tweets with abstract words were more often retweeted than tweets with concrete words. In addition, while Liberal users were more likely to have tweets with a positive sentiment reshared. Conservative users were more likely to have tweets with a negative sentiment reshared. Our results can inform public health messaging on how to best phrase vaccine information to impact engagement and information resharing, and potentially persuade a wider set of people to get vaccinated.",

Previous work indicate that interferences can cause frustration and sometimes severe consequences. This article investigates new default behaviors for GUI elements that aim to prevent the occurrences of interferences or to mitigate their consequences. We present a design space of the advantages and technical requirements of these behaviors and demonstrate in a controlled study how simple rules can reduce the occurrences of so-called “ Pop-up -style” interferences and user frustration. We then discuss their application to various forms of interaction interferences. We conclude by addressing the feasibility and trade-offs of implementing these behaviors in existing systems.",

Gaze-based metrics revealed discrimination between high- and low-feedback realism. Increased interaction uncertainty was associated with longer fixations on the avatar hand and temporal shifts in the gaze–action relationship. Our findings enable real-time evaluation of users’ perception of realism in interactions. They facilitate the optimization of interaction realism in virtual environments and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Self-determination theory (SDT), a psychological theory of human motivation, is a prominent paradigm in human–computer interaction (HCI) research on games. However, our prior literature review observed a trend towards shallow applications of the theory. This follow-up work takes a broader view—examining SDT scholarship on games, a wider corpus of SDT-based HCI games research (N = 259), and perspectives from a games industry practitioner conference—to help explain current applications of SDT. Our findings suggest that perfunctory applications of the theory in HCI games research originate in part from within SDT scholarship on games, which itself exhibits limited engagement with theoretical tenets. Against this backdrop, we unpack the popularity of SDT in HCI games research and identify conditions underlying the theory’s current use as an oft-unquestioned paradigm. Finally, we outline avenues for more productive SDT-informed games research and consider ways towards more intentional practices of theory use in HCI.",

To explore this space, we developed Household Wattch, a speculative eco-feedback ‘provotype’ that profiles households according to their energy use data. Evaluated by 16 participants from Australian households engaged in an 18-month energy use monitoring trial, Household Wattch elicited users’ perceptions and expectations about a near future where energy use data is a useful yet potentially sensitive commodity when analysed. We highlight challenges and opportunities for energy use data across three scales: (1) Within the household, (2) Beyond the household (e.g., sharing energy data with third parties) and (3) Post-household (e.g., what happens to energy data when a household re-configures or disbands). Findings suggest users may require support in understanding the sensitivities of their energy use data, particularly when deciding whether to share it with third parties. Opportunities exist for accidental or deliberate surveillance via energy use data, and these need to be identified and managed. Provotypes represent a useful tool for navigating this space, and we provide considerations for how they can support users in speculating over possible energy futures.",

Haptic interfaces, on the other hand, can convey physical design parameters through tangible local cues that don’t distract from the surroundings. We propose two edge-changing haptic devices that use small inertial measurement units (IMUs) and linear actuators to guide users to perform construction tasks in real time: Drangle gives feedback for angling a drill relative to gravity, and Brangle assists with orienting bricks in the plane. We conducted a study with 18 participants to evaluate user performance and gather qualitative feedback. All users understood the edge-changing cues from both devices with minimal training. Drilling holes with Drangle was somewhat less accurate but much faster and easier than with a mechanical guide; 89% of participants preferred Drangle over the mechanical guide. Users generally understood Brangle’s feedback but found its hand-size-specific grip, palmar contact, and attractive tactile cues less intuitive than Drangle’s generalized form factor, fingertip contact, and repulsive cues. After summarizing design considerations, we propose application scenarios and speculate how such devices could improve construction workflows.",

To address these issues, we explored new and creative authentication interactions with an interaction relabelling approach using everyday objects. We conducted six focus group workshops with 20 participants in a living room and a kitchen setting that resulted in a variety of creative authentication interactions with analogue and digital objects. Furthermore, participants created authentication interactions based on tasks that they have to or wish to perform anyway such as cleaning the kitchen - thus primary tasks. This led us to explore the option to transform authentication from being an additional, secondary task towards using primary tasks further in an online study with 194 participants. Relevant implications in terms of acceptable authentication task characteristics, user perceptions, arising security challenges, and psychological habit research are discussed.",

Reproductive healthcare providers are uniquely positioned to offer critical privacy guidance. We conducted interviews with 22 reproductive healthcare providers across the U.S. to explore their perceptions of privacy threats for abortion-seeking patients and the types of guidance they provide. Our findings show that providers are most concerned about privacy risks for vulnerable patients—minors, individuals seeking gender-affirming care, and those in abusive relationships—particularly regarding information that could be intercepted by people close to them, such as partners or relatives. However, providers generally do not perceive government surveillance or hostile actors as major threats to abortion-seeking patients. We conclude with an updated notion of informed consent and preliminary recommendations for ways healthcare providers can revise their threat models to better support the privacy of abortion-seeking patients.",

The measures of checklist interactions included the number of unchecked items and the number of notes written on the checklist. Of the 10 contexts we studied, team leaders’ arrival after the patient and patients with penetrating injuries were both associated with more unchecked items. We also found that the care of patients with external injuries contributed to more notes written on the checklist. Finally, our results showed that more experienced leaders took significantly more notes overall and more numerical notes than less experienced leaders.

Computer models operationalize real-world behaviors of selected variables, and can simulate interactions between the modeled elements through programmed instructions. This study explores how middle school students think about the high-level semantic meaning of those instructions, which we term rules . To investigate this aspect of students’ computational thinking, we developed the Computational Modeling Inventory and administered it to 253 7 th grade students. The Inventory included three computer models that students interacted with during the assessment. In our sample, 99% of students identified at least one key rule underlying a model, but only 14% identified all key rules; 65% believed that model rules can contradict; and 98% could not distinguish between emergent patterns and behaviors that directly resulted from model rules. Despite these misconceptions, compared to the “typical” questions about the science content alone, questions about model rules elicited deeper science thinking, with 2--10 times more responses including reasoning about scientific mechanisms. These results suggest that incorporating computational thinking instruction into middle school science courses might yield deeper learning and more precise assessments around scientific models.",

We discuss how this behavior changes according to call purpose.

We codesigned a video game with a K-5 afterschool program located in a working-class, rural, predominantly white county over 20 weeks. We uncover ways that the codesign process and different activity types can create a permissive environment for enacting behaviors that are harmful to minorities.

Yet, we also found that when an object is (only) close to the crossing path, i.e., a distractor , users still curve their stroke, even though the object does not intrude. We tested the effects of distractor proximity and length. While the crossing motion is modified by a nearby distractor, our results also identify that overall its effect on crossing times was small, and thus Fitts’ law can still be applied safely with distractors.",

    "abstract": "In recent years there has been an introduction of sophisticated new video conferencing technologies (e.g. HP Halo, Cisco Telepresence) that have led to enhancements in the collaborative user experience over traditional video conferencing technologies. Traditional video conferencing set-ups often distort the shared spatial properties of action and communication due to screen and camera orientation disparities and other asymmetries. These distortions affect access to the common resources used to mutually organize action and communication. By contrast new systems, such as Halo, are physically configured to reduce these asymmetries and orientation disparities, thereby minimizing these spatial distortions. By creating appropriate shared spatial geometries, the distributed spaces become “blended” where the spatial geometries of the local space continue coherently across the distributed boundary into the remote site providing the illusion of a single unified space. Drawing on theories of embodied action and workplace design we discuss the importance of this geometric “blending” of space for distributed collaboration and how this is achieved in systems such as Halo. We then extend these arguments to explore the concept of Blended Interaction Spaces – blended spaces in which interactive groupware is incorporated in ways spatially consistent with the physical geometries of the video mediated setup. We illustrate this discussion through a system called BISi that introduces interactive horizontal and vertical multipoint surfaces into a blended video mediated collaboration space. In presenting this system, we highlight some of the particular challenges of creating these systems arising from the spatial consequences of different interaction mechanisms (e.g. direct touch or remote control) and how they affect movement and spatial configuration of people in these spaces.",

Most constraint solvers represent these dataflow relationships as directed edges in a dataflow graph. Unfortunately, dataflow graphs require a great deal of storage. Consequently, an application with a large number of constraints can get pushed into virtual memory, and performance degrades in interactive applications. Our solution is based on the observation that objects derived from the same class use the same constraints, and thus have the same dataflow graphs. We represent the common dataflow patterns in a model dataflow graph that is stored with the class. Instance objects may derive explicit dependencies from this graph when the dependencies are needed. Model dependencies provide a useful new mechanism for improving the storage efficiency of dataflow constraint systems, especially when a large number of constrained objects must be managed.",

Our work contributed to HCI and CSCW literature by identifying the existence of a new type of “rurality.” That is, although residing in the city for nearly almost all of their lives, these second generation mingongs experiences greatly differed from their urban-native peers while exhibiting certain similarities with people living in rural areas.",

    "abstract": "We have developed a method that makes it easier for language novices to look up Japanese and Chinese logographs. Instead of using the arbitrary conventions of logographs, this method is based on three simple prototypes: horizontal, vertical, and other strokes. For example, the code for the logograph ⊞ ( ta , meaning rice field) is 3-3-0, indicating the logograph consists of three horizontal strokes and three vertical strokes. Such codes allow a novice to look up logographs even with no knowledge of the logographic conventions used by native speakers. To make the search easier, a complex logograph can be looked up via the components making up the logograph. We conducted a user evaluation of this system and found that novices could look up logographs with fewer failures with our system than with conventional methods.",

    "abstract": "Modern experiments in many disciplines generate large quantities of network (graph) data. Researchers require aesthetic layouts of these networks that clearly convey the domain knowledge and meaning. However, the problem remains challenging due to multiple conflicting aesthetic criteria and complex domain-specific constraints. In this article, we present a strategy for generating visualizations that can help network biologists understand the protein interactions that underlie processes that take place in the cell. Specifically, we have developed Flud, a crowd-powered system that allows humans with no expertise to design biologically meaningful graph layouts with the help of algorithmically generated suggestions. Furthermore, we propose a novel hybrid approach for graph layout wherein crowd workers and a simulated annealing algorithm build on each other’s progress. A study of about 2,000 crowd workers on Amazon Mechanical Turk showed that the hybrid crowd–algorithm approach outperforms the crowd-only approach and state-of-the-art techniques when workers were asked to lay out complex networks that represent signaling pathways. Another study of seven participants with biological training showed that Flud layouts are more effective compared to those created by state-of-the-art techniques. We also found that the algorithmically generated suggestions guided the workers when they are stuck and helped them improve their score. Finally, we discuss broader implications for mixed-initiative interactions in layout design tasks beyond biology.",

Based on our observations, we identify 17 multi-device management tasks that are important to teachers in this specific device configuration. We conducted a second study to investigate how teachers could perform these tasks with the help of a smartwatch. For remote control tasks, participants preferred smartwatches to interact from a distance, whereas for content-sharing tasks, they preferred to interact directly with the devices displaying the content. We outline design opportunities for multi-device management controls in learning environments, and challenges for HCI research on classroom orchestration.",

The tool visualizes the topic and opinion structure in a collection of feedback and provides interaction for reviewing providers’ backgrounds. A total of 18 teams engaged with the tool to interpret feedback for course projects. We surveyed students (N = 69) to learn about their sensemaking goals, use of the tool to accomplish those goals, and perceptions of specific features. We interviewed students (N = 12) and TAs (N = 2) to assess the tool’s impact on students’ review processes and course instruction. Students discovered valuable feedback, assessed project quality, and justified design decisions to teammates by exploring specific icon patterns in the visualization. The interviews revealed that students mimicked strategies implemented in the tool when reviewing new feedback without the tool. Students found the benefits of the visualization outweighed the cost of labeling feedback.",

This article investigates the use of an ad-hoc system for sending SOS signals in a large-scale exercise that simulated a terrorist attack.

We show how practices of calling for help and reacting to help calls can be affected by such a system and affect the management of the visibility and validity of SOS calls, implying a need for further negotiation in situations where communication is sensitive and technically restrained.",

    "abstract": "Recent discussions in the interaction design community have called attention to sketching as an omnipresent element of any disciplined activity of design, and have pointed out that sketching should be extended beyond the simple creation of a pencil trace on paper. More specifically, the need to deal with all attributes of a user experience, especially the timing, phrasing, and feel of the interaction, has been identified. In this article, we propose extending the concept of sketching with a pencil on paper to the more generic concept of fluent exploration of interactive materials. We define interactive materials as any piece of software or hardware that represents or simulates a part of the interactive user experience, such as input from sensors, output in the form of sound, video, or image, or interaction with Web services or specialized programs. We have implemented the proposed concept within Sketchify, a tool for sketching user interfaces. Sketchify gives designers the freedom to manipulate interactive materials by combining elements of traditional freehand sketching with functional extensions and end-user programming tools, such as spreadsheets and scripting. We have evaluated Sketchify in the education of interaction designers, identifying both successful aspects and aspects that need further improvements.",

    "abstract": "To combine the affordances of paper and computers, prior research has proposed numerous interactive paper systems that link specific paper document content to digital operations such as multimedia playback and proofreading. Yet, it remains unclear to what degree these systems bridge the inherent gap between paper and computers when compared to existing paper-only and computer-only interfaces. In particular, given the special properties of paper, such as limited dynamic feedback, how well does an average new user learn to master the interactive paper system? What factors affect the user performance? And how does the paper interface work in a typical use scenario? To answer these questions, we conducted two empirical experiments on a generic pen-gesture-based command system, called PapierCraft [Liao et al. 2008], for paper-based interfaces. With it, people can select sections of printed document and issue commands such as copy and paste, linking and in-text search. The first experiment focused on the user performance of drawing pen gestures on paper. It proves that users can learn the command system in about 30 minutes and achieve a performance comparable to a table PC-based interface supporting the same gestures. The second experiment examined the application of the command system in active reading tasks. The results show promise for seamless integration of paper and computers in active reading for their combined affordances. In addition, our study identifies some key design issues, such as the pen form factor and feedback of gestures. This article contributes to better understanding on pros and cons of paper and computers, and sheds light on the design of future interfaces for document interaction.",

    "abstract": "Software is increasingly being used to control safety-critical systems. Much research since Levesons fundamental article Software Safety: Why, What, and How (ACM Computing Surveys 18, 2 (1986), pp. 125163) has focused on ways to reduce or avoid software failures. However, the reliability of even the best-engineered software can be undermined by its user interface. Indeed, interface design for safety-critical interactive systems poses special challenges to the human-computer interaction community. This special issue addresses the challenge of analyzing, designing, and building reliable and usable safety-critical interactive systems. From a pragmatic point of view a safety-critical system is a system for which the cost of a failure is more important than the cost of developing the system. Safety-critical interactive systems add the human dimension to a software system by putting control into the hands of a human operator. Prominent examples of such control systems include nuclear power plants, railways systems, airplane cockpits, and military systems. Recent years have seen much effort put into the reengineering of the control system that is well represented in this special issueair traffic control. When compared to office automation systems, human-computer interac-tion for safety-critical interactive systems is both familiar and different. For instance, the management of a functionality like undo, that can be seen as a usability issue in an office automation system, can become a critical functionality when the user interacts with a safety-critical system. The three articles in this special issue provide three snapshots for how human-computer interaction issues play out in the broader field of safety-critical interactive systems. In the first article, Is Paper Safer? The Role of Flight Strips in Air Traffic Control, Wendy Mackay provides a detailed ethnographic study on how air traffic controllers work. As in Mackays article, the case study entails en-route air traffic control. An important contribution of this article is a method for an integrated analysis of three important methods of this field: task performance, analysis of user deviation and consequent hazard, and cooperation among users. Each of the three articles deals with the analysis and design phases of safety-critical interactive systems. If changes are to be made to large, complex, safety-critical control systems, the changes must be made early in the development lifecycle, where redesign in response to identified problems is feasible.This special issue arose from a CHI98 Workshop organized by Palanque and Paterno´ (“Designing User Interfaces for Safety-Critical Systems”, SIGCHI Bulletin 30, 4 ). The three articles included in this special issue were selected from more than a score of papers received. The editors thank and acknowledge their debt to the many qualified external reviewers from several countries who have helped select and improve (through their comments) the contributions in this special issue.",

The strategy is to do generalization through incremental analysis of logical relationships among concrete program entities from the perspective of a particular computational goal. The method uses deductive dataflow analysis with algebraic back-substitution rather than inference with heuristics, and there is no need for generalization-related dialog with the user. We present the algorithms and their time complexities and show that, because the algorithms perform their analyses incrementally, on only the on-screen program elements rather than on the entire program, the method is scalable. Performance data is presented to help demonstrate the scalability.",

The software components of such an interactive system perform their tasks relative to the data structures that represent the information artifact. System components interact with each other by changing these data and responding when relevant changes are made to them by other components. Perhaps the most difficult problem to be solved when building such data-centric systems is the monitoring problem. System components require the ability to watch for and respond to changes made to complex data structures. Previous monitoring approaches are geared toward monitoring single data items rather than entire data structures. This article describes an new monitoring approach called Nanites that is designed to simplify the task of monitoring complex data structures.",

In our work, we address this issue through an exploration of the representation of ADHD in games. First, we engage in interviews with 15 young people with ADHD to understand their lived experience of ADHD and their perspective on its integration in games. Second, we formulate considerations for the design of games that include ADHD in a way that aligns with their experience. Finally, we apply the guidelines to develop three game concepts and evaluate them with the initial group of young people to critically appraise our design considerations. The results show that nuanced representation of ADHD requires careful deliberation, that lived experience should be leveraged with care, and that game design must be mindful of the challenges associated with identifying the fine line between disability simulation and adequate representation.",

We first extend a prior 2D Kinematic Template Matching technique to include head movements. This new technique, Head-Coupled Kinematic Template Matching, was found to improve upon the existing 2D approach, with an angular error of 10.0° when a user was 40% of the way through their movement. We then investigate two additional models that incorporated eye gaze, which were both found to further improve the predicted landing positions. The first model, Gaze-Coupled Kinematic Template Matching resulted in angular error of 6.8° for reciprocal target layouts and 9.1° for random target layouts, when a user was 40% of the way through their movement. The second model, Hybrid Kinematic Template Matching, resulted in angular error of 5.2° for reciprocal target layouts and 7.2° for random target layouts when a user was 40% of the way through their movement. We also found that using just the current gaze location resulted in sufficient predictions in many conditions. We reflect on our results by discussing the broader implications of utilizing multimodal input to inform selection predictions in VR.",

    "abstract": "PDF documents are usually not born-accessible, and so document authors need to put in additional work (remediation) to make them accessible for people with disabilities. Unfortunately, this step is often overlooked and hard to execute, resulting in a large number of inaccessible PDF documents on the internet. Previously, there have been research efforts to investigate potential solutions for remediating PDF documents for accessibility. However, most of the existing research focuses on accessibility of long or scientific PDF documents meant for passive reading. PDF documents come in different types, and this research project focuses on a distinct type of PDF document—forms—where the user is required to interact with the PDF document and enter data. Through our research work we identified that the PDF form remediation process is non-intuitive, repetitive, and overwhelming due to the high-information density of PDF forms, and existing research and tools do not yet address the challenges. Our research work culminated in the creation of a tool – FormA11y – that addresses these challenges by making the repetitive and painstaking process of form remediation easier. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of FormA11y against the industry standard tool – Adobe Acrobat – for PDF form remediation, we performed a within-subject user study with 20 participants. With FormA11y, users remediated forms 2.8 times faster while creating more accurately accessible PDF forms.",

As a step towards building that understanding, based on interviews conducted with veteran web designers, we analyze a corpus of popular web design books published during and shortly after the dot-com boom. Using a combination of ethnographic methods and discourse analysis, we identify the rhetorical strategies in these books and why they were successful in shaping our participants’ ideas about web design. We find that the books exhibit a particular style of technical writing defined by a speech-like techno-masculinity . Despite their short shelf-lives, the books and their writing style contributed to the disciplinary identity of web design which exists today. Studying the history of best practice books is an important opportunity to reflect on the genre of best practices in design, and how we should frame them in the future.",

The article considers four different historical periods impacted by division and denunciation: the European Witch Hunts, the Soviet Purges, the McCarthy Era, and the Chinese Cultural Revolution. Historians have identified patterns common to such periods including: the unity of accusation and action; condemnation as a show of virtue, and defense of the accused as collusion with enemies. These patterns are mapped to findings from social media research such as: impulsive shares are easy to make but difficult to retract; angry posts travel fastest and furthest; likes and retweets express group identity and solidarity. Anachronistic memes, tweets and selfies explore what previous eras might have looked like if contemporary technology had existed in the past. It is argued that such anachronistic fiction may be a useful method for exploring the potential impact of particular design choices.",

However, unlike managing subordinates (managing down), managing people of equal or higher status (managing up) are not obligated to help. These requests often involve collaborative tasks between requesters and performers. Through interviews, we found that these collaborative tasks require coordination work that is not materialized in existing management tools. We also found that requesters are willing to take on this coordination work to see their requests fulfilled. To address this issue, we propose a system called TaskLight , which allows requesters to handle coordination work themselves. For example, requesters can collect useful context and information for their performers. We conducted two deployment studies and found that TaskLight leads to better outcomes because requesters are able to assist performers more effectively. Our findings demonstrate a new way to reduce the social burdens of managing up and improve collaboration.",

By examining current and nascent interactive TV services we trace ways in which they are deployed, received and consumed in the Indian home. From ethnographic probes we offer observations from Indian domestic contexts in the threshold of adopting interactivity as part of everyday TV viewing. We foreground India as a new and primary emerging site adopting interactive TV and to expand attention from the predominance of designing for Western cultural contexts. We develop a specific focus on personalizing TV, a dominant media attribute of interactive TV, conflicting with conventional viewing patterns in the Indian home. We note emergent challenges for interactive TV adoption patterns, particularly for personalization, in the Indian home. Here, TV is viewed as a) Comfort media b) Shared media c) Media for family bonding and raise concerns for viewer preferences around personalizing TV.",

Informed by research on “small” intervention approaches, we sent participants daily behavioral challenges that demonstrated connections between personal health and environmental impact at large. Through a 20-day mobile intervention study, 139 participants uploaded 1,920 submissions documenting their attempts to engage in these challenges. We found that participants’ self-reported healthy eating behavior and general self-efficacy improved significantly immediately after the intervention. Moreover, 30 days after the intervention, participants’ self-reported eating, exercise, and general self-efficacy all significantly improved compared to the beginning of the study. Participants had a more negative reaction when being asked to come up with their own challenges. Based on quantitative and qualitative findings, we provide implications for future researcher on mobile behavior intervention research.",

For young adults, social planning generally occurs through computer-mediated communication. Given the importance of social connectedness for mental health and academic engagement, we sought to understand how young adults plan in-person meetups over computer-mediated communication in the context of the pandemic. We present a qualitative study that explores young adults’ risk negotiation during the COVID-19 pandemic, a period of conflicting public health guidance. Inspired by cultural probe studies, we invited participants to express their preferred precautions for one week as they planned in-person meetups. We interviewed and surveyed participants about their experiences. Through qualitative analysis, we identify strategies for risk negotiation, social complexities that impede risk negotiation, and emotional consequences of risk negotiation. Our findings have implications for AI-mediated support for risk negotiation and assertive communication more generally. We explore tensions between risks and potential benefits of such systems.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive modeling tools have been widely used by researchers and practitioners to help design, evaluate, and study computer user interfaces (UIs). Despite their usefulness, large-scale modeling tasks can still be very challenging due to the amount of manual work needed. To address this scalability challenge, we propose CogTool+, a new cognitive modeling software framework developed on top of the well-known software tool CogTool. CogTool+ addresses the scalability problem by supporting the following key features: (1) a higher level of parameterization and automation; (2) algorithmic components; (3) interfaces for using external data; and (4) a clear separation of tasks, which allows programmers and psychologists to define reusable components (e.g., algorithmic modules and behavioral templates) that can be used by UI/UX researchers and designers without the need to understand the low-level implementation details of such components. CogTool+ also supports mixed cognitive models required for many large-scale modeling tasks and provides an offline analyzer of simulation results. In order to show how CogTool+ can reduce the human effort required for large-scale modeling, we illustrate how it works using a pedagogical example, and demonstrate its actual performance by applying it to large-scale modeling tasks of two real-world user-authentication systems.",

    "abstract": "The standard definition for ‘physicalizations’ is “a physical artifact whose geometry or material properties encode data” [47]. While this working definition provides the fundamental groundwork for conceptualizing physicalization, in practice many physicalization systems go beyond the scope of this definition as they consist of distributed physical and digital elements that involve complex interaction mechanisms. In this paper, we examine how ‘physicalization’ is part of a broader ecology – the ‘physecology’ – with properties that go beyond the scope of the working definition. Through analyzing 60 representative physicalization papers, we derived six design dimensions of a physecology: (i) represented data type, (ii) way of information communication, (iii) interaction mechanisms, (iv) spatial input-output coupling, (v) physical setup, and (vi) audiences involved. Our contribution is the extension of the definition of physicalization to the broader concept of ‘physecology’, to provide conceptual clarity on the design of physicalizations for future work.",
