    "abstract": "Abstract ENSO induces coherent climate anomalies over the Indo-western Pacific, but these anomalies outlast SST anomalies of the equatorial Pacific by a season, with major effects on the Asian summer monsoon. This review provides historical accounts of major milestones and synthesizes recent advances in the endeavor to understand summer variability over the Indo-Northwest Pacific region. Specifically, a large-scale anomalous anticyclone (AAC) is a recurrent pattern in post-El Ni˜no summers, spanning the tropical Northwest Pacific and North Indian oceans. Regarding the ocean memory that anchors the summer AAC, competing hypotheses emphasize either SST cooling in the easterly trade wind regime of the Northwest Pacific or SST warming in the westerly monsoon regime of the North Indian Ocean. Our synthesis reveals a coupled ocean–atmosphere mode that builds on both mechanisms in a two-stage evolution. In spring, when the northeast trades prevail, the AAC and Northwest Pacific cooling are coupled via wind–evaporation–SST feedback. The Northwest Pacific cooling persists to trigger a summer feedback that arises from the interaction of the AAC and North Indian Ocean warming, enabled by the westerly monsoon wind regime. This Indo-western Pacific ocean capacitor (IPOC) effect explains why El Ni˜no stages its last act over the monsoonal Indo-Northwest Pacific and casts the Indian Ocean warming and AAC in leading roles. The IPOC displays interdecadal modulations by the ENSO variance cycle, significantly correlated with ENSO at the turn of the 20th century and after the 1970s, but not in between. Outstanding issues, including future climate projections, are also discussed.",

This database records data relating to all TCs that have passed through the western North Pacific (WNP) and South China Sea (SCS) since 1949. TC data collection has expanded over recent decades via continuous TC monitoring using remote sensing and specialized field detection techniques, allowing collation of a multi-source TC database for the WNP and SCS that covers a long period, with wide coverage and many observational elements. This database now comprises a wide variety of information related to TCs, such as historical or real-time locations (i.e., best track and landfall), intensity, dynamic and thermal structures, wind strengths, precipitation amounts, and frequency. This database will support ongoing research into the processes and patterns associated with TC climatic activity and TC forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Urban environments lie at the confluence of social, cultural, and economic activities and have unique biophysical characteristics due to continued infrastructure development that generally replaces natural landscapes with built-up structures. The vast majority of studies on urban perturbation of local weather and climate have been centered on the urban heat island (UHI) effect, referring to the higher temperature in cities compared to their natural surroundings. Besides the UHI effect and heat waves, urbanization also impacts atmospheric moisture, wind, boundary layer structure, cloud formation, dispersion of air pollutants, precipitation, and storms. In this review article, we first introduce the datasets and methods used in studying urban areas and their impacts through both observation and modeling and then summarize the scientific insights on the impact of urbanization on various aspects of regional climate and extreme weather based on more than 500 studies. We also highlight the major research gaps and challenges in our understanding of the impacts of urbanization and provide our perspective and recommendations for future research priorities and directions.城市环境位于社会、文化和经济活动的结合点,城市下垫面具有独特的生物物理特征。在城市化过程中持续的基础设施建设导致自然景观被建筑物替代。在过去很长时间,绝大部分城市影响天气气候的研究和城市热岛效应(城市及上空温度高于周边地区)有关。除了城市热岛效应,城市化也影响大气湿度、风、边界层结构、云的形成、污染物扩散、降水和暴雨。在这篇综述文章中,我们阅览了超过五百篇文献,从观测和模拟两个方面,首先介绍了用于城市化及影响研究的数据资料和方法,总结了城市化影响区域气候和极端天气的各个领域的科学要点。我们也例举了在理解城市化影响方面目前存在的主要问题和挑战,提出了相应的未来研究重点和方向。.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Arctic plays a fundamental role in the climate system and has shown significant climate change in recent decades, including the Arctic warming and decline of Arctic sea-ice extent and thickness. In contrast to the Arctic warming and reduction of Arctic sea ice, Europe, East Asia and North America have experienced anomalously cold conditions, with record snowfall during recent years. In this paper, we review current understanding of the sea-ice impacts on the Eurasian climate. Paleo, observational and modelling studies are covered to summarize several major themes, including: the variability of Arctic sea ice and its controls; the likely causes and apparent impacts of the Arctic sea-ice decline during the satellite era, as well as past and projected future impacts and trends; the links and feedback mechanisms between the Arctic sea ice and the Arctic Oscillation/North Atlantic Oscillation, the recent Eurasian cooling, winter atmospheric circulation, summer precipitation in East Asia, spring snowfall over Eurasia, East Asian winter monsoon, and midlatitude extreme weather; and the remote climate response (e.g., atmospheric circulation, air temperature) to changes in Arctic sea ice. We conclude with a brief summary and suggestions for future research.",

    "abstract": "In this study, regional persistent haze events (RPHEs) in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region were identified based on the Objective Identification Technique for Regional Extreme Events for the period 1980–2013. The formation mechanisms of the severe RPHEs were investigated with focus on the atmospheric circulation and dynamic mechanisms. Results indicated that: (1) 49 RPHEs occurred during the past 34 years. (2) The severe RPHEs could be categorized into two types according to the large-scale circulation, i.e. the zonal westerly airflow (ZWA) type and the high-pressure ridge (HPR) type. When the ZWA-type RPHEs occurred, the BTH region was controlled by near zonal westerly airflow in the mid–upper troposphere. Southwesterly winds prevailed in the lower troposphere, and near-surface wind speeds were only 1–2 m s−1. Warm and humid air originating from the northwestern Pacific was transported into the region, where the relative humidity was 70% to 80%, creating favorable moisture conditions. When the HPR-type RPHEs appeared, northwesterly airflow in the mid–upper troposphere controlled the region. Westerly winds prevailed in the lower troposphere and the moisture conditions were relatively weak. (3) Descending motion in the mid-lower troposphere caused by the above two circulation types provided a crucial dynamic mechanism for the formation of the two types of RPHEs. The descending motion contributed to a reduction in the height of the planetary boundary layer (PBL), which generated an inversion in the lower troposphere. This inversion trapped the abundant pollution and moisture in the lower PBL, leading to high concentrations of pollutants.",

The CAS FGOALS-f3-L model, experiment settings, and outputs are all given. In total, there are three ensemble experiments over the period 1979–2014, which are performed with different initial states. The model outputs contain a total of 37 variables and include the required three-hourly mean, six-hourly transient, daily and monthly mean datasets. The baseline performances of the model are validated at different time scales. The preliminary evaluation suggests that the CAS FGOALS-f3-L model can capture the basic patterns of atmospheric circulation and precipitation well, including the propagation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation, activities of tropical cyclones, and the characterization of extreme precipitation. These datasets contribute to the benchmark of current model behaviors for the desired continuity of CMIP.",

The refined grid forecast requires direct correction on gridded forecast products, as opposed to correcting forecast data only at individual weather stations. In this study, a deep learning method called CU-net is proposed to correct the gridded forecasts of four weather variables from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast Integrated Forecasting System global model (ECMWF-IFS): 2-m temperature, 2-m relative humidity, 10-m wind speed, and 10-m wind direction, with a forecast lead time of 24 h to 240 h in North China. First, the forecast correction problem is transformed into an image-to-image translation problem in deep learning under the CU-net architecture, which is based on convolutional neural networks. Second, the ECMWF-IFS forecasts and ECMWF reanalysis data (ERA5) from 2005 to 2018 are used as training, validation, and testing datasets. The predictors and labels (ground truth) of the model are created using the ECMWF-IFS and ERA5, respectively. Finally, the correction performance of CU-net is compared with a conventional method, anomaly numerical correction with observations (ANO). Results show that forecasts from CU-net have lower root mean square error, bias, mean absolute error, and higher correlation coefficient than those from ANO for all forecast lead times from 24 h to 240 h. CU-net improves upon the ECMWF-IFS forecast for all four weather variables in terms of the above evaluation metrics, whereas ANO improves upon ECMWF-IFS performance only for 2-m temperature and relative humidity. For the correction of the 10-m wind direction forecast, which is often difficult to achieve, CU-net also improves the correction performance.",

    "abstract": "Changes in ocean heat content (OHC), salinity, and stratification provide critical indicators for changes in Earth's energy and water cycles. These cycles have been profoundly altered due to the emission of greenhouse gasses and other anthropogenic substances by human activities, driving pervasive changes in Earth's climate system. In 2022, the world's oceans, as given by OHC, were again the hottest in the historical record and exceeded the previous 2021 record maximum. According to IAP/CAS data, the 0-2000 m OHC in 2022 exceeded that of 2021 by 10.9 ± 8.3 ZJ (1 Zetta Joules = 1021 Joules); and according to NCEI/NOAA data, by 9.1 ± 8.7 ZJ. Among seven regions, four basins (the North Pacific, North Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea, and southern oceans) recorded their highest OHC since the 1950s. The salinity-contrast index, a quantification of the \"salty gets saltier-fresh gets fresher\" pattern, also reached its highest level on record in 2022, implying continued amplification of the global hydrological cycle. Regional OHC and salinity changes in 2022 were dominated by a strong La Niña event. Global upper-ocean stratification continued its increasing trend and was among the top seven in 2022.由于人类活动排放温室气体, 全球能量和水循环已经发生了显著的变化, 驱动了气候系统的一系列变异. 海洋热含量、 盐度和层结变化是地球系统能量和水循环的重要指针. 2022 年, 全球海洋上层 2000 米热含量再破记录, 海洋成为有现代记录以来最热的一年. 据中国科学院大气物理研究所的测算, 2022 年 0–2000 米海洋热含量超过 2021 年 10.9 ± 8.3 泽塔焦耳 (1 泽塔焦耳= 1021焦耳). 与之一致, 美国国家海洋和大气管理局国家环境信息中心的测算为 9.1 ± 8.7 泽塔焦耳. 在所研究的 7 个海盆中, 北太平洋、 北大西洋、 地中海、 南大洋这 4 个海盆的 2022 年度热含量均创下了自上世纪 50 年代以来的新记录. 此外, 定量化测算海洋盐度 “咸变咸, 淡变淡” 变化趋势的 “盐度差指数” 也在 2022 年达到过去半世纪以来的最高值, 反映了全球水循环在不断加速. 在区域尺度, 海洋热含量和盐度变化显示出较强的拉尼娜事件的影响. 最后, 全球上层 2000 米海洋层结也持续加强, 2022 年全球海洋层结处于有现代记录以来的第 7 高位.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Starting in mid-November, China was hit by several cold events during the early winter of 2020/21. The lowest temperature observed at Beijing station on 7 January reached −19.6°C. In this paper, we show that the outbreak of the record-breaking extreme cold event can be attributed to a huge merging Ural blocking (UB) ridge over the Eurasian region. The sea-ice cover in the Kara and East Siberia Seas (KESS) in autumn was at its lowest value since 1979, which could have served as a precursor signal. Further analysis shows that several successive UB episodes occurred from 1 September 2020 to 10 January 2021. The persistent UB that occurred in late September/early October 2020 may have made an important contribution to the October historical minimum of sea ice in the KESS region. Our results also show that, after each UB episode in winter, significant upward propagation of wave activity occurred around 60°E, which resulted in weakening the stratospheric vortex. Meanwhile, each UB episode also caused a significant reduction in sea-ice extent in KESS and a significant weakening of the westerly jet in mid–high-latitude Eurasia. Results suggest that the Arctic vortex, which is supposed to enhance seasonally, became weaker and more unstable than the climatic mean under the seasonal cumulative effects of UB episodes, KESS warming, and long-lasting negative-phase North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO–). Those seasonal cumulative effects, combined with the impact of La Niña winter, led to the frequent occurrence of extreme cold events.",

As in recent years, the record warmth has again been accompanied with yet more extreme weather and climate events throughout the world. Here, we provide an overview of those of 2023, with details and key background causes to help build upon our understanding of the roles of internal climate variability and anthropogenic climate change. We also highlight emerging features associated with some of these extreme events. Hot extremes are occurring earlier in the year, and increasingly simultaneously in differing parts of the world (e.g., the concurrent hot extremes in the Northern Hemisphere in July 2023). Intense cyclones are exacerbating precipitation extremes (e.g., the North China flooding in July and the Libya flooding in September). Droughts in some regions (e.g., California and the Horn of Africa) have transitioned into flood conditions. Climate extremes also show increasing interactions with ecosystems via wildfires (e.g., those in Hawaii in August and in Canada from spring to autumn 2023) and sandstorms (e.g., those in Mongolia in April 2023). Finally, we also consider the challenges to research that these emerging characteristics present for the strategy and practice of adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change is expected to strengthen the vertical wind shears at aircraft cruising altitudes within the atmospheric jet streams. Such a strengthening would increase the prevalence of the shear instabilities that generate clear-air turbulence. Climate modelling studies have indicated that the amount of moderate-or-greater clear-air turbulence on transatlantic flight routes in winter will increase significantly in future as the climate changes. However, the individual responses of light, moderate, and severe clear-air turbulence have not previously been studied, despite their importance for aircraft operations. Here, we use climate model simulations to analyse the transatlantic wintertime clear-air turbulence response to climate change in five aviation-relevant turbulence strength categories. We find that the probability distributions for an ensemble of 21 clear-air turbulence diagnostics generally gain probability in their right-hand tails when the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration is doubled. By converting the diagnostics into eddy dissipation rates, we find that the ensembleaverage airspace volume containing light clear-air turbulence increases by 59% (with an intra-ensemble range of 43%–68%), light-to-moderate by 75% (39%–96%), moderate by 94% (37%–118%), moderate-to-severe by 127% (30%–170%), and severe by 149% (36%–188%). These results suggest that the prevalence of transatlantic wintertime clear-air turbulence will increase significantly in all aviation-relevant strength categories as the climate changes.",

Previous studies have indicated in-phase and out-of-phase variations between Indian and East Asian summer rainfall. The present study reviews the current understanding of the connection between Indian and East Asian summer rainfall. The review covers the relationship of northern China, southern Japan, and South Korean summer rainfall with Indian summer rainfall; the atmospheric circulation anomalies connecting Indian and East Asian summer rainfall variations; the long-term change in the connection between Indian and northern China rainfall and the plausible reasons for the change; and the influence of ENSO on the relationship between Indian and East Asian summer rainfall and its change. While much progress has been made about the relationship between Indian and East Asian summer rainfall variations, there are several remaining issues that need investigation. These include the processes involved in the connection between Indian and East Asian summer rainfall, the non-stationarity of the connection and the plausible reasons, the influences of ENSO on the relationship, the performance of climate models in simulating the relationship between Indian and East Asian summer rainfall, and the relationship between Indian and East Asian rainfall intraseasonal fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hourly rainfall measurements of 1919 national-level meteorological stations from 1981 through 2012 are used to document, for the first time, the climatology of extreme rainfall in hourly through 24-h accumulation periods in China. Rainfall amounts for 3-, 6-, 12- and 24-h periods at each station are constructed through running accumulation from hourly rainfall data that have been screened by proper quality control procedures. For each station and for each accumulation period, the historical maximum is found, and the corresponding 50-year return values are estimated using generalized extreme value theory. Based on the percentiles of the two types of extreme rainfall values among all the stations, standard thresholds separating Grade I, Grade II and Grade III extreme rainfall are established, which roughly correspond to the 70th and 90th percentiles for each of the accumulation periods. The spatial characteristics of the two types of extreme rainfall are then examined for different accumulation periods. The spatial distributions of extreme rainfall in hourly through 6-h periods are more similar than those of 12- and 24-h periods. Grade III rainfall is mostly found over South China, the western Sichuan Basin, along the southern and eastern coastlines, and in the large river basins and plains. There are similar numbers of stations with Grade III extreme hourly rainfall north and south of 30°N, but the percentage increases to about 70% south of 30°N as the accumulation period increases to 24 hours, reflecting richer moisture and more prolonged rain events in southern China. Potential applications of the extreme rainfall climatology and classification standards are suggested at the end.",

    "abstract": "Abstract China’s recently announced directive on tackling climate change, namely, to reach carbon peak by 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, has led to an unprecedented nationwide response among the academia and industry. Under such a directive, a rapid increase in the grid penetration rate of solar in the near future can be fully anticipated. Although solar radiation is an atmospheric process, its utilization, as to produce electricity, has hitherto been handled by engineers. In that, it is thought important to bridge the two fields, atmospheric sciences and solar engineering, for the common good of carbon neutrality. In this überreview, all major aspects pertaining to solar resource assessment and forecasting are discussed in brief. Given the size of the topic at hand, instead of presenting technical details, which would be overly lengthy and repetitive, the overarching goal of this review is to comprehensively compile a catalog of some recent, and some not so recent, review papers, so that the interested readers can explore the details on their own.",

    "abstract": "The increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere from human activities traps heat within the climate system and increases ocean heat content (OHC). Here, we provide the first analysis of recent OHC changes through 2021 from two international groups. The world ocean, in 2021, was the hottest ever recorded by humans, and the 2021 annual OHC value is even higher than last year's record value by 14 ± 11 ZJ (1 zetta J = 1021 J) using the IAP/CAS dataset and by 16 ± 10 ZJ using NCEI/NOAA dataset. The long-term ocean warming is larger in the Atlantic and Southern Oceans than in other regions and is mainly attributed, via climate model simulations, to an increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations. The year-to-year variation of OHC is primarily tied to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In the seven maritime domains of the Indian, Tropical Atlantic, North Atlantic, Northwest Pacific, North Pacific, Southern oceans, and the Mediterranean Sea, robust warming is observed but with distinct inter-annual to decadal variability. Four out of seven domains showed record-high heat content in 2021. The anomalous global and regional ocean warming established in this study should be incorporated into climate risk assessments, adaptation, and mitigation.人类活动导致大气中温室气体的浓度上升,造成了地球系统的净热量吸收和海洋热含量增加。本文发布了两个国际机构的2021年海洋热含量数据,数据表明:2021年海洋升温持续——成为有现代海洋观测记录以来海洋最暖的一年。相对于2020年,2021年全球海洋上层2000米热含量上升了14 ± 11 ZJ (1 zetta J = 1021 J)(IAP/CAS数据)、以及16 ± 10 ZJ(NOAA/NCEI数据)。海洋长期变暖趋势在南大洋、中低纬度大西洋区域更强,地球系统模式的单个因子强迫实验证明,温室气体增加是主要的驱动因子;而年际尺度的海洋热含量变化主要受到厄尔尼诺-南方涛动模态调控。此外,本文给出了全球7个主要海域的海洋变暖测算,发现地中海、北大西洋、南大洋、北太平洋海区温度均创历史新高。最后,本文提出需要充分将全球和区域海洋变暖的影响纳入气候风险评估、气候变化影响和应对当中。.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The effect of climate change on tropical cyclone intensity has been an important scientific issue for a few decades. Although theory and modeling suggest the intensification of tropical cyclones in a warming climate, there are uncertainties in the assessed and projected responses of tropical cyclone intensity to climate change. While a few comprehensive reviews have already provided an assessment of the effect of climate change on tropical cyclone activity including tropical cyclone intensity, this review focuses mainly on the understanding of the effect of climate change on basin-wide tropical cyclone intensity, including indices for basin-wide tropical cyclone intensity, historical datasets used for intensity trend detection, environmental control of tropical cyclone intensity, detection and simulation of tropical cyclone intensity change, and some issues on the assessment of the effect of climate change on tropical cyclone intensity. In addition to the uncertainty in the historical datasets, intertwined natural variabilities, the considerable model bias in the projected large-scale environment, and poorly simulated inner-core structures of tropical cyclones, it is suggested that factors controlling the basin-wide intensity can be different from individual tropical cyclones since the assessment of the effect of climate change treats tropical cyclones in a basin as a whole.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Following the progress of satellite data assimilation in the 1990s, the combination of meteorological satellites and numerical models has changed the way scientists understand the earth. With the evolution of numerical weather prediction models and earth system models, meteorological satellites will play a more important role in earth sciences in the future. As part of the space-based infrastructure, the Fengyun (FY) meteorological satellites have contributed to earth science sustainability studies through an open data policy and stable data quality since the first launch of the FY-1A satellite in 1988. The capability of earth system monitoring was greatly enhanced after the second-generation polar orbiting FY-3 satellites and geostationary orbiting FY-4 satellites were developed. Meanwhile, the quality of the products generated from the FY-3 and FY-4 satellites is comparable to the well-known MODIS products. FY satellite data has been utilized broadly in weather forecasting, climate and climate change investigations, environmental disaster monitoring, etc. This article reviews the instruments mounted on the FY satellites. Sensor-dependent level 1 products (radiance data) and inversion algorithm-dependent level 2 products (geophysical parameters) are introduced. As an example, some typical geophysical parameters, such as wildfires, lightning, vegetation indices, aerosol products, soil moisture, and precipitation estimation have been demonstrated and validated by in-situ observations and other well-known satellite products. To help users access the FY products, a set of data sharing systems has been developed and operated. The newly developed data sharing system based on cloud technology has been illustrated to improve the efficiency of data delivery.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Record-breaking heavy and persistent precipitation occurred over the Yangtze River Valley (YRV) in June-July (JJ) 2020. An observational data analysis has indicated that the strong and persistent rainfall arose from the confluence of southerly wind anomalies to the south associated with an extremely strong anomalous anticyclone over the western North Pacific (WNPAC) and northeasterly anomalies to the north associated with a high-pressure anomaly over Northeast Asia. A further observational and modeling study has shown that the extremely strong WNPAC was caused by both La Niña-like SST anomaly (SSTA) forcing in the equatorial Pacific and warm SSTA forcing in the tropical Indian Ocean (IO). Different from conventional central Pacific (CP) El Niños that decay slowly, a CP El Niño in early 2020 decayed quickly and became a La Niña by early summer. This quick transition had a critical impact on the WNPAC. Meanwhile, an unusually large area of SST warming occurred in the tropical IO because a moderate interannual SSTA over the IO associated with the CP El Niño was superposed by an interdecadal/long-term trend component. Numerical sensitivity experiments have demonstrated that both the heating anomaly in the IO and the heating anomaly in the tropical Pacific contributed to the formation and maintenance of the WNPAC. The persistent high-pressure anomaly in Northeast Asia was part of a stationary Rossby wave train in the midlatitudes, driven by combined heating anomalies over India, the tropical eastern Pacific, and the tropical Atlantic.",

Then, a series of North and Equatorial Atlantic configurations are used to show that an increase of the horizontal resolution from eddy-resolving to submesoscale-enabled together with the inclusion of high-resolution bathymetry and tides significantly improve the models’ abilities to represent the observed ocean variability and western boundary currents. However, the computational cost of these simulations is extremely large, and for these simulations to become routine, close collaborations with computer scientists are essential to ensure that numerical codes can take full advantage of the latest computing architecture.",

This study focuses on the new positioning of CCUS in the carbon neutrality scenario and aims to identify potential cutting-edge/disruptive CCU technologies that may find important application opportunities during the decarbonization of the energy and industrial system. To this end, direct air capture (DAC), flexible metal-framework materials (MOFs) for CO 2 capture, integrated CO 2 capture and conversion (ICCC), and electrocatalytic CO 2 reduction (ECR) were selected, and their general introduction, the importance to carbon neutrality, and most up-to-date research progress are summarized.",

Here, we use observational data to find the atmospheric circulation variabilities of the North Pacific and Arctic-Pacific-Canada patterns that co-occurred with the development and mature phases of the heatwave, as well as the North America pattern, which coincided with the decaying and eastward movement of the heatwave. Climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (Phase 6) are not designed to simulate a particular heatwave event like this one. Still, models show that greenhouse gases are the main reason for the long-term increase of average daily maximum temperature in western North America in the past and future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An unprecedented cold wave intruded into East Asia in early January 2021 and led to record-breaking or historical extreme low temperatures over vast regions. This study shows that a major stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) event at the beginning of January 2021 exerted an important influence on this cold wave. The major SSW event occurred on 2 January 2021 and subsequently led to the displacement of the stratospheric polar vortex to the East Asian side. Moreover, the SSW event induced the stratospheric warming signal to propagate downward to the mid-to-lower troposphere, which not only enhanced the blocking in the Urals–Siberia region and the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation, but also shifted the tropospheric polar vortex off the pole. The displaced tropospheric polar vortex, Ural blocking, and another downstream blocking ridge over western North America formed a distinct inverted omega-shaped circulation pattern (IOCP) in the East Asia–North Pacific sector. This IOCP was the most direct and impactful atmospheric pattern causing the cold wave in East Asia. The IOCP triggered a meridional cell with an upward branch in East Asia and a downward branch in Siberia. The meridional cell intensified the Siberian high and low-level northerly winds, which also favored the invasion of the cold wave into East Asia. Hence, the SSW event and tropospheric circulations such as the IOCP, negative phase of Arctic Oscillation, Ural blocking, enhanced Siberian high, and eastward propagation of Rossby wave eventually induced the outbreak of an unprecedented cold wave in East Asia in early January 2021.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The non-hydrostatic global variable resolution model (MPAS-atmosphere) is used to conduct the simulations for the South Asian Summer monsoon season (June, July, and August) in 2015 with a refinement over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) at the convection-permitting scale (4 km). Two experiments with different topographical datasets, complex (4-km) and smooth (60-km) topography, are designed to investigate the impacts of topographical complexity on moisture transport and precipitation. Compared with the observations and reanalysis data, the simulation can successfully capture the general features of key meteorological fields over the TP despite slightly underestimating the inflow through the southern TP. The results indicate that the complex topography can decrease the inward and outward moisture transport, ultimately increasing the total net moisture transport into the TP by ∼11%. The impacts of complex topography on precipitation are negligible over the TP, but the spatial distributions of precipitation over the Himalayas are significantly modulated. With the inclusion of complex topography, the sharper southern slopes of the Himalayas shift the lifted airflow and hence precipitation northward compared to the smooth topography. In addition, more small-scale valleys are resolved by the inclusion of complex topography, which serve as channels for moisture transport across the Himalayas, further favoring a northward shift of precipitation. Overall, the difference between the two experiments with different topography datasets is mainly attributed to their differing representation of the degree of the southern slopes of the Himalayas and the extent to which the valleys are resolved.",

    "abstract": "Atmospheric chemistry research has been growing rapidly in China in the last 25 years since the concept of the \"air pollution complex\" was first proposed by Professor Xiaoyan TANG in 1997. For papers published in 2021 on air pollution (only papers included in the Web of Science Core Collection database were considered), more than 24 000 papers were authored or co-authored by scientists working in China. In this paper, we review a limited number of representative and significant studies on atmospheric chemistry in China in the last few years, including studies on (1) sources and emission inventories, (2) atmospheric chemical processes, (3) interactions of air pollution with meteorology, weather and climate, (4) interactions between the biosphere and atmosphere, and (5) data assimilation. The intention was not to provide a complete review of all progress made in the last few years, but rather to serve as a starting point for learning more about atmospheric chemistry research in China. The advances reviewed in this paper have enabled a theoretical framework for the air pollution complex to be established, provided robust scientific support to highly successful air pollution control policies in China, and created great opportunities in education, training, and career development for many graduate students and young scientists. This paper further highlights that developing and low-income countries that are heavily affected by air pollution can benefit from these research advances, whilst at the same time acknowledging that many challenges and opportunities still remain in atmospheric chemistry research in China, to hopefully be addressed over the next few decades.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this review, instead of summarizing all the advances and progress achieved in stratospheric research, the main advances and new developments in stratosphere-troposphere coupling and stratospheric chemistry-climate interactions are summarized, and some outstanding issues and grand challenges are discussed. A consensus has been reached that the stratospheric state is an important source of improving the predictability of the troposphere on sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) time scales and beyond. However, applying stratospheric signals in operational S2S forecast models remains a challenge because of model deficiencies and the complexities of the underlying mechanisms of stratosphere-troposphere coupling. Stratospheric chemistry, which controls the magnitude and distribution of many important climate-forcing agents, plays a critical role in global climate change. Convincing evidence has been found that stratospheric ozone depletion and recovery have caused significant tropospheric climate changes, and more recent studies have revealed that stratospheric ozone variations can even exert an impact on SSTs and sea ice. The climatic impacts of stratospheric aerosols and water vapor are also important. Although their quantitative contributions to radiative forcing have been reasonably well quantified, there still exist large uncertainties in their long-term impacts on climate. The advances and new levels of understanding presented in this review suggest that whole-atmosphere interactions need to be considered in future for a better and more thorough understanding of stratosphere-troposphere coupling and its role in climate change.",

Among numerous trending topics, energy meteorology has been attracting the most attention hitherto. One essential skill of solar energy meteorologists is solar power curve modeling, which seeks to map irradiance and auxiliary weather variables to solar power, by statistical and/or physical means. In this regard, this tutorial review aims to deliver a complete overview of those fundamental scientific and engineering principles pertaining to the solar power curve. Solar power curves can be modeled in two primary ways, one of regression and the other of model chain. Both classes of modeling approaches, alongside their hybridization and probabilistic extensions, which allow accuracy improvement and uncertainty quantification, are scrutinized and contrasted thoroughly in this review.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent years, there has been an increasing need for climate information across diverse sectors of society. This demand has arisen from the necessity to adapt to and mitigate the impacts of climate variability and change. Likewise, this period has seen a significant increase in our understanding of the physical processes and mechanisms that drive precipitation and its variability across different regions of Africa. By leveraging a large volume of climate model outputs, numerous studies have investigated the model representation of African precipitation as well as underlying physical processes. These studies have assessed whether the physical processes are well depicted and whether the models are fit for informing mitigation and adaptation strategies. This paper provides a review of the progress in precipitation simulation over Africa in state-of-the-science climate models and discusses the major issues and challenges that remain.",

    "abstract": "Four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVar) is one of the most promising methods to provide optimal analysis for numerical weather prediction (NWP). Five national NWP centers in the world have successfully applied 4DVar methods in their global NWPs, thanks to the increment method and adjoint technique. However, the application of 4DVar is still limited by the computer resources available at many NWP centers and research institutes. It is essential, therefore, to further reduce the computational cost of 4DVar. Here, an economical approach to implement 4DVar is proposed, using the technique of dimensionreduced projection (DRP), which is called \"DRP-4DVar.\" The proposed approach is based on dimension reduction using an ensemble of historical samples to define a subspace. It directly obtains an optimal solution in the reduced space by fitting observations with historical time series generated by the model to form consistent forecast states, and therefore does not require implementation of the adjoint of tangent linear approximation. To evaluate the performance of the DRP-4DVar on assimilating different types of mesoscale observations, some observing system simulation experiments are conducted using MM5 and a comparison is made between adjoint-based 4DVar and DRP-4DVar using a 6-hour assimilation window.",

The experiment forced by CORE-II (Co-ordinated Ocean–Ice Reference Experiments, Phase II) data (1948–2009) is called OMIP1, and that forced by JRA55-do (surface dataset for driving ocean–sea-ice models based on Japanese 55-year atmospheric reanalysis) data (1958–2018) is called OMIP2. First, the improvement of LICOM from CMIP5 to CMIP6 and the configurations of the two experiments are described. Second, the basic performances of the two experiments are validated using the climatological-mean and interannual time scales from observation. We find that the mean states, interannual variabilities, and long-term linear trends can be reproduced well by the two experiments. The differences between the two datasets are also discussed. Finally, the usage of these data is described. These datasets are helpful toward understanding the origin system bias of the fully coupled model.",

We make use of available surface observations, ECMWF’s ERA5 and its predecessor ERA-Interim, as well as numerical simulations, allowing us to contrast different data sources. We use hindcast simulations performed with Polar-WRF over the Antarctic Peninsula on a nested domain configuration at 45 km (PWRF-45) and 15 km (PWRF-15) spatial resolutions for the period 1991-2015. In addition, we include hindcast simulations of KNMI-RACMO21P obtained from the CORDEX-Antarctica domain (~50 km) for further comparisons. Results show that there is a marked windward warming trend except during summer. This windward warming trend is particularly notable in the autumn season and likely to be associated with the recent deepening of the Amundsen/Bellingshausen Sea low and warm advection towards the Antarctic Peninsula. On the other hand, an overall summer cooling is characterized by the strengthening of the Weddell Sea low as well as an anticyclonic trend over the Amundsen Sea accompanied by northward winds. The persistent cooling trend observed at the Larsen Ice Shelf station is not captured by ERA-Interim, whereas hindcast simulations indicate that there is a clear pattern of windward warming and leeward cooling. Furthermore, larger temporal correlations and lower differences exhibited by PWRF-15 illustrate the existence of the added value in the higher spatial resolution simulation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigated the drivers and physical processes for the abrupt decadal summer surface warming and increases in hot temperature extremes that occurred over Northeast Asia in the mid-1990s. Observations indicate an abrupt increase in summer mean surface air temperature (SAT) over Northeast Asia since the mid-1990s. Accompanying this abrupt surface warming, significant changes in some temperature extremes, characterized by increases in summer mean daily maximum temperature (Tmax), daily minimum temperature (Tmin), annual hottest day temperature (TXx), and annual warmest night temperature (TNx) were observed. There were also increases in the frequency of summer days (SU) and tropical nights (TR). Atmospheric general circulation model experiments forced by changes in sea surface temperature (SST)/sea ice extent (SIE), anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, and anthropogenic aerosol (AA) forcing, relative to the period 1964–93, reproduced the general patterns of observed summer mean SAT changes and associated changes in temperature extremes, although the abrupt decrease in precipitation since the mid-1990s was not simulated. Additional model experiments with different forcings indicated that changes in SST/SIE explained 76% of the area-averaged summer mean surface warming signal over Northeast Asia, while the direct impact of changes in GHG and AA explained the remaining 24% of the surface warming signal. Analysis of physical processes indicated that the direct impact of the changes in AA (through aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions), mainly related to the reduction of AA precursor emissions over Europe, played a dominant role in the increase in TXx and a similarly important role as SST/SIE changes in the increase in the frequency of SU over Northeast Asia via AA-induced coupled atmosphere–land surface and cloud feedbacks, rather than through a direct impact of AA changes on cloud condensation nuclei. The modelling results also imply that the abrupt summer surface warming and increases in hot temperature extremes over Northeast Asia since the mid-1990s will probably sustain in the next few decades as GHG concentrations continue to increase and AA precursor emissions over both North America and Europe continue to decrease.",

    "abstract": "After decades of research and development, the WSR-88D (NEXRAD) network in the United States was upgraded with dual-polarization capability, providing polarimetric radar data (PRD) that have the potential to improve weather observations, quantification, forecasting, and warnings. The weather radar networks in China and other countries are also being upgraded with dual-polarization capability. Now, with radar polarimetry technology having matured, and PRD available both nationally and globally, it is important to understand the current status and future challenges and opportunities. The potential impact of PRD has been limited by their oftentimes subjective and empirical use. More importantly, the community has not begun to regularly derive from PRD the state parameters, such as water mixing ratios and number concentrations, used in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. In this review, we summarize the current status of weather radar polarimetry, discuss the issues and limitations of PRD usage, and explore potential approaches to more efficiently use PRD for quantitative precipitation estimation and forecasting based on statistical retrieval with physical constraints where prior information is used and observation error is included. This approach aligns the observation-based retrievals favored by the radar meteorology community with the model-based analysis of the NWP community. We also examine the challenges and opportunities of polarimetric phased array radar research and development for future weather observation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Surface relative humidity (RH) is a key element for weather and climate monitoring and research. However, RH is not as commonly applied in studying climate change, partly because the observation series of RH are prone to inhomogeneous biases due to non-climate changes in the observation system. A homogenized dataset of daily RH series from 746 stations in Chinese mainland for the period 1960–2017, ChinaRHv1.0, has been developed. Most (685 or 91.82% of the total) station time series were inhomogeneous with one or more break points. The major breakpoints occurred in the early 2000s for many stations, especially in the humid and semi-humid zones, due to the implementation of automated observation across the country. The inhomogeneous biases in the early manual records before this change are positive relative to the recent automatic records, for most of the biased station series. There are more break points detected by using the MASH (Multiple Analysis of Series for Homogenization) method, with biases mainly around −0.5% and 0.5%. These inhomogeneous biases are adjusted with reference to the most recent observations for each station. Based on the adjusted observations, the regional mean RH series of China shows little long-term trend during 1960–2017 [0.006% (10 yr) −1 ], contrasting with a false decreasing trend [−0.414% (10 yr) −1 ] in the raw data. It is notable that ERA5 reanalysis data match closely with the interannual variations of the raw RH series in China, including the jump in the early 2000s, raising a caveat for its application in studying climate change in the region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, we investigate the influence of the winter NAO on the multidecadal variability of winter East Asian surface air temperature (EASAT) and EASAT decadal prediction. The observational analysis shows that the winter EASAT and East Asian minimum SAT (EAmSAT) display strong in-phase fluctuations and a significant 60–80-year multidecadal variability, apart from a long-term warming trend. The winter EASAT experienced a decreasing trend in the last two decades, which is consistent with the occurrence of extremely cold events in East Asia winters in recent years. The winter NAO leads the detrended winter EASAT by 12–18 years with the greatest significant positive correlation at the lead time of 15 years. Further analysis shows that ENSO may affect winter EASAT interannual variability, but does not affect the robust lead relationship between the winter NAO and EASAT. We present the coupled oceanic-atmospheric bridge (COAB) mechanism of the NAO influences on winter EASAT multidecadal variability through its accumulated delayed effect of ∼15 years on the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and Africa–Asia multidecadal teleconnection (AAMT) pattern. An NAO-based linear model for predicting winter decadal EASAT is constructed on the principle of the COAB mechanism, with good hindcast performance. The winter EASAT for 2020–34 is predicted to keep on fluctuating downward until ∼2025, implying a high probability of occurrence of extremely cold events in coming winters in East Asia, followed by a sudden turn towards sharp warming. The predicted 2020/21 winter EASAT is almost the same as the 2019/20 winter.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are an important component of the hydrological cycle linking moisture sources in lower latitudes to the Antarctic surface mass balance. We investigate AR signatures in the atmospheric vertical profiles at the Dronning Maud Land coast, East Antarctica, using regular and extra radiosonde measurements conducted during the Year of Polar Prediction Special Observing Period November 2018 to February 2019. Prominent AR events affecting the locations of Neumayer and Syowa cause a strong increase in specific humidity extending through the mid-troposphere and a strong low-level jet (LLJ). At Neumayer, the peak in the moisture inversion (up to 4 g kg −1 ) is observed between 800 and 900 hPa, while the LLJ (up to 32 m s −1 ) is concentrated below 900 hPa. At Syowa the increase in humidity is less pronounced and peaks near the surface, while there is a substantial increase in wind speed (up to 40 m s −1 ) between 825 and 925 hPa. Moisture transport (MT) within the vertical profile during the ARs attains a maximum of 100 g kg −1 m s −1 at both locations, and is captured by both ERA-Interim and ERA5 reanalysis data at Neumayer, but is strongly underestimated at Syowa. Composites of the enhanced MT events during 2009-19 show that these events represent an extreme state of the lower-tropospheric profile compared to its median values with respect to temperature, humidity, wind speed and, consequently, MT. High temporal- and vertical-resolution radiosonde observations are important for understanding the contribution of these rare events to the total MT towards Antarctica and improving their representation in models.",

Two ensembles of simulation (CTRL, NURB), each consisting of 11 members with a multi-layer urban canopy model and various combinations of physics schemes, were conducted using different land cover scenarios: (i) the real urban land cover, (ii) all cities in d3 being replaced with natural land cover. The results suggest that CTRL reasonably reproduces the spatiotemporal evolution of rainstorms and the 24-h rainfall accumulation over the key region, although the maximum hourly rainfall is underestimated and displaced to the west or southwest by most members. The ensemble mean 24-h rainfall accumulation over the key region of heavy rainfall is reduced by 13%, and the maximum hourly rainfall simulated by each member is reduced by 15–70 mm in CTRL relative to NURB. The reduction in the simulated rainfall by urbanization is closely associated with numerous cities/towns to the south, southeast, and east of Zhengzhou. Their heating effects jointly lead to formation of anomalous upward motions in and above the planetary boundary layer (PBL), which exaggerates the PBL drying effect due to reduced evapotranspiration and also enhances the wind stilling effect due to increased surface friction in urban areas. As a result, the lateral inflows of moisture and high- θ e (equivalent potential temperature) air from south and east to Zhengzhou are reduced.",

Instead of giving a comprehensive review of existing microphysical parameterizations that have been developed over the years, this study concentrates purposely on several topics that we believe are understudied but hold great potential for further advancing bulk microphysics parameterizations: multi-moment bulk microphysics parameterizations and the role of the spectral shape of hydrometeor size distributions; discrete vs “continuous” representation of hydrometeor types; turbulence-microphysics interactions including turbulent entrainment-mixing processes and stochastic condensation; theoretical foundations for the mathematical expressions used to describe hydrometeor size distributions and hydrometeor morphology; and approaches for developing bulk microphysics parameterizations. Also presented are the spectral bin scheme and particle-based scheme (especially, super-droplet method) for representing explicit microphysics. Their advantages and disadvantages are elucidated for constructing cloud models with detailed microphysics that are essential to developing processes understanding and bulk microphysics parameterizations. Particle-resolved direct numerical simulation (DNS) models are described as an emerging technique to investigate turbulence-microphysics interactions at the most fundamental level by tracking individual particles and resolving the smallest turbulent eddies in turbulent clouds. Outstanding challenges and future research directions are explored as well.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Precipitous Arctic sea-ice decline and the corresponding increase in Arctic open-water areas in summer months give more space for sea-ice growth in the subsequent cold seasons. Compared to the decline of the entire Arctic multiyear sea ice, changes in newly formed sea ice indicate more thermodynamic and dynamic information on Arctic atmosphere–ocean–ice interaction and northern mid–high latitude atmospheric teleconnections. Here, we use a large multimodel ensemble from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) to investigate future changes in wintertime newly formed Arctic sea ice. The commonly used model-democracy approach that gives equal weight to each model essentially assumes that all models are independent and equally plausible, which contradicts with the fact that there are large interdependencies in the ensemble and discrepancies in models’ performances in reproducing observations. Therefore, instead of using the arithmetic mean of well-performing models or all available models for projections like in previous studies, we employ a newly developed model weighting scheme that weights all models in the ensemble with consideration of their performance and independence to provide more reliable projections. Model democracy leads to evident bias and large intermodel spread in CMIP6 projections of newly formed Arctic sea ice. However, we show that both the bias and the intermodel spread can be effectively reduced by the weighting scheme. Projections from the weighted models indicate that wintertime newly formed Arctic sea ice is likely to increase dramatically until the middle of this century regardless of the emissions scenario. Thereafter, it may decrease (or remain stable) if the Arctic warming crosses a threshold (or is extensively constrained).",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this study, we investigate the complex relationship between western disturbances (WDs), the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and extreme precipitation events (EPEs) in the western Himalaya (WH) during the extended winter season (November–March). WDs west of WH coincide with 97% of recorded EPEs, contributing substantially (32% in winter, 11% annually) to total precipitation within WH. WDs are 6% less frequent and 4% more intense during El Niño than La Niña to the west of WH. During El Niño (compared to La Niña) years, WDs co-occurring with EPEs are significantly more intense and associated with 17% higher moisture transport over “WH box” (the selected region where most of the winter precipitation over WH occurs). This results in twice the EPE frequency during El Niño periods than La Niña periods. A substantial southward shift (∼180 km) of the subtropical jet (STJ) axis during El Niño brings WD tracks further south towards their primary moisture sources, especially the Arabian Sea. We have shown that WDs that are both more intense and pass to the south of their typical latitudes have higher levels of vertically integrated moisture flux (VIMF) within them. VIMF convergence in the most intense pentile of WDs is 5.7 times higher than in the weakest, and is 3.4 times higher in the second lowest latitude pentile than in the highest. Overall, this study demonstrates a direct link between changes in the latitudinal position and intensity of WDs associated with the winter STJ, and moisture convergence, which leads to the occurrence of EPEs over WH during ENSO phases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A generalized, structural, time series modeling framework was developed to analyze the monthly records of absolute surface temperature, one of the most important environmental parameters, using a deterministicstochastic combined (DSC) approach. Although the development of the framework was based on the characterization of the variation patterns of a global dataset, the methodology could be applied to any monthly absolute temperature record. Deterministic processes were used to characterize the variation patterns of the global trend and the cyclic oscillations of the temperature signal, involving polynomial functions and the Fourier method, respectively, while stochastic processes were employed to account for any remaining patterns in the temperature signal, involving seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models. A prediction of the monthly global surface temperature during the second decade of the 21st century using the DSC model shows that the global temperature will likely continue to rise at twice the average rate of the past 150 years. The evaluation of prediction accuracy shows that DSC models perform systematically well against selected models of other authors, suggesting that DSC models, when coupled with other ecoenvironmental models, can be used as a supplemental tool for short-term (∼10-year) environmental planning and decision making.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Severe haze pollution that occurred in January 2014 in Wuhan was investigated. The factors leading to Wuhan’s PM 2.5 pollution and the characteristics and formation mechanism were found to be significantly different from other megacities, like Beijing. Both the growth rates and decline rates of PM 2.5 concentrations in Wuhan were lower than those in Beijing, but the monthly PM 2.5 value was approximately twice that in Beijing. Furthermore, the sharp increases of PM 2.5 concentrations were often accompanied by strong winds. A high-precision modeling system with an online source-tagged method was established to explore the formation mechanism of five haze episodes. The long-range transport of the polluted air masses from the North China Plain (NCP) was the main factor leading to the sharp increases of PM 2.5 concentrations in Wuhan, which contributed 53.4% of the monthly PM 2.5 concentrations and 38.5% of polluted days. Furthermore, the change in meteorological conditions such as weakened winds and stable weather conditions led to the accumulation of air pollutants in Wuhan after the long-range transport. The contribution from Wuhan and surrounding cities to the PM 2.5 concentrations was determined to be 67.4% during this period. Under the complex regional transport of pollutants from surrounding cities, the NCP, East China, and South China, the five episodes resulted in 30 haze days in Wuhan. The findings reveal important roles played by transregional and intercity transport in haze formation in Wuhan.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Surface ozone (O 3 ) and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) are dominant air pollutants in China. Concentrations of these pollutants can show significant differences between urban and nonurban areas. However, such contrast has never been explored on the country level. This study investigates the spatiotemporal characteristics of urban-to-suburban and urban-to-background difference for O 3 (Δ[O 3 ]) and PM 2.5 (Δ[PM 2.5 ]) concentrations in China using monitoring data from 1171 urban, 110 suburban, and 15 background sites built by the China National Environmental Monitoring Center (CNEMC). On the annual mean basis, the urban-to-suburban Δ[O 3 ] is −3.7 ppbv in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, 1.0 ppbv in the Yangtze River Delta, −3.5 ppbv in the Pearl River Delta, and −3.8 ppbv in the Sichuan Basin. On the contrary, the urban-to-suburban Δ[PM 2.5 ] is 15.8, −0.3, 3.5 and 2.4 µg m −3 in those areas, respectively. The urban-to-suburban contrast is more significant in winter for both Δ[O 3 ] and Δ[PM 2.5 ]. In eastern China, urban-to-background differences are also moderate during summer, with −5.1 to 6.8 ppbv for Δ[O 3 ] and −0.1 to 22.5 µg m −3 for Δ[PM 2.5 ]. However, such contrasts are much larger in winter, with −22.2 to 5.5 ppbv for Δ[O 3 ] and 3.1 to 82.3 µg m −3 for Δ[PM 2.5 ]. Since the urban region accounts for only 2% of the whole country’s area, the urban-dominant air quality data from the CNEMC network may overestimate winter [PM 2.5 ] but underestimate winter [O 3 ] over the vast domain of China. The study suggests that the CNEMC monitoring data should be used with caution for evaluating chemical models and assessing ecosystem health, which require more data outside urban areas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is important to local and downstream ecosystems. Based on a weighting method considering model skill and independence, changes in the TP precipitation for near-term (2021–40), mid-term (2041–60) and long-term (2081–2100) under shared socio-economic pathways (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5) are projected with 27 models from the latest Sixth Phase of the Couple Model Intercomparison Project. The annual mean precipitation is projected to increase by 7.4%–21.6% under five SSPs with a stronger change in the northern TP by the end of the 21st century relative to the present climatology. Changes in the TP precipitation at seasonal scales show a similar moistening trend to that of annual mean precipitation, except for the drying trend in winter precipitation along the southern edges of the TP. Weighting generally suggests a slightly stronger increase in TP precipitation with reduced model uncertainty compared to equally-weighted projections. The effect of weighting exhibits spatial and seasonal differences. Seasonally, weighting leads to a prevailing enhancement of increase in spring precipitation over the TP. Spatially, the influence of weighting is more remarkable over the northwestern TP regarding the annual, summer and autumn precipitation. Differences between weighted and original MMEs can give us more confidence in a stronger increase in precipitation over the TP, especially for the season of spring and the region of the northwestern TP, which requires additional attention in decision making.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examines the long-term change in the threat of landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) in East Asia over the period 1975–2020 with a focus on rapidly intensifying (RI) TCs. The increase in the annual number of RI-TCs over the western North Pacific and the northwestward shift of their genesis location lead to an increasing trend in the annual number of landfalling RI-TCs along the coast of East Asia. The annual power dissipation index (PDI), a measure of the destructive potential of RI-TCs at landfall, also shows a significant increasing trend due to increases in the annual frequency and mean landfall intensity of landfalling RI-TCs. The increase in mean landfall intensity is related to a higher lifetime maximum intensity (LMI) and the LMI location of the landfalling RI-TCs being closer to the coast. The increase in the annual PDI of East Asia is mainly associated with landfalling TCs in the southern (the Philippines, South China, and Vietnam) and northern parts (Japan and the Korean Peninsula) of East Asia due to long-term changes in vertical wind shear and TC heat potential. The former leads to a northwestward shift of favorable environments for TC genesis and intensification, resulting in the northwestward shift in the genesis, RI, and LMI locations of RI-TCs. The latter provides more heat energy from the ocean for TC intensification, increasing its chances to undergo RI.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Several consecutive extreme cold events impacted China during the first half of winter 2020/21, breaking the low-temperature records in many cities. How to make accurate climate predictions of extreme cold events is still an urgent issue. The synergistic effect of the warm Arctic and cold tropical Pacific has been demonstrated to intensify the intrusions of cold air from polar regions into middle-high latitudes, further influencing the cold conditions in China. However, climate models failed to predict these two ocean environments at expected lead times. Most seasonal climate forecasts only predicted the 2020/21 La Niña after the signal had already become apparent and significantly underestimated the observed Arctic sea ice loss in autumn 2020 with a 1–2 month advancement. In this work, the corresponding physical factors that may help improve the accuracy of seasonal climate predictions are further explored. For the 2020/21 La Niña prediction, through sensitivity experiments involving different atmospheric–oceanic initial conditions, the predominant southeasterly wind anomalies over the equatorial Pacific in spring of 2020 are diagnosed to play an irreplaceable role in triggering this cold event. A reasonable inclusion of atmospheric surface winds into the initialization will help the model predict La Niña development from the early spring of 2020. For predicting the Arctic sea ice loss in autumn 2020, an anomalously cyclonic circulation from the central Arctic Ocean predicted by the model, which swept abnormally hot air over Siberia into the Arctic Ocean, is recognized as an important contributor to successfully predicting the minimum Arctic sea ice extent.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Radiative transfer simulations and remote sensing studies fundamentally require accurate and efficient computation of the optical properties of non-spherical particles. This paper proposes a deep learning (DL) scheme in conjunction with an optical property database to achieve this goal. Deep neural network (DNN) architectures were obtained from a dataset of the optical properties of super-spheroids with extensive shape parameters, size parameters, and refractive indices. The dataset was computed through the invariant imbedding T -matrix method. Four separate DNN architectures were created to compute the extinction efficiency factor, single-scattering albedo, asymmetry factor, and phase matrix. The criterion for designing these neural networks was the achievement of the highest prediction accuracy with minimal DNN parameters. The numerical results demonstrate that the determination coefficients are greater than 0.999 between the prediction values from the neural networks and the truth values from the database, which indicates that the DNN can reproduce the optical properties in the dataset with high accuracy. In addition, the DNN model can robustly predict the optical properties of particles with high accuracy for shape parameters or refractive indices that are unavailable in the database. Importantly, the ratio of the database size (∼127 GB) to that of the DNN parameters (∼20 MB) is approximately 6810, implying that the DNN model can be treated as a highly compressed database that can be used as an alternative to the original database for real-time computing of the optical properties of non-spherical particles in radiative transfer and atmospheric models.",

Each member includes a historical experiment (1850–2014) and an experiment (2015–99) under the very high greenhouse gas emissions Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenario (SSP5-8.5). The dataset includes monthly and daily temperature, precipitation, and other variables, requiring storage of 275 TB. Additionally, the surface air temperature (SAT) and land precipitation simulated by the FGOALS-g3 super-large ensemble have been validated and projected. The ensemble can capture the response of SAT and land precipitation to external forcings well, and the internal variabilities can be quantified. The availability of more than 100 realizations will help researchers to study rare events and improve the understanding of the impact of internal variability on forced climate changes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Thousands of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) play a critical role in the regional water cycle, weather, and climate. In recent years, the areas of TP lakes underwent drastic changes and have become a research hotspot. However, the characteristics of the lake-atmosphere interaction over the high-altitude lakes are still unclear, which inhibits model development and the accurate simulation of lake climate effects. The source region of the Yellow River (SRYR) has the largest outflow lake and freshwater lake on the TP and is one of the most densely distributed lakes on the TP. Since 2011, three observation sites have been set up in the Ngoring Lake basin in the SRYR to monitor the lake-atmosphere interaction and the differences among water-heat exchanges over the land and lake surfaces. This study presents an eight-year (2012–19), half-hourly, observation-based dataset related to lake–atmosphere interactions composed of three sites. The three sites represent the lake surface, the lakeside, and the land. The observations contain the basic meteorological elements, surface radiation, eddy covariance system, soil temperature, and moisture (for land). Information related to the sites and instruments, the continuity and completeness of data, and the differences among the observational results at different sites are described in this study. These data have been used in the previous study to reveal a few energy and water exchange characteristics of TP lakes and to validate and improve the lake and land surface model. The dataset is available at National Cryosphere Desert Data Center and Science Data Bank.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Agricultural flash droughts are high-impact phenomena, characterized by rapid soil moisture dry down. The ensuing dry conditions can persist for weeks to months, with detrimental effects on natural ecosystems and crop cultivation. Increases in the frequency of these rare events in a future warmer climate would have significant societal impact. This study uses an ensemble of 10 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) models to investigate the projected change in agricultural flash drought during the 21st century. Comparison across geographical regions and climatic zones indicates that individual events are preceded by anomalously low relative humidity and precipitation, with long-term trends governed by changes in temperature, relative humidity, and soil moisture. As a result of these processes, the frequency of both upper-level and root-zone flash drought is projected to more than double in the mid- and high latitudes over the 21st century, with hot spots developing in the temperate regions of Europe, and humid regions of South America, Europe, and southern Africa.",

The HYSPLIT model provides more insightful information than water vapor flux. Analysis of the specific humidity along the trajectories revealed the origins of moisture and their contributions to the moisture supply in Southeast China. In the boreal summer half year, four key moisture transport paths from the eastern Indian Ocean, central Indian Ocean, South China Sea (SCS), and western North Pacific (WNP) contribute 10%, 20%, 31%, and 16% of the moisture to Southeast China, respectively. In the winter half year, the contributions of the paths from the WNP and North China double. Examination of heavy rainfall events showed that under tropical storm conditions, all moisture transport routines are rotated cyclonically before reaching Southeast China. The invasion of cold air can trigger heavy rainfall in both the summer and winter half years but plays different roles: it does not contribute to the moisture supply but plays a key role in converging and uplifting the moisture in the summer half year, while it supplies a great amount of moisture in the winter half year as it absorbs abundant moisture in crossing the WNP.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have examined the projected climate types in China by 2100. This study identified the emergence time of climate shifts at a 1◦ scale over China from 1990 to 2100 and investigated the temporal evolution of Köppen–Geiger climate classifications computed from CMIP5 multi-model outputs. Climate shifts were detected in transition regions (7%–8% of China's land area) by 2010, including rapid replacement of mixed forest (Dwb) by deciduous forest (Dwa) over Northeast China, strong shrinkage of alpine climate type (ET) on the Tibetan Plateau, weak northward expansion of subtropical winterdry climate (Cwa) over Southeast China, and contraction of oceanic climate (Cwb) in Southwest China. Under all future RCP (Representative Concentration Pathway) scenarios, the reduction of Dwb in Northeast China and ET on the Tibetan Plateau was projected to accelerate substantially during 2010–30, and half of the total area occupied by ET in 1990 was projected to be redistributed by 2040. Under the most severe scenario (RCP8.5), sub-polar continental winter dry climate over Northeast China would disappear by 2040–50, ET on the Tibetan Plateau would disappear by 2070, and the climate types in 35.9% and 50.8% of China's land area would change by 2050 and 2100, respectively. The results presented in this paper indicate imperative impacts of anthropogenic climate change on China's ecoregions in future decades.",

Two ultraviolet radiation datasets are described in this paper. One contains hourly observations of UV radiation measured at 40 Chinese Ecosystem Research Network stations from 2005 to 2015. CUV3 broadband radiometers were used to observe the UV radiation, with an accuracy of 5%, which meets the World Meteorology Organization's measurement standards. The extremum method was used to control the quality of the measured datasets. The other dataset contains daily cumulative UV radiation estimates that were calculated using an all-sky estimation model combined with a hybrid model. The reconstructed daily UV radiation data span from 1961 to 2014. The mean absolute bias error and root-mean-square error are smaller than 30% at most stations, and most of the mean bias error values are negative, which indicates underestimation of the UV radiation intensity. These datasets can improve our basic knowledge of the spatial and temporal variations in UV radiation. Additionally, these datasets can be used in studies of potential ozone formation and atmospheric oxidation, as well as simulations of ecological processes.",

The monthly and a part of the surface daily data in this study can be accessed on the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) node. Besides the details of the model and experiments, the evolutions and spatial patterns of large-scale and mesoscale features are also presented. The mesoscale features are reproduced well in the high-resolution simulation, as the mesoscale activities can contribute up to 50% of the total SST variability in eddy-rich regions. Also, the large-scale circulations are remarkably improved compared with the low-resolution simulation, such as the climatological annual mean SST (the RMSE is reduced from 0.59°C to 0.47°C, globally) and the evolution of Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. The preliminary evaluation also indicates that there are systematic biases in the salinity, the separation location of the western boundary currents, and the magnitude of eddy kinetic energy. All these biases are worthy of further investigation.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the relationship between the phase transition of the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) and decadal variation of the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) in the twentieth century. The first transition occurred in the 1940s, with an enhanced SST in the North Pacific and reduced SST in the tropical eastern Pacific and South Indian Ocean. In agreement with these SST changes, a higher SLP was found in most parts of the Pacific, while a lower SLP was found in the North Pacific and most parts of the Indian Ocean. In this case, the EASM was largely enhanced with a southerly anomaly in the lower troposphere along the east coast of China. Correspondingly, there was less rainfall in the Yangtze River valley and more rainfall in northern and southern China. An opposite change was found when the PDO reversed its phase in the late 1970s. In the tropical Indian Ocean and western Pacific, however, the SST was enhanced in both the 1940s and 1970s. As a result, the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) tended to extend westward with a larger magnitude in the 1970s. The major features were reasonably reproduced by an atmospheric general circulation model (IAP AGCM4.0) prescribed with observed SST and sea ice. On the other hand, the westward extension of the WPSH was exaggerated in the 1970s, while it was underestimated in the 1940s. Besides, the spatial pattern of the simulated summer rainfall in eastern China tended to shift southward compared with the observation.",

There are three simulations in Tier-1, with different initial states, and five simulations in Tier-3, with different topographies or surface thermal status. Specifically, Tier-3 contains four orographic perturbation experiments that remove the Tibetan–Iranian Plateau, East African and Arabian Peninsula highlands, Sierra Madre, and Andes, and one thermal perturbation experiment that removes the surface sensible heating over the Tibetan–Iranian Plateau and surrounding regions at altitudes above 500 m. These datasets will contribute to CMIP6’s value as a benchmark to evaluate the importance of long-term and short-term trends of the sea surface temperature in monsoon circulations and precipitation, and to a better understanding of the orographic impact on the global monsoon system over highlands.",

    "abstract": "This study examines associations between California Central Valley (CCV) heat waves and the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO). These heat waves have major economic impact. Our prior work showed that CCV heat waves are frequently preceded by convection over the tropical Indian and eastern Pacific oceans, in patterns identifiable with MJO phases. The main analysis method is lagged composites (formed after each MJO phase pair) of CCV synoptic station temperature, outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), and velocity potential (VP). Over the CCV, positive temperature anomalies occur only after the Indian Ocean (phases 2–3) or eastern Pacific Ocean (phases 8–1) convection (implied by OLR and VP fields). The largest fractions of CCV hot days occur in the two weeks after onset of those two phase pairs. OLR and VP composites have significant subsidence and convergence above divergence over the CCV during heat waves, and these structures are each part of larger patterns having significant areas over the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Prior studies showed that CCV heat waves can be roughly grouped into two clusters: Cluster 2 is preceded by a heat wave over northwestern North America, while Cluster 1 is not. OLR and VP composite analyses are applied separately to these two clusters. However, for Cluster 2, the subsidence and VP over the CCV are not significant, and the large-scale VP pattern has low correlation with the MJO lagged composite field. Therefore, the association between the MJO convection and subsequent CCV heat wave is more evident in Cluster 1 than Cluster 2.",

The details of the CAS FGOALS-f3-L model, experiment settings and output datasets are briefly introduced. The datasets include monthly and daily outputs from the atmospheric, oceanic, land and sea-ice component models of CAS FGOALS-f3-L, and all these data have been published online in the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF, https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip6/ ). The three ensembles are initialized from the 600th, 650th and 700th model year of the preindustrial experiment (piControl) and forced by the same historical forcing provided by CMIP6 from 1850 to 2014. The performance of the coupled model is validated in comparison with some recent observed atmospheric and oceanic datasets. It is shown that CAS FGOALS-f3-L is able to reproduce the main features of the modern climate, including the climatology of air surface temperature and precipitation, the long-term changes in global mean surface air temperature, ocean heat content and sea surface steric height, and the horizontal and vertical distribution of temperature in the ocean and atmosphere. Meanwhile, like other state-of-the-art coupled GCMs, there are still some obvious biases in the historical simulations, which are also illustrated. This paper can help users to better understand the advantages and biases of the model and the datasets.",

Comparing three months of observations from the Microwave Temperature Sounder 2 (MWTS-2), the Microwave Humidity Sounder 2 (MWHS-2), and the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) to Met Office short-range forecasts, we characterize the instrumental biases, show how those biases have changed with respect to their predecessors onboard FY-3C, and how they compare to the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) onboard NOAA-20 and the Global Precipitation Measurement Microwave Imager (GMI). The MWTS-2 global bias is much reduced with respect to its predecessor and compares well to ATMS at equivalent channel frequencies, differing only by 0.36 ± 0.28 K (1σ) on average. A suboptimal averaging of raw digital counts is found to cause an increase in striping noise and an ascending—descending bias. MWHS-2 benefits from a new calibration method improving the 183-GHz humidity channels with respect to its predecessor and biases for these channels are within ± 1.9 K to ATMS. MWRI presents the largest improvements, with reduced global bias and standard deviation with respect to FY-3C; although, spurious, seemingly transient, brightness temperatures have been detected in the observations at 36.5 GHz (vertical polarization). The strong solar-dependent bias that affects the instrument on FY-3C has been reduced to less than 0.2 K on average for FY-3D MWRI. Experiments where radiances from these instruments were assimilated on top of a full global system demonstrated a neutral to positive impact on the forecasts, as well as on the fit to the background of independent instruments.",

These ensemble versions have been merged with the ERSSTv5 ensemble dataset, and an upgraded version of the CMST-Interim dataset with 5° × 5° resolution has been developed. The CMST-Interim dataset has significantly improved the coverage rate of global surface temperature data. After reconstruction, the data coverage before 1950 increased from 78%–81% of the original CMST to 81%–89%. The total coverage after 1955 reached about 93%, including more than 98% in the Northern Hemisphere and 81%–89% in the Southern Hemisphere. Through the reconstruction ensemble experiments with different parameters, a good basis is provided for more systematic uncertainty assessment of C-LSAT2.0 and CMST-Interim. In comparison with the original CMST, the global mean surface temperatures are estimated to be cooler in the second half of 19th century and warmer during the 21st century, which shows that the global warming trend is further amplified. The global warming trends are updated from 0.085 ± 0.004°C (10 yr) −1 and 0.128 ± 0.006°C (10 yr) −1 to 0.089 ± 0.004°C (10 yr) −1 and 0.137 ± 0.007°C (10 yr) −1 , respectively, since the start and the second half of 20th century.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Persistent heavy rainfall events (PHREs) over the Yangtze–Huaihe River Valley (YHRV) during 1981–2020 are classified into three types (type-A, type-B and type-C) according to pattern correlation. The characteristics of the synoptic systems for the PHREs and their possible development mechanisms are investigated. The anomalous cyclonic disturbance over the southern part of the YHRV during type-A events is primarily maintained and intensified by the propagation of Rossby wave energy originating from the northeast Atlantic in the mid–upper troposphere and the northward propagation of Rossby wave packets from the western Pacific in the mid–lower troposphere. The zonal propagation of Rossby wave packets and the northward propagation of Rossby wave packets during type-B events are more coherent than those for type-A events, which induces eastward propagation of stronger anomaly centers of geopotential height from the northeast Atlantic Ocean to the YHRV and a meridional anomaly in geopotential height over the Asian continent. Type-C events have “two ridges and one trough” in the high latitudes of the Eurasian continent, but the anomalous intensity of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and the trough of the YHRV region are weaker than those for type-A and type-B events. The composite synoptic circulation of four PHREs in 2020 is basically consistent with that of the corresponding PHRE type. The location of the South Asian high (SAH) in three of the PHREs in 2020 moves eastward as in the composite of the three types, but the position of the WPSH of the four PHREs is clearly westward and northward. Two water vapor conveyor belts and two cold air conveyor belts are tracked during the four PHREs in 2020, but the water vapor path from the western Pacific is not seen, which may be caused by the westward extension of the WPSH.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A sustained heavy rainfall event occurred over the Sichuan basin in southwest China during 10–18 August 2020, showing pronounced diurnal rainfall variations with nighttime peak and afternoon minimum values, except on the first day. Results show that the westward extension of the anomalously strong western Pacific subtropical high was conducive to the maintenance of a southerly low-level jet (LLJ) in and to the southeast of the basin, which favored continuous water vapor transport and abnormally high precipitable water in the basin. The diurnal cycle of rainfall over the basin was closely related to the periodic oscillation of the LLJ in both wind speed and direction that was caused by the combination of inertial oscillation and terrain thermal forcing. The nocturnally enhanced rainfall was produced by moist convection mostly initiated during the evening hours over the southwest part of the basin where high convective available potential energy with moister near-surface moist air was present. The convective initiation took place as cold air from either previous precipitating clouds from the western Sichuan Plateau or a larger-scale northerly flow met a warm and humid current from the south. It was the slantwise lifting of the warm, moist airflow above the cold air, often facilitated by southwest vortices and quasi-geostrophic ascent, that released the convective instability and produced heavy rainfall.",

These datasets provide the homogenised monthly and daily mean (TG), minimum (TN), and maximum (TX) temperature and precipitation (RR) records since 1960 at 366 stations in China and 56 stations in Greece. The datasets are available at the Science Data Bank repository and can be downloaded from https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.01731 and https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.01720 . For China, the regional mean annual TG, TX, TN, and RR series during 1960–2021 showed significant warming or increasing trends of 0.27°C (10 yr) −1 , 0.22°C (10 yr) −1 , 0.35°C (10 yr) −1 , and 6.81 mm (10 yr) −1 , respectively. Most of the seasonal series revealed trends significant at the 0.05 level, except for the spring, summer, and autumn RR series. For Greece, there were increasing trends of 0.09°C (10 yr) −1 , 0.08°C (10 yr) −1 , and 0.11°C (10 yr) −1 for the annual TG, TX, and TN series, respectively, while a decreasing trend of −23.35 mm (10 yr) −1 was present for RR. The seasonal trends showed a significant warming rate for summer, but no significant changes were noted for spring (except for TN), autumn, and winter. For RR, only the winter time series displayed a statistically significant and robust trend [−15.82 mm (10 yr) −1 ]. The final homogenised temperature and precipitation time series for both China and Greece provide a better representation of the large-scale pattern of climate change over the past decades and provide a quality information source for climatological analyses.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Weather forecasts from numerical weather prediction models play a central role in solar energy forecasting, where a cascade of physics-based models is used in a model chain approach to convert forecasts of solar irradiance to solar power production. Ensemble simulations from such weather models aim to quantify uncertainty in the future development of the weather, and can be used to propagate this uncertainty through the model chain to generate probabilistic solar energy predictions. However, ensemble prediction systems are known to exhibit systematic errors, and thus require post-processing to obtain accurate and reliable probabilistic forecasts. The overarching aim of our study is to systematically evaluate different strategies to apply post-processing in model chain approaches with a specific focus on solar energy: not applying any post-processing at all; post-processing only the irradiance predictions before the conversion; post-processing only the solar power predictions obtained from the model chain; or applying post-processing in both steps. In a case study based on a benchmark dataset for the Jacumba solar plant in the U.S., we develop statistical and machine learning methods for post-processing ensemble predictions of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and solar power generation. Further, we propose a neural-network-based model for direct solar power forecasting that bypasses the model chain. Our results indicate that postprocessing substantially improves the solar power generation forecasts, in particular when post-processing is applied to the power predictions. The machine learning methods for post-processing slightly outperform the statistical methods, and the direct forecasting approach performs comparably to the post-processing strategies.",

    "abstract": "Using a set of numerical experiments from 39 CMIP5 climate models, we project the emergence time for 4◦C global warming with respect to pre-industrial levels and associated climate changes under the RCP8.5 greenhouse gas concentration scenario. Results show that, according to the 39 models, the median year in which 4◦C global warming will occur is 2084. Based on the median results of models that project a 4◦C global warming by 2100, land areas will generally exhibit stronger warming than the oceans annually and seasonally, and the strongest enhancement occurs in the Arctic, with the exception of the summer season. Change signals for temperature go outside its natural internal variabilities globally, and the signal-tonoise ratio averages 9.6 for the annual mean and ranges from 6.3 to 7.2 for the seasonal mean over the globe, with the greatest values appearing at low latitudes because of low noise. Decreased precipitation generally occurs in the subtropics, whilst increased precipitation mainly appears at high latitudes. The precipitation changes in most of the high latitudes are greater than the background variability, and the global mean signal-to-noise ratio is 0.5 and ranges from 0.2 to 0.4 for the annual and seasonal means, respectively. Attention should be paid to limiting global warming to 1.5◦C, in which case temperature and precipitation will experience a far more moderate change than the natural internal variability. Large inter-model disagreement appears at high latitudes for temperature changes and at mid and low latitudes for precipitation changes. Overall, the intermodel consistency is better for temperature than for precipitation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper describes the historical simulations produced by the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS) climate system model (CAMS-CSM), which are contributing to phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The model description, experiment design and model outputs are presented. Three members’ historical experiments are conducted by CAMS-CSM, with two members starting from different initial conditions, and one excluding the stratospheric aerosol to identify the effect of volcanic eruptions. The outputs of the historical experiments are also validated using observational data. It is found that the model can reproduce the climatological mean states and seasonal cycle of the major climate system quantities, including the surface air temperature, precipitation, and the equatorial thermocline. The long-term trend of air temperature and precipitation is also reasonably captured by CAMS-CSM. There are still some biases in the model that need further improvement. This paper can help the users to better understand the performance and the datasets of CAMS-CSM.",

Recent system upgrades have seen the introduction of a scattering-permitting observation operator and the development of a variable observation error using both liquid and ice water paths as proxies of scattering-induced bias. Applied to the Fengyun 3 Microwave Temperature Sounder 2 (MWTS-2) and the Microwave Humidity Sounder 2 (MWHS-2), this methodology increases the data usage by up to 8% at 183 GHz. It also allows for the investigation into the assimilation of MWHS-2 118 GHz channels, sensitive to temperature and lower tropospheric humidity, but whose large sensitivity to ice cloud have prevented their use thus far. While the impact on the forecast is mostly neutral with small but significant short-range improvements, 0.3% in terms of root mean square error, for southern winds and low-level temperature, balanced by 0.2% degradations of short-range northern and tropical low-level temperature, benefits are observed in the background fit of independent instruments used in the system. The lower tropospheric temperature sounding Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) channels see a reduction of the standard deviation in the background departure of up to 1.2%. The Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit A (AMSU-A) stratospheric sounding channels improve by up to 0.5% and the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) humidity sounding channels improve by up to 0.4%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Southern Ocean is covered by a large amount of clouds with high cloud albedo. However, as reported by previous climate model intercomparison projects, underestimated cloudiness and overestimated absorption of solar radiation (ASR) over the Southern Ocean lead to substantial biases in climate sensitivity. The present study revisits this long-standing issue and explores the uncertainty sources in the latest CMIP6 models. We employ 10-year satellite observations to evaluate cloud radiative effect (CRE) and cloud physical properties in five CMIP6 models that provide comprehensive output of cloud, radiation, and aerosol. The simulated longwave, shortwave, and net CRE at the top of atmosphere in CMIP6 are comparable with the CERES satellite observations. Total cloud fraction (CF) is also reasonably simulated in CMIP6, but the comparison of liquid cloud fraction (LCF) reveals marked biases in spatial pattern and seasonal variations. The discrepancies between the CMIP6 models and the MODIS satellite observations become even larger in other cloud macro- and micro-physical properties, including liquid water path (LWP), cloud optical depth (COD), and cloud effective radius, as well as aerosol optical depth (AOD). However, the large underestimation of both LWP and cloud effective radius (regional means ∼20% and 11%, respectively) results in relatively smaller bias in COD, and the impacts of the biases in COD and LCF also cancel out with each other, leaving CRE and ASR reasonably predicted in CMIP6. An error estimation framework is employed, and the different signs of the sensitivity errors and biases from CF and LWP corroborate the notions that there are compensating errors in the modeled shortwave CRE. Further correlation analyses of the geospatial patterns reveal that CF is the most relevant factor in determining CRE in observations, while the modeled CRE is too sensitive to LWP and COD. The relationships between cloud effective radius, LWP, and COD are also analyzed to explore the possible uncertainty sources in different models. Our study calls for more rigorous calibration of detailed cloud physical properties for future climate model development and climate projection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the disparities in the deployment of photovoltaic (PV) technology for carbon emissions reduction across different nations, highlighting the mismatch between countries with high economic capacity and those where PV installation would maximize global decarbonization benefits. This mismatch is discussed based on three key factors influencing decarbonization via PV technology: per capita gross domestic product; carbon intensity of the energy system; and solar resource availability. Current PV deployment is predominantly concentrated in economically advanced countries, and does not coincide with regions where the environmental and economic impact of such installations would be most significant. Through a series of thought experiments, it is demonstrated how alternative prioritization strategies could significantly reduce global carbon emissions. Argument is put forward for a globally coordinated approach to PV deployment, particularly targeting high-impact sunbelt regions, to enhance the efficacy of decarbonization efforts and promote equitable energy access. The study underscores the need for international policies that support sustainable energy transitions in economically less developed regions through workforce development and assistance with the activation of capital.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Solar radiation modification, a scheme aimed at mitigating rapid global warming triggered by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, has been explored through the G1ext experiment under the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project (GeoMIP) framework, utilizing the Chinese Academy of Sciences Earth System Model version 2 (CAS-ESM2.0). This paper briefly describes the basic configuration and experimental design of the CAS-ESM2.0 for G1ext, which involves a sudden reduction in solar irradiance to counterbalance the radiative forcing of an abrupt quadrupling of atmospheric CO 2 concentration, running for 100 years. Preliminary results show that this model can reproduce well the compensatory effect of a uniform decrease in global solar radiation on the radiative forcing resulting from an abrupt quadrupling of CO 2 concentration. Like other Earth system models, CAS-ESM2.0 reasonably captures variations in radiative adjustments, surface air temperature, and precipitation patterns, both globally and locally, under the G1ext scenario. The generated datasets have been released on the Earth System Grid Federation data server, providing insight into the potential efficacy and impact of solar geoengineering strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Atmospheric chemistry research and atmospheric measurement techniques have mutually promoted each other and developed rapidly in China in recent years. Cavity-based absorption spectroscopy, which uses a high-finesse cavity to achieve very long absorption path-length, thereby achieving ultra-high detection sensitivity, plays an extremely important role in atmospheric chemistry research. Based on the Beer–Lambert law, this technology has the unique advantages of being non-destructive, chemical-free, and highly selective. It does not require any sample preparation and can quantitatively analyze atmospheric trace gases in real time and in situ. In this paper, we review the following: (1) key technological advances in different cavity-based absorption spectroscopy techniques, including cavity ring-down spectroscopy, cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy, cavity attenuated phase shift spectroscopy, and their extensions; and (2) applications of these techniques in the detection of atmospheric reactive species, such as total peroxy radical, formaldehyde, and reactive nitrogen (e.g., NO x , HONO, peroxy nitrates, and alkyl nitrates). The review systematically introduces cavity-based absorption spectroscopy techniques and their applications in atmospheric chemistry, which will help promote further communication and cooperation in the fields of laser spectroscopy and atmospheric chemistry.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The oceanic mixed layer in the Southern Ocean is characterized by numerous fronts due to the stirring of freshwater influxes arising from ice melting. The interaction of these fronts with winds modulates the evolution of the mixed layer and affects atmosphere–ocean energy exchanges. However, the underlying mechanism behind the wind-front interaction remains obscure due to a lack of three-dimensional observations of the ocean, particularly in terms of velocities. To address this issue, this study investigates the dynamics of fronts within the mixed layer during a storm by employing a subset of the global submesoscale-permitting simulation, Northeast Weddell Sea Pre-SWOT Level-4 Hourly MITgcm LLC4320 Native Grid 2km Oceanographic Dataset (ROAM_MIZ). We first compare the ROAM_MIZ data to glider data to assess the performance of the model simulation and find that the ROAM_MIZ can, to a large degree, capture sub-mesoscale features within a mixed layer. Subsequent analyses based on a subset of ROAM_MIZ show that lateral density gradients within the mixed layer rapidly decrease during high winds associated with the storm. Down-front winds accelerate this process as the Ekman buoyancy transport responsible for enhancing the instability of the fronts is primarily dominated by horizontal baroclinic components. After the storm, the fronts strengthen again in the presence of weaker winds due to the frontogenesis by the larger-scale strain. Moreover, the non-geostrophic turbulence induces a modification of the relative vorticity, affecting the instability within the mixed layer. These findings offer valuable guidance for the deployment of observational instruments and subsequent analysis, as well as deepen the understanding of air–sea interactions in the Southern Ocean.",

    "abstract": "State-of-the-art climate models have long-standing intrinsic biases that limit their simulation and projection capabilities. Significantly weak ENSO asymmetry and weakly nonlinear air–sea interaction over the tropical Pacific was found in CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 5) climate models compared with observation. The results suggest that a weak nonlinear air–sea interaction may play a role in the weak ENSO asymmetry. Moreover, a weak nonlinearity in air–sea interaction in the models may be associated with the biases in the mean climate—the cold biases in the equatorial central Pacific. The excessive cold tongue bias pushes the deep convection far west to the western Pacific warm pool region and suppresses its development in the central equatorial Pacific. The deep convection has difficulties in further moving to the eastern equatorial Pacific, especially during extreme El Ni˜no events, which confines the westerly wind anomaly to the western Pacific. This weakens the eastern Pacific El Ni˜no events, especially the extreme El Ni˜no events, and thus leads to the weakened ENSO asymmetry in climate models. An accurate mean state structure (especially a realistic cold tongue and deep convection) is critical to reproducing ENSO events in climate models. Our evaluation also revealed that ENSO statistics in CMIP5 climate models are slightly improved compared with those of CMIP3. The weak ENSO asymmetry in CMIP5 is closer to the observation. It is more evident in CMIP5 that strong ENSO activities are usually accompanied by strong ENSO asymmetry, and the diversity of ENSO amplitude is reduced.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The initiation of convective cells in the late morning of 24 June 2010 along the eastward extending ridge of the Dabie Mountains in the Anhui region, China, is studied through numerical simulations that include local data assimilation. A primary convergence line is found over the ridge of the Dabie Mountains, and along the ridge line several locally enhanced convergence centers preferentially initiate convection. Three processes responsible for creating the overall convergence pattern are identified. First, thermally-driven upslope winds induce convergence zones over the main mountain peaks along the ridge, which are shifted slightly downwind in location by the moderate low-level easterly flow found on the north side of a Mei-yu front. Second, flows around the main mountain peaks along the ridge create further convergence on the lee side of the peaks. Third, upslope winds develop along the roughly north–south oriented valleys on both sides of the ridge due to thermal and dynamic channeling effects, and create additional convergence between the peaks along the ridge. The superposition of the above convergence features creates the primary convergence line along the ridge line of the Dabie Mountains. Locally enhanced convergence centers on the primary line cause the initiation of the first convection cells along the ridge. These conclusions are supported by two sensitivity experiments in which the environmental wind (dynamic forcing) or radiative and land surface thermal forcing are removed, respectively. Overall, the thermal forcing effects are stronger than dynamic forcing given the relatively weak environmental flow.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper examines how assimilating surface observations can improve the analysis and forecast ability of a fourdimensional Variational Doppler Radar Analysis System (VDRAS). Observed surface temperature and winds are assimilated together with radar radial velocity and reflectivity into a convection-permitting model using the VDRAS four-dimensional variational (4DVAR) data assimilation system. A squall-line case observed during a field campaign is selected to investigate the performance of the technique. A single observation experiment shows that assimilating surface observations can influence the analyzed fields in both the horizontal and vertical directions. The surface-based cold pool, divergence and gust front of the squall line are all strengthened through the assimilation of the single surface observation. Three experiments—assimilating radar data only, assimilating radar data with surface data blended in a mesoscale background, and assimilating both radar and surface observations with a 4DVAR cost function—are conducted to examine the impact of the surface data assimilation. Independent surface and wind profiler observations are used for verification. The result shows that the analysis and forecast are improved when surface observations are assimilated in addition to radar observations. It is also shown that the additional surface data can help improve the analysis and forecast at low levels. Surface and low-level features of the squall line—including the surface warm inflow, cold pool, gust front, and low-level wind—are much closer to the observations after assimilating the surface data in VDRAS.",

Two areas of high lightning density are identified: one over the Pearl River Delta, and the other to the north of Leizhou Peninsula. Large peak-current cloud-to-ground (LPCCG) lightning (>75 kA) shows weaker land–offshore contrasts than total CG lightning, in which negative cloud-to-ground (NCG) lightning occurs more prominently than positive cloud-to-ground (PCG) lightning on land. While the frequency of total CG lightning shows a main peak in June and a second peak in August, the LPCCG lightning over land shows only a single peak in June. The ratio of positive LPCCG to total lightning is significantly greater during February–April than during other times of the year. Diurnally, CG lightning over land shows only one peak in the afternoon, whereas CG lightning offshore shows morning and afternoon peaks. The rain yield per flash is on the order of 107–108 kg per flash across the analysis region, and its spatial distribution is opposite to that of lightning density. Our data show that lightning activity over land is more sensitive than that over offshore waters to CAPE. The relationships between lightning activity and both precipitation and CAPE are associated with convection activity in the analysis region.",

A twin experiment is designed to evaluate the impact of the 4D-Var data assimilation algorithm on ENSO analysis and prediction based on the ICM. The model error is assumed to arise only from the parameter uncertainty. The “observation” of the SST anomaly, which is sampled from a “truth” model simulation that takes default parameter values and has Gaussian noise added, is directly assimilated into the assimilation model with its parameters set erroneously. Results show that 4D-Var effectively reduces the error of ENSO analysis and therefore improves the prediction skill of ENSO events compared with the non-assimilation case. These results provide a promising way for the ICM to achieve better real-time ENSO prediction.",

Considering future CO 2 , CH 4 , N 2 O and other gases’ concentrations, as well as land use, the design of ScenarioMIP involves eight pathways, including two tiers (tier-1 and tier-2) of priority. Tier-1 includes four combined Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) with radiative forcing, i.e., SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5, in which the globally averaged radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere around the year 2100 is approximately 2.6, 4.5, 7.0 and 8.5 W m −2 , respectively. This study provides an introduction to the ScenarioMIP datasets of this model, such as their storage location, sizes, variables, etc. Preliminary analysis indicates that surface air temperatures will increase by about 1.89°C, 3.07°C, 4.06°C and 5.17°C by around 2100 under these four scenarios, respectively. Meanwhile, some other key climate variables, such as sea-ice extension, precipitation, heat content, and sea level rise, also show significant long-term trends associated with the radiative forcing increases. These datasets will help us understand how the climate will change under different anthropogenic and radiative forcings.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Weather forecasting in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica is a challenge above all due to the rarity of observations to be assimilated in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. As observations are expensive and logistically challenging, it is important to evaluate the benefit that additional observations could bring to NWP. Atmospheric soundings applying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have a large potential to supplement conventional radiosonde sounding observations. Here, we applied UAV and radiosonde sounding observations from an RV Polarstern cruise in the ice-covered Weddell Sea in austral winter 2013 to evaluate the impact of their assimilation in the Polar version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (Polar WRF) model. Our experiments revealed small to moderate impacts of radiosonde and UAV data assimilation. In any case, the assimilation of sounding data from both radiosondes and UAVs improved the analyses of air temperature, wind speed, and humidity at the observation site for most of the time. Further, the impact on the results of 5-day-long Polar WRF experiments was often felt over distances of at least 300 km from the observation site. All experiments succeeded in capturing the main features of the evolution of near-surface variables, but the effects of data assimilation varied between different cases. Due to the limited vertical extent of the UAV observations, the impact of their assimilation was limited to the lowermost 1–2-km layer, and assimilation of radiosonde data was more beneficial for modeled sea level pressure and near-surface wind speed.",

The purpose of FAFMIP is to understand and reduce the uncertainty of ocean climate changes in response to increased CO 2 forcing in atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs), including the simulations of ocean heat content (OHC) change, ocean circulation change, and sea level rise due to thermal expansion. FAFMIP experiments (including faf-heat, faf-stress, faf-water, faf-all, faf-passiveheat, faf-heat-NA50pct and faf-heat-NA0ct) have been conducted. All of the experiments were integrated over a 70-year period and the corresponding data have been uploaded to the Earth System Grid Federation data server for CMIP6 users to download. This paper describes the experimental design and model datasets and evaluates the preliminary results of CAS-ESM2.0 simulations of ocean climate changes in the FAFMIP experiments. The simulations of the changes in global ocean temperature, Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), OHC., and dynamic sea level (DSL), are all reasonably reproduced.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Large parts of East and South Asia were affected by heavy precipitation and flooding during early summer 2020. This study provides both a statistical and dynamical characterization of rains and floods affecting the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). By aggregating daily and monthly precipitation over river basins across Asia, it is shown that the YRB is one of the areas that was particularly affected. June and July 2020 rainfall was higher than in the previous 20 years, and the YRB experienced anomalously high rainfall across most of its sub-basins. YRB discharge also attained levels not seen since 1998/1999. An automated method detecting the daily position of the East Asian Summer Monsoon Front (EASMF) is applied to show that the anomalously high YRB precipitation was associated with a halted northward progression of the EASMF and prolonged mei-yu conditions over the YRB lasting more than one month. Two 5-day heavy-precipitation episodes (12−16 June and 4−8 July 2020) are selected from this period for dynamical characterization, including Lagrangian trajectory analysis. Particular attention is devoted to the dynamics of the airstreams converging at the EASMF. Both episodes display heavy precipitation and convergence of monsoonal and subtropical air masses. However, clear differences are identified in the upper-level flow pattern, substantially affecting the balance of airmass advection towards the EASMF. This study contextualizes heavy precipitation in Asia in summer 2020 and showcases several analysis tools developed by the authors for the study of such events.",

Daily intensities of global MHWs from 1982 to 2020 were analyzed using gridded SST data sourced from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Optimum Interpolation (OI) SST V2 high-resolution (0.25°) dataset. The analysis shows a linear increase in the frequency of MHWs in most ocean regions of the world as well as significant interdecadal changes.

The aircraft observations show that convection was deeper and radar echoes were significantly enhanced with higher tops in response to seeding in the convective region. This is linked with the conversion of supercooled liquid droplets to ice crystals with released latent heat, resulting in strengthened updrafts, enhanced radar echoes, higher cloud tops, and more and larger precipitation particles. In contrast, in the stratiform cloud region, after the Silver Iodide (AgI) seeding, the radar echoes become significantly weaker at heights close to the seeding layer, with the echo tops lowered by 1.4–1.7 km. In addition, a hollow structure appears at the height of 6.2–7.8 km with a depth of about 1.6 km and a diameter of about 5.5 km, and features such as icing seeding tracks appear. These suggest that the transformation between droplets and ice particles was accelerated by the seeding in the stratiform part. The NPP and H8 satellites also show that convective activity was stronger in the convective region after seeding; while in the stratiform region, a cloud seeding track with a width of 1–3 km appears 10 km downstream of the seeding layer 15 minutes after the AgI seeding, which moves along the wind direction as width increases.",

    "abstract": "A global atmospheric general circulation model has been used to perform eleven idealized numerical experiments, i.e., TP00, TP10, ..., TP100, corresponding to different percentages of the Tibetan Plateau altitude. The aim is to explore the sensitivity of East Asian climate to the uplift and expansion of the Tibetan Plateau under the reconstructed boundary conditions for the mid-Pliocene about 3 Ma ago. When the plateau is progressively uplifted, global annual surface temperature is gradually declined and statistically significant cooling signals emerge only in the Northern Hemisphere, especially over and around the Tibetan Plateau, with larger magnitudes over land than over the oceans. On the contrary, annual surface temperature rises notably over Central Asia and most parts of Africa, as well as over northeasternmost Eurasia in the experiments TP60 to TP100. Meanwhile, the plateau uplift also leads to annual precipitation augmentation over the Tibetan Plateau but a reduction in northern Asia, the Indian Peninsula, much of Central Asia, parts of western Asia and the southern portions of northeastern Europe. Additionally, it is found that an East Asian summer monsoon system similar to that of the present initially exists in the TP60 and is gradually intensified with the continued plateau uplift. At 850 hPa the plateau uplift induces an anomalous cyclonic circulation around the Tibetan Plateau in summertime and two anomalous westerly currents respectively located to the south and north of the Tibetan Plateau in wintertime. In the mid-troposphere, similar-to-modern spatial pattern of summertime western North Pacific subtropical high is only exhibited in the experiments TP60 to TP100, and the East Asian trough is steadily deepened in response to the progressive uplift and expansion of the Tibetan Plateau.",

At the interannual timescale, atmospheric pressure at different height levels in the ERA-40 data are in better agreement with observed pressure than that in the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis data. ERA-40 reanalysis also outperforms NCEP-NCAR reanalysis in atmospheric temperature, except in the surface layer where the biases are somewhat larger. The wind velocity fields in both datasets do not agree well with surface- and upper-layer atmospheric observations. At intraseasonal timescales, both datasets capture the observed intraseasonal variability in pressure and temperature during austral winter.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A coupled earth system model (ESM) has been developed at the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology (NUIST) by using version 5.3 of the European Centre Hamburg Model (ECHAM), version 3.4 of the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO), and version 4.1 of the Los Alamos sea ice model (CICE). The model is referred to as NUIST ESM1 (NESM1). Comprehensive and quantitative metrics are used to assess the model’s major modes of climate variability most relevant to subseasonal-to-interannual climate prediction. The model’s assessment is placed in a multi-model framework. The model yields a realistic annual mean and annual cycle of equatorial SST, and a reasonably realistic precipitation climatology, but has difficulty in capturing the spring-fall asymmetry and monsoon precipitation domains. The ENSO mode is reproduced well with respect to its spatial structure, power spectrum, phase locking to the annual cycle, and spatial structures of the central Pacific (CP)-ENSO and eastern Pacific (EP)-ENSO; however, the equatorial SST variability, biennial component of ENSO, and the amplitude of CP-ENSO are overestimated. The model captures realistic intraseasonal variability patterns, the vertical-zonal structures of the first two leading predictable modes of Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), and its eastward propagation; but the simulated MJO speed is significantly slower than observed. Compared with the T42 version, the high resolution version (T159) demonstrates improved simulation with respect to the climatology, interannual variance, monsoon-ENSO lead-lag correlation, spatial structures of the leading mode of the Asian-Australian monsoon rainfall variability, and the eastward propagation of the MJO.",

Progress has been made in modeling these aspects by moving from ECHAM5/MPI-OM to MPI-ESM. MPI-ESM is more skillful than ECHAM5/MPI-OM in modeling the time-mean state and the extreme condition of the IIE. Though simulation of the interannual variability significantly deviates to some extent in both MPI-ESM and ECHAM5/MPI-OM, MPI-ESM-LR shows better skill in reflecting the relationship among sea surface temperature anomalies over the Pacific, circulation anomalies over East Asia, and IIE variability. The temperature becomes warmer under the RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios in comparison with the historical experiments, but the position of the IIE and the key physical process in relation to the IIE variability almost remains the same, suggesting that the Indian summer monsoon tends to change in phase with the East Asian summer monsoon under each RCP scenario. The relatively realistic description of the physical processes modulated by terrain in MPI-ESM may be one of the most important reasons why MPI-ESM performs better in simulating the IIE.",

The basic configuration of the FGOALS-f3-H model and numerical experiments design are briefly described, and then the historical simulation is validated. Forced by observed radiative agents from 1950 to 2014, the coupled model essentially reproduces the observed long-term trends of temperature, precipitation, and sea ice extent, as well as the large-scale pattern of temperature and precipitation. With an approximate 0.25° horizontal resolution in the atmosphere and 0.1° in the ocean, the coupled models also simulate energetic western boundary currents and the Antarctic Circulation Current (ACC), reasonable characteristics of extreme precipitation, and realistic frontal scale air-sea interaction. The dataset and supporting detailed information have been published in the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF, https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/cmip6/ ).",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ground-based microwave radiometers (MWRs) operating in the K- and V-bands (20–60 GHz) can help us obtain temperature and humidity profiles in the troposphere. Aside from some soundings from local meteorological observatories, the tropospheric atmosphere over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has never been continuously observed. As part of the Chinese Second Tibetan Plateau Scientific Expedition and Research Program (STEP), the Tibetan Plateau Atmospheric Profile (TP-PROFILE) project aims to construct a comprehensive MWR troposphere observation network to study the synoptic processes and environmental changes on the TP. This initiative has collected three years of data from the MWR network. This paper introduces the data information, the data quality, and data downloading. Some applications of the data obtained from these MWRs were also demonstrated. Our comparisons of MWR against the nearest radiosonde observation demonstrate that the TP-PROFILE MWR system is adequate for monitoring the thermal and moisture variability of the troposphere over the TP. The continuous temperature and moisture profiles derived from the MWR data provide a unique perspective on the evolution of the thermodynamic structure associated with the heating of the TP. The TP-PROFILE project reveals that the low-temporal resolution instruments are prone to large uncertainties in their vapor estimation in the mountain valleys on the TP.",

Despite the many pages of that review, it was incomplete in the sense that it did not elaborate on the applications of this very important tool of solar energy meteorology. Indeed, solar power curves are ubiquitously needed in a broad spectrum of solar forecasting and solar resource assessment tasks. Hence, this tutorial review should continue from where it left off and present examples concerning the usage of solar power curves. In a nutshell, this tutorial review, together with the preceding one, should elucidate how surface shortwave radiation data, be they ground-based, satellite-retrieved, or model-output, are bridged to various power system operations via solar power curves.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aerosol optical properties are simulated using the Spectral Radiation Transport Model for Aerosol Species (SPRINTARS) coupled with the Non-hydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM). The 3-year global mean all-sky aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 550 nm, the Ångström Exponent (AE) based on AOTs at 440 and 870 nm, and the single scattering albedo (SSA) at 550 nm are estimated at 0.123, 0.657 and 0.944, respectively. For each aerosol species, the mean AOT is within the range of the AeroCom models. Both the modeled all-sky and clear-sky results are compared with observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). The simulated spatiotemporal distributions of all-sky AOTs can generally reproduce the MODIS retrievals, and the correlation and model skill can be slightly improved using the clear-sky results over most land regions. The differences between clear-sky and all-sky AOTs are larger over polluted regions. Compared with observations from AERONET, the modeled and observed all-sky AOTs and AEs are generally in reasonable agreement, whereas the SSA variation is not well captured. Although the spatiotemporal distributions of all-sky and clear-sky results are similar, the clear-sky results are generally better correlated with the observations. The clear-sky AOT and SSA are generally lower than the all-sky results, especially in those regions where the aerosol chemical composition is contributed to mostly by sulfate aerosol. The modeled clear-sky AE is larger than the all-sky AE over those regions dominated by hydrophilic aerosol, while the opposite is found over regions dominated by hydrophobic aerosol.",

    "abstract": "This study examines pre-industrial control simulations from CMIP5 climate models in an effort to better understand the complex relationships between Arctic sea ice and the stratosphere, and between Arctic sea ice and cold winter temperatures over Eurasia. We present normalized regressions of Arctic sea-ice area against several atmospheric variables at extended lead and lag times. Statistically significant regressions are found at leads and lags, suggesting both atmospheric precursors of, and responses to, low sea ice; but generally, the regressions are stronger when the atmosphere leads sea ice, including a weaker polar stratospheric vortex indicated by positive polar cap height anomalies. Significant positive midlatitude eddy heat flux anomalies are also found to precede low sea ice. We argue that low sea ice and raised polar cap height are both a response to this enhanced midlatitude eddy heat flux. The so-called \"warm Arctic, cold continents\" anomaly pattern is present one to two months before low sea ice, but is absent in the months following low sea ice, suggesting that the Eurasian cooling and low sea ice are driven by similar processes. Lastly, our results suggest a dependence on the geographic region of low sea ice, with low Barents–Kara Sea ice correlated with a weakened polar stratospheric vortex, whilst low Sea of Okhotsk ice is correlated with a strengthened polar vortex. Overall, the results support a notion that the sea ice, polar stratospheric vortex and Eurasian surface temperatures collectively respond to large-scale changes in tropospheric circulation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tibetan Plateau vortices (TPVs) are mesoscale cyclones originating over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) during the extended summer season (April–September). Most TPVs stay on the TP, but a small number can move off the TP to the east. TPVs are known to be one of the main precipitation-bearing systems on the TP and moving-off TPVs have been associated with heavy precipitation and flooding downstream of the TP (e.g., in Sichuan province or over the Yangtze River Valley). Identifying and tracking TPVs is difficult because of their comparatively small horizontal extent (400–800 km) and the limited availability of soundings over the TP, which in turn constitutes a challenge for short-term predictions of TPV-related impacts and for the climatological study of TPVs. In this study k](i) manual tracking (MT) results using radiosonde data from a network over and downstream of the TP are compared with (ii) results obtained by an automated tracking (AT) algorithm applied to ERA-Interim data. Ten MT-TPV cases are selected based on method (i) and matched to and compared with the corresponding AT-TPVs identified with method (ii). Conversely k]ten AT-TPVs are selected and compared with the corresponding MT-TPVs. In general k]the comparison shows good results in cases where the underlying data are in good agreement k]but considerable differences are also seen in some cases and explained in terms of differences in the tracking methods k]data availability/coverage and disagreement between sounding and ERA-Interim data. Recommendations are given for future efforts in TPV detection and tracking k]including in an operational weather forecasting context.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent studies demonstrate that the Antarctic Ozone Hole has important influences on Antarctic sea ice. While most of these works have focused on effects associated with atmospheric and oceanic dynamic processes caused by stratospheric ozone changes, here we show that stratospheric ozone-induced cloud radiative effects also play important roles in causing changes in Antarctic sea ice. Our simulations demonstrate that the recovery of the Antarctic Ozone Hole causes decreases in clouds over Southern Hemisphere (SH) high latitudes and increases in clouds over the SH extratropics. The decrease in clouds leads to a reduction in downward infrared radiation, especially in austral autumn. This results in cooling of the Southern Ocean surface and increasing Antarctic sea ice. Surface cooling also involves ice-albedo feedback. Increasing sea ice reflects solar radiation and causes further cooling and more increases in Antarctic sea ice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Two versions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Flexible Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System model (CAS-FGOALS), version f3-L and g3, are used to simulate the two interglacial epochs of the mid-Holocene and the Last Interglacial in phase 4 of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP4), which aims to study the impact of changes in orbital parameters on the Earth’s climate. Following the PMIP4 experimental protocols, four simulations for the mid-Holocene and two simulations for the Last Interglacial have been completed, and all the data, including monthly and daily outputs for the atmospheric, oceanic, land and sea-ice components, have been released on the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) node. These datasets contribute to PMIP4 and CMIP6 (phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) by providing the variables necessary for the two interglacial periods. In this paper, the basic information of the CAS-FGOALS models and the protocols for the two interglacials are briefly described, and the datasets are validated using proxy records. Results suggest that the CAS-FGOALS models capture the large-scale changes in the climate system in response to changes in solar insolation during the interglacial epochs, including warming in mid-to-high latitudes, changes in the hydrological cycle, the seasonal variation in the extent of sea ice, and the damping of interannual variabilities in the tropical Pacific. Meanwhile, disagreements within and between the models and the proxy data are also presented. These datasets will help the modeling and the proxy data communities with a better understanding of model performance and biases in paleoclimate simulations.",

    "abstract": "Since the 1990s, the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) has experienced a strikingly warming and wetter climate that alters the thermal and hydrological properties of frozen ground. A positive correlation between the warming and thermal degradation in permafrost or seasonally frozen ground (SFG) has long been recognized. Still, a predictive relationship between historical wetting under warming climate conditions and frozen ground has not yet been well demonstrated, despite the expectation that it will become even more important because precipitation over the QTP has been projected to increase continuously in the near future. This study investigates the response of the thermal regime to historical wetting in both permafrost and SFG areas and examines their relationships separately using the Community Land Surface Model version 4.5. Results show that wetting before the 1990s across the QTP mainly cooled the permafrost body in the arid and semiarid zones, with significant correlation coefficients of 0.60 and 0.48, respectively. Precipitation increased continually at the rate of 6.16 mm decade−1 in the arid zone after the 1990s but had a contrasting warming effect on permafrost through a significant shortening of the thawing duration within the active layer. However, diminished rainfall in the humid zone after the 1990s also significantly extended the thawing duration of SFG. The relationship between the ground thawing index and precipitation was significantly negatively correlated (−0.75). The dual effects of wetting on the thermal dynamics of the QTP are becoming critical because of the projected increases in future precipitation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Thermal processes on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) influence atmospheric conditions on regional and global scales. Given this, previous work has shown that soil moisture–driven surface flux variations feed back onto the atmosphere. Whilst soil moisture is a source of atmospheric predictability, no study has evaluated soil moisture–atmosphere coupling on the TP in general circulation models (GCMs). In this study, we use several analysis techniques to assess soil moisture-atmosphere coupling in CMIP6 simulations including: instantaneous coupling indices; analysis of flux and atmospheric behaviour during dry spells; and a quantification of the preference for convection over drier soils. Through these metrics we partition feedbacks into their atmospheric and terrestrial components. Consistent with previous global studies, we conclude substantial inter-model differences in the representation of soil moisture–atmosphere coupling, and that most models underestimate such feedbacks. Focusing on dry spell analysis, most models underestimate increased sensible heat during periods of rainfall deficiency. For example, the model-mean bias in anomalous sensible heat flux is 10 W m −2 (≈25%) smaller compared to observations. Deficient dry-spell sensible heat fluxes lead to a weaker atmospheric response. We also find that most GCMs fail to capture the negative feedback between soil moisture and deep convection. The poor simulation of feedbacks in CMIP6 experiments suggests that forecast models also struggle to exploit soil moisture–driven predictability. To improve the representation of land–atmosphere feedbacks requires developments in not only atmospheric modelling, but also surface processes, as we find weak relationships between rainfall biases and coupling indexes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the response of the Earth system to varying concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is critical for projecting possible future climate change and for providing insight into mitigation and adaptation strategies in the near future. In this study, we generate a dataset by conducting an experiment involving carbon dioxide removal (CDR)—a potential way to suppress global warming—using the Chinese Academy of Sciences Earth System Model version 2.0 (CAS-ESM2.0). A preliminary evaluation is provided. The model is integrated from 200–340 years as a 1% yr −1 CO 2 concentration increase experiment, and then to ~478 years as a carbon dioxide removal experiment until CO 2 returns to its original value. Finally, another 80 years is integrated in which CO 2 is kept constant. Changes in the 2-m temperature, precipitation, sea surface temperature, ocean temperature, Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), and sea surface height are all analyzed. In the ramp-up period, the global mean 2-m temperature and precipitation both increase while the AMOC weakens. Values of all the above variables change in the opposite direction in the ramp-down period, with a delayed peak relative to the CO 2 peak. After CO 2 returns to its original value, the global mean 2-m temperature is still ~1 K higher than in the original state, and precipitation is ~0.07 mm d −1 higher. At the end of the simulation, there is a ~0.5°C increase in ocean temperature and a 1 Sv weakening of the AMOC. Our model simulation produces similar results to those of comparable experiments previously reported in the literature.",

In the models showing a stronger sea-ice decline, the Polar cell becomes weaker and there is an anomalous increase in the sea level pressure (SLP) along 60°N, including the Urals–Siberia region and the Iceland low region. There is an accompanying weakening of both the midlatitude westerly winds and the Ferrell cell, where the SVD signals are also related to anomalous sea surface temperature warming in the midlatitude North Atlantic. In the Mediterranean region, the anomalous circulation response shows a decreasing SLP and increasing precipitation. The anomalous SLP responses over the Euro-Atlantic region project on to the negative North Atlantic Oscillation–like pattern. Altogether, pan-Arctic SIC decline could strongly impact the winter Eurasian climate, but we should be cautious about the causality of their linkage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract It has been challenging to project the tropical cyclone (TC) intensity, structure and destructive potential changes in a warming climate. Here, we compare the sensitivities of TC intensity, size and destructive potential to sea surface warming with and without a pre-storm atmospheric adjustment to an idealized state of Radiative-Convective Equilibrium (RCE). Without RCE, we find large responses of TC intensity, size and destructive potential to sea surface temperature (SST) changes, which is in line with some previous studies. However, in an environment under RCE, the TC size is almost insensitive to SST changes, and the sensitivity of intensity is also much reduced to 3% °C −1 –4% °C −1 . Without the pre-storm RCE adjustment, the mean destructive potential measured by the integrated power dissipation increases by about 25% °C −1 during the mature stage. However, in an environment under RCE, the sensitivity of destructive potential to sea surface warming does not change significantly. Further analyses show that the reduced response of TC intensity and size to sea surface warming under RCE can be explained by the reduced thermodynamic disequilibrium between the air boundary layer and the sea surface due to the RCE adjustment. When conducting regional-scale sea surface warming experiments for TC case studies, without any RCE adjustment the TC response is likely to be unrealistically exaggerated. The TC intensity–temperature sensitivity under RCE is very similar to those found in coupled climate model simulations. This suggests global mean intensity projections under climate change can be understood in terms of a thermodynamic response to temperature with only a minor contribution from any changes in large-scale dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Cloud detection is an essential preprocessing step for retrieving carbon dioxide from satellite observations of reflected sunlight. During the pre-launch study of the Chinese Carbon Dioxide Observation Satellite (TANSAT), a cloud-screening scheme was presented for the Cloud and Aerosol Polarization Imager (CAPI), which only performs measurements in five channels located in the visible to near-infrared regions of the spectrum. The scheme for CAPI, based on previous cloudscreening algorithms, defines a method to regroup individual threshold tests for each pixel in a scene according to the derived clear confidence level. This scheme is proven to be more effective for sensors with few channels. The work relies upon the radiance data from the Visible and Infrared Radiometer (VIRR) onboard the Chinese FengYun-3A Polar-orbiting Meteorological Satellite (FY-3A), which uses four wavebands similar to that of CAPI and can serve as a proxy for its measurements. The scheme has been applied to a number of the VIRR scenes over four target areas (desert, snow, ocean, forest) for all seasons. To assess the screening results, comparisons against the cloud-screening product from MODIS are made. The evaluation suggests that the proposed scheme inherits the advantages of schemes described in previous publications and shows improved cloud-screening results. A seasonal analysis reveals that this scheme provides better performance during warmer seasons, except for observations over oceans, where results are much better in colder seasons.",

    "abstract": "The influence of the Arctic atmosphere on Northern Hemisphere midlatitude tropospheric weather and climate is explored by comparing the skill of two sets of 14-day weather forecast experiments using the ECMWF model with and without relaxation of the Arctic atmosphere towards ERA-Interim reanalysis data during the integration. Two pathways are identified along which the Arctic influences midlatitude weather: a pronounced one over Asia and Eastern Europe, and a secondary one over North America. In general, linkages are found to be strongest (weakest) during boreal winter (summer) when the amplitude of stationary planetary waves over the Northern Hemisphere is strongest (weakest). No discernible Arctic impact is found over the North Atlantic and North Pacific region, which is consistent with predominantly southwesterly flow. An analysis of the flow-dependence of the linkages shows that anomalous northerly flow conditions increase the Arctic influence on midlatitude weather over the continents. Specifically, an anomalous northerly flow from the Kara Sea towards West Asia leads to cold surface temperature anomalies not only over West Asia but also over Eastern and Central Europe. Finally, the results of this study are discussed in the light of potential midlatitude benefits of improved Arctic prediction capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigates the potential influences of anthropogenic forcings and natural variability on the risk of summer extreme temperatures over China. We use three multi-thousand-member ensemble simulations with different forcings (with or without anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosol emissions) to evaluate the human impact, and with sea surface temperature patterns from three different years around the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) 2015/16 event (years 2014, 2015 and 2016) to evaluate the impact of natural variability. A generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is used to fit the ensemble results. Based on these model results, we find that, during the peak of ENSO (2015), daytime extreme temperatures are smaller over the central China region compared to a normal year (2014). During 2016, the risk of nighttime extreme temperatures is largely increased over the eastern coastal region. Both anomalies are of the same magnitude as the anthropogenic influence. Thus, ENSO can amplify or counterbalance (at a regional and annual scale) anthropogenic effects on extreme summer temperatures over China. Changes are mainly due to changes in the GEV location parameter. Thus, anomalies are due to a shift in the distributions and not to a change in temperature variability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In earlier studies, objective techniques have been used to determine the contribution of tropical cyclones to precipitation (TCP) in a region, where the Tropical cyclone Precipitation Event (TPE) and the Regional Heavy Precipitation Events (RHPEs) are defined and investigated. In this study, TPE and RHPEs are combined to determine the Typhoon Regional Heavy Precipitation Events (TRHPEs), which is employed to evaluate the contribution of tropical cyclones to regional extreme precipitation events. Based on the Objective Identification Technique for Regional Extreme Events (OITREE) and the Objective Synoptic Analysis Technique (OSAT) to define TPE, temporal and spatial overlap indices are developed to identify the combined events as TRHPE. With daily precipitation data and TC best-track data over the western North Pacific from 1960 to 2018, 86 TRHPEs have been identified. TRHPEs contribute as much as 20% of the RHPEs, but 100% of events with extreme individual precipitation intensities. The major TRHPEs continued for approximately a week after tropical cyclone landfall, indicating a role of post landfall precipitation. The frequency and extreme intensity of TRHPEs display increasing trends, consistent with an observed positive trend in the mean intensity of TPEs as measured by the number of daily station precipitation observations exceeding 100 mm and 250 mm. More frequent landfalling Southeast and South China TCs induced more serious impacts in coastal areas in the Southeast and the South during 1990–2018 than 1960–89. The roles of cyclone translation speed and “shifts” in cyclone tracks are examined as possible explanations for the temporal trends.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An atmosphere-only model system for making seasonal prediction and projecting future intensities of landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) along the South China coast is upgraded by including ocean and wave models. A total of 642 TCs have been re-simulated using the new system to produce a climatology of TC intensity in the South China Sea. Detailed comparisons of the simulations from the atmosphere-only and the fully coupled systems reveal that the inclusion of the additional ocean and wave models enable differential sea surface temperature responses to various TC characteristics such as translational speed and size. In particular, interaction with the ocean does not necessarily imply a weakening of the TC, with the coastal bathymetry possibly playing a role in causing a near-shore intensification of the TC. These results suggest that to simulate the evolution of TC structure more accurately, it is essential to use an air-sea coupled model instead of an atmosphere-only model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The positive phase of the subtropical Indian Ocean dipole (SIOD) is one of the climatic modes in the subtropical southern Indian Ocean that influences the austral summer inter-annual rainfall variability in parts of southern Africa. This paper examines austral summer rain-bearing circulation types (CTs) in Africa south of the equator that are related to the positive SIOD and the dynamics through which specific rainfall regions in southern Africa can be influenced by this relationship. Four austral summer rain-bearing CTs were obtained. Among the four CTs, the CT that featured (i) enhanced cyclonic activity in the southwest Indian Ocean; (ii) positive widespread rainfall anomaly in the southwest Indian Ocean; and (iii) low-level convergence of moisture fluxes from the tropical South Atlantic Ocean, tropical Indian Ocean, and the southwest Indian Ocean, over the south-central landmass of Africa, was found to be related to the positive SIOD climatic mode. The relationship also implies that positive SIOD can be expected to increase the amplitude and frequency of occurrence of the aforementioned CT. The linkage between the CT related to the positive SIOD and austral summer homogeneous regions of rainfall anomalies in Africa south of the equator showed that it is the principal CT that is related to the inter-annual rainfall variability of the south-central regions of Africa, where the SIOD is already known to significantly influence its rainfall variability. Hence, through the large-scale patterns of atmospheric circulation associated with the CT, the SIOD can influence the spatial distribution and intensity of rainfall over the preferred landmass through enhanced moisture convergence.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Three tiers of experiments in the Global Monsoons Model Intercomparison Project (GMMIP), one of the endorsed model intercomparison projects of phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), are implemented by the First Institute of Oceanography Earth System Model version 2 (FIO-ESM v2.0), following the GMMIP protocols. Evaluation of global mean surface air temperature from 1870 to 2014 and climatological precipitation (1979–2014) in tier-1 shows that the atmosphere model of FIO-ESM v2.0 can reproduce the basic observed atmospheric features. In tier-2, the internal variability is captured by the coupled model, with the SST restoring to the model climatology plus the observed anomalies in the tropical Pacific and North Atlantic. Simulation of the Northern Hemisphere summer monsoon circulation is significantly improved by the SST restoration in the North Atlantic. In tier-3, five orographic perturbation experiments are conducted covering the period 1979–2014 by modifying the surface elevation or vertical heating in the prescribed region. In particular, the strength of the South Asian summer monsoon is reduced by removing the topography or thermal forcing above 500 m over the Asian continent. Monthly and daily simulated outputs of FIO-ESM v2.0 are provided through the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) node to contribute to a better understanding of the global monsoon system.",

Estimating the severity of the impacts of tropical cyclones (TCs) that make landfall on the Chinese mainland based on observations from 1401 meteorological stations was proposed in a previous study, including an index combining TC-induced precipitation and wind (IPWT) and further information, such as the corresponding category level (CAT_IPWT), an index of TC-induced wind (IWT), and an index of TC-induced precipitation (IPT). The current version of the dataset includes TCs that made landfall from 1949–2018; the dataset will be extended each year. Long-term trend analyses demonstrate that the severity of the TC impacts on the Chinese mainland have increased, as embodied by the annual mean IPWT values, and increases in TCinduced precipitation are the main contributor to this increase. TC Winnie (1997) and TC Bilis (2006) were the two TCs with the highest IPWT and IPT values, respectively. The PRITC V1.0 dataset was developed based on the China Meteorological Administration’s tropical cyclone database and can serve as a bridge between TC hazards and their social and economic impacts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study explores the structures of the correlations between infrared (IR) brightness temperatures (BTs) from the three water vapor channels of the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) onboard the GOES-16 satellite and the atmospheric state. Ensemble-based data assimilation techniques such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) rely on correlations to propagate innovations of BTs to increments of model state variables. Because the three water vapor channels are sensitive to moisture in different layers of the troposphere, the heights of the strongest correlations between these channels and moisture in clear-sky regions are closely related to the peaks of their respective weighting functions. In cloudy regions, the strongest correlations appear at the cloud tops of deep clouds, and ice hydrometeors generally have stronger correlations with BT than liquid hydrometeors. The magnitudes of the correlations decrease from the peak value in a column with both vertical and horizontal distance. Just how the correlations decrease depend on both the cloud scenes and the cloud structures, as well as the model variables. Horizontal correlations between BTs and moisture, as well as hydrometeors, in fully cloudy regions decrease to almost 0 at about 30 km. The horizontal correlations with atmospheric state variables in clear-sky regions are broader, maintaining non-zero values out to ∼100 km. The results in this study provide information on the proper choice of cut-off radii in horizontal and vertical localization schemes for the assimilation of BTs. They also provide insights on the most efficient and effective use of the different water vapor channels.",

Results show that NESM3 reasonably simulates the modern climate and the major internal modes of climate variability. In the Scenario MIP experiment, changes in the projected surface air temperature (SAT) show robust “Northern Hemisphere (NH) warmer than Southern Hemisphere (SH)” and “land warmer than ocean” patterns, as well as an El Niño-like warming over the tropical Pacific. Changes in the projected precipitation exhibit “NH wetter than SH” and “eastern hemisphere gets wetter and western hemisphere gets drier” patterns over the tropics. These precipitation patterns are driven by circulation changes owing to the inhomogeneous warming patterns. Two PMIP experiments show enlarged seasonal cycles of SAT and precipitation over the NH due to the seasonal redistribution of solar radiation. Changes in the climatological mean SAT, precipitation, and ENSO amplitudes are consistent with the results from PMIP4 models. The NESM3 outputs are available on the Earth System Grid Federation nodes for data users.",

Analysis of this new data product demonstrates its value as a tool for quantifying exposure to humid verses dry heat events. It also enables exploration into “stealth heat events”, where humidity is high, perhaps enough to affect productivity and health, while temperature remains moderate. Such events may not typically be identified as “heat events” by temperature-focused heat indices. Over 1973–2022, the peak magnitude of humid extremes (maximum daily wet bulb temperature over a month; T w X) for the global annual mean increased significantly at 0.13 ± 0.04°C (10 yr) −1 , which is slightly slower than the global annual mean T w increase of 0.22± 0.04°C (10 yr) −1 . The frequency of moderate humid extreme events per year (90th percentile daily maxima wet bulb temperature exceedance; T w X90p) also increased significantly at 4.61 ± 1.07 d yr −1 (10 yr) −1 . These rates were slower than for temperature extremes, TX and TX90p, which respectively increased significantly at 0.27 ± 0.04°C (10 yr) −1 and 5.53 ± 0.72 d yr −1 (10 yr) −1 . Similarly, for the UK/Europe focus region, JJA-mean T w X increased significantly, again at a slower rate than for TX and mean T w . HadISDH.extremes shows some evidence of “stealth heat events” occurring where humidity is high but temperature remains more moderate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nested simulations of a downslope windstorm over Cangshan mountain, Yunnan, China, have been used to demonstrate a method of topographic smoothing that preserves a relatively large amount of terrain detail compared to typical smoothing procedures required for models with terrain-following grids to run stably. The simulations were carried out using the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM) to investigate downslope winds. The smoothing method seamlessly blends two terrain datasets to which uniform smoothing has been applied–one with a minimum of smoothing, the other smoothed more heavily to remove gradients that would cause model instabilities. The latter dataset dominates the blend where the steepest slopes exist, but this is localised and recedes outside these areas. As a result, increased detail is starkly apparent in depictions of flow simulated using the blend, compared to one using the default approach. This includes qualitative flow details that were absent in the latter, such as narrow shooting flows emerging from roughly 1–2 km wide leeside channels. Flow separation is more common due to steeper lee slopes. The use of targeted smoothing also results in increased lee side temporal variability at a given point during the windstorm, including over flat areas. Low-/high-pass filtering of the wind perturbation field reveals that relative spatial variability above 30 km in scale (reflecting the background flow) is similar whether or not targeting is used. Beneath this scale, when smoothing is targeted, relative flow variability decreases at the larger scales, and increases at lower scales. This seems linked to fast smaller scale flows disturbing more coherent flows (notably an along-valley current over Erhai Lake). Spatial variability of winds in the model is unsurprisingly weaker at key times than is observed across a local network sampling mesoscale variation, but results are compromised due to relatively few observation locations sampling the windstorm. Only when targeted smoothing is applied does the model capture the downslope windstorm’s extension over the city of Dali at the mountain’s foot, and the peak mean absolute wind.",

    "abstract": "The NCEP–NCAR reanalysis dataset and the HadISST dataset (1959–2014) are used to analyze the impact of two types of El Niño events, i.e., eastern Pacific El Niño (EP-El Niño) and central Pacific El Niño (CP-El Niño) events, on the duration of major and minor sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs) in Northern Hemisphere winter (November to February). Although the frequency of major and minor SSWs during different types of El Niño shows no distinct differences, the duration of both major and minor SSWs during CP-El Niño is shorter than that during EP-El Niño. The spatial distribution of geopotential height anomalies preceding major SSWs resembles the western Pacific (WP) teleconnection pattern, while the spatial distribution of geopotential height anomalies preceding minor SSWs bears similarity to the Pacific–North America (PNA) teleconnection pattern. An enhancement of the strength of both wavenumber 1 and wavenumber 2 is found before major SSWs. Before minor SSWs, wavenumber 1 is also strengthened, but wavenumber 2 is weakened. The analysis also reveals that EP-El Niño tends to induce positive phases of PNA and WP teleconnections, while CP-El Niño induces negative-phase WP teleconnection. As the positive phases of the PNA and WP teleconnections are related to the strengthening of wavenumber 1, EP-El Niño causes an enhancement of wavenumber 1 in the high-latitude upper troposphere and an enhancement of the upward wave flux in the high-latitude stratosphere, accompanied by a negative anomaly in Eliassen–Palm flux divergence in the subpolar stratosphere, which accounts for the longer SSW duration during EP-El Niño than during CP-El Niño.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A set of homogenized monthly mean surface air temperature (SAT) series at 32 stations in China back to the 19th century had previously been developed based on the RHtest method by Cao et al., but some inhomogeneities remained in the dataset. The present study produces a further-adjusted and updated dataset based on the Multiple Analysis of Series for Homogenization (MASH) method. The MASH procedure detects 33 monthly temperature records as erroneous outliers and 152 meaningful break points in the monthly SAT series since 1924 at 28 stations. The inhomogeneous parts are then adjusted relative to the latest homogeneous part of the series. The new data show significant warming trends during 1924–2016 at all the stations, ranging from 0.48 to 3.57°C (100 yr) −1 , with a regional mean trend of 1.65°C (100 yr) −1 ; whereas, the previous results ranged from a slight cooling at two stations to considerable warming, up to 4.5°C (100 yr) −1 . It is suggested that the further-adjusted data are a better representation of the large-scale pattern of climate change in the region for the past century. The new data are available online at https://doi.org/www.dx.doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.516 .",

    "abstract": "A new set of Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) channels was re-selected from 314 EUMETSAT channels. In selecting channels, we calculated the impact of the individually added channel on the improvement in the analysis outputs from a one-dimensional variational analysis (1D-Var) for the Unified Model (UM) data assimilation system at the Met Office, using the channel score index (CSI) as a figure of merit. Then, 200 channels were selected in order by counting each individual channel's CSI contribution. Compared with the operationally used 183 channels for the UM at the Met Office, the new set shares 149 channels, while the other 51 channels are new. Also examined is the selection from the entropy reduction method with the same 1D-Var approach. Results suggest that channel selection can be made in a more objective fashion using the proposed CSI method. This is because the most important channels can be selected across the whole IASI observation spectrum. In the experimental trial runs using the UM global assimilation system, the new channels had an overall neutral impact in terms of improvement in forecasts, as compared with results from the operational channels. However, upper-tropospheric moist biases shown in the control run with operational channels were significantly reduced in the experimental trial with the newly selected channels. The reduction of moist biases was mainly due to the additional water vapor channels, which are sensitive to the upper-tropospheric water vapor.",

Accurate weather forecasts are essential for safe shipping in the Southern Ocean and observational and logistical operations at Antarctic research stations. This study investigated the impact of additional radiosonde observations from Research Vessel “Shirase” over the Southern Ocean and Dome Fuji Station in Antarctica on reanalysis data and forecast experiments using an ensemble data assimilation system comprising the Atmospheric General Circulation Model for the Earth Simulator and the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter Experimental Ensemble Reanalysis, version 2. A 63-member ensemble forecast experiment was conducted focusing on an unusually strong Antarctic cyclonic event. Reanalysis data with (observing system experiment) and without (control) additional radiosonde data were used as initial values. The observing system experiment correctly captured the central pressure of the cyclone, which led to the reliable prediction of the strong winds and moisture transport near the coast. Conversely, the control experiment predicted lower wind speeds because it failed to forecast the central pressure of the cyclone adequately. Differences were found in cyclone predictions of operational forecast systems with and without assimilation of radiosonde observations from Dome Fuji Station.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Most large-scale evapotranspiration (ET) estimation methods require detailed information of land use, land cover, and/or soil type on top of various atmospheric measurements. The complementary relationship of evaporation (CR) takes advantage of the inherent dynamic feedback mechanisms found in the soil-vegetation-atmosphere interface for its estimation of ET rates without the need of such biogeophysical data. ET estimates over the conterminous United States by a new, globally calibrated, static scaling (GCR-stat) of the generalized complementary relationship (GCR) of evaporation were compared to similar estimates of an existing, calibration-free version (GCR-dyn) of the GCR that employs a temporally varying dynamic scaling. Simplified annual water balances of 327 medium and 18 large watersheds served as ground-truth ET values. With long-term monthly mean forcing, GCR-stat (also utilizing precipitation measurements) outperforms GCR-dyn as the latter cannot fully take advantage of its dynamic scaling with such data of reduced temporal variability. However, in a continuous monthly simulation, GCR-dyn is on a par with GCR-stat, and especially excels in reproducing long-term tendencies in annual catchment ET rates even though it does not require precipitation information. The same GCR-dyn estimates were also compared to similar estimates of eight other popular ET products and they generally outperform all of them. For this reason, a dynamic scaling of the GCR is recommended over a static one for modeling long-term behavior of terrestrial ET.",

The three-month forecasts are based on dynamical predictions of an East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) index, which is transformed into regional-mean rainfall through linear regression. The June rainfall forecasts for the middle/lower Yangtze River basin are based on linear regression of precipitation. The forecasts verify well in terms of giving strong, consistent predictions of above-average rainfall at lead times of at least three months. However, the Yangtze region was subject to exceptionally heavy rainfall throughout the summer period, leading to observed values that lie outside the 95% prediction intervals of the three-month forecasts. The forecasts presented here are consistent with other studies of the 2020 EASM rainfall, whereby the enhanced mei-yu front in early summer is skillfully forecast, but the impact of midlatitude drivers enhancing the rainfall in later summer is not captured. This case study demonstrates both the utility of probabilistic seasonal forecasts for the Yangtze region and the potential limitations in anticipating complex extreme events driven by a combination of coincident factors.",

The initial states are produced using a 3-dimensional variational data assimilation scheme utilizing a large amount of observations from conventional in-situ measurements, weather radars, global navigation satellite system, advanced scatterometer data and satellite radiances from various satellite platforms. A version of the forecasting system which is aimed for future operations has been prepared for an enhanced assimilation of microwave radiances. This enhanced data assimilation system will use radiances from the Microwave Humidity Sounder, the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A and the Micro-Wave Humidity Sounder-2 instruments on-board the Metop-C and Fengyun-3 C/D polar orbiting satellites. The implementation process includes channel selection, set-up of an adaptive bias correction procedure, and careful monitoring of data usage and quality control of observations. The benefit of the additional microwave observations in terms of data coverage and impact on analyses, as derived using the degree of freedom of signal approach, is demonstrated. A positive impact on forecast quality is shown, and the effect on the precipitation for a case study is examined. Finally, the role of enhanced data assimilation techniques and adaptions towards nowcasting are discussed.",

In this study, CRKs at the surface and TOA were built using the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (RRTM). Longwave cloud radiative effect (CRE) at the surface is primarily driven by cloud base properties, while TOA CRE is primarily decided by cloud top properties. For this reason, the standard version of surface CRK is a function of latitude, longitude, month, cloud optical thickness ( τ ) and cloud base pressure (CBP), and the TOA CRK is a function of latitude, longitude, month, τ and cloud top pressure (CTP). Considering that the cloud property histograms provided by climate models are functions of CTP instead of CBP at present, the surface CRKs on CBP- τ histograms were converted to CTP- τ fields using the statistical relationship between CTP, CBP and τ obtained from collocated CloudSat and MODIS observations. For both climate model outputs and satellites observations, the climatology of surface CRE and cloud-induced surface radiative anomalies calculated with the surface CRKs and cloud property histograms are well correlated with those calculated from surface radiative fluxes. The cloud-induced surface radiative anomalies reproduced by surface CRKs and MODIS cloud property histograms are not affected by spurious trends that appear in Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) surface irradiances products.",

    "abstract": "The attainment of suitable ambient air quality standards is a matter of great concern for successfully hosting the XXIV Olympic Winter Games (OWG). Transport patterns and potential sources of pollutants in Zhangjiakou (ZJK) were investigated using pollutant monitoring datasets and a dispersion model. The PM2.5 concentration during February in ZJK has increased slightly (28%) from 2018 to 2021, mostly owing to the shift of main potential source regions of west-central Inner Mongolia and Mongolian areas (2015-18) to the North China Plain and northern Shanxi Province (NCPS) after 2018. Using CO as an indicator, the relative contributions of the different regions to the receptor site (ZJK) were evaluated based on the source-receptor-relationship method (SRR) and an emission inventory. We found that the relative contribution of pollutants from NCPS increased from 33% to 68% during 2019-21. Central Inner Mongolia (CIM) also has an important impact on ZJK under unfavorable weather conditions. This study demonstrated that the effect of pollution control measures in the NCPS and CIM should be strengthened to ensure that the air quality meets the standard during the XXIV OWG.PM2.5(环境空气中空气动力学当量直径小于等于2.5微米的颗粒物)在大气中的滞留时间长, 可传输至几百公里远. 某一城市或区域的大气PM2.5污染往往具有明显的区域性和复合型污染特征, 既包括本地排放生成, 也包括周边地区的外来传输贡献. 因此确保环境空气质量达标, 对成功举办第24届北京冬季奥林匹克运动会至关重要. 为了解区域大气污染物的传输规律和潜在来源, 我们利用历史大气污染物数据集、 大气传输模式和中国多分辨率排放清单, 对冬奥会期间比赛区域空气质量水平、 大气传输规律和潜在污染源贡献进行了研究. 根据轨迹聚类和源-受体扩散模型模拟分析, 我们发现影响张家口地区的气团来源存在系统性变化, 主要传输路径在2018年后明显从内蒙古中部城市群和蒙古国地区转移到华北平原和山西省北部, 气团的传输高度主要集中在距地面600米以下. 以一氧化碳为示踪剂, 根据“源-受体”关系法和排放清单, 我们评估了不同地区对受体站点张家口的相对贡献. 2018至2021年, 来自华北地区污染的相对贡献率从35%增加到68%, 而来自内蒙古中部污染的相对贡献率从56%下降到15%. 模拟的结果与观测值之间的相关系数达到约0.94, 且与MOPITT卫星数据较为一致.",

The FGOALS-f3-L was initialized through the upgraded, weakly coupled data assimilation scheme, referred to as EnOI-IAU, which assimilates observational anomalies of sea surface temperature (SST) and upper-level (0–1000-m) ocean temperature and salinity profiles into the coupled model. Then, nine ensemble members of 10-year hindcast/forecast experiments were conducted for each initial year over the period of 1960–2021, based on initial conditions produced by three initialization experiments. The hindcast and forecast experiments follow the experiment designs of the Component-A and Component-B of the DCPP, respectively. The decadal prediction output datasets contain a total of 44 monthly mean atmospheric and oceanic variables. The preliminary evaluation indicates that the hindcast experiments show significant predictive skill for the interannual variations of SST in the north Pacific and multi-year variations of SST in the subtropical Pacific and the southern Indian Ocean.",

    "abstract": "Abstract HadISDH.extremes is an annually updated global gridded monthly monitoring product of wet and dry bulb temperature-based extremes indices, from January 1973 to December 2022. Data quality, including spatial and temporal stability, is a key focus. The hourly data are quality controlled. Homogeneity is assessed on monthly means and used to score each gridbox according to its homogeneity rather than to apply adjustments. This enables user-specific screening for temporal stability and avoids errors from inferring adjustments from monthly means for the daily maximum values. For general use, a score (HQ Flag) of 0 to 6 is recommended. A range of indices are presented, aligning with existing standardised indices. Uniquely, provision of both wet and dry bulb indices allows exploration of heat event character — whether it is a “humid and hot”, “dry and hot” or “humid and warm” event. It is designed for analysis of long-term trends in regional features. HadISDH.extremes can be used to study local events, but given the greater vulnerability to errors of maximum compared to mean values, cross-validation with independent information is advised.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Shallow convection plays an important role in transporting heat and moisture from the near-surface to higher altitudes, yet its parameterization in numerical models remains a great challenge, partly due to the lack of high-resolution observations. This study describes a large eddy simulation (LES) dataset for four shallow convection cases that differ primarily in inversion strength, which can be used as a surrogate for real data. To reduce the uncertainty in LES modeling, three different large eddy models were used, including SAM (System for Atmospheric Modeling), WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting model), and UCLA-LES. Results show that the different models generally exhibit similar behavior for each shallow convection case, despite some differences in the details of the convective structure. In addition to grid-averaged fields, conditionally sampled variables, such as in-cloud moisture and vertical velocity, are also provided, which are indispensable for calculation of the entrainment/detrainment rate. Considering the essentiality of the entraining/detraining process in the parameterization of cumulus convection, the dataset presented in this study is potentially useful for validation and improvement of the parameterization of shallow convection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Spring consecutive rainfall events (CREs) are key triggers of geological hazards in the Three Gorges Reservoir area (TGR), China. However, previous projections of CREs based on the direct outputs of global climate models (GCMs) are subject to considerable uncertainties, largely caused by their coarse resolution. This study applies a triple-nested WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model dynamical downscaling, driven by a GCM, MIROC6 (Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate, version 6), to improve the historical simulation and reduce the uncertainties in the future projection of CREs in the TGR. Results indicate that WRF has better performances in reproducing the observed rainfall in terms of the daily probability distribution, monthly evolution and duration of rainfall events, demonstrating the ability of WRF in simulating CREs. Thus, the triple-nested WRF is applied to project the future changes of CREs under the middle-of-the-road and fossil-fueled development scenarios. It is indicated that light and moderate rainfall and the duration of continuous rainfall spells will decrease in the TGR, leading to a decrease in the frequency of CREs. Meanwhile, the duration, rainfall amount, and intensity of CREs is projected to regional increase in the central-west TGR. These results are inconsistent with the raw projection of MIROC6. Observational diagnosis implies that CREs are mainly contributed by the vertical moisture advection. Such a synoptic contribution is captured well by WRF, which is not the case in MIROC6, indicating larger uncertainties in the CREs projected by MIROC6.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To quantify the relative contributions of Arctic sea ice and unforced atmospheric internal variability to the “warm Arctic, cold East Asia” (WACE) teleconnection, this study analyses three sets of large-ensemble simulations carried out by the Norwegian Earth System Model with a coupled atmosphere–land surface model, forced by seasonal sea ice conditions from preindustrial, present-day, and future periods. Each ensemble member within the same set uses the same forcing but with small perturbations to the atmospheric initial state. Hence, the difference between the present-day (or future) ensemble mean and the preindustrial ensemble mean provides the ice-loss-induced response, while the difference of the individual members within the present-day (or future) set is the effect of atmospheric internal variability. Results indicate that both present-day and future sea ice loss can force a negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation with a WACE pattern in winter. The magnitude of ice-induced Arctic warming is over four (ten) times larger than the ice-induced East Asian cooling in the present-day (future) experiment; the latter having a magnitude that is about 30% of the observed cooling. Sea ice loss contributes about 60% (80%) to the Arctic winter warming in the present-day (future) experiment. Atmospheric internal variability can also induce a WACE pattern with comparable magnitudes between the Arctic and East Asia. Ice-loss-induced East Asian cooling can easily be masked by atmospheric internal variability effects because random atmospheric internal variability may induce a larger magnitude warming. The observed WACE pattern occurs as a result of both Arctic sea ice loss and atmospheric internal variability, with the former dominating Arctic warming and the latter dominating East Asian cooling.",

Past theoretical, numerical, and experimental studies on penetrative convection are reviewed, along with field studies providing insights into turbulence modeling. The physical factors that initiate penetrative convection, including internal heat sources, nonlinear constitutive relationships, centrifugal forces and other complicated factors are summarized. Cutting-edge methods for understanding transport mechanisms and statistical properties of penetrative turbulence are also documented, e.g., the variational approach and quasilinear approach, which derive scaling laws embedded in penetrative turbulence. Exploring these scaling laws in penetrative convection can improve our understanding of large-scale geophysical and astrophysical motions. To better the model of penetrative turbulence towards a practical situation, new directions, e.g., penetrative convection in spheres, and radiation-forced convection, are proposed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The shrinking Arctic sea-ice area (SIA) in recent decades is a striking manifestation of the ongoing climate change. Variations of the Arctic sea ice have been continuously observed by satellites since 1979, relatively well monitored since the 1950s, but are highly uncertain in the earlier period due to a lack of observations. Several reconstructions of the historical gridded sea-ice concentration (SIC) data were recently presented based on synthesized regional sea-ice observations or by applying a hybrid model–empirical approach. Here, we present an SIC reconstruction for the period 1901–2019 based on established co-variability between SIC and surface air temperature, sea surface temperature, and sea level pressure patterns. The reconstructed sea-ice data for March and September are compared to the frequently used HadISST1.1 and SIBT1850 datasets. Our reconstruction shows a large decrease in SIA from the 1920 to 1940 concurrent with the Early 20th Century Warming event in the Arctic. Such a negative SIA anomaly is absent in HadISST1.1 data. The amplitude of the SIA anomaly reaches about 0.8 mln km 2 in March and 1.5 mln km 2 in September. The anomaly is about three times stronger than that in the SIBT1850 dataset. The larger decrease in SIA in September is largely due to the stronger SIC reduction in the western sector of the Arctic Ocean in the 70°–80°N latitudinal zone. Our reconstruction provides gridded monthly data that can be used as boundary conditions for atmospheric reanalyses and model experiments to study the Arctic climate for the first half of the 20th century.",

    "abstract": "Two years of mid-latitude cirrus cloud macrophysical and optical properties over North China are described from Earth-orbiting Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) satellite measurements. Global cloud climatological studies based on active remote sensing data sets benefit from more accurate resolution of vertical structure and more reliable detection of optically thin layers. The mean values for cirrus cases over North China are 0.19±0.18 for infrared emittance, 0.41±0.68 for visible optical depth, 0.26±0.12 for integrated depolarization ratio, and 0.72±0.22 for integrated color ratio. When studied using reasonable assumptions for the relationship between extinction and ice crystal backscatter coefficients, our results show that most of the cirrus clouds profiled using the 0.532 µm channel data stream correspond with an optical depth of less than 1.0. The dependence of cirrus cloud properties on cirrus cloud mid-cloud temperature and geometry thickness are generally similar to the results derived from the ground-based lidar, which are mainly impacted by the adiabatic process on the ice cloud content. However, the differences in macrophysical parameter variability indicate the limits of spaceborne-lidar and dissimilarities in regional climate variability and the nature and source of cloud nuclei in different geographical regions.",

The method is tested on three chaotic systems with different complexity. The results indicate that the NLLE spectrum realistically characterizes the growth rates of initial error vectors along different directions from the linear to nonlinear phases of error growth. This represents an improvement over the traditional Lyapunov exponent spectrum, which only characterizes the error growth rates during the linear phase of error growth. In addition, because the NLLE spectrum can effectively separate the slowly and rapidly growing perturbations, it is shown to be more suitable for estimating the predictability of chaotic systems, as compared to the traditional Lyapunov exponent spectrum.",

    "abstract": "Low visibility episodes (visibility < 1000 m) were studied by applying the anomaly-based weather analysis method. A regional episode of low visibility associated with a coastal fog that occurred from 27 to 28 January 2016 over Ningbo-Zhoushan Port, Zhejiang Province, East China, was first examined. Some basic features from the anomalous weather analysis for this case were identified: (1) the process of low visibility mainly caused by coastal fog was a direct response to anomalous temperature inversion in the lower troposphere, with a warm center around the 925 hPa level, which was formed by a positive geopotential height (GPH) anomaly in the upper troposphere and a negative GPH anomaly near the surface; (2) the positive humidity anomaly was conducive to the formation of coastal fog and rain; (3) regional coastal fog formed at the moment when the southwesterly wind anomalies transferred to northeasterly wind anomalies. Other cases confirmed that the low visibility associated with coastal fog depends upon low-level inversion, a positive humidity anomaly, and a change of wind anomalies from southwesterly to northeasterly, rain and stratus cloud amount. The correlation coefficients of six-hourly inversion, 850–925-hPa-averaged temperature, GPH and humidity anomalies against visibility are −0.31, 0.40 and −0.48, respectively, reaching the 99% confidence level in the first half-years of 2015 and 2016. By applying the anomaly-based weather analysis method to medium-range model output products, such as ensemble prediction systems, the anomalous temperature-pressure pattern and humidity—wind pattern can be used to predict the process of low visibility associated with coastal fog at several days in advance.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aerosols in the atmosphere not only degrade visibility, but are also detrimental to human health and transportation. In order to develop a method to estimate PM 2.5 mass concentration from the widely measured visibility, a field campaign was conducted in Southwest China in January 2019. Visibility, ambient relative humidity (RH), PM 2.5 mass concentrations and scattering coefficients of dry particles were measured. During the campaign, two pollution episodes, i.e., from 4–9 January and from 10–16 January, were encountered. Each of the two episodes could be divided into two periods. High aerosol hygroscopicity was found during the first period, when RH was higher than 80% at most of the time, and sometimes even approached 100%. The second period experienced a relatively dry but more polluted condition and aerosol hygroscopicity was lower than that during the first period. An empirical relationship between PM 2.5 mass concentration and visibility (ambient aerosol extinction) under different RH conditions could thus be established. Based on the empirical relationship, PM 2.5 mass concentration could be well estimated from visibility and RH. This method will be useful for remote sensing of PM 2.5 mass concentration.",

By employing the Community Earth System Model and applying an overriding technique to its ocean component (version 2 of the Parallel Ocean Program), this study investigates the similarities and differences of the formation mechanisms for the changes in the tropical Indian Ocean during the pIOD versus global warming. Results show that their formation processes and related seasonality are quite similar; in particular, wind–thermocline–SST feedback is the leading mechanism in producing the anomalous cooling over the eastern tropics in both cases. Some differences are also found, including the fact that the cooling effect of the vertical advection over the eastern tropical Indian Ocean is dominated by the anomalous vertical velocity during the pIOD but by the anomalous upper-ocean stratification under global warming. These findings are further examined through an analysis of the mixed layer heat budget.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) combined with the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) is cycled and evaluated for western North Pacific (WNP) typhoons of year 2016. Conventional in situ data, radiance observations, and tropical cyclone (TC) minimum sea level pressure (SLP) are assimilated every 6 h using an 80-member ensemble. For all TC categories, the 6-h ensemble priors from the WRF/EnKF system have an appropriate amount of variance for TC tracks but have insufficient variance for TC intensity. The 6-h ensemble priors from the WRF/EnKF system tend to overestimate the intensity for weak storms but underestimate the intensity for strong storms. The 5-d deterministic forecasts launched from the ensemble mean analyses of WRF/EnKF are compared to the NCEP and ECMWF operational control forecasts. Results show that the WRF/EnKF forecasts generally have larger track errors than the NCEP and ECMWF forecasts for all TC categories because the regional simulation cannot represent the large-scale environment better than the global simulation. The WRF/EnKF forecasts produce smaller intensity errors and biases than the NCEP and ECMWF forecasts for typhoons, but the opposite is true for tropical storms and severe tropical storms. The 5-d ensemble forecasts from the WRF/EnKF system for seven typhoon cases show appropriate variance for TC track and intensity with short forecast lead times but have insufficient spread with long forecast lead times. The WRF/EnKF system provides better ensemble forecasts and higher predictability for TC intensity than the NCEP and ECMWF ensemble forecasts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The study of shortwave (SW) radiation and its interactions with our planet has proven critical for advancing the understanding of the Earth–atmosphere system. Here, the author shares an accessible and high-level perspective on recent progress, surprises encountered, and promising future research directions a . A brief context for the study of SW radiation is provided, after which three specific aspects are focused upon that the author considers particularly important. First, the significance of three-dimensional (3D) SW radiative effects is highlighted via impacts on surface downward SW radiation in complex cloud fields. Crucially, it is shown that probability distributions of surface radiation can only be reliably simulated when accounting for 3D effects, which has implications for various applications and next-generation atmospheric modeling. Second, the significance of the often overlooked diurnal cycle in global top-of-atmosphere upward SW radiation is underscored by quantifying the controlling properties and processes. Opportunities for improved future satellite observations of the global diurnal cycle are noted. Third, the wealth of information provided by the spectral dimension of SW radiation is demonstrated through the extraction and attribution of SW spectral signatures. It is argued that further exploration of the spectral dimension, aided by the recently launched and upcoming suite of spectrally resolved SW satellite observations, promises a new era of SW radiation research.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Black Array of Broadband Absolute Radiometers Earth Radiation Imager (BABAR-ERI) is a small, adaptable nadir-pointed pushbroom imager to measure Earth-leaving broadband radiance from 0.3 µm to 100 µm with higher information content than is currently measured by reducing radiometric uncertainty and enabling cloud-resolving spatial resolution. The three-instrument BABAR-ERI suite fits a 12U CubeSat form factor and contains co-registered science telescope channels for measuring shortwave (0.3 µm to 4.5 µm band) and total radiance (0.3 µm to 100 µm band), dual-channel on-board radiance stability monitors, and a visible-wavelength camera. Novel, 1 × 32 element, electrical-substitution radiometer pixels image the shortwave and total radiance in 1 km × 1 km co-registered ground footprints; longwave radiance (4.5 µm to 100 µm band) is derived from subtraction of the shortwave and total radiance. The dual-channel onboard stability monitors are radiance standard detectors, and their measurements, acquired concurrently with the science telescopes and at much different duty cycles for the dual channels, will be used to track and correct the degradation of the science channels. The single-channel, mid-visible camera facilitates geolocation pointing knowledge and provides scene context information and sub-pixel variability to facilitate measurement stability studies and enable process-level science studies at high spatial resolution. The detectors for the science channels and stability monitors are absolute, ambient-temperature, micro-fabricated, electrical-substitution radiometers with near-perfect optical absorptance across the measurement range from vertically aligned carbon nanotubes. The BABAR-ERI science channels will be characterized over the full measurement range and for variable Earth scenes and deep space temperatures during extensive ground calibrations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Predicting monsoon climate is one of the major endeavors in climate science and is becoming increasingly challenging due to global warming. The accuracy of monsoon seasonal predictions significantly impacts the lives of billions who depend on or are affected by monsoons, as it is essential for the water cycle, food security, ecology, disaster prevention, and the economy of monsoon regions. Given the extensive literature on Asian monsoon climate prediction, we limit our focus to reviewing the seasonal prediction and predictability of the Asian Summer Monsoon (ASM). However, much of this review is also relevant to monsoon predictions in other seasons and regions. Over the past two decades, considerable progress has been made in the seasonal forecasting of the ASM, driven by an enhanced understanding of the sources of predictability and the dynamics of seasonal variability, along with advanced development in sophisticated models and technologies. This review centers on advances in understanding the physical foundation for monsoon climate prediction (section 2), significant findings and insights into the primary and regional sources of predictability arising from feedback processes among various climate components (sections 3 and 4), the effects of global warming and external forcings on predictability (section 5), developments in seasonal prediction models and techniques (section 6), the challenges and limitations of monsoon climate prediction (section 7), and emerging research trends with suggestions for future directions (section 8). We hope this review will stimulate creative activities to enhance monsoon climate prediction.",

    "abstract": "The UK Met Office Unified Model (UM) is employed by many weather forecasting agencies around the globe. This model is designed to run across spatial and time scales and known to produce skillful predictions for large-scale weather systems. However, the model has only recently begun running operationally at horizontal grid spacings of ∼1.5 km [e.g., at the UK Met Office and the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA)]. As its microphysics scheme was originally designed and tuned for large-scale precipitation systems, we investigate the performance of UM microphysics to determine potential inherent biases or weaknesses. Two rainfall cases from the KMA forecasting system are considered in this study: a Changma (quasi-stationary) front, and Typhoon Sanba (2012). The UM output is compared to polarimetric radar observations in terms of simulated polarimetric radar variables. Results show that the UM generally underpredicts median reflectivity in stratiform rain, producing high reflectivity cores and precipitation gaps between them. This is partially due to the diagnostic rain intercept parameter formulation used in the one-moment microphysics scheme. Model drop size is generally both underand overpredicted compared to observations. UM frozen hydrometeors favor generic ice (crystals and snow) rather than graupel, which is reasonable for Changma and typhoon cases. The model performed best with the typhoon case in terms of simulated precipitation coverage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract High spectral resolution (or hyperspectral) infrared (IR) sounders onboard low earth orbiting satellites provide high vertical resolution atmospheric information for numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. In contrast, imagers on geostationary (GEO) satellites provide high temporal and spatial resolution which are important for monitoring the moisture associated with severe weather systems, such as rapidly developing local severe storms (LSS). A hyperspectral IR sounder onboard a geostationary satellite would provide four-dimensional atmospheric temperature, moisture, and wind profiles that have both high vertical resolution and high temporal/spatial resolutions. In this work, the added-value from a GEO-hyperspectral IR sounder is studied and discussed using a hybrid Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) method. A hybrid OSSE is distinctively different from the traditional OSSE in that, (a) only future sensors are simulated from the nature run and (b) the forecasts can be evaluated using real observations. This avoids simulating the complicated observation characteristics of the current systems (but not the new proposed system) and allows the impact to be assessed against real observations. The Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) full spectral resolution (FSR) is assumed to be onboard a GEO for the impact studies, and the GEO CrIS radiances are simulated from the ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) with the hyperspectral IR all-sky radiative transfer model (HIRTM). The simulated GEO CrIS radiances are validated and the hybrid OSSE system is verified before the impact assessment. Two LSS cases from 2018 and 2019 are selected to evaluate the value-added impacts from the GEO CrIS-FSR data. The impact studies show improved atmospheric temperature, moisture, and precipitation forecasts, along with some improvements in the wind forecasts. An added-value, consisting of an overall 5% Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) reduction, was found when a GEO CrIS-FSR is used in replacement of LEO ones indicating the potential for applications of data from a GEO hyperspectral IR sounder to improve local severe storm forecasts.",

    "abstract": "Highly unusual amounts of rainfall were seen in the 2020 summer in many parts of China, Japan, and South Korea. At the intercontinental scale, case studies have attributed this exceptional event to a displacement of the climatological western North Pacific subtropical anticyclone, potentially associated Indian Ocean sea surface temperature patterns and a mid-latitude wave train emanating from the North Atlantic. Using clusters of spatial patterns of sea level pressure, we show that an unprecedented 80% of the 2020 summer days in East Asia were dominated by clusters of surface pressure greater than normal over the South China Sea. By examining the rainfall and water vapor fluxes in other years when these clusters were also prevalent, we find that the frequency of these types of clusters was likely to have been largely responsible for the unusual rainfall of 2020. From two ensembles of future climate projections, we show that summers like 2020 in East Asia may become more frequent and considerably wetter in a warmer world with an enhanced moisture supply.2020 年夏季, 中国、 日本和韩国的诸多地区均出现了创纪录的极端强降水. 该事件的个例研究将这一特殊事件归因于西北太平洋副热带反气旋的位置移动, 可能与印度洋海表面温度异常和自北大西洋发出的中纬度波列有关. 本工作通过对东亚逐日海平面气压 (SLP) 空间场的聚类分析, 发现 2020 年夏季南海地区为正 SLP 异常的天气型出现天数达到整个夏季的 80%, 为 1979 年以来之最. 通过与其他环流型所对应的降水和水汽通量异常对比, 发现这类天气型的频繁出现很可能是造成 2020 年梅雨期降水偏多的主要原因. 该研究进一步分析了两个大样本集合气候模拟预估结果, 发现未来在全球进一步增暖、 水分供应相应增加的情景下, 像 2020 年这样的东亚夏季环流可能会出现得更加频繁, 中国降水也会更强.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study uses linear regression and composite analyses to identify a pronounced asymmetric connection of sea surface temperature (SST) in the Tasman Sea with the two opposite phases of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during austral summer. In El Niño years, the SST anomalies (SSTAs) in the Tasman Sea exhibit a dipolar pattern with weak warmth in the northwest and modest cooling in the southeast, while during La Niña years the SSTAs exhibit a basin-scale warmth with greater amplitude. Investigations into the underlying mechanism suggest that this asymmetry arises from a mechanism related to oceanic heat transport, specifically the anomalous Ekman meridional heat transport induced by the zonal wind stress anomalies, rather than the surface heat fluxes on the air-sea interface. Further analysis reveals that the asymmetry of oceanic heat transport between El Niño and La Niña years is driven by the asymmetric atmospheric circulation over the Tasman Sea stimulated by the asymmetric diabatic heating in the tropical Pacific between the two opposite ENSO phases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) provides the majority of annual rainfall to countries in East Asia. Although state-of-the-art models broadly project increased EASM rainfall, the spread of projections is large and simulations of present-day rainfall show significant climatological biases. Systematic evapotranspiration biases occur locally over East Asia, and globally over land, in simulations both with and without a coupled ocean. This study explores the relationship between evapotranspiration and EASM precipitation biases. First, idealized model simulations are presented in which the parameterization of land evaporation is modified, while sea surface temperature is fixed. The results suggest a feedback whereby excessive evapotranspiration over East Asia results in cooling of land, a weakened monsoon low, and a shift of rainfall from the Philippine Sea to China, further fueling evapotranspiration. Cross-model regressions against evapotranspiration over China indicate a similar pattern of behavior in Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) simulations. Possible causes of this pattern are investigated. The feedback is not explained by an overly intense global hydrological cycle or by differences in radiative processes. Analysis of land-only simulations indicates that evapotranspiration biases are present even when models are forced with prescribed rainfall. These are strengthened when coupled to the atmosphere, suggesting a role for land-model errors in driving atmospheric biases. Coupled atmosphere-ocean models are shown to have similar evapotranspiration biases to those in AMIP over China, but different precipitation biases, including a northward shift in the ITCZ over the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Arctic is one of Earth’s regions highly susceptible to climate change. However, in situ long-term observations used for climate research are relatively sparse in the Arctic Ocean, and current climate models exhibit notable biases in Arctic Ocean simulations. Here, we present an Arctic Ocean dynamical downscaling dataset, obtained from the global ocean-sea ice model FESOM2 with a regionally refined horizonal resolution of 4.5 km in the Arctic region, which is driven by bias-corrected surface forcings derived from a climate model. The dataset includes 115 years (1900–2014) of historical simulations and two 86-year future projection simulations (2015–2100) for the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. The historical simulations demonstrate substantially reduced biases in temperature, salinity and sea-ice thickness compared to CMIP6 climate models. Common biases in the representation of the Atlantic Water layer found in climate model simulations are also markedly reduced in the dataset. Serving as a crucial long-term data source for climate change assessments and scientific research for the Arctic Ocean, this dataset provides valuable information for the scientific community.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The global monsoon system, encompassing the Asian-Australian, African, and American monsoons, sustains two-thirds of the world’s population by regulating water resources and agriculture. Monsoon anomalies pose severe risks, including floods and droughts. Recent research associated with the implementation of the Global Monsoons Model Intercomparison Project under the umbrella of CMIP6 has advanced our understanding of its historical variability and driving mechanisms. Observational data reveal a 20th-century shift: increased rainfall pre-1950s, followed by aridification and partial recovery post-1980s, driven by both internal variability (e.g., Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) and external forcings (greenhouse gases, aerosols), while ENSO drives interannual variability through ocean-atmosphere interactions. Future projections under greenhouse forcing suggest long-term monsoon intensification, though regional disparities and model uncertainties persist. Models indicate robust trends but struggle to quantify extremes, where thermodynamic effects (warming-induced moisture rise) uniformly boost heavy rainfall, while dynamical shifts (circulation changes) create spatial heterogeneity. Volcanic eruptions and proposed solar radiation modification (SRM) further complicate predictions: tropical eruptions suppress monsoons, whereas high-latitude events alter cross-equatorial flows, highlighting unresolved feedbacks. The emergent constraint approach is booming in terms of correcting future projections and reducing uncertainty with respect to the global monsoons. Critical challenges remain. Model biases and sparse 20th-century observational data hinder accurate attribution. The interplay between natural variability and anthropogenic forcings, along with nonlinear extreme precipitation risks under warming, demands deeper mechanistic insights. Additionally, SRM’s regional impacts and hemispheric monsoon interactions require systematic evaluation. Addressing these gaps necessitates enhanced observational networks, refined climate models, and interdisciplinary efforts to disentangle multiscale drivers, ultimately improving resilience strategies for monsoon-dependent regions.",

The goal of FAFMIP is to investigate the spread in the atmosphere-ocean general circulation model projections of ocean climate change forced by increased CO 2 , including the uncertainties in the simulations of ocean heat uptake, global mean sea level rise due to ocean thermal expansion and dynamic sea level change due to ocean circulation and density changes. The FAFMIP experiments have already been conducted with the Flexible Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System Model, gridpoint version 3.0 (FGOALS-g3). The model datasets have been submitted to the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) node. Here, the details of the experiments, the output variables and some baseline results are presented. Compared with the preliminary results of other models, the evolutions of global mean variables can be reproduced well by FGOALS-g3. The simulations of spatial patterns are also consistent with those of other models in most regions except the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean, indicating large uncertainties in the regional sea level projections of these two regions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract BCC-ESM1 is the first version of the Beijing Climate Center’s Earth System Model, and is participating in phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). The Aerosol Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP) is the only CMIP6-endorsed MIP in which BCC-ESM1 is involved. All AerChemMIP experiments in priority 1 and seven experiments in priorities 2 and 3 have been conducted. The DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations have also been run as the entry card of CMIP6. The AerChemMIP outputs from BCC-ESM1 have been widely used in recent atmospheric chemistry studies. To facilitate the use of the BCC-ESM1 datasets, this study describes the experiment settings and summarizes the model outputs in detail. Preliminary evaluations of BCC-ESM1 are also presented, revealing that: the climate sensitivities of BCC-ESM1 are well within the likely ranges suggested by IPCC AR5; the spatial structures of annual mean surface air temperature and precipitation can be reasonably captured, despite some common precipitation biases as in CMIP5 and CMIP6 models; a spurious cooling bias from the 1960s to 1990s is evident in BCC-ESM1, as in most other ESMs; and the mean states of surface sulfate concentrations can also be reasonably reproduced, as well as their temporal evolution at regional scales. These datasets have been archived on the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) node for atmospheric chemistry studies.",

The National Natural Science Foundation of China's Major Research Plan entitled \"Fundamental Researches on the Formation and Response Mechanism of the Air Pollution Complex in China\" (or the Plan) has funded 76 research projects to explore the causes of air pollution in China, and the key processes of air pollution in atmospheric physics and atmospheric chemistry. In order to summarize the abundant data from the Plan and exhibit the long-term impacts domestically and internationally, an integration project is responsible for collecting the various types of data generated by the 76 projects of the Plan. This project has classified and integrated these data, forming eight categories containing 258 datasets and 15 technical reports in total. The integration project has led to the successful establishment of the China Air Pollution Data Center (CAPDC) platform, providing storage, retrieval, and download services for the eight categories. This platform has distinct features including data visualization, related project information querying, and bilingual services in both English and Chinese, which allows for rapid searching and downloading of data and provides a solid foundation of data and support for future related research. Air pollution control in China, especially in the past decade, is undeniably a global exemplar, and this data center is the first in China to focus on research into the country's air pollution complex.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This work addresses challenges and opportunities in the evaluation of solar power plant impacts, with a particular focus on thermal effects of solar plants on the environment and vice-versa. Large-scale solar power plants are often sited in arid or desert habitats, which tend to include fauna and flora that are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and humidity. Our understanding of both shortwave (solar) and longwave (terrestrial) radiation processes in solar power plants is complete enough to render the modeling of radiation fluxes with high confidence for most applications. In contrast to radiation, the convective environment in large-scale solar power plants is much more difficult to characterize. Wind direction, wind speed, turbulence intensity, dust concentration, ground condition, panel configuration density, orientation and distribution throughout the solar field, all affect the local environment, the balance between radiation and convection, and in turn, the performance and thermal impact of solar power plants. Because the temperatures of the two sides of photovoltaic (PV) panels depend on detailed convection–radiation balances, the uncertainty associated with convection affects the heat and mass transfer balances as well. Those balances are critically important in estimating the thermal impact of large-scale solar farms on local habitats. Here we discuss outstanding issues related with these transfer processes for utility-scale solar generation and highlight potential pathways to gain useful knowledge about the convective environment directly from solar farms under operating conditions.",

    "abstract": "During extended winter (November–April), 43% of the intraseasonal rainfall variability in China is explained by three spatial patterns of temporally coherent rainfall. These patterns were identified with empirical orthogonal teleconnection (EOT) analysis of observed 1982–2007 pentad rainfall anomalies and connected to midlatitude disturbances. However, examination of individual strong EOT events shows that there is substantial inter-event variability in their dynamical evolution, which implies that precursor patterns found in regressions cannot serve as useful predictors. To understand the physical nature and origins of the extratropical precursors, the EOT technique is applied to six simulations of the Met Office Unified Model at horizontal resolutions of 200–40 km, with and without air–sea coupling. All simulations reproduce the observed precursor patterns in regressions, indicating robust underlying dynamical processes. Further investigation into the dynamics associated with observed patterns shows that Rossby wave dynamics can explain the large inter-event variability. The results suggest that the apparently slowly evolving or quasi-stationary waves in regression analysis are a statistical amalgamation of more rapidly propagating waves with a variety of origins and properties.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating a climate model's fidelity (ability to simulate observed climate) is a critical step in establishing confidence in the model's suitability for future climate projections, and in tuning climate model parameters. Model developers use their judgement in determining which trade-offs between different aspects of model fidelity are acceptable. However, little is known about the degree of consensus in these evaluations, and whether experts use the same criteria when different scientific objectives are defined. Here, we report on results from a broad community survey studying expert assessments of the relative importance of different output variables when evaluating a global atmospheric model's mean climate. We find that experts adjust their ratings of variable importance in response to the scientific objective, for instance, scientists rate surface wind stress as significantly more important for Southern Ocean climate than for the water cycle in the Asian watershed. There is greater consensus on the importance of certain variables (e.g., shortwave cloud forcing) than others (e.g., aerosol optical depth). We find few differences in expert consensus between respondents with greater or less climate modeling experience, and no statistically significant differences between the responses of climate model developers and users. The concise variable lists and community ratings reported here provide baseline descriptive data on current expert understanding of certain aspects of model evaluation, and can serve as a starting point for further investigation, as well as developing more sophisticated evaluation and scoring criteria with respect to specific scientific objectives.",

    "abstract": "The ozone budget inside the middle stratospheric polar vortex (24–36 km) during the 2002–2003 Arctic winter is studied by analyzing Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) satellite data. A comprehensive global chemical transport model (Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers, MOZART-3) is used to analyze the observed variation in polar vortex ozone during the stratospheric sudden warming (SSW) events. Both MIPAS measurement and MOZART-3 calculation show that a pronounced increase (26–28 DU) in the polar vortex ozone due to the SSW events. Due to the weakening of the polar vortex, the exchange of ozone mass across the edge of the polar vortex increases substantially and amounts to about 3.0×107 kg according to MOZART-3 calculation. The enhanced downward transport offsets about 80% of polar vortex ozone mass increase by horizontal transport. A “passive ozone” experiment shows that only ∼55% of the vertical ozone mass flux in February and March can be attributed to the variation in vertical transport. It is also shown that the enhanced downward ozone above ∼32 km should be attributed to the springtime photochemical ozone production. Due to the increase of air temperature, the NO x reaction rate increases by 40%–80% during the SSW events. As a result, NO x catalytic cycle causes another 44% decrease in polar vortex ozone compared to the net ozone changes due to dynamical transport. It is also shown that the largest change in polar vortex ozone is due to horizontal advection by planetary waves in January 2003.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study examined the characteristics of the diurnal variations of heavy rainfall (⩾110 mm in 12 hours) in Korea and the related atmospheric circulation for July from 1980–2020. During the analysis period, two dominant pattens of diurnal variation of the heavy rainfall emerged: all-day heavy rainfall (AD) and morning only heavy rainfall (MO) types. For the AD-type, the heavy rainfall is caused by abundant moisture content in conjunction with active convection in the morning (0000–1200, LST; LST = UTC + 9) and the afternoon hours (1200–2400 LST). These systems are related to the enhanced moisture inflow and upward motion induced by the strengthening of the western North Pacific subtropical high and upper-tropospheric jet. For the MO-type, heavy rainfall occurs mostly in the morning hours; the associated atmospheric patterns are similar to the climatology. We find that the atmospheric pattern related to severe heavy rainfalls in 2020 corresponds to a typical AD-type and resembles the 1991 heavy-rainfall system in its overall synoptic/mesoscale circulations. The present results imply that extremely heavy rainfall episodes in Korea during the 2020 summer may occur again in the future associated with the recurring atmospheric phenomenon related to the heavy rainfall.",

    "abstract": "Towards a better understanding of hydrological interactions between the land surface and atmosphere, land surface models are routinely used to simulate hydro-meteorological fluxes. However, there is a lack of observations available for model forcing, to estimate the hydro-meteorological fluxes in East Asia. In this study, Common Land Model (CLM) was used in offline-mode during the summer monsoon period of 2006 in East Asia, with different forcings from Asiaflux, Korea Land Data Assimilation System (KLDAS), and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), at point and regional scales, separately. The CLM results were compared with observations from Asiaflux sites. The estimated net radiation showed good agreement, with r =0.99 for the point scale and 0.85 for the regional scale. The estimated sensible and latent heat fluxes using Asiaflux and KLDAS data indicated reasonable agreement, with r = 0.70. The estimated soil moisture and soil temperature showed similar patterns to observations, although the estimated water fluxes using KLDAS showed larger discrepancies than those of Asiaflux because of scale mismatch. The spatial distribution of hydro-meteorological fluxes according to KLDAS for East Asia were compared to the CLM results with GLDAS, and the GLDAS provided online. The spatial distributions of CLM with KLDAS were analogous to CLM with GLDAS, and the standalone GLDAS data. The results indicate that KLDAS is a good potential source of high spatial resolution forcing data. Therefore, the KLDAS is a promising alternative product, capable of compensating for the lack of observations and low resolution grid data for East Asia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The influences of interannual surface potential vorticity forcing over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) on East Asian summer rainfall (EASR) and upper-level circulation are explored in this study. The results show that the interannual EASR and associated circulations are closely related to the surface potential vorticity negative uniform leading mode (PVNUM) over the TP. When the PVNUM is in the positive phase, more rainfall occurs in the Yangtze River valley, South Korea, Japan, and part of northern China, less rainfall occurs in southern China, and vice versa. A possible mechanism by which PVNUM affects EASR is proposed. Unstable air induced by the positive phase of PVNUM could stimulate significant upward motion and a lower-level anomalous cyclone over the TP. As a result, a dipole heating mode with anomalous cooling over the southwestern TP and anomalous heating over the southeastern TP is generated. Sensitivity experiment results regarding this dipole heating mode indicate that anomalous cooling over the southwestern TP leads to local and northeastern Asian negative height anomalies, while anomalous heating over the southeastern TP leads to local positive height anomalies. These results greatly resemble the realistic circulation pattern associated with EASR. Further analysis indicates that the anomalous water vapor transport associated with this anomalous circulation pattern is responsible for the anomalous EASR. Consequently, changes in surface potential vorticity forcing over the TP can induce changes in EASR.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Based on the ERA5 reanalysis datasets during 1980–2019, a total of eleven zonal shear lines (ZSLs) that caused heavy precipitation and lasted more than 60 hours over the Tibetan Plateau in summer are selected for composite analysis. By decomposing the kinetic energy ( K ) near the ZSL into divergent and rotational kinetic energies ( K D and K R ) and the kinetic energy of interaction between the divergent wind and the rotational wind ( K RD ), the influence of the rotational and divergent winds on the evolution of the ZSL intensity is investigated from the perspective of K D and K R . The main results are as follows. The ZSL is a comprehensive reflection of rotation and convergence. The intensity evolution of ZSL is essentially synchronized with those of K, K R , and K RD but lags behind K D by about three hours. The enhancement of K is mainly contributed by K R , which is governed by the conversion from K D to K R . Furthermore, the increase in the conversion from K D to K R is controlled by the geostrophic effect term Af, which is determined by the joint enhancement of the zonal rotational and meridional divergent wind components ( u R and v D ). Therefore, the joint enhancement of u R and v D controls the increase of the ZSL intensity, leading to increased precipitation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In recent studies, proxy XCH 4 retrievals from the Japanese Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) have been used to constrain top-down estimation of CH 4 emissions. Still, the resulting interannual variations often show significant discrepancies over some of the most important CH 4 source regions, such as China and Tropical South America, by causes yet to be determined. This study compares monthly CH 4 flux estimates from two parallel assimilations of GOSAT XCH 4 retrievals from 2010 to 2019 based on the same Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) framework but with the global chemistry transport model (GEOS-Chem v12.5) being run at two different spatial resolutions of 4° × 5° (R4, lon × lat) and 2° × 2.5° (R2, lon × lat) to investigate the effects of resolution-related model errors on the derived long-term global and regional CH 4 emission trends. We found that the mean annual global methane emission for the 2010s is 573.04 Tg yr −1 for the inversion using the R4 model, which becomes about 4.4 Tg yr −1 less (568.63 Tg yr −1 ) when a finer R2 model is used, though both are well within the ensemble range of the 22 top-down results (2008–17) included in the current Global Carbon Project (from 550 Tg yr −1 to 594 Tg yr −1 ). Compared to the R2 model, the inversion based on the R4 tends to overestimate tropical emissions (by 13.3 Tg yr which is accompanied by a general underestimation (by 8.9 Tg yr −1 ) in the extratropics. Such a dipole reflects differences in tropical-mid-latitude air exchange in relation to the model’s convective and advective schemes at different resolutions. The two inversions show a rather consistent long-term CH 4 emission trend at the global scale and over most of the continents, suggesting that the observed rapid increase in atmospheric methane can largely be attributed to the emission growth from North Africa (1.79 Tg yr −2 for R4 and 1.29 Tg yr −2 for R2) and South America Temperate (1.08 Tg yr −2 for R4 and 1.21 Tg yr −2 for R2) during the first half of the 2010s, and from Eurasia Boreal (1.46 Tg yr −2 for R4 and 1.63 Tg yr −2 for R2) and Tropical South America (1.72 Tg yr −2 for R4 and 1.43 Tg yr −2 for R2) over 2015–19. In the meantime, emissions in Europe have shown a consistent decrease over the past decade. However, the growth rates by the two parallel inversions show significant discrepancies over Eurasia Temperate, South America Temperate, and South Africa, which are also the places where recent GOSAT inversions usually disagree with one other.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The frequency and duration of observed concurrent hot and dry events (HDEs) over China during the growing season (April–September) exhibit significant decadal changes across the mid-1990s. These changes are characterized by increases in HDE frequency and duration over most of China, with relatively large increases over southeastern China (SEC), northern China (NC), and northeastern China (NEC). The frequency of HDEs averaged over China in the present day (PD, 1994–2011) is double that in the early period (EP, 1964–81); the duration of HDEs increases by 60%. Climate experiments with the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM-GOML2) are used to estimate the contributions of anthropogenic forcing to HDE decadal changes over China. Anthropogenic forcing changes can explain 60%–70% of the observed decadal changes, suggesting an important anthropogenic influence on HDE changes over China across the mid-1990s. Single-forcing experiments indicate that the increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations dominates the simulated decadal changes, increasing the frequency and duration of HDEs throughout China. The change in anthropogenic aerosol (AA) emissions significantly decreases the frequency and duration of HDEs over SEC and NC, but the magnitude of the decrease is much smaller than the increase induced by GHGs. The changes in HDEs in response to anthropogenic forcing are mainly due to the response of climatological mean surface air temperatures. The contributions from changes in variability and changes in climatological mean soil moisture and evapotranspiration are relatively small. The physical processes associated with the response of HDEs to GHG and AA changes are also revealed.",

    "abstract": "Planetary wave reflection from the stratosphere played a significant role in changing the tropospheric circulation pattern over Eurasia in mid-January 2008. We studied the 2008 event and compared with composite analysis (winters of 2002/2003, 2004/2005, 2006/2007, 2007/2008, 2010/2011 and 2011/2012), when the downward coupling was stronger, by employing time-lagged singular value decomposition analysis on the geopotential height field. In the Northern Hemisphere, the geopotential fields were decomposed into zonal mean and wave components to compare the relative covariance patterns. It was found that the wavenumber 1 (WN1) component was dominant compared with the wavenumber 2 (WN2) component and zonal mean process. For the WN1 field, the covariance was much higher (lower) for the negative (positive) lag, with a prominent peak around +15 days when the leading stratosphere coupled strongly with the troposphere. It contributed to the downward coupling due to reflection, when the stratosphere exhibited a partially reflective background state. We also analyzed the evolution of the WN1 anomaly and heat flux anomaly, both in the troposphere and stratosphere, during January–March 2008. The amplitude of the tropospheric WN1 pattern reached a maximum and was consistent with a downward wave coupling event influenced by the stratospheric WN1 anomaly at 10 hPa. This was consistent with the reflection of the WN1 component over Eurasia, which triggered an anomalous blocking high in the Urals–Siberia region. We further clarified the impact of reflection on the tropospheric WN1 field and hence the tropospheric circulation pattern by changing the propagation direction during and after the event.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Convectively coupled equatorial Rossby waves (ERW) modulate tropical cyclone activities over tropical oceans. This study presents a survey of the statistical relationship between intraseasonal ERWs and tropical cyclone genesis (TCG) over major global TC basins using four-decade-long outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and TC best-track datasets. Intraseasonal ERWs are identified from the OLR anomalies using an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis method without imposing equatorial symmetry. We find that westward-propagating ERWs are most significant in four tropical ocean basins over the summer hemisphere and that ERWs exhibit similar northeast-southwest (southeast-northwest) tilted phase lines in the northern (southern) hemisphere, with an appreciable poleward advance of wave energy in most TC basins. The EOF-based ERW indices quantitatively show that ERWs significantly modulate TC genesis. The convectively active (suppressed) phases of ERWs coincide with increased (reduced) TCG occurrences. The TCG modulation by ERWs achieves the maximum where the ERWs propagate through the climatological TCG hotspots. As a result, the total number of TCG occurrences in the TC basins varies significantly according to the ERW phase. The ERW-TCG relationship is significant over the northwestern Pacific Ocean, northeastern Pacific Ocean, and the northern Indian Ocean during the northern summer seasons. In the southern summer season, the ERW-TCG relationship is significant over the southern Indian Ocean, Indonesian-Australia basin, and the southwestern Pacific Ocean. However, ERW activities are weak in the main TC development region of the Atlantic Ocean; and the impact on Atlantic TCG appears to be insignificant.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Three types of previously used numerical methods are revisited for computing the streamfunction ψ and velocity potential χ from the horizontal velocity v in limited domains. The first type, called the SOR-based method, uses a classical successive over-relaxation (SOR) scheme to compute ψ (or χ ) first with an arbitrary boundary condition (BC) and then χ (or ψ ) with the BC derived from ν . The second type, called the spectral method, uses spectral formulations to construct the inner part of ( ψ, χ )—the inversion of (vorticity, divergence) with a homogeneous BC, and then the remaining harmonic part of ( ψ, χ ) with BCs from ν . The third type, called the integral method, uses integral formulas to compute the internally induced ( ψ, χ )—the inversion of domain-internal (vorticity, divergence) using the free-space Green’s function without BCs and then the remaining harmonic ψ (or χ ) with BCs from v minus the internally-induced part. Although these methods have previously been successfully applied to flows in large-scale and synoptic-scale domains, their accuracy is compromised when applied to complex flows over mesoscale domains, as shown in this paper. To resolve this problem, two hybrid approaches, the integral-SOR method and the integral-spectral method, are developed by combining the first step of the integral method with the second step adopted from the SOR-based and spectral methods, respectively. Upon testing these methods on real-case complex flows, the integral-SOR method is significantly more accurate than the integral-spectral method, noting that the latter is still generally more accurate than the three previously-used methods. The integral-SOR method is recommended for future applications and diagnostic studies of complex flows.",

    "abstract": "As salinity stratification is necessary to form the barrier layer (BL), the quantification of its role in BL interannual variability is crucial. This study assessed salinity variability and its effect on the BL in the equatorial Pacific using outputs from Beijing Normal University Earth System Model (BNU-ESM) simulations. A comparison between observations and the BNU-ESM simulations demonstrated that BNU-ESM has good capability in reproducing most of the interannual features observed in nature. Despite some discrepancies in both magnitude and location of the interannual variability centers, the displacements of sea surface salinity (SSS), barrier layer thickness (BLT), and SST simulated by BNU-ESM in the equatorial Pacific are realistic. During El Ni˜no, for example, the modeled interannual anomalies of BLT, mixed layer depth, and isothermal layer depth, exhibit good correspondence with observations, including the development and decay of El Ni˜no in the central Pacific, whereas the intensity of the interannual variabilities is weaker relative to observations. Due to the bias in salinity simulations, the SSS front extends farther west along the equator, whereas BLT variability is weaker in the central Pacific than in observations. Further, the BNU-ESM simulations were examined to assess the relative effects of salinity and temperature variability on BLT. Consistent with previous observation-based analyses, the interannual salinity variability can make a significant contribution to BLT relative to temperature in the western-central equatorial Pacific.",

Considerable knowledge of how and why SSR varies is crucial to a better understanding of climate change, which surely requires long-term measurements of high quality. The objective of this study is to introduce a value-added SSR dataset from Oct 2004 to Oct 2019 based on measurements taken at Xianghe, a suburban site in the North China Plain; two value-added products based on the 1-minute SSR measurements are developed. The first is clear sky detection by using a machine learning model. The second is cloud fraction estimation derived from an effective semi-empirical method. A “brightening” of global horizontal irradiance (GHI) was revealed and found to occur under both clear and cloudy conditions. This could likely be attributed to a reduction in aerosol loading and cloud fraction. This dataset could not only improve our knowledge of the variability and trend of SSR in the North China Plain, but also be beneficial for solar energy assessment and forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Many weather radar networks in the world have now provided polarimetric radar data (PRD) that have the potential to improve our understanding of cloud and precipitation microphysics, and numerical weather prediction (NWP). To realize this potential, an accurate and efficient set of polarimetric observation operators are needed to simulate and assimilate the PRD with an NWP model for an accurate analysis of the model state variables. For this purpose, a set of parameterized observation operators are developed to simulate and assimilate polarimetric radar data from NWP model-predicted hydrometeor mixing ratios and number concentrations of rain, snow, hail, and graupel. The polarimetric radar variables are calculated based on the T-matrix calculation of wave scattering and integrations of the scattering weighted by the particle size distribution. The calculated polarimetric variables are then fitted to simple functions of water content and volume-weighted mean diameter of the hydrometeor particle size distribution. The parameterized PRD operators are applied to an ideal case and a real case predicted by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to have simulated PRD, which are compared with existing operators and real observations to show their validity and applicability. The new PRD operators use less than one percent of the computing time of the old operators to complete the same simulations, making it efficient in PRD simulation and assimilation usage.",

Eight groups of experiments forced by different combinations of the sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice concentration (SIC) for pre-industrial, present-day, and future conditions were performed and published. The time-lag method was used to generate the 100 ensemble members, with each member integrating from 1 April 2000 to 30 June 2001 and the first two months as the spin-up period. The basic model responses of the surface air temperature (SAT) and precipitation were documented. The results indicate that Arctic amplification is mainly caused by Arctic SIC forcing changes. The SAT responses to the Arctic SIC decrease alone show an obvious increase over high latitudes, which is similar to the results from the combined forcing of SST and SIC. However, the change in global precipitation is dominated by the changes in the global SST rather than SIC, partly because tropical precipitation is mainly driven by local SST changes. The uncertainty of the model responses was also investigated through the analysis of the large-ensemble members. The relative roles of SST and SIC, together with their combined influence on Arctic amplification, are also discussed. All of these model datasets will contribute to PAMIP multi-model analysis and improve the understanding of polar amplification.",

To enhance the prediction skill for sea ice and respond to the Sea Ice Prediction Network-South's latest call, this study presents the reforecast results of Antarctic sea-ice area and extent from December to June of the coming year with a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) Network. The reforecast experiments demonstrate that ConvLSTM captures the interannual and interseasonal variability of Antarctic sea ice successfully, and performs better than the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Based on this, we present the prediction from December 2023 to June 2024, indicating that the Antarctic sea ice will remain at lows, but may not create a new record low. This research highlights the promising application of deep learning in Antarctic sea-ice prediction.",

    "abstract": "Since the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics was the first Winter Olympics in history held in continental winter monsoon climate conditions across complex terrain areas, there is a deficiency of relevant research, operational techniques, and experience. This made providing meteorological services for this event particularly challenging. The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) Earth System Modeling and Prediction Centre, achieved breakthroughs in research on short- and medium-term deterministic and ensemble numerical predictions. Several key technologies crucial for precise winter weather services during the Winter Olympics were developed. A comprehensive framework, known as the Operational System for High-Precision Weather Forecasting for the Winter Olympics, was established. Some of these advancements represent the highest level of capabilities currently available in China. The meteorological service provided to the Beijing 2022 Games also exceeded previous Winter Olympic Games in both variety and quality. This included achievements such as the \"100-meter level, minute level\" downscaled spatiotemporal resolution and forecasts spanning 1 to 15 days. Around 30 new technologies and over 60 kinds of products that align with the requirements of the Winter Olympics Organizing Committee were developed, and many of these techniques have since been integrated into the CMA's operational national forecasting systems. These accomplishments were facilitated by a dedicated weather forecasting and research initiative, in conjunction with the preexisting real-time operational forecasting systems of the CMA. This program represents one of the five subprograms of the WMO's high-impact weather forecasting demonstration project (SMART2022), and is also a part of their Regional Association (RA) II Research Development Project (Hangzhou RDP). Therefore, the research accomplishments and meteorological service experiences from this program will be carried forward into forthcoming high-impact weather forecasting activities. This article provides an overview and assessment of this program and the operational national forecasting systems.",

The disciplines represented in the project are related to climatology, anthropology, marine biology, economics, and the broad spectrum of social-ecological studies. Team members were drawn from the Nordic countries, Russia, China, the United States, and Canada. The project was transdisciplinary as well as interdisciplinary as it included collaboration with local knowledge holders. ARCPATH made significant contributions to Arctic research through an improved understanding of the mechanisms that drive climate variability in the Arctic. In tandem with this research, a combination of historical investigations and social, economic, and marine biological fieldwork was carried out for the project study areas of Iceland, Greenland, Norway, and the surrounding seas, with a focus on the joint use of ocean and sea-ice data as well as social-ecological drivers. ARCPATH was able to provide an improved framework for predicting the near-term variation of Arctic climate on spatial scales relevant to society, as well as evaluating possible related changes in socioeconomic realms. In summary, through the integration of information from several different disciplines and research approaches, ARCPATH served to create new and valuable knowledge on crucial issues, thus providing new pathways to action for Arctic communities.",

The region's climate is continental, mostly semi-arid to arid. Agriculture is a significant part of the region's economy. By its nature of intensive water use, agriculture is extremely vulnerable to climate change. Population growth and irrigation development have significantly increased the demand for water in the region. Major climate change issues include melting glaciers and a shrinking snowpack, which are the foundation of the region's water resources, and a changing precipitation regime. Most glaciers are located in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, leading to transboundary water resource issues. Summer already has extremely high temperatures. Analyses indicate that Central Asia has been warming and precipitation might be increasing. The warming is expected to increase, but its spatial and temporal distribution depends upon specific global scenarios. Projections of future precipitation show significant uncertainties in type, amount, and distribution. Regional Hydroclimate Projects (RHPs) are an approach to studying these issues. Initial steps to develop an RHP began in 2021 with a widely distributed online survey about these climate issues. It was followed up with an online workshop and then, in 2023, an in-person workshop, held in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Priorities for the Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX) project for the region include both observations and modeling, as well as development of better and additional precipitation observations, all of which are topics for the next workshop. A well-designed RHP should lead to reductions in critical climate uncertainties in policy-relevant timeframes that can influence decisions on necessary investments in climate adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Extreme cold temperatures were observed in July and August 2023, coinciding with the WINFLY (winter fly-in) period of mid to late August into September 2023, meaning aircraft operations into McMurdo Station and Phoenix Airfield were adversely impacted. Specifically, with temperatures below −50°C, safe flight operation was not possible because of the risk of failing hydraulics and fuel turning to gel onboard the aircraft. The cold temperatures were measured across a broad area of the Antarctic, from East Antarctica toward the Ross Ice Shelf, and stretching across West Antarctica to the Antarctic Peninsula. A review of automatic weather station measurements and staffed station observations revealed a series of sites recording new record low temperatures. Four separate cold phases were identified, each a few days in duration and occurring from mid-July to the end of August 2023. A brief analysis of 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies shows how the mid-tropospheric atmospheric environment evolves in relation to these extreme cold temperatures. The monthly 500-hPa geopotential height anomalies show strong negative anomalies in August. Examination of composite geopotential height anomalies during each of the four cold phases suggests various factors leading to cold temperatures, including both southerly off-content flow and calm atmospheric conditions. Understanding the atmospheric environment that leads to such extreme cold temperatures can improve prediction of such events and benefit Antarctic operations and the study of Antarctic meteorology and climatology.",

    "abstract": "Tea is an important global commodity, with important tea-growing regions spanning across South America, Africa, and Asia, and burgeoning smaller-scale and artisanal tea production in the UK and Europe. In each of these regions, the quality and quantity of tea production, with their economic and social consequences, are highly sensitive to variations in the climate on both short-term weather, seasonal and climate change timescales. The provision of tailored climate information in a timely and accessible manner through the development, delivery and use of climate services can help tea-farmers and other relevant stakeholders better understand the impacts of climate variability and climate change on decision-making and a range of adaptive actions. This paper presents an overview of the Tea-CUP project (Co-developing Useful Predictions), a joint initiative between UK and Chinese partners, which aims to develop and implement solutions for improving robust decision-making. Co-production principles are core, ensuring that the resultant climate services are usable and useful; users' needs are met through close engagement and joint research and decision-making. The paper also reports on the exchange of knowledge and experiences, such as between tea growers in China and the UK, which has resulted from this collaborative work, fostering global knowledge sharing, enriching understanding, and driving innovation by integrating diverse perspectives and expertise from different countries. This is an unintended but valuable side-effect of the collaborative approach taken and highlights the benefits of a highly relational and multidisciplinary approach to climate services development that will inform future work in the field.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Nusantara, the new capital city of Indonesia, and its surrounding areas experienced intense heavy rainfall on 15–16 March 2022, leading to devastating and widespread flooding. However, the factors triggering such intense heavy rainfall and the underlying physical mechanisms are still not fully understood. Using high-resolution GSMaP (Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation) data, we show that a mesoscale convective system (MCS) was the primary cause of the heavy rainfall event. The rainfall peak occurred during the MCS’s mature stage at 1800 UTC 15 March 2022, and diminished as it entered the dissipation stage. To understand the large-scale environmental factors affecting the MCS event, we analyzed contributions from the MJO, equatorial waves, and low-frequency variability to column water vapor and moisture flux convergence. Results indicate a substantial influence of the MJO and equatorial waves on lower-level (boundary layer) meridional moisture flux convergence during the pre-MCS stage and initiation, with their contributions accounting for up to 80% during the growth phase. Moreover, while La Niña and the Asian monsoon had negligible impacts on MCS moisture supply, we find a large contribution from the residual term of the water vapour budget during the maturation and decay phases of the MCS. This suggests that local forcing (such as small-scale convection, local evaporation, land-surface feedback, and topography) also contributed to modulation of the intensity and duration of the MCS. The results of this study can help in our understanding of the potential causes of extreme rainfall in Nusantara and could be leveraged to improve rainstorm forecasting and risk management across the region in the future.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Understanding the characteristics and variations of heat exchange and evaporation of lakes is important for regional water resource management and sustainable development. Based on eddy covariance measurements over Lake Vanajavesi in southern Finland, characteristics of energy fluxes and cold frontal effects on energy exchange were investigated. The lake acted as a heat sink in spring and summer and a heat source in winter. The latent heat flux reached its minimum value in the morning and peaked in the afternoon. The diurnal variation of sensible heat flux was opposite to that of latent heat flux. Impact factors for the sensible heat flux were mainly the lake-air temperature difference and the product of lake-air temperature difference and wind speed. The latent heat flux was mainly affected by the vapor pressure deficit and the product of vapor pressure deficit and wind speed. The annual mean values of bulk transfer coefficients for momentum, heat, and water vapor were 1.98 × 10 −3 , 1.62 × 10 −3 , and 1.31 × 10 −3 , respectively. Bulk transfer coefficients for heat and water vapor were not equal, indicating that the parameterization of energy exchange in numerical models, where the assumption that the heat coefficient equals the water vapor coefficient needs improvement. During the ice-free season, cold fronts resulted in 28 sensible heat pulses and 17 latent heat pulses, contributing to 50.59% and 34.89% of sensible and latent heat exchange in Lake Vanajavesi. These results indicate that cold fronts significantly impact the surface energy budget and evaporation over lakes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A positivity-preserving conservative semi-Lagrangian transport model by multi-moment finite volume method has been developed on the cubed-sphere grid. Two kinds of moments (i.e., point values (PV moment) at cell interfaces and volume integrated average (VIA moment) value) are defined within a single cell. The PV moment is updated by a conventional semi-Lagrangian method, while the VIA moment is cast by the flux form formulation to assure the exact numerical conservation. Different from the spatial approximation used in the CSL2 (conservative semi-Lagrangian scheme with second order polynomial function) scheme, a monotonic rational function which can effectively remove non-physical oscillations is reconstructed within a single cell by the PV moments and VIA moment. To achieve exactly positive-definite preserving, two kinds of corrections are made on the original conservative semi-Lagrangian with rational function (CSLR) scheme. The resulting scheme is inherently conservative, non-negative, and allows a Courant number larger than one. Moreover, the spatial reconstruction can be performed within a single cell, which is very efficient and economical for practical implementation. In addition, a dimension-splitting approach coupled with multi-moment finite volume scheme is adopted on cubed-sphere geometry, which benefitsthe implementation of the 1D CSLR solver with large Courant number. The proposed model is evaluated by several widely used benchmark tests on cubed-sphere geometry. Numerical results show that the proposed transport model can effectively remove nonphysical oscillations and preserve the numerical non-negativity, and it has the potential to transport the tracers accurately in a real atmospheric model.",

I had the enormous pleasure of meeting Professor YE personally in 1992 in Beijing. His concern to promote the very best science and to use it well, and his thinking on multi-level orderly human activities, reminds me not only of the communication skills we need as scientists but also of the multi-level nature of science itself. Here I want to say something (a) about what science is; (b) about why multi-level thinking—and taking more than one viewpoint—is so important for scientific as well as for other forms of understanding; and (c) about what is meant, at a deep level, by \"scientific understanding\" and trying to communicate it, not only with lay persons but also across professional disciplines. I hope that Professor YE would approve.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To improve the ensemble prediction system of the tropical regional atmosphere model for the South China Sea (TREPS) in predicting landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs), the impacts of three new implementing strategies for surface and model physics perturbations in TREPS were evaluated for 19 TCs making landfall in China during 2014–16. For sea surface temperature (SST) perturbations, spatially uncorrelated random perturbations were replaced with spatially correlated ones. The multiplier f , which is used to form perturbed tendency in the Stochastically Perturbed Parameterization Tendency (SPPT) scheme, was inflated in regions with evident convective activity ( f -inflated SPPT). Lastly, the Stochastically Perturbed Parameterization (SPP) scheme with 14 perturbed parameters selected from the planetary boundary layer, surface layer, microphysics, and cumulus convection parameterizations was added. Overall, all these methods improved forecasts more significantly for non-intensifying than intensifying TCs. Compared with f -inflated SPPT, the spatially correlated SST perturbations generally showed comparable performance but were more (less) skillful for intensifying (non-intensifying) TCs. The advantages of the spatially correlated SST perturbations and f -inflated SPPT were mainly present in the deterministic guidance for both TC track and wind and in the probabilistic guidance for reliability of wind. For intensifying TCs, adding SPP led to mixed impacts with significant improvements in probability-matched mean of modest winds and in probabilistic forecasts of rainfall; while for non-intensifying TCs, adding SPP frequently led to positive impacts on the deterministic guidance for track, intensity, strong winds, and moderate rainfall and on the probabilistic guidance for wind and discrimination of rainfall.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mode water is a distinct water mass characterized by a near vertical homogeneous layer or low potential vorticity, and is considered essential for understanding ocean climate variability. Based on the output of GFDL CM3, this study investigates the response of eastern subtropical mode water (ESTMW) in the North Pacific to two different single forcings: greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosol. Under GHG forcing, ESTMW is produced on lighter isopycnal surfaces and is decreased in volume. Under aerosol forcing, in sharp contrast, it is produced on denser isopycnal surfaces and is increased in volume. The main reason for the opposite response is because surface ocean-to-atmosphere latent heat flux change over the ESTMW formation region shoals the mixed layer and thus weakens the lateral induction under GHG forcing, but deepens the mixed layer and thus strengthens the lateral induction under aerosol forcing. In addition, local wind changes are also favorable to the opposite response of ESTMW production to GHG versus aerosol.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The datasets of the five Land-offline Model Intercomparison Project (LMIP) experiments using the Chinese Academy of Sciences Land Surface Model (CAS-LSM) of CAS Flexible Global-Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System Model Grid-point version 3 (CAS FGOALS-g3) are presented in this study. These experiments were forced by five global meteorological forcing datasets, which contributed to the framework of the Land Surface Snow and Soil Moisture Model Intercomparison Project (LS3MIP) of CMIP6. These datasets have been released on the Earth System Grid Federation node. In this paper, the basic descriptions of the CAS-LSM and the five LMIP experiments are shown. The performance of the soil moisture, snow, and land-atmosphere energy fluxes was preliminarily validated using satellite-based observations. Results show that their mean states, spatial patterns, and seasonal variations can be reproduced well by the five LMIP simulations. It suggests that these datasets can be used to investigate the evolutionary mechanisms of the global water and energy cycles during the past century.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent work has shown the dominance of the Himalaya in supporting the Indian summer monsoon (ISM), perhaps by surface sensible heating along its southern slope and by mechanical blocking acting to separate moist tropical flow from drier midlatitude air. Previous studies have also shown that Indian summer rainfall is largely unaffected in sensitivity experiments that remove only the Tibetan Plateau. However, given the large biases in simulating the monsoon in CMIP5 models, such results may be model dependent. This study investigates the impact of orographic forcing from the Tibetan Plateau, Himalaya and Iranian Plateau on the ISM and East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) in the UK Met Office’s HadGEM3-GA6 and China’s Institute of Atmospheric Physics FGOALS-FAMIL global climate models. The models chosen feature oppositesigned biases in their simulation of the ISM rainfall and circulation climatology. The changes to ISM and EASM circulation across the sensitivity experiments are similar in both models and consistent with previous studies. However, considerable differences exist in the rainfall responses over India and China, and in the detailed aspects such as onset and retreat dates. In particular, the models show opposing changes in Indian monsoon rainfall when the Himalaya and Tibetan Plateau orography are removed. Our results show that a multi-model approach, as suggested in the forthcoming Global Monsoon Model Intercomparison Project (GMMIP) associated with CMIP6, is needed to clarify the impact of orographic forcing on the Asian monsoon and to fully understand the implications of model systematic error.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The measurement of atmospheric O 2 concentrations and related oxygen budget have been used to estimate terrestrial and oceanic carbon uptake. However, a discrepancy remains in assessments of O 2 exchange between ocean and atmosphere (i.e. air-sea O 2 flux), which is one of the major contributors to uncertainties in the O 2 -based estimations of the carbon uptake. Here, we explore the variability of air-sea O 2 flux with the use of outputs from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6). The simulated air-sea O 2 flux exhibits an obvious warming-induced upward trend (∼1.49 Tmol yr −2 ) since the mid-1980s, accompanied by a strong decadal variability dominated by oceanic climate modes. We subsequently revise the O 2 -based carbon uptakes in response to this changing air-sea O 2 flux. Our results show that, for the 1990–2000 period, the averaged net ocean and land sinks are 2.10±0.43 and 1.14±0.52 GtC yr −1 respectively, overall consistent with estimates derived by the Global Carbon Project (GCP). An enhanced carbon uptake is found in both land and ocean after year 2000, reflecting the modification of carbon cycle under human activities. Results derived from CMIP5 simulations also investigated in the study allow for comparisons from which we can see the vital importance of oxygen dataset on carbon uptake estimations.",

    "abstract": "Extreme Mei-yu rainfall (MYR) can cause catastrophic impacts to the economic development and societal welfare in China. While significant improvements have been made in climate models, they often struggle to simulate local-to-regional extreme rainfall (e.g., MYR). Yet, large-scale climate modes (LSCMs) are relatively well represented in climate models. Since there exists a close relationship between MYR and various LSCMs, it might be possible to develop causality-guided statistical models for MYR prediction based on LSCMs. These statistical models could then be applied to climate model simulations to improve the representation of MYR in climate models. In this pilot study, it is demonstrated that skillful causality-guided statistical models for MYR can be constructed based on known LSCMs. The relevancy of the selected predictors for statistical models are found to be consistent with the literature. The importance of temporal resolution in constructing statistical models for MYR is also shown and is in good agreement with the literature. The results demonstrate the reliability of the causality-guided approach in studying complex circulation systems such as the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). Some limitations and possible improvements of the current approach are discussed. The application of the causality-guided approach opens up a new possibility to uncover the complex interactions in the EASM in future studies.极端梅雨降雨 (MYR) 会对中国的社会和经济发展造成灾难性影响. 尽管气候模型在模拟气候上已有重要进展, 但这些模型通常难以模拟局部到区域的极端降雨过程(例如, 极端梅雨降雨). 目前来说, 气候模型能较好地模拟大尺度气候模式(LSCM). 由于 极端梅雨降雨 与不同的 大尺度气候模式 之间存在密切关系, 因此, 我们有可能基于大尺度气候模式来构建因果关系引导的数据模型. 该数据模型有望应用于气候模型的模拟以改善其在模拟极端梅雨降雨中的表现. 在此探索性研究中, 我们证明了基于因果关系引导方法的数据模型可以通过已知的大尺度气候模式来建立, 并有效模拟极端梅雨降雨. 该统计模型內的预测变量的相关性以及时间分辨率的重要性都与文献一致. 该研究结果证实了因果关系引导方法在研究东亚夏季风 (EASM) 等复杂环流系统中的可靠性. 本文也讨论了当前方法的一些局限性和可能的改进方法. 因果关系引导方法的应用为未来研究复杂的东亚夏季风中的相互作用开辟了新的可能性.",

    "abstract": "A global spherical Fourier–Legendre spectral element method is proposed to solve Poisson equations and advective flow over a sphere. In the meridional direction, Legendre polynomials are used and the region is divided into several elements. In order to avoid coordinate singularities at the north and south poles in the meridional direction, Legendre–Gauss–Radau points are chosen at the elements involving the two poles. Fourier polynomials are applied in the zonal direction for its periodicity, with only one element. Then, the partial differential equations are solved on the longitude–latitude meshes without coordinate transformation between spherical and Cartesian coordinates. For verification of the proposed method, a few Poisson equations and advective flows are tested. Firstly, the method is found to be valid for test cases with smooth solution. The results of the Poisson equations demonstrate that the present method exhibits high accuracy and exponential convergence. Highprecision solutions are also obtained with near negligible numerical diffusion during the time evolution for advective flow with smooth shape. Secondly, the results of advective flow with non-smooth shape and deformational flow are also shown to be reasonable and effective. As a result, the present method is proved to be capable of solving flow through different types of elements, and thereby a desirable method with reliability and high accuracy for solving partial differential equations over a sphere.",

    "abstract": "Convection and its ensuing severe weather, such as heavy rainfall, hail, tornado, and high wind, have significant impacts on our society and economy (e.g., Cao et al., 2004; Fritsch and Carbone, 2004; Verbout et al., 2006; Ashley and Black, 2008; Cao, 2008; Cao and Ma, 2009; Zhang et al., 2014). Due to its localized and transient nature, the initiation of convection or convective initiation remains one of the least understood aspects of convection in the scientific communities, and it is a significant challenge to accurately predict the exact timing and location of convective initiation (e.g., Cai et al., 2006; Wilson and Roberts, 2006; Xue and Martin, 2006; Cao and Zhang, 2016). Convective initiation can be attributed to various forcing mechanisms, including, but not limited to, upper-level forcing, boundary-layer forcing, and a combination of them (e.g., Bennett et al., 2006; Lopez, 2007; Marsham et al., 2011). For surface-based convective initiation, boundary-layer forcing often determines the precise location where convection is triggered within large areas of potential instability (e.g., Pielke, 2001). The most common boundary-layer triggering mechanisms include surface fronts, drylines, gust fronts, sea/lake land breezes, orographic circulations, and boundary layer horizontal convective rolls. In addition, inhomogeneity in land surface characteristics can also produce sufficient vertical motion to force convection, particularly under strong surface heating conditions (Trier et al., 2004). Various possible mechanisms for convective initiation are generally recognized, but the exact forcings responsible for a specific case are often difficult to ascertain, especially when multiple physical processes and their interactions are involved. In this issue (Page 1120–1136), Wang et al. (2016) devote themselves to the understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for convective initiation over the Dabie Mountains located in eastern China.

    "abstract": "Abstract Wind field simulation in the surface layer is often used to manage natural resources in terms of air quality, gene flow (through pollen drift), and plant disease transmission (spore dispersion). Although Lagrangian stochastic (LS) models describe stochastic wind behaviors, such models assume that wind velocities follow Gaussian distributions. However, measured surface-layer wind velocities show a strong skewness and kurtosis. This paper presents an improved model, a non-Gaussian LS model, which incorporates controllable non-Gaussian random variables to simulate the targeted non-Gaussian velocity distribution with more accurate skewness and kurtosis. Wind velocity statistics generated by the non-Gaussian model are evaluated by using the field data from the Cooperative Atmospheric Surface Exchange Study, October 1999 experimental dataset and comparing the data with statistics from the original Gaussian model. Results show that the non-Gaussian model improves the wind trajectory simulation by stably producing precise skewness and kurtosis in simulated wind velocities without sacrificing other features of the traditional Gaussian LS model, such as the accuracy in the mean and variance of simulated velocities. This improvement also leads to better accuracy in friction velocity (i.e., a coupling of three-dimensional velocities). The model can also accommodate various non-Gaussian wind fields and a wide range of skewness–kurtosis combinations. Moreover, improved skewness and kurtosis in the simulated velocity will result in a significantly different dispersion for wind/particle simulations. Thus, the non-Gaussian model is worth applying to wind field simulation in the surface layer.",

    "abstract": "As AI continues to establish itself as a cornerstone technology across various industries and scientific disciplines, its profound impact on atmospheric and oceanic science is becoming increasingly apparent.The advantages of AI in surmounting obstacles within our field are undeniable, as evidenced by breakthroughs in weather forecasting (e.g., Bi et al., 2023), climate prediction (e.g., Ham et al., 2019), AI-based parameterization schemes (e.g., Rasp et al., 2018;Wang and Tan, 2023), and beyond.Recognizing the transformative potential of AI in atmospheric and oceanic science, this special issue endeavors to explore the extensive applications of AI in our domain.Covering a broad spectrum of subjects, from weather and climate to oceanic science, this issue aims to enrich our understanding of how AI is transforming our approaches.With articles focusing on enhancing forecasts, optimizing numerical models, and conducting mechanistic research through explainable analysis, this collection provides valuable insights into the current state and future potential of AI in atmospheric and oceanic science.This special issue (Part I) highlights recent advancements in AI applications in atmospheric and oceanic science, comprising a total of 14 articles that span a broad spectrum of research topics.Huang et al. ( 2024) commence by succinctly addressing the ongoing debate surrounding the physical consistency of AI weather models, elucidating the significance of physical constraints and delineating methodologies for their integration into AI models.Additionally, they underscore the adoption of online coupled AI-physical models as a viable approach.Lyu et al. (2024) and Wang et al. (2024) employ supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to undertake ENSO predictions and correct ENSO simulations within climate models, respectively.Meanwhile, Lin et al. (2024) and Wang et al. (2024) conduct mechanistic analyses using AI models, exploring the impacts of fires on hail events and investigating the origins of the low predictability of El Niño.At weather and subseasonal scales, Li et al. (2024) investigate the integration of deep learning and physical models for soil moisture prediction, while Zhou et al. (2024) propose a physics-informed deep learning method for typhoon intensity prediction.Additionally, Liu et al. (2024) utilize deep learning for thunderstorm wind forecasting, and Song et al. (2024a) construct advanced deep learning models for predicting Arctic sea-ice concentration one month in advance.Yuan et al. (2024) employ deep learning models for predicting ocean sound velocity.Addressing the issue of ensemble forecast integration, Song et al. (2024b) develop a novel non-cross-quantile regression neural network method for calibrating numerical forecast ensembles.Furthermore, Zhuang et al. (2024) apply symbolic classification algorithms to the monitoring of turbulence anomalies, bearing significance for aviation safety.Moreover, Du and Zhang (2024) advocate for a deep learning scheme called Representing Wind Stress Anomalies over the Tropical Pacific, integrated with an intermediate coupled model.Collectively, these contributions underscore the significant progress made at the confluence of AI and atmospheric and oceanic science, offering promising prospects for enhanced understanding and predictive capabilities in our ongoing efforts to comprehend and mitigate environmental challenges.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to the considerable uncertainties inherent in the datasets describing the spatiotemporal distributions of precipitation in the drylands of China, this study presents a new merged monthly precipitation product with a spatial resolution of approximately 0.2° × 0.2° during 1980–2019. The newly developed precipitation product was validated at different temporal scales (e.g., monthly, seasonally, and annually). The results show that the new product consistently aligns with the spatiotemporal distributions reported by the Chinese Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) product and Multi-Source Weighted Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP). The merged product exhibits exceptional quality in describing the drylands of China, with a bias of −2.19 mm month −1 relative to MSWEP. In addition, the annual trend of the merged product (0.09 mm month −1 yr −1 ) also closely aligns with that of the MSWEP (0.11 mm month −1 yr −1 ) during 1980–2019. The increasing trend indicates that the water cycle and wetting process intensified in the drylands of China during this period. In particular, there was an increase in wetting during the period from 2001–2019. Generally, the merged product exhibits potential value for improving our understanding of the climate and water cycle in the drylands of China.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Climate change is an essential topic in climate science, and the accessibility of accurate, high-resolution datasets in recent years has facilitated the extraction of more insights from big-data resources. Nonetheless, current research predominantly focuses on mean-value changes and largely overlooks changes in the probability distribution. In this study, a novel method called Wasserstein Stability Analysis (WSA) is developed to identify probability density function (PDF) changes, especially the extreme event shift and nonlinear physical value constraint variation in climate change. WSA is applied to the early 21st century and compared with traditional mean-value trend analysis. The results indicate that despite no significant trend, the equatorial eastern Pacific experienced a decline in hot extremes and an increase in cold extremes, indicating a La Niña-like temperature shift. Further analysis at two Arctic locations suggests sea ice severely restricts the hot extremes of surface air temperature. This impact is diminishing as the sea ice melts. By revealing PDF shifts, WSA emerges as a powerful tool to re-examine climate change dynamics, providing enhanced data-driven insights for understanding climate evolution.",

    "abstract": "Abstract To understand the potential impacts of projected climate change on the vulnerable agriculture in Central Asia (CA), six agroclimatic indicators are calculated based on the 9-km-resolution dynamical downscaled results of three different global climate models from Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), and their changes in the near-term future (2031–50) are assessed relative to the reference period (1986–2005). The quantile mapping (QM) method is applied to correct the model data before calculating the indicators. Results show the QM method largely reduces the biases in all the indicators. Growing season length (GSL, day), summer days (SU, day), warm spell duration index (WSDI, day), and tropical nights (TR, day) are projected to significantly increase over CA, and frost days (FD, day) are projected to decrease. However, changes in biologically effective degree days (BEDD, °C) are spatially heterogeneous. The high-resolution projection dataset of agroclimatic indicators over CA can serve as a scientific basis for assessing the future risks to local agriculture from climate change and will be beneficial in planning adaption and mitigation actions for food security in this region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Idealized numerical simulations have been carried out to reveal the complexity in the development of asymmetric convection in a tropical cyclone (TC) under the influence of an environment with either uniform flow, vertical wind shear (VWS), or both. Results show that rainwater is enhanced to the right of the motion in the outer rainband, but such enhancement occurs in the upshear-left area of the inner-core region. Additionally, due to the asymmetries introduced by environmental flow, wavenumber-1 temperature and height anomalies develop at a radius of ~1000 km in the upper levels. A sub-vortex aside from the TC center encompassing the wavenumber-1 warm center appears, and asymmetric horizontal winds emerge, which, in turn, changes the storm-scale (within 400 km) VWS. Deep convection in the inner core closely follows the changing storm-scale VWS when its magnitude is larger than 2 m s –1 and is located downshear of the storm-scale VWS in all the experiments with environmental flow. In the outer rainbands, the maximum boundary layer convergence is mainly controlled by the direction of motion and is located in the rear-right quadrant. These results extend upon the findings of previous studies in three aspects: (1) The discovery of the roughly linear combination effect from the uniform flow and large-scale VWS; (2) The development of upper-level asymmetric winds on a 1000-km scale through the interaction between the TC vortex and environmental flow, resulting in changes in the storm-scale VWS pattern within the TC area; (3) The revelation that TC asymmetric convection closely aligns with the direction-varying storm-scale VWS instead of the initially designated VWS.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In August 2018, a remarkable polynya was observed off the north coast of Greenland, a perennial ice zone where thick sea ice cover persists. In order to investigate the formation process of this polynya, satellite observations, a coupled ice-ocean model, ocean profiling data, and atmosphere reanalysis data were applied. We found that the thinnest sea ice cover in August since 1978 (mean value of 1.1 m, compared to the average value of 2.8 m during 1978−2017) and the modest southerly wind caused by a positive North Atlantic Oscillation (mean value of 0.82, compared to the climatological value of −0.02) were responsible for the formation and maintenance of this polynya. The opening mechanism of this polynya differs from the one formed in February 2018 in the same area caused by persistent anomalously high wind. Sea ice drift patterns have become more responsive to the atmospheric forcing due to thinning of sea ice cover in this region.",
