    "abstract": "Microvesicles (MVs) are released by different cell types and may remain in the extracellular space in proximity of the cell of origin or may enter the biological fluids. MVs released by tumor cells are detectable in patients with cancer and their number in the circulation correlates with poor prognosis. Recent studies demonstrated that MVs may act as mediator of cell-to-cell communication thus ensuring short- and long-range exchange of information. Due to their pleyotropic effects, MVs may play a role in the prothrombotic state associated with cancer as well as in cancer development and progression. It has been recently shown that MVs may induce epigenetic changes in target cells by transferring genetic information. This finding suggests that tumor and stromal cells may talk each other via MVs to establish a favorable tumor niche and to promote tumor growth, invasiveness and progression. Moreover, MVs contain genetic material under the form of mRNA and microRNA, that may allow an easy screening for cancer genetic markers and offer new diagnostic and prognostic information. This review presents an overview of the many biological actions of MVs and of the potential role of MV-mediated exchange of genetic information among cells in tumor biology.",

    "abstract": "Clinical endpoints are essential for assessing the safety and efficacy of new cancer therapies. They are used by oncologists to help guide clinical decision making. While overall survival (OS) has frequently been regarded as the gold standard primary clinical endpoint, it's utility is constrained by several disadvantages. The time-consuming nature of trials using OS has led to a recent push to explore surrogate clinical endpoints and their potential to serve as primary clinical endpoints in lieu of OS. Additionally, it is becoming evident that other endpoints add valuable information about quality of life and treatment failure as their use is becoming increasingly prevalent in oncology clinical trials. Without a doubt, the use of clinical endpoints will continue to expand and evolve as new cancer therapies are developed and novel treatments, including immunotherapy, draw interest. This review explores the roles of primary and surrogate clinical endpoints as well as the benefits and drawbacks of each specific endpoint. In addition, it directly compares the unique features of each suggesting some of the specific uses each one fulfills.",

    "abstract": "Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and PARP-2 belong to a family of enzymes that, using NAD+ as a substrate, catalyze poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of proteins. PARP-1 and PARP-2 catalytic activity is stimulated by DNA-strand breaks targeting mainly proteins involved in chromatin structure and DNA metabolism, providing strong support for a dual role of both PARP-1 and PARP-2 in the DNA damage response as DNA damage sensors and signal transducers to downstream effectors. The DNA damage response has important consequences for genomic stability and tumour development. In order to manipulate DNA damage responses to selectively induce tumour cell death, a considerable effort is centred on defining the molecular mechanisms that allow cells to detect, respond to, and repair DNA damage. PARP inhibitors that compete with NAD+ at the highly conserved enzyme active site are arisen as new potential therapeutic strategies as chemo- and radiopotentiation and for the treatment of cancers with specific DNA repair defects as single-agent therapies. In the present review, we highlight emerging information about the redundant and specific functions of PARP-1 and PARP-2 in genome surveillance and DNA repair pathways. Understanding these roles might provide invaluable clues to design new cancer therapeutic approaches. In addition, we provide an overview of ongoing clinical trials with PARP inhibitors and the value of PARP-1 and PARP-2 expression as prognostic biomarkers in cancer.",

Incidentally detected tumors in asymptomatic individuals have been steadily increasing owing to the increased usage of various imaging technologies. Currently there are no recommendations for screening to detect and make an early diagnosis of renal cancer. But in recent years, the discovery of new molecular and cytogenetic markers has led to the recognition and classification of several novel subtypes of RCC, and the introduction of molecular-targeted therapy for advanced-stage RCC.

    "abstract": "The Hippo signaling pathway regulates cell fate and organ development. In the Hippo pathway, transcriptional enhanced associate domain (TEAD) which is a transcription factor is activated by forming a complex with yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) or transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ, also called WWTR1). Hyper-activation of YAP1/TAZ, leading to the activation of TEAD, has been reported in many cancers, including malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM). Therefore, the YAP1/TAZ-TEAD complex is considered a novel therapeutic target for cancer treatment. However, few reports have described YAP1/TAZ-TEAD inhibitors, and their efficacy and selectivity are poor. In this study, we performed a high-throughput screening of a neurofibromin 2 (NF2)-deficient MPM cell line and a large tumor suppressor kinase 1/2 (LATS1/2)-deficient non-small-cell lung cancer cell line using a transcriptional reporter assay. After screening and optimization, K-975 was successfully identified as a potent inhibitor of YAP1/TAZ-TEAD signaling. X-ray crystallography revealed that K-975 was covalently bound to an internal cysteine residue located in the palmitate-binding pocket of TEAD. K-975 had a strong inhibitory effect against protein-protein interactions between YAP1/TAZ and TEAD in cell-free and cell-based assays. Furthermore, K-975 potently inhibited the proliferation of NF2-non-expressing MPM cell lines compared with NF2-expressing MPM cell lines. K-975 also suppressed tumor growth and provided significant survival benefit in MPM xenograft models. These findings indicate that K-975 is a strong and selective TEAD inhibitor with the potential to become an effective drug candidate for MPM therapy.",

    "abstract": "Currently, the majority of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) present with locally invasive and/or metastatic disease, resulting in five-year survival of less than 5%. The development of an early diagnostic test is, therefore, expected to significantly impact the patient's prognosis. In this study, we successfully evaluated the feasibility of identifying diagnostic cell free microRNAs (miRNAs) for early stage PDAC, through the analysis of urine samples. Using Affymetrix microarrays, we established a global miRNA profile of 13 PDAC, six chronic pancreatitis (CP), and seven healthy (H) urine specimens. Selected differentially expressed miRNAs were subsequently investigated using an independent technique (RT-PCR) on 101 urine samples including 46 PDAC, 29 CP and 26 H. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and logistic regression analyses were applied to determine the discriminatory potential of the candidate miRNA biomarkers. Three miRNAs (miR-143, miR-223, and miR-30e) were significantly over-expressed in patients with Stage I cancer when compared with age-matched healthy individuals (P=0.022, 0.035 and 0.04, respectively); miR-143, miR-223 and miR-204 were also shown to be expressed at higher levels in Stage I compared to Stages II-IV PDAC (P=0.025, 0.013 and 0.008, respectively). Furthermore, miR-223 and miR-204 were able to distinguish patients with early stage cancer from patients with CP (P=0.037 and 0.036). Among the three biomarkers, miR-143 was best able to differentiate Stage I (n=6) from healthy (n=26) with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.862 (95% CI 0.695-1.000), with sensitivity (SN) of 83.3% (95% CI 50.0-100.0), and specificity (SP) of 88.5% (95% CI 73.1-100.0). The combination of miR-143 with miR-30e was significantly better at discriminating between these two groups, achieving an AUC of 0.923 (95% CI 0.793-1.000), with SN of 83.3% (95% CI 50.0-100.0) and SP of 96.2% (95% CI 88.5-100.0). In this feasibility study, we demonstrate for the first time the utility of miRNA biomarkers for non-invasive, early detection of PDAC in urine specimens.",

Besides its role in tumor biology, TMPRSS2 is also a key player in cellular entry by the SARS-CoV viruses. The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in huge losses in socio-economy, culture, and human lives for which safe and effective cures are highly demanded. The main protease (Mpro/3CLpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is a critical enzyme for viral propagation in host cells and, like TMPRSS2, has been exploited for treatment of the infectious disease. Numerous natural compounds abundant in common fruits have been suggested with anti-coronavirus infection in the previous outbreaks of SARS-CoV. Here we show that screening of these compounds identified tannic acid a potent inhibitor of both SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and TMPRSS2. Molecular analysis demonstrated that tannic acid formed a thermodynamically stable complex with the two proteins at a KD of 1.1 mM for Mpro and 1.77 mM for TMPRSS2. Tannic acid inhibited the activities of the two proteases with an IC50 of 13.4 mM for Mpro and 2.31 mM for TMPRSS2. Mpro protein. Consistently, functional assays using the virus particles pseudotyped (Vpp) of SARS-CoV2-S demonstrated that tannic acid suppressed viral entry into cells. Thus, our results demonstrate that tannic acid has high potential of developing anti-COVID-19 therapeutics as a potent dual inhibitor of two independent enzymes essential for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Quercetin (Que), a natural substance, demonstrates promising anticancer action. However, further information is required to fully comprehend the function and mechanism of Que in pyroptosis in colon cancer. This study revealed the underlying mechanism of Que-induced pyroptosis in colon cancer in vitro and in vivo. Que inhibited colon cancer cell growth through gasdermin D (GSDMD)-mediated pyroptosis. Depletion of GSDMD, rather than gasdermin E (GSDME), reversed the cytotoxic effects of Que on colon cancer cells. Que treatment upregulated NIMA-related kinase 7 (NEK7) protein expression, thus facilitating the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome and cleavage of GSDMD. NEK7 silencing resulted in colon cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, NEK7 depression restrained the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome-GSDMD pathway, thus attenuating pyroptosis triggered by Que in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, lower NEK7 and NLRP3 expression levels indicated colon cancer progression. Our results unveiled a novel pattern of anti-colon cancer activity of Que, and activation of NEK7-mediated pyroptosis is potentially a promising therapeutic target for colon cancer, which provides novel experimental proof for the clinical application of Que.",

The paper synthesized current research on amino acid metabolism in the colorectal cancer tumor microenvironment, focusing on amino acids such as tryptophan, methionine, glutamine, and arginine. It examined their impact on tumor growth, immune evasion, and patient prognosis, as well as the metabolic reprogramming of tumor cells and complex tumor microenvironment interactions. Aberrant amino acid metabolism was a hallmark of colorectal cancer, influencing tumor proliferation, survival, and invasiveness. Key findings included: Tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine and serotonin pathways significantly affected immune response and tumor progression in CRC. Methionine influenced T cell function and DNA methylation, playing a critical role in tumor development. Glutamine was extensively used by tumor cells for energy metabolism and supported immune cell function. Arginine metabolism impacted CD8+ T cell functionality and tumor growth. The review also discussed the dual roles of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment and the potential of targeting amino acid metabolic pathways for CRC treatment. In conclusion, amino acid metabolism significantly impacts the colorectal cancer tumor microenvironment and immunity. Understanding these metabolic pathways provides valuable insights into CRC pathogenesis and identifies potential therapeutic targets. Future research should focus on developing treatments that disrupt these metabolic processes to improve patient outcomes in CRC.",

Studies have revealed that dysbiosis in both the gut and breast tissue microbiota is strongly associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer. Distinct microbial profiles have been identified among healthy individuals, patients with benign breast conditions, and those with malignant tumors, with further variations observed across different ethnic groups and breast cancer subtypes. The complex interplay between breast cancer risk factors and microbial populations, coupled with the direct impact of microbial communities and their metabolites on inflammatory pathways and immune responses, underscores the importance of this field. Additionally, the interaction between gut microbiota and therapeutic modalities such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy is of particular interest, as these interactions can significantly influence treatment outcomes, either enhancing or diminishing efficacy. This review explores the effects of the Mediterranean diet, probiotics, prebiotics, and natural medicinal products on gut microbiota, emphasizing their potential as innovative therapeutic strategies. Notably, the use of engineered probiotics within the tumor microenvironment represents a promising frontier in breast cancer treatment.

We demonstrated that miR-338-3p was significantly decreased in NSCLC tissues and cell lines, and negatively correlated with advanced and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and lymph node metastasis (both P<0.01). Transient overexpression of miR-338-3p by transfecting with miR-338-3p mimic significantly suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, invasion and induced apoptosis and cell cycle at G1 phase.

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is characterized by poor outcome and shows limited drug-response in clinical trials. Tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) exerts a strong selection pressure on HCC, leading to HCC evolvement and recurrence after multiple therapies. T cell-mediated immunoreaction during cancer surveillance and clearance is central in cancer immunity. Heterogenous T cell subsets play multiple roles in HCC development and progression. The re-educated T cells in TIME usually lead to deteriorated T cell response and tumor progression. Investigation into immune system dysregulation during HCC development will shed light on how to turn immune suppressive state to immune activation and induce more efficient immune response. Emerging T cell-based treatment such as cancer vaccines, CAR-T cell therapy, adoptive cell therapy, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), have been proved to cause tumor regression in some clinical and preclinical trials. In this review, we focused on recent studies that explored T cells involved in HCC and how they affect the course of disease. We also briefly outlined current T cell-based immunotherapies in HCC.",

    "abstract": "Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are the gatekeeper cells in the liver, contributing critical roles in liver physiological and pathological changes. Factors such as dietary macronutrients, toxins, and aging impact LSEC fenestration. Defenestration of LSECs changes their phenotype and function. Under liver injury, capillarized LSECs promote hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation and fibrogenesis, while decapillarized LSECs protect the activation of HSCs and liver injury. The expression of chemokines, such as CXCL9 and CXCL16, changes and impacts the infiltration of immune cells in the liver during disease progression, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As the largest solid organ, liver is one of the most favorable organs into where tumor cells metastasize. The increased interaction and adhesion of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) with LSECs in the local microenvironment and LSEC-induced tolerance of immunity promote cancer liver metastasis. Several strategies can be applied to target LSEC to modulate their function to prevent cancer liver metastasis, including gut microbiota modulation, microRNA therapy, and medical treatment. Delivery of different treatment agents with nanoparticles may promote precise target treatment. Overall, targeting LSECs is a potential strategy for treatment of early liver diseases and prevention of cancer liver metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells must maintain metabolic homeostasis under a wide range of conditions and meet their own energy needs in order to survive and reproduce. In addition to glycolysis, cancer cells can also perform various metabolic strategies, such as fatty acid oxidation (FAO). It has been found that the proliferation, survival, drug resistance and metastasis of cancer cells depend on FAO. The carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT), including CPT1 and CPT2, located on the mitochondrial membrane, are important mediators of FAO. In recent years, many researchers have found that CPT has a close relationship with the metabolic development of tumor cells, not only provides energy for cancer cells development and metastasis by promoting FAO but also affects the occurrence and invasion through other signal pathways or cytokines or microRNA. This review summarized the role of CPTs in several kinds of tumors and the developed targeted inhibitors of CPTs, as well as the potential gene therapy and immunotherapy of CPTs, hoping to better explore the mechanism and role of CPTs in the future and providing useful ideas for clinical treatment.",

These upgraded SADs integrate specific features designed to enhance positive-pressure ventilation and mitigate the risk of aspiration. Nowadays, they are extensively used in general anesthesia procedures and play a critical role in difficult airway management, pre-hospital care, and emergency medicine.

    "abstract": "Exploring novel early detection biomarkers and developing more efficacious treatments remain pressing tasks in the current research landscape for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Morphologically and molecularly separate from apoptosis, cell death, and autophagy, ferroptosis is a recently discovered, unique, controlled form of cell death. SLC7A11 (also known as xCT) represents a subunit of the cystine-glutamate antiporter (also known as system Xc(-)). A growing body of research suggests that induction of ferroptosis through SLC7A11 can effectively eliminate hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, particularly those exhibiting resistance to alternative forms of cell death. Thus, targeting ferroptosis via SLC7A11 may become a new direction for the design of therapeutic strategies for HCC. Although many research articles have investigated the possible roles of SLC7A11 in HCC, a study that summarizes the main findings, including the regulators and mechanisms of action of SLC7A11 in HCC is not available. Therefore, we present a comprehensive overview of the functions of ferroptosis, particularly SLC7A11, in the identification, development, and management of HCC in this review. In addition, we discuss how this knowledge can be translated into treatment by providing a systemic therapy in advanced HCC using sorafenib, the first-line drug targeting multiple kinases and SLC7A11. We further dissect the possible barriers as well as the corresponding solutions and provide insights on how to navigate effective treatment using this knowledge.",

Our findings indicate that high expression of TGM2 in LUSC was associated with a poorer prognosis. Additionally, we found that high expression of TGM2 is closely related to tumor-promoting inflammation and may increase sensitivity to immunotherapy. We further confirmed the cancer-promoting effect of TGM2 in LUSC through in vitro overexpression and knockdown experiments and showed that TGM2 primarily affects cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion.

    "abstract": "Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a pivotal enzyme responsible for catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). This enzyme serves as a crucial regulator in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), acting as a rate-limiting step. Its role extends beyond mere metabolic function, influencing cellular homeostasis and overall cell function. In the past decade, prominent research in cancer genetics has revealed that genes responsible for encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase are commonly mutated across various human malignancies. Significant research in the field has shown that these mutations are commonly found in diseases like glioma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), chondrosarcoma, and thyroid cancer (TC). As research on IDH progresses, deeper insights into the biological effects of IDH mutations have been gained, unveiling their potential role in tumorigenesis. In addition, IDH mutants' unique activities creates new pathways in tumor metabolism, gene rearrangement, and therapeutic resistance. Currently, innovative molecular targeting strategies for genes bearing mutations in IDH have been devised to enhance the therapeutic efficacy against cancers harboring IDH mutations. These methods represent a promising avenue for improving treatment outcomes in IDH-mutated malignancies. This article mainly summarizes the related research on glioma caused by IDH mutation, and focuses on the biological characteristics and transformation of IDH.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether radiomics and/or semantic features could improve the detection accuracy of RAS/BRAF gene mutation status in patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM). In this retrospective study, 159 patients who had been diagnosed with CRLM in two hospitals were enrolled. All patients received lung and abdominal contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) scans prior to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Semantic features were independently assessed by two radiologists. Radiomics features were extracted from the portal venous phase (PVP) of the CT scan for each patient. Seven machine learning algorithms were used to establish three scores based on the semantic, radiomics and the combination of both features. Two semantic and 851 radiomics features were used to predict the mutation status of RAS and BRAF using an artificial neural network method (ANN). This approach performed best out of the seven tested algorithms. We constructed three scores which were based on radiomics, semantic features and the combined scores. The combined score could distinguish between wild-type and mutant patients with an AUC of 0.95 in the primary cohort and 0.79 in the validation cohort. This study proved that the application of radiomics together with semantic features can improve non-invasive assessment of the gene mutation status of RAS (KRAS and NRAS) and BRAF in CRLM.",

Cinobufagin, a natural product extracted from toad venom and a major active ingredient in cinobufotalin, exhibits high antitumor activity. Here, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities of cinobufagin and explored the underlying mechanisms in CRC. Cinobufagin could inhibit proliferation, migration, invasion and promote apoptosis of HCT116, RKO, and SW480 cells in vitro. Mechanistically, cinobufagin simultaneously suppressed the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and blocked the interleukin-6 (IL6)-induced nuclear translocation of STAT3. IL6 activated the STAT3 pathway, subsequently inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, cinobufagin suppressed EMT in CRC by inhibiting the STAT3 pathway. Animal experiments clearly showed that cinobufagin could reduce tumor growth. Cinobufagin may be used clinically as a novel STAT3 inhibitor for CRC adjuvant therapy.",

Currently, various FGFR inhibitors are being developed. In order to optimize their clinical applications, understanding the frequencies and types of FGFR alterations in multiple cancer types appears to be extremely important. This study characterized FGFR1-4 alterations in solid tumors by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Between Jun. 2019 and Aug. 2020, the sequencing data of 5 557 solid tumors of diverse types in the database of Simcere Diagnostics, Inc. (Nanjing, China) were retrospectively analyzed. A panel-based NGS assay was used to detect FGFR1-4 alterations in tumor samples. 9.2% of cancer cases had FGFR1-4 alterations, in which gene amplifications (51.5%) and mutations (40.7%) were frequent, whereas gene rearrangements were less common (10.0%). FGFR1 was involved in 4.6% of 5 557 cases, FGFR2 in 2.1%, FGFR3 in 1.6%, and FGFR4 in 1.4%. Of patients with FGFR1-4 alterations, TP53, MUC16, NSD3, MYC and LRP1B genes were the top 5 mutant genes. FGFR1-4 aberrations occurred in almost every type of solid tumors, with the most common tumor being endometrial carcinoma (22.2%), followed by sarcoma (17.3%), breast cancer (13.2%), gastric cancer (12.2%), and more. 0.6% of cancer cases harbored FGFR1-4 fusions, with the most common fusion partner being TACC3. Two cases of GBM harboring FGFR3-TACC3 fusions were responsive to anlotinib treatment. In conclusion, FGFR1-4 alterations are prevalent in solid tumors of diverse types, with the majority being gene amplifications and mutations. FGFR1-4 fusions only occur in a minority of cancer cases, and those with glioblastoma harboring FGFR3-TACC3 fusions may benefit from anlotinib.",

Using an in silico translational approach, we hypothesize that a combination of these CSC markers has prognostic value in a large cohort of patients with colorectal cancer. Clinicopathologic and RNA expression data from a total of 594 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients from TCGA were analyzed. The expression of CD133, CD24, and CD44 was individually defined as high or low based on the median expression. Disease specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS) were not associated with tumors that are CD133-high or CD44-high alone. Patients with CD24-high tumors have significantly better DSS (P<0.001) and OS (P = 0.043). CD24-high, CD44-high and CD133-high tumors were associated with significantly greater EGFR, KRAS and Ki67 expression (all P<0.001). CD133, CD24 and CD44-high tumors were independently enriched for conventional stemness-related signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin and Hedgehog signaling pathways. There was no survival difference linked to CD133-high/CD44-low patients, but CD44-high/CD24-low patients have worse DSS (P = 0.005) compared with CD44-low/CD24-high patients. CD133-high/CD24-low tumors show significant negative enrichment of MYC targets, E2F targets, G2M checkpoint and mitotic spindle gene sets, suggesting less cell proliferation in these tumors. Patients with CD133-high/CD24-low tumors have worse DSS (P = 0.004) and OS (P = 0.044), and are more likely to have early and late recurrences.

Additionally, HIF can bypass VEGF/VEGFR and activate downstream signaling factors to promote tumor development.

However, factors that regulate chemoresistance in CRC cells are largely unknown. To identify proteins involved in MDR in CRC, we used proteomics and transcriptomics approaches to analyze HCT8/T cells and parental HCT8 cells. Results showed that the expression of insulin-like growth factor-2 mRNA-binding protein 3 (IGF2BP3) was upregulated in HCT8/T cells, and siIGF2BP3 remarkably elevated the sensitivity of HCT8/T cells to DOX. Overexpression of IGF2BP3 promoted ABCB1 expression, and reduced the sensitivity to ABCB1 substrates. Conversely, knockdown of IGF2BP3 reduced ABCB1 expression, and increased the sensitivity to ABCB1 substrates in vitro and in vivo. This phenomeon was further confirmed by the strong association of IGF2BP3 and ABCB1 expression with DOX sensitivity. Mechanistically, IGF2BP3, as a N6-methyladenosine (m6A) reader, directly bound to the m6A-modified region of ABCB1 mRNA, thereby promoting the stability and expression of ABCB1 mRNA. Overall, the results showed that IGF2BP3 bound to the m6A modification region of ABCB1 mRNA, and conferred chemoresistance in CRC cells via upregulation of ABCB1. These findings suggest that IGF2BP3 might be a potential biomarker for predicting the development of MDR in CRC. Targeting IGF2BP3 might be an important chemotherapeutic strategy for preventing MDR development in CRC.",

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins is known to be involved in various biological processes, whereas its role in the regulation of radiosensitivity remains largely unknown. In this study, we characterized NONO, an RNA/DNA binding protein with LLPS capacity, as an essential regulator of tumor radioresistance. In vitro assay showed that NONO involved in DNA repair via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) manner. NONO knockout significantly reduced DNA damage repair and sensitized tumor cells to irradiation in vitro and in vivo. NONO overexpression was correlated with an inferior survival outcome in cancer patients. Mechanically, NONO was associated with nuclear EGFR (nEGFR). Both irradiation and EGF treatment induced nEGFR accumulation, thereby increased the association between NONO and nEGFR. However, NONO was not a substrate of EGFR kinase. Furthermore, NONO promoted DNA damage-induced DNA-PK phosphorylation at T2609 by enhancing the interaction between EGFR and DNA-PK. Importantly, NONO protein formed high concentration LLPS droplets in vitro, and recruited EGFR and DNA-PK. Disruption of NONO droplets with LLPS inhibitor significantly reduced the interaction between EGFR and DNA-PK, and suppressed DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of T2609-DNA-PK. Taken together, LLPS of NONO recruits nuclear EGFR and DNA-PK and enhances their interaction, further increases DNA damage-activated pT2609-DNA-PK and promotes NHEJ-mediated DNA repair, finally leads to tumor radioresistance. NONO phase separation-mediated radioresistance may serve as a novel molecular target to sensitize tumor cell to radiotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) accounts for 75% of the total incidence of renal cancer, and every year the number of morbidity and mortality increases, posing a serious threat to public health. The current main treatment methods for kidney cancer include drug-targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Although there are many treatment options for kidney cancer, they all have limitations, including drug resistance, unsatisfied long-term benefits, and adverse effects. Therefore, it is crucial to identify more effective therapeutic targets. As a newly discovered mechanism of cell death, copper-induced cell death (cuprotosis) is closely related to changes in cell metabolism, particularly in copper metabolism. Current studies have shown that the key signaling pathway of cuprotosis, the FDX1 (Ferredoxin 1)-LIAS (Lipoic Acid Synthetase) axis, plays an important role in the regulation of cellular oxidative stress, which can directly affect cell survival via inducing or promoting cancer cell death. Therefore, we speculated that this regulatory cell death mechanism might serve as a potential therapeutic target for the clinical treatment of renal cancer. To test this, we first performed a pan-cancer analysis based on cuprotosis-related genomic and transcriptomic levels to reveal the expression of cuprotosis in cancer. Next, GSVA-clustering analysis was performed with data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, and the cohort was divided into three clusters according to the gene enrichment levels of cuprotosis marker genes. In addition, we analyzed the potential of using cuprotosis in clinical treatment from multiple perspectives, including chemotherapeutic drug susceptibility test, immune target inhibition treatment responsiveness, and histone modification. Combining the results of multi-omics analysis, we focused on the feasibility of this novel regulatory cell death mechanism in ccRCC treatment and further constructed a prognostic model. Finally, we verified our results by integrating the patient's gene expression information and radiomics information. Our study provides new insights into the development and clinical application of targeting cuprotosis pathway.",

    "abstract": "Sorafenib, FDA-approved therapy for patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), leads to limited improvement in overall survival. However, it may indirectly impact the expansion and activity of natural killer (NK) cells. While NK cell-based immunotherapies generally exhibit favorable safety profiles, their effectiveness in controlling solid tumor growth is constrained, primarily due to the absence of antigen specificity and suboptimal expansion and persistence within the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we postulated that enhancing NK cell functionality via cytokine activation could bolster their viability and cytotoxic capabilities, leading to an improved therapeutic response when combined with sorafenib. Memory-like (ML)-NK cells were generated through the supplementation of optimal concentrations of interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-18 cytokines. Following a single day of treatment, cytotoxicity against rat and human HCC cells was evaluated via flow cytometry analysis. A rat HCC model was developed in 30 animals via subcapsular implantation and assigned to control, NK, sorafenib, ML-NK, and combination groups. Sorafenib was administered orally, and NK cells were delivered via the intrahepatic artery. Tumor growth was measured one week after treatment evaluation. Therapeutic efficacy during in-vitro and in-vivo analysis was investigated through a one-way ANOVA test, followed by pairwise two-tailed Student t-tests, considering P < 0.05 statistically significant. The in-vitro experiment results demonstrated that sorafenib and conventional NK cell therapies induced more substantial cell death than the control group (P < 0.01). ML NK cells significantly improved cell death compared to conventional NK cell immunotherapy. Furthermore, sorafenib in combination with ML-NK cells significantly decreased the viability of HCC cells (P < 0.05) compared to sorafenib plus conventional NK cell combination therapy. In vivo experiments have shown that sorafenib and ML-NK cell immunotherapy reduced the growth rate of HCC tumors compared to conventional NK immunotherapy and control groups. Notably, a combination of sorafenib and ML-NK cell immunochemotherapy resulted in the most significant suppression of tumor growth when compared to other therapies. In conclusion, our experimental findings demonstrate that the concurrent administration of sorafenib and ML-NK immunotherapy enhances cytotoxicity against HCC by optimizing the therapeutic response through cytokine activation, resulting in a significant decrease in tumor growth.",

As a small subfamily of DUBs, the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs) subfamily only contains four members including UCHL1, UCHL3, UCHL5, and BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1). Despite sharing the deubiquitinase activity with a similar catalysis mechanism, the UCHs exhibit distinctive biological functions which are mainly determined by their specific subcellular localization and partner substrates. Besides, growing evidence indicates that the UCH enzymes are involved in human malignancies. In this review, the structural information and biological functions of the UCHs are briefly described. Meanwhile, the roles of these enzymes in tumorigenesis and the discovered inhibitors against them are also summarized to give an insight into the cancer therapy with the potential alternative strategy.",

The heterogeneity of breast cancer complicates both treatment and diagnosis. Traditional methods based on histopathology and hormone receptor status are now no longer sufficient. Recently, advances in multi-omics techniques, including genomic, proteomic, and transcriptomic analyses, have deepened our understanding of breast cancer. Combining these approaches allows for precise molecular subtyping, which is essential for the detection of key mutations, protein interactions and gene expression patterns that are highly relevant to different therapeutic strategies. Genomic analyses have been effectively identifying key mutations in cancer. Meanwhile, proteomics and transcriptomics complement by identifying new therapeutic targets and elucidating gene expression dynamics. Integrating multi-omics and conventional diagnostics improves tumour characterisation and enables prognostic accuracy comparable to established standards and treatment response. Existing and emerging technologies enable real-time enhanced tumour follow-up and data analysis through liquid biopsy and artificial intelligence, respectively. Despite these clinical implementation challenges, multi-omics including clinical phenotyping offers significant potential for precision breast cancer treatment.

    "abstract": "Tumor metastasis is the leading cause of death in cancer patients. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is abundantly expressed in various malignant tumors and plays a crucial role in cell adhesion, metastasis, proliferation, and differentiation. This study investigated the effects of hinokitiol, a natural tropolone compound known for its antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial properties, on tumor growth and metastasis. Specifically, the study focused on the expression of EpCAM in mouse tumor cells treated with hinokitiol. Hinokitiol was administered to mouse melanoma cells (B16F10) and mouse colorectal carcinoma cells (CT26), resulting in a significant decrease in EpCAM expression. Additionally, the protein levels involved in the protein kinase-B/mammalian target of rapamycin (AKT/mTOR) signaling pathway were reduced following hinokitiol treatment. Using wound healing and Transwell assays, the study demonstrated that hinokitiol effectively inhibits cancer cell migration. In vivo experiments were conducted using mice, which were injected intravenously with B16F10 or CT26 cells to induce tumor metastasis. The tumor cells were either treated with hinokitiol or left untreated. The results showed that tumor cells treated with hinokitiol exhibited significantly reduced tumor size and weight in the lungs, as well as prolonged survival, compared to untreated tumor cells. This study concludes that hinokitiol inhibits tumor migration by downregulating EpCAM via the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway and exhibits positive effects in vivo.",

Understanding the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) versus adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) in this specific population is critical for optimizing treatment strategies and improving prognoses. This research was conducted to compare the prognoses of young women (≤35 years old) with early-stage hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer, who were treated with NAC versus those treated with AC. This study retrospectively analyzed data from young women with HR+/HER2- breast cancer, with complete follow-up information, sourced from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2010-2018) and the Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital (TJMUCH) (2014-2018). Patients from both cohorts were allocated to NAC and AC groups based on their treatment regimens. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square, whereas the Kaplan-Meier method was utilized to generate survival curves; additionally, the log-rank test was employed for survival analysis. Propensity score matching (PSM) was employed to control baseline differences. Analysis of the SEER and TJMUCH cohorts revealed that patients treated with NAC had significantly worse overall survival (OS) compared to those treated with AC, as indicated by Kaplan-Meier curves both before and after PSM. The disease-free survival analysis of the TJMUCH cohort yielded similar results, indicating that patients treated with AC experienced longer periods without disease recurrence compared to their counterparts receiving NAC. Statistically significant differences were observed across both survival metrics, reinforcing the robustness of our findings. Overall, among young women (≤35 years old) with early-stage HR+/HER2- breast cancer, patients treated with AC exhibited a more favorable prognosis and improved survival outcomes compared to those treated with NAC. These findings could potentially influence clinical decision-making and treatment guidelines, advocating for a more tailored approach in managing young women with HR+/HER2- breast cancer.",

Recent studies have highlighted the critical role of RNA modifications, particularly N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, in cancer progression. This study aimed to investigate the role of ALKBH1, a m6A demethylase, in the proliferation and metastasis of OS through the regulation of TRAF1. Our findings showed that lower ALKBH1 expression correlates with poorer overall survival in OS patients. Knockdown of ALKBH1 significantly enhanced the proliferation, migration, and clonogenicity of OS cell lines (MG63 and HOS cells), while overexpression had the opposite effects. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that ALKBH1 regulates the expression of key oncogenes, including TRAF1, through m6A methylation. m6A-RIP and qPCR assays further confirmed that overexpression of ALKBH1 significantly decreased the m6A methylation and expression of TRAF1 in both MG63 and HOS cells, and ALKBH1 knockdown had the opposite roles. Combined knockdown of ALKBH1 and TRAF1 further reduced the oncogenic properties of osteosarcoma cells compared to individual knockdown for ALKBH1. In conclusion, ALKBH1 silence promotes osteosarcoma proliferation and metastasis by regulating TRAF1 expression through m6A methylation. Targeting the ALKBH1-TRAF1 axis may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma.",

A total of 283 HCC cases from Hunan Provincial People's Hospital were included in the analysis, with 45 additional patients as external validation. The relationship between these indices and patient prognosis was further evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the predictive performance of these indices for overall survival (OS) and to determine the optimal cutoff values. ROC curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) for PNI, FAR, and NLR was 0.723, 0.857, and 0.872, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified hepatitis history, intraoperative blood transfusion, FAR, NLR, and PNI as independent prognostic factors (all P<0.05). The resulting prediction model demonstrated strong performance in both the training (C-index =0.917) and external validation (C-index =0.853) cohorts, with AUCs of 0.889 and 0.931 for 6-month and 1-year prediction in the validation set, respectively. These findings suggest that preoperative levels of peripheral blood PNI, FAR, and NLR are closely associated with the surgical prognosis of HCC patients. The prognostic prediction model developed based on these indices exhibits good predictive efficacy.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the development and evaluation of machine learning models, particularly the Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm, for predicting lymph node metastasis (LNM) in cervical cancer (CC) patients. The findings show that AdaBoost outperformed traditional statistical methods and other machine learning models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, in predicting LNM. The areas under the curve (AUCs) for the training and validation sets were 0.882 and 0.857, respectively, indicating high prediction efficiency. Multivariate logistic regression identified key independent risk factors for LNM, including FIGO staging, squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag), white blood cell count (WBC), neutrophil count (NEUT), hemoglobin (HGB) level, and prealbumin (PAB) level. These factors are significant in predicting LNM and emphasize their importance in clinical decision-making. AdaBoost's ability to predict LNM preoperatively, without invasive procedures such as lymph node dissection, can reduce treatment risks and improve patient outcomes. While other models, such as XGBoost, showed a marginally higher AUC in training, AdaBoost's performance in validation was comparable (P=0.18). Inflammatory and nutritional markers, such as WBC, NEUT, HGB, and PAB, were significant predictors and provide valuable insights into tumor progression. Despite the study's retrospective nature, the integration of larger, multi-center datasets, and multi-modal imaging could further enhance the model's accuracy and generalizability. This high-performance AdaBoost model offers clinical potential for refining personalized treatment strategies for CC patients.",

ONC201 provides clinical benefit in a subset of patients with histone H3K27M-mutated diffuse glioma (DG). We hypothesized that EZH2 inhibitors (EZH2i) may sensitize tumors to imipridones by mimicking H3K27M mutation. EZH1 is a homolog and alternative for EZH2 in assembling PRC2 complex. We combined ONC201, ONC206 or ONC212 plus dual EZH1/2i in tumors and observed synergy. We observed synergies with imipridones combined with HDACi or triple combination of ONC201/ONC206, EZH2i and HDACi in DG, GBM, prostate cancer and SCLC cells. Our observations implicate EZH1/2 suppression in mechanism of anti-cancer effect of imipridones. We investigated effects of imipridones on EZH1/2 in DG cells and solid tumor cells including GBM, CRC, PDAC, SCLC, prostate cancer, gastric cancer, HCC and breast cancer cells and found inhibition of EZH1/EZH2 expression across tumor types and cell viability suppression by imipridones is correlated with EZH1/2 reduction. Imipridone or EZH2i-treated tumor cells showed similar cytokine profile changes. RNA-seq showed ONC201 and EHZ2i tazemetostat-treated cells have similar transcriptional profiles and share overlap of top regulated genes. Thus, imipridones inhibit EZH1/2 in tumor cells in a manner that mimics H3K27M mutation supporting their role in anti-cancer efficacy. ONC201 and EZH2i share similar targets and actions on tumors. Synergistic combinations of imipridones plus EZH1/2i or imipridones, EZH2i and HDACi merit further investigation.",

Ranking as the third most prevalent EGFR mutation type, these ex20ins mutations trail the widely recognized EGFR exon 19 deletion (19-Del) and exon 21 L858R substitution. In advanced-stage NSCLC patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations, conventional treatments such as EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), chemotherapy, and immunotherapies often yield suboptimal responses, resulting in unfavorable clinical outcomes. This unmet clinical need underscores the urgency to explore innovative targeted therapies.

This review examines the latest research on targeted therapies for EGFR ex20ins mutations, dissecting the mechanisms of action of these agents, evaluating the results of relevant clinical trials, and integrating the evidence in a systematic manner.

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the predominant form of primary liver cancer worldwide, continues to pose a substantial health challenge with limited treatment options for advanced stages. Despite progress in therapies such as surgery, transplantation, and targeted treatments, prognosis remains bleak for many patients. The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized the landscape of advanced HCC treatment, offering hope for improved outcomes. However, its efficacy is limited, with a modest response rate of approximately 20% as a single-agent therapy, underscoring the urgent need to decipher mechanisms of immunotherapy resistance. Tumor protein 53 gene (TP53), a pivotal tumor suppressor gene, and Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), a crucial immune checkpoint ligand, play central roles in HCC's evasion of immune responses. Understanding how tumor protein 53 (p53) influences PD-L1 expression and immune system interactions is essential for unraveling the complexities of immunotherapy resistance mechanisms. Elucidating these molecular interactions not only enhances our understanding of HCC's underlying mechanisms but also lays the foundation for developing targeted treatments that may improve outcomes for patients with advanced-stage liver cancer. Ultimately, deciphering the nexus of p53 and PD-L1 in immunotherapy resistance promises to advance treatment strategies and outcomes in the challenging landscape of HCC. This review delves into the intricate relationship between p53 and PD-L1 concerning immunotherapy resistance in HCC, offering insights that could pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing treatment efficacy and overcoming resistance in advanced stages of the disease.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common malignant tumour and a serious global health issue. Glycosylation, a type of posttranslational modification, has been extensively studied in relation to cancer growth and metastasis. Aberrant glycosylation alters how the immune system in the microenvironment perceives the tumour and drives immune suppression through glycan-binding receptors. Interestingly, specific glycan signatures can be regarded as a new pattern of immune checkpoints. Lectins are a group of proteins that exhibit high affinity for glycosylation structures. Lectins and their ligands are found on endothelial cells (ECs), immune cells and tumour cells and play important roles in the tumour microenvironment (TME). In CRC, glycan-lectin interactions can accelerate immune evasion promoting the differentiation of tumour-associated M2 macrophages, altering T cell, dendritic cell (DC), natural killer (NK) cell, and regulatory T (Treg) cell activity to modify the functions of antigen-presenting cells functions. Here, we review our current knowledge on how glycan-lectin interactions affect immune-suppressive circuits in the TME and discuss their roles in the development of more effective immunotherapies for CRC.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer that has progressed to metastatic disease remains largely untreatable. Nearly 90% of patients with advanced prostate cancer develop skeletal metastases, resulting in a substantial reduction in the quality of life and a drastic worsening of patient prognosis. The mechanisms involved in prostate cancer cell dissemination, however, remain poorly understood. We previously reported the identification of a highly tumorigenic E-cadherin positive prostate tumor stem cell subpopulation that expressed the embryonic stem cell markers SOX2 and OCT3/4. We herein demonstrate that this subpopulation is also highly invasive and, importantly, is capable of altering its E-cadherin expression during the process of invasion. The non-tumorigenic E-cadherin negative subpopulation which minimally expresses SOX2 or OCT3/4 was found to be poorly invasive. In addition, targeted knockdown of SOX2 or OCT3/4 markedly suppressed the invasion of prostate cancer cells. Taken together, these findings indicate that the expression of SOX2 or OCT3/4 is required for invasive cell capacity, but the ability to modulate E-cadherin is the key permissive factor enabling cancer stem cell invasion in vitro. We therefore propose a model in which the post-epithelial to mesenchymal transition phenotype progresses to a frank, aggressive, and invasive phenotype by a process requiring the acquisition of E-cadherin plasticity. Considering the clinical significance of the metastatic complications of prostate adenocarcinoma, the identification of factors that promote the dissemination of the malignant prostate phenotype is essential to establish effective therapies to combat this disease in future.",

    "abstract": "Exposure of tumor cells to ionizing radiation (IR) is widely known to induce a number of cellular changes. One way that IR can affect tumor cells is through the development of neoantigens which are new molecules that tumor cells express at the cell membrane following some insult or change to the cell. There have been numerous reports in the literature of changes in both tumor and tumor vasculature cell surface molecule expression following treatment with IR. The usefulness of neoantigens for imaging and therapeutic applications lies in the fact that they are differentially expressed on the surface of irradiated tumor cells to a greater extent than on normal tissues. This differential expression provides a mechanism by which tumor cells can be \"marked\" by radiation for further targeting. Drug delivery vehicles or imaging agents conjugated to ligands that recognize and interact with the neoantigens can help to improve tumor-specific targeting and reduce systemic toxicity with cancer drugs. This article provides a review of the molecules that have been reported to be expressed on the surface of tumor cells in response to IR either in vivo or in vitro. Additionally, we provide a discussion of some of the methods used in the identification of these antigens and applications for their use in drug delivery and imaging.",

PDAC solid tumours are constituted of heterogeneous populations of cells including cancer stem cells (CSCs), differentiated cancer cells, desmoplastic stroma and immune cells. The identification and consequent isolation of pancreatic CSCs facilitated the generation of genetically engineered murine models. Nonetheless, the current models may not be representative for the spontaneous tumour occurrence. In the present study, we show the generation of a novel pancreatic iPSC-converted cancer stem cell lines (CSCcm) as a cutting-edge model for the study of PDAC. The CSCcm lines were achieved only by the influence of pancreatic cancer cell lines conditioned medium and were not subjected to any genetic manipulation. The xenografts tumours from CSCcm lines displayed histopathological features of ADM, PanIN and PDAC lesions. Further molecular characterization from RNA-sequencing analysis highlighted primary culture cell lines (1st CSCcm) as potential candidates to represent the pancreatic CSCs and indicated the establishment of the pancreatic cancer molecular pattern in their subsequent progenies 2nd CSCcm and 3rd CSCcm. In addition, preliminary RNA-seq SNPs analysis showed that the distinct CSCcm lines did not harbour single point mutations for the oncogene Kras codon 12 or 13. Therefore, PDAC-CSCcm model may provide new insights about the actual occurrence of the pancreatic cancer leading to develop different approaches to target CSCs and abrogate the progression of this fatidic disease.",

    "abstract": "Background: Despite overall incidence reduction in colorectal cancer (CRC) the past 32 years, unexplained incidence and mortality rates have increased significantly in younger adults ages 20-49. To improve understanding of sex-specific differences among this population, we aimed to determine the variance in early-onset CRC (EOCRC) survival among US men diagnosed with CRC before age 50, while considering individual- and county-level CRC outcome determinants. Methods: Hotspots (i.e., counties with high EOCRC mortality rates) were derived from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from 1999-2017, and linked to SEER data for men aged 15-49 years with CRC. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare CRC-specific survival probability and hazard in hotspots versus non-significant counties. A generalized R2 was used to estimate the total variance in EOCRC survival explained by clinicodemographic and county-level determinants. Results: We identified 232 hotspot counties for EOCRC-214 (92%) of which were in the South. In hotspots, 1,009 men were diagnosed with EOCRC and 31,438 in non-significant counties. After adjusting for age, race, tumor stage and grade, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and marital status, men residing in hotspot counties had higher hazard of CRC-specific death (HR 1.24, 95% CI, 1.12-1.36). Individual/county-level factors explained nearly 35% of the variation in survival, and adult smoking served as the strongest county-level determinant of EOCRC survival. Conclusion: Distinct geographic patterns of EOCRC were predominantly located in the southern US. Survival after EOCRC diagnosis was significantly worse among men residing in hotspot counties.",

    "abstract": "To grow beyond a size of approximately 1-2 mm3, tumor cells activate many processes to develop blood vasculature. Growing evidences indicate that the formation of the tumor vascular network is very complex, and is not restricted to angiogenesis. Cancer cell-derived tumor vasculatures have been recently described. Among them, endothelial differentiation of tumor cells have been directly related to cancer stem cells, which are cells within a tumor that possess the capacity to self-renew, and to exhibit multipotential heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells. Vasculogenic mimicry has been described to be formed by cancer cells expressing stemness markers. Thus, cancer stem cells have been proposed to contribute to vasculogenic mimicry, though its relation is yet to be clarified. Here, we analyzed the tumor vasculature by using a model of mouse cancer stem cells, miPS-LLCcm cells, which we have previously established from mouse induced pluripotent stem cells and we introduced the DsRed gene in miPS-LLCcm to trace them in vivo. Various features of vasculature were evaluated in ovo, in vitro, and in vivo. The tumors formed in allograft nude mice exhibited angiogenesis in chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. In those tumors, along with penetrated host endothelial vessels, we detected endothelial differentiation from cancer stem cells and formation of vasculogenic mimicry. The angiogenic factors such as VEGF-A and FGF2 were expressed predominantly in the cancer stem cells subpopulation of miPS-LLCcm cells. Our results suggested that cancer stem cells play key roles in not only the recruitment of host endothelial vessels into tumor, but also in maturation of endothelial linage of cancer stem cell's progenies. Furthermore, the undifferentiated subpopulation of the miPS-LLCcm participates directly in the vasculogenic mimicry formation. Collectively, we show that miPS-LLCcm cells have advantages to further study tumor vasculature and to develop novel targeting strategies in the future.",

    "abstract": "The side effects of platinum-based chemotherapy are important factors limiting the survival of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients. Current research suggests that pyroptosis is involved in this process. However, how this mechanism can be used to reduce side effects has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we reported that GSDME was expressed at higher levels in normal tissues than in cancerous tissues in OSCC patients and was the main cause of platinum-based side effects. In an OSCC xenograft model, the inflammatory status and GSDME expression were increased after cisplatin chemotherapy. Cellular experiments showed that higher expression of GSDME was associated with less chemoresistance to cisplatin. A subsequent study demonstrated that cisplatin treatment promotes the maturation of caspase-3, triggers GSDME-mediated pyroptosis and induces cell death. When the amino acid sequence of GSDME cleaved by caspase-3 was mutated, cellular death and pyroptosis induced by cisplatin were significantly inhibited. Moreover, application of vitamin D during cisplatin-based chemotherapy could successfully inhibit GSDME cleavage and pyroptotic cell death in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our study revealed that vitamin D can inhibit caspase-3-mediated GSDME cleavage and thus reduce normal tissue pyroptosis, relieving chemotherapeutic side effects. Inhibition of systemic GSDME during chemotherapy is currently unachievable. Vitamin D supplementation during chemotherapy in OSCC patients might be able to reduce the process described above and benefit patients. However, additional follow-up clinical studies are needed.",

A total of 107 ENKTL patients, including 101 early stage and 6 advanced stage patients were enrolled in our study. ExoPD-L1 and sPD-L1 in the blood were measured by single molecule array (Simoa) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Compared with the healthy individuals (n=16), the patients with ENKTL (n=107) exhibited significantly elevated exoPD-L1 and sPD-L1 levels in the blood. High pretreatment plasma exoPD-L1 concentration was associated with higher SUVmax level and recurrence rate. Similarly, high sPD-L1 group was also associated with some adverse clinical parameters, including advanced stage, elevated LDH levels, B symptoms, high IPI score and PINK score. The 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate and overall survival (OS) rates were 65.2% and 85.7% for the whole cohort, respectively. Patients with a low pretreatment exoPD-L1 level (simoa signal 1.2). The 5-year OS and PFS rates for patients with low sPD-L1 group (< 219 pg/mL) was significantly higher than high sPD-L1 group (≥ 219 pg/mL) (OS, 91.3% vs. 55.5%, P < 0.001; PFS, 68.9% vs. 34.6%, P=0.003). However, no correlation was found between circulating exoPD-L1 and sPD-L1 levels. This is the first study to measure plasma exoPD-L1 level on the Quanterix Simoa platform. Our results proved that circulating exoPD-L1 and sPD-L1 levels were significantly elevated in ENKTL and might be potential biomarkers for predicting the survival outcomes of ENKTL patients.",

Twenty-six species differed significantly between the PC and HD microbiota. Six fecal microbes, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, were associated with an increased hazard of death.

Multiple salivary microbes were present in the co-occurrence network. Microbacterium and Stenotrophomonas were detected in the PC tissues and formed a network with the fecal and salivary microbes. The dysbiotic gut microbiota in the PC patients formed a complex network with the oral and cancerous microbiota, and gut microbes abundant in the PC patients were closely linked with poor prognostic factors in the network.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed male malignancy worldwide. Early diagnosis and metastases detection are crucial features to diminish patient mortality. High fat diet (HFD) and metabolic syndrome increase PCa risk and aggressiveness. Our goal was to identify miRNAs-based biomarkers for PCa diagnosis and prognosis associated with HFD. Mice chronically fed with a HFD or control diet (CD) were subcutaneously inoculated with androgen insensitive PC3 cells. Xenografts from HFD-fed mice showed increased expression of 7 miRNAs that we named candidates compared to CD-fed mice. These miRNAs modulate specific metabolic and cancer related pathways. Using bioinformatic tools and human datasets we found that hsa-miR-19b-3p and miR-101-3p showed more than 1,100 validated targets involved in proteoglycans in cancer and fatty acid biosynthesis. These miRNAs were significantly increased in the bloodstream of PCa patients compared to non-PCa volunteers, and in prostate tumors compared to normal adjacent tissues (NAT). Interestingly, both miRNAs were also increased in tumors of metastatic patients compared to tumors of non-metastatic patients. Further receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis determined that hsa-miR-19b-3p and hsa-miR-101-3p in serum showed poor predictive power to discriminate PCa from non-PCa patients. Hsa-miR-19b-3p showed the best score to discriminate between tumor and NAT, while hsa-miR-101-3p was useful to differentiate between metastatic and non-metastatic PCa patients. Hsa-miR-101-3p was increased in exosomes isolated from blood of PCa patients. Although more detailed functional exploration and validation of the molecular mechanisms are required, we identified hsa-miR-19b-3p and hsa-miR-101-3p with high potential for PCa diagnosis and prognosis.",

However, BCR-ABL1 compound mutations may develop during therapy in these patients and may lead to drug resistance. Asciminib is a novel drug capable of targeting most BCR-ABL1 mutant-forms, including BCR-ABL1T315I, but remains ineffective against most BCR-ABL1T315I+ compound mutation-bearing sub-clones. We demonstrate that asciminib synergizes with ponatinib in inducing growth-arrest and apoptosis in patient-derived CML cell lines and murine Ba/F3 cells harboring BCR-ABL1 T315I or T315I-including compound mutations. Asciminib and ponatinib also produced cooperative effects on CRKL phosphorylation in BCR-ABL1-transformed cells. The growth-inhibitory effects of the drug combination 'asciminib+ponatinib' was further enhanced by hydroxyurea (HU), a drug which has lately been described to suppresses the proliferation of BCR-ABL1 T315I+ CML cells. Cooperative drug effects were also observed in patient-derived CML cells. Most importantly, we were able to show that the combinations 'asciminib+ponatinib' and 'asciminib+ponatinib+HU' produce synergistic apoptosis-inducing effects in CD34+/CD38- CML stem cells obtained from patients with chronic phase CML or BCR-ABL1 T315I+ CML blast phase. Together, asciminib, ponatinib and HU synergize in producing anti-leukemic effects in multi-resistant CML cells, including cells harboring T315I+ BCR-ABL1 compound mutations and CML stem cells. The clinical efficacy of this TKI combination needs to be evaluated within the frame of upcoming clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Macropinocytosis is a form of endocytosis which provides an effective way for non-selective uptakes of extracellular proteins, liquids, and particles. The endocytic process is initiated by the activation of the growth factors signaling pathways. After activation of the biochemical signal, the cell starts internalizing extracellular solutes and nutrients into the irregular endocytic vesicles, known as macropinosomes that deliver them into the lysosomes for degradation. Macropinocytosis plays an important role in the nutritional supply of cancer cells. Due to the rapid expansion of cancer cells and the abnormal vascular microenvironment, cancer cells are usually deprived of oxygen and nutrients. Therefore, they must transform their metabolism to survive and grow in this harsh microenvironment. To satisfy their energy needs, cancer cells enhance the activity of macropinocytosis. Therefore, this metabolic adaptation that is used by cancer cells can be exploited to develop new targeted cancer therapies. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanism that actuates the process of macropinocytosis in a variety of cancers, and the novel anti-cancer therapeutics in targeting macropinocytosis.",

Recently, PD-L1 was reported to be acetylated at Lys263 site by p300 and was deacetylated by histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2). Acetylation of PD-L1 prevented its translocation to the nucleus and led to a reduction of the nuclear portion of PD-L1, resulting in evading immune surveillance of tumor cells. In this review article, we briefly describe the PTMs of PD-1/PD-L1 and mainly summarize the novel findings of PD-L1 acetylation in tumor cells.

However, there are few safe and effective targeting agents available in clinical practices. The artemisinin and its derivatives have shown potential anti-cancer activity by disturbing cellular iron homeostasis, but the specific mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that Artesunate (ART), a water-soluble anti-malaria agent in clinical use, can regulate the labile iron pool (LIP) and effectively induce ROS-dependent cell death in multiple HCC cells. Mechanistically, ART increases the LIP by promoting lysosomal degradation of iron-storage protein ferritin through acidizing lysosomes. Then the accumulation of labile iron in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) promotes excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and severe ER disruption, which leads to cell death. Our results provide a new understanding of how ART modulates iron metabolism in HCC cells at the subcellular level, demonstrate the significance of endoplasmic reticulum as iron-vulnerability of HCC cells. More importantly, our findings suggest ART is a safe and potential anti-HCC agent via disturbing iron homeostasis.",

Exploratory analysis included the associations between treatment response and tumor mutation burden (TMB), programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression.

Ginsenoside Rg3, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, was reported to have multiple antitumor functions. Here, we revealed a novel effect of Rg3 on BCSCs. Rg3 inhibits breast cancer cell viability in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Importantly, Rg3 suppressed mammosphere formation, reduced the expression of stemness-related transcription factors, including c-Myc, Oct4, Sox2 and Lin28, and diminished ALDH(+) populations. Moreover, tumor-bearing mice treated with Rg3 exhibited robust delay of tumor growth and a decrease in tumor-initiating frequency. In addition, we found that Rg3 suppressed breast cancer stem-like properties mainly through inhibiting MYC expression. Mechanistically, Rg3 accelerated the degradation of MYC mRNA by enhancing the expression of the let-7 family, which was demonstrated to bind to the MYC 3' untranslated region (UTR). In conclusion, our findings reveal the remarkable suppressive effect of Rg3 on BCSCs, suggesting that Rg3 is a promising therapeutic treatment for breast cancer.",

Employing the PanCancer Immune Profile Panel, encompassing 770 genes, in the discovery dataset, we identified 54 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within the tumor microenvironment of metastatic CRC. Validation of potential biomarkers was performed using two publicly available RNA-based sequencing datasets (TCGA 1 (n=371) and TCGA 2 (n=566)). Univariate COX regression unveiled that three significant biomarkers were associated with overall survival in CRC within the discovery dataset, which were SLC11A1 (hazard ratio (HR): 4.09, P=0.012), TNFSF11 (HR: 3.67, P=0.02), and MEF2C (HR: 0.34, P=0.037). Kaplan-Meier survival curve analyses confirmed the correlation between SLC11A1 expression and overall survival in CRC across the discovery set (P=0.0071) and the two independent datasets (TCGA 1 (P=0.0016) and TCGA 2 (P=0.025)). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated an area under the curve ranging from 0.64 to 0.76, with sensitivity of 59% to 87% and specificity of 60% to 73% for predicting CRC overall survival. Immunohistochemistry staining further validated the strong expression of SLC11A1 protein in CRC tumor cells, with high expression correlating with short-term survival.

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop and validate a new non-invasive artificial intelligence (AI) model based on preoperative computed tomography (CT) data to predict the presence of liver metastasis (LM) in colon cancer (CC). A total of forty-eight eligible CC patients were enrolled, including twenty-four patients with LM and twenty-four patients without LM. Six clinical factors and one hundred and fifty-two tumor image features extracted from CT data were utilized to develop three models: clinical, radiomics, and hybrid (a combination of clinical and radiomics features) using support vector machines with 5-fold cross-validation. The performance of each model was evaluated in terms of accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and area under the curve (AUC). For the radiomics model, a total of four image features utilized to construct the model resulting in an accuracy of 83.87% for training and 79.50% for validation. The clinical model that employed two selected clinical variables had an accuracy of 69.82% and 69.50% for training and validation, respectively. The hybrid model that combined relevant image features and clinical variables improved accuracy of both training (90.63%) and validation (85.50%) sets. In terms of AUC, hybrid (0.96; 0.87) and radiomics models (0.91; 0.85) demonstrated a significant improvement compared with the clinical model (0.71; 0.69), and the hybrid model had the best prediction performance. In conclusion, the AI model developed using preoperative conventional CT data can accurately predict LM in CC patients without additional procedures. Furthermore, combining image features with clinical characteristics greatly improved the model's prediction performance. We have thus generated a promising tool that allows guidance and individualized surveillance of CC patients with high risks of LM.",

    "abstract": "As an important hallmark of metabolic reprogramming in cancer, a disruption in fatty acid metabolism contributes to tumor proliferation, cell migration and invasion, and other tumor cell behaviors. In recent years, more and more studies have been conducted on fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2), the first rate-limiting enzyme for the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids. These studies have found that FADS2 is abnormally expressed in cancers of the breast, lung, liver, and esophagus; melanoma; leukemia; and other malignant tumors. Furthermore, its expression is significantly correlated with tumor proliferation, cell migration and invasion, clonal formation, angiogenesis, ferroptosis, resistance to radiotherapy, histological grade, metastasis to lymph nodes, clinical stage, and prognosis. The abnormal expression of FADS2 results in an imbalance of cell membrane phospholipids, which disrupts the fluidity of the membrane structure and the transmission of signals and promotes the production of proinflammatory factors and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites, ultimately harming human health. This article aims to systematically review the structural characteristics of FADS2; its function, expression, and mechanism of action; and the factors affecting its activity. This review also provides new ideas and strategies for the development of treatments aimed at the metabolic reprogramming of tumors.",

In the study, we reported that PNN was upregulated in prostate cancer tissues and PNN expression was positively associated with Gleason score, tumor stage and tumor metastasis. PNN promoted cell growth and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo, and modulated cell growth through driving G1/S transition via CDK6, CDK2, and Cyclin D1 in prostate cancer cells.

    "abstract": "Resisting cell death is one of the hallmarks of cancer. Necroptosis is a form of non-caspase dependent necrotic cell death mediated by receptor-interacting protein kinase-1/3 (RIP1/3), which represents another mode of programmed cell death besides apoptosis. RIP3 also acts as an energy metabolism regulator associated with switching cell death from apoptosis to necroptosis. Trichothecin (TCN) is a sesquiterpenoid originating from endophytic fungi and shows potent anti-tumor bioactivity. Our current findings reveal that RIP3 mediates TCN-induced necroptosis through up-regulating PYGL and PDC-E1α to promote mitochondria energy metabolism and ROS production. RIP3 might be involved in sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapy induced by TCN. Therefore, activating RIP3 to initiate necroptosis contributes to the bioactivity of TCN. Moreover, TCN could be exploited for therapeutic gain through up-regulating RIP3 to sensitize cancer chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of thyroid cancer and breast cancer is increasing year by year, and the specific pathogenesis is unclear. Posttranslational modifications constitute an important regulatory mechanism that affects the function of almost all proteins, are essential for a diverse and well-functioning proteome and can integrate metabolism with physiological and pathological processes. In recent years, posttranslational modifications, which mainly include metabolic enzyme-mediated protein posttranslational modifications, such as methylation, phosphorylation, acetylation and succinylation, have become a research hotspot. Among these modifications, lysine succinylation is a newly discovered broad-spectrum, dynamic, non-enzymatic protein post-translational modification, and it plays an important regulatory role in a variety of tumors. Studies have shown that succinylation can affect the synthesis of thyroid hormones, and the regulation of this post-translational modification can inhibit the apoptosis and migration of thyroid cancer cell lines, and promote breast cancer cell proliferation, DNA damage repair and autophagy-related regulation. However, the specific regulatory mechanism of succinylation in thyroid cancer and breast cancer is currently unclear. Therefore, this article mainly reviews the research progress of succinylation modification in thyroid cancer and breast cancer. It is expected to provide new directions and targets for the prevention and treatment of thyroid cancer and breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Sphingosine-1-Phosphate (S1P) is produced by Sphingosine Kinase 1 (SphK1) in the cell and is transported out of the cells by ABCC1 transporter. S1P induces inflammation, angiogenesis and modulates tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in autocrine and paracrine manner. We hypothesized that high S1P export is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression and worse survival. Transcriptome linked with clinical data were obtained from a total of 533 patients from TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas)-HCC (n = 350), GSE6764 (n = 75), and GSE89377 (n = 108) cohorts. Both SphK1 and ABCC1 were expressed higher in aggressive HCC than normal liver or cirrhosis and correlated with MKi67 expression. High S1P export by high expression of both SphK1 and ABCC1 enriched gene sets related with cell proliferation (E2F targets, G2M checkpoint, MYC targets), inflammation (Inflammatory response, TNFα, IL6), angiogenesis, metastasis (TGF-β, epithelial-mesenchymal transition), and immune response (allograft rejection, complement, interferon-gamma) in gene set enrichment analysis. High S1P export was associated with elevation of HGF, HSP90AA1, TRAF2, and AKR1B10. It was also associated with high intratumor heterogeneity, leucocyte fraction, macrophage regulation and lymphocyte infiltration, as well as T helper type2 cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, CD4+ T memory activated cells, B-cells and cytolytic activity score in TIME. High S1P export was associated with significantly worse disease specific survival (P = 0.034) and overall survival (P = 0.004) compared to low S1P export group. In conclusion, simultaneous high expression of SphK1 and ABCC1 that reflect S1P export is associated with enhancement of both HCC progression and immune response. Given that S1P export was also associated with worse survival, we cannot help but speculate that pro-cancer pathways activated by S1P may overwhelm the anti-cancer immune response mediated by S1P.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer among women. Several types of drugs, targeting the specific proteins expressed on the breast cancer cell surface (such as receptor tyrosine kinases and immune checkpoint regulators) and proteins involved in cell cycle and motility (including cyclin-dependent kinases, DNA stabilisers, and cytoskeleton modulators) are approved for different subtypes of breast cancer. However, breast cancer also has a poor response to conventional chemotherapy due to intrinsic and acquired resistance, and an Akt fingerprint is detectable in most drug-resistant cases. Overactivation of Akt and its upstream and downstream regulators in resistant breast cancer cells is considered a major potential target for novel anti-cancer therapies, suggesting that Akt signalling acts as a cellular mechanism against chemotherapy. The present review has shown that sustained activation of Akt results in resistance to different types of chemotherapy. Akt signalling plays a cellular defence role against chemotherapy and (1) enhances multi-drug resistance, (2) increases reactive oxygen species at breast tumor microenvironment, (3) enhances anaerobic metabolism, (4) inhibits the tricarboxylic cycle, (5) promotes PD-L1 upregulation, (6) inhibits apoptosis, (7) increases glucose uptake, and more importantly (8) recruits and interconnects the plasma membrane, nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondria to hijack breast cancer cells and rescue these cells from chemotherapy. Therefore, Akt signalling is considered a cellular defence mechanism employed against chemotherapeutic effects. In addition, interfering roles of PI3K/Akt signalling on the current cytotoxic and molecularly targeted therapy as well as immunotherapy of breast cancer are discussed with a clinical approach. Although, alpelisib, a PIK3CA inhibitor, is the only PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor approved for breast cancer, we also highlight well-evaluated inhibitors of PI3K/Akt signalling based on different subtypes of breast cancer, which are under clinical trials whether as monotherapy or in combination with other types of chemotherapy.",

We showed that the migration and invasiveness of LN18 cells was significantly enhanced after 24 h of hypoxia treatment. The metabolomic and proteomic profiling were conducted in LN18 cells cultured under hypoxia condition. Correlation analysis between significant differential metabolites and proteins revealed seven proteins and ten metabolites, of which metabolite L-Arg was negatively correlated with P4HA1 protein. Meanwhile, the expression of HIF1α, nNOS and P4HA1 was up-regulated, and the concentration of L-Arg and NO was decreased and increased respectively. Knockdown of HIF1α reduced the expression of nNOS and P4HA1, the concentration of NO and the invasiveness of cells, while increased the concentration of L-Arg. Similar changes on P4HA1 expression, the concentration of L-Arg and NO were observed when the expression of nNOS was disrupted. Lastly, knockdown of P4HA1 impaired the invasion of LN18 and T98G cells, probably through regulating the expression of Vimentin, MMP2, MMP9, Snail and E-cadherin. Consistent trends on both the overexpression of these relevant genes, as well as the concentration of L-Arg and NO were also observed in all our overexpression experiments. Besides, we investigated the relationship between P4HA1 expression and prognosis by MTA, CGGA and TCGA databases. Increased P4HA1 level was correlated poor prognosis with advanced histological grade. In summary, we found that hypoxia promotes the migration and invasion of GBM via the L-Arg/P4HA1 axis which maybe an effective molecular marker or predictor of clinical outcome in GBM patients.",

    "abstract": "HBV infection plays a crucial role in primary liver cancer development. Also, HBV related liver cancer has higher invasiveness and earlier discovered distant metastasis. HBV-encoded X protein (HBx) exerts various biological functions on liver cancer progression, including proliferation, invasion, and venous metastasis. There is evidence that High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis of tumors, including liver cancer. Therefore, this study investigates whether HMGB1 mediates HBx-induced EMT and angiogenesis in HBV related liver cancer. We collected 76 tumor samples of primary liver cancer patients to analyze the relationship between HMGB1 and portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) in HBV related liver cancer. To test the influence of HMGB1 on EMT and angiogenesis, we constructed HBx lentivirus transfected HepG2/Huh7 cell lines and performed invasion assays, tube formation and in vivo metastatic experiments. We evaluated HMGB1 and STAT3/miR-34a/NF-κB pathway in vivo and in vitro by immunoblot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry analysis. Subsequent RNA interference (RNAi) and luciferase reporter assay were conducted to detect the functional correlation between HMGB1 and STAT3/miR-34a/NF-κB pathway. Our results showed enhanced expression of HMGB1 in HBV related liver cancer, especially with PVTT, while HMGB1 expression was associated with tumor invasion and metastasis. Further experiments indicated that the activation of STAT3 mediated HBx-induced HMGB1, which is involved in EMT and tumor angiogenesis. Besides, HMGB1 expression stimulated by HBx was dependent on the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway, which was inhibited by miR-34a, while STAT3 suppressed the expression of miR-34a. Moreover, extracellular HMGB1 induced the IL-6/STAT3/miR-34a axis activation, which indicated a reciprocal relationship between HMGB1 and miR-34a. Collectively, our study provided evidence to reveal that HBx-mediated high expression of HMGB1 accounted for EMT and tumor angiogenesis in HBV related liver cancer, and HMGB1 may be a potential target for predicting venous metastasis.",

The current PCa diagnostic method, the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, is not specific, thus, alternatives are needed to avoid unnecessary biopsies and over-diagnosis of clinically insignificant PCa. To explore the application of metabolomics in such effort, urine samples were collected from 386 male adults aged 44-93 years, including 247 patients with biopsy-proven PCa and 139 with biopsy-proven negative results. The PCa-positive group was further subdivided into two groups: low-grade (ISUP Grade Group = 1; n = 139) and intermediate/high-grade (ISUP Grade Group ≥ 2; n = 108). Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in urine were extracted by stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE) and analyzed using thermal desorption with gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). We used machine learning tools to develop and evaluate models for PCa diagnosis and prognosis. In total, 22,538 VOCs were identified in the urine samples. With regularized logistic regression, our model for PCa diagnosis yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99 and 0.88 for the training and testing sets respectively. Furthermore, the model for differentiating between low-grade and intermediate/high-grade PCa yielded an average AUC of 0.78 based on a repeated test-sample approach for cross-validation. These novel methods using urinary VOCs and logistic regression were developed to fill gaps in PCa screening and assessment of PCa grades prior to biopsy. Our study findings provide a promising alternative or adjunct to current PCa screening and diagnostic methods to better target patients for biopsy and mitigate the challenges associated with over-diagnosis and over-treatment of PCa.",

    "abstract": "Ototoxicity is an often-underestimated sequela for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, with an incidence rate exceeding 50%, affecting approximately 4 million individuals worldwide each year. Despite the nearly 2,000 publications on chemotherapy-related ototoxicity in the past decade, the understanding of its prevalence, mechanisms, and preventative or therapeutic measures remains ambiguous and subject to debate. To date, only one drug, sodium thiosulfate, has gained FDA approval for treating ototoxicity in chemotherapy. However, its utilization is restricted. This review aims to offer clinicians and researchers a comprehensive perspective by thoroughly and carefully reviewing available data and current evidence. Chemotherapy-induced ototoxicity is characterized by four primary symptoms: hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and dizziness, originating from both auditory and vestibular systems. Hearing loss is the predominant symptom. Amongst over 700 chemotherapeutic agents documented in various databases, only seven are reported to induce hearing loss. While the molecular mechanisms of the hearing loss caused by the two platinum-based drugs are extensively explored, the pathways behind the action of the other five drugs are primarily speculative, rooted in their therapeutic properties and side effects. Cisplatin attracts the majority of attention among these drugs, encompassing around two-thirds of the literature regarding ototoxicity in chemotherapy. Cisplatin ototoxicity chiefly manifests through the loss of outer hair cells, possibly resulting from damages directly by cisplatin uptake or secondary effects on the stria vascularis. Both direct and indirect influences contribute to cisplatin ototoxicity, while it is still debated which path is dominant or where the primary target of cisplatin is located. Candidates for hearing protection against cisplatin ototoxicity are also discussed, with novel strategies and methods showing promise on the horizon.",

Due to the lack of specific markers for CAF subpopulations, their specific mechanisms in breast cancer remain unclear. We identified eight distinct CAF phenotypes in breast cancer using multiple single-cell RNA sequencing datasets and determined distinct transcription factors (TFs) of CAFs through SCENIC analysis. Our study highlights one CAF subtype in breast cancer, FN1+CAF2, associated with metastasis and macrophage polarization. We observed elevated FN1 expression in the stromal tissue of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, FN1 knockdown in CAFs reduced the migration ability of breast cancer cells. We identified a regulatory gene, MXRA5, in CAF2, which may play crucial roles in breast cancer. Our results indicated upregulated MXRA5 expression in breast cancer tissues and CAFs from patients with lymph node metastasis in the following experiment. Overall, our study reveals that the FN1+CAF2 subtype is associated with metastasis and suggests that MXRA5 may be a novel marker mediating the effects of CAF2 on breast cancer metastasis. This study enriches our understanding of CAF heterogeneity and offers new insights for treating breast cancer metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most prevalent malignant solid tumor in children. Tumor metabolism, including lipid, amino acid, and glucose metabolism, is intricately linked to the genesis and progression of tumors. This study aimed to establish a prognostic gene signature for NB patients, based on metabolism-related genes, and to investigate a treatment approach that could enhance the survival rate of high-risk NB patients. From the NB dataset GSE49710, we identified metabolism-related gene markers utilizing the \"limma\" R package and univariate Cox analysis combined with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis. We explored the correlation between these gene markers and the overall survival of NB patients. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and single-sample GSEA algorithms were used to assess the differences in metabolism and immune status. Furthermore, we examined the association between metabolic subgroups and drug responsiveness. Concurrently, data downloaded from TARGET and MTAB were used for external verification. Using multicolor immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, we investigated the relationship between the lipid metabolism-related gene ELOVL6 with both the International Neuroblastoma Staging System classification of NB and survival rate. Finally, we explored the effect of high ELOVL6 expression on the immune microenvironment in NB using flow cytometry. We identified an eight-gene signature comprising metabolism-related genes in NB: ELOVL6, OSBPL9, RPL27A, HSD17B3, ACHE, AKR1C1, PIK3R1, and EPHX2. This panel effectively predicted disease-free survival, and was validated using an internal dataset from GSE49710 and two external datasets from the TARGET and MTAB databases. Moreover, our findings confirmed that ELOVL6 fosters an immunosuppressive microenvironment and contributes to the malignant progression in NB. The eight-gene signature is significant in predicting the prognosis of NB, effectively classifying patients into high- and low-risk groups. This classification may guide the development of innovative treatment strategies for these patients. Notably, the signature gene ELOVL6 markedly encourages an immunosuppressive microenvironment and malignant progression in NB.",

The biological function of circBRAF in TNBC was further investigated through colony formation, tube formation, and transwell assays.Crucially, the mechanisms underlying the effects of circBRAF on TNBC progression were explored via RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq) data, MS2 pulldown, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis, circBRAF knockdown, histone H3K9me3 modification, and Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP) tests followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).We focused particularly on hsa_ circ_0007178, produced from exons 4-13 of the oncogene BRAF.Functional experiments revealed that circBRAF is crucial for the development of TNBC, with its knockdown preventing angiogenesis, metastasis, and cell division in vitro.Mechanistically, circBRAF interacts with KDM4B and IGF2BP3, promoting TNBC growth.Interaction of circBRAF with IGF2BP3 increased the expression of VCAN, FN1, CDCA3, or B4GALT3 by controlling mRNA stability through RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification.Furthermore, circBRAF upregulated the expression of ADAMTS14 and MMP9 through recruitment of KDM4B to enhance respective H3K9me3 modification.Furthermore, overexpression of circBRAF was able to overcome the inhibitory effects of siKDM4B and siIGF2BP3 on cell migration and invasion.Our findings suggest that circBRAF may act as an oncogene in TNBC through its specific interactions with KDM4B and IGF2BP3, implying that circBRAF could serve as a potentially effective novel therapeutic target for TNBC.",

The positive outcomes of immunotherapy are limited by the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment. Integrin αvβ6, which can regulate the progression of colon cancer, was recently reported to be involved in the immune suppression of colon cancer. In the present study, we explored the correlation between αvβ6 and PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry of colon cancer tissues. Then, the regulation of PD-L1 signaling by αvβ6 in colon cancer cells was demonstrated. We constructed an in vivo model and performed immunophenotyping experiments to analyze further the regulation of the immune response by αvβ6. The role of αvβ6 in the response to anti-PD-1 therapy in colon cancer was also verified. αvβ6-positive tissues exhibited increased PD-L1 expression. Inhibition of αvβ6 not only downregulated constitutive PD-L1 expression but also decreased IFN-γ-induced PD-L1 expression. In addition, αvβ6-induced PD-L1 expression was suppressed by the ERK inhibitor PD98059, and knockdown of the β6-ERK2 binding site had the equivalent effect. αvβ6 decreased CD8+ T cell infiltration and granzyme B expression in CD8+ T cells in colon cancer patients. Furthermore, mice engrafted with αvβ6-expressing colon cancer cells exhibited an unsatisfactory response to anti-PD-1 therapy, and anti-PD-1-induced increases in CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration could be inhibited by αvβ6. These results indicate that αvβ6 mediates immune escape in colon cancer by upregulating PD-L1 through the ERK/MAPK pathway. Moreover, αvβ6 could serve as a marker for the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in colon cancer.",

We retrospectively analyzed data from 60 patients with benign thyroid nodules treated at Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital from January 2021 to December 2021. All patients underwent microwave ablation. Based on the intraoperative assessment of the ablation effect, they were divided into a contrast-enhanced ultrasound group (n=34) and a conventional ultrasound group (n=26). Postoperatively, the treatment outcomes were classified into complete ablation or the presence of residual nodules. We also assessed the recurrence rate one year after treatment, along with inflammatory factors, stress response indicators, and effects on thyroid function. The complete ablation rate for thyroid nodules in the contrast-enhanced ultrasound group was significantly higher than that in the conventional ultrasound group (P<0.05). Intraoperative measurements revealed lower ablated nodule volumes, bleeding volumes, and in situ replacement rates in the contrast-enhanced ultrasound group, with statistically significant differences (P<0.05). Preoperative thyroid function hormone indicators, inflammatory factors and stress response indicators did not significantly differ between the two groups. Postoperatively, both groups had lower levels of free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4), along with higher levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), white blood cells (WBC), serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), norepinephrine (NE), epinephrine (E), and cortisol (Cor) compared to preoperative levels. However, the contrast-enhanced ultrasound group demonstrated higher FT3 and FT4 levels and lower WBC, serum CRP, IL-6, NE, E, Cor and TSH levels than the conventional ultrasound group, with statistically significant differences (all P<0.05). No statistically significant differences in complication rates were observed between the two groups. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound in microwave ablation for benign thyroid nodules can improve the complete ablation rate, reduce recurrence, and have a minimal impact on thyroid function, without increasing complication rates. It is recommended for clinical use.",

In this work, we compile and discuss findings from a range of studies investigating the expression patterns of OTUD6B-AS1 in different cancers and its consequent effects on tumor behavior, both in vitro and in vivo. We delve into the mechanisms through which OTUD6B-AS1 influences cancer initiation and progression, focusing on its role in regulating essential cellular processes such as cell growth, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, ferroptosis, and treatment resistance.

Additionally, we assess the clinical relevance of OTUD6B-AS1 expression levels, evaluating its potential as a biomarker for cancer prognosis and diagnosis, as well as a target for therapeutic intervention.

A total of 292 OC patients with abdominal metastasis, treated at Henan Provincial People's Hospital between 2021 and 2023 were included in this retrospective study. Follow-up was conducted for one year to observe the recurrence, with 285 patients completing the observation. The patients were then categorized into relapsing and non-relapsing groups based on whether they experienced a relapse within one-year follow-up. Independent sample t-tests and χ 2 tests were used for inter-group comparison. Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were utilized to screen factors affecting recurrence. The variance inflation factor (VIF) was used to analyze whether the variables in the model had multicollinearity. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and nomographs were used to construct models for predicting one-year recurrence in OC patients with abdominal metastasis. Area under curve (AUC) of ROC and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test were used to evaluate the accuracy of the model. The prediction model was verified by internal verification and external verification. The number of pregnancies, the number of births, diabetes mellitus, tumor diameter, tumor reduction combined with intraperitoneal chemotherapy, CA-125, HE-4, NLR, PLR, MLR showed association with patient recurrence. Logistic regression analysis revealed that lower pregnancy frequency and elevated levels of CA-125, HE-4, PLR and MLR were independent risk factors for increased risk of recurrence. In addition, the nomogram-based model demonstrated strong predictive accuracy for one-year recurrence. OC patients with abdominal metastasis present diverse clinical manifestations, among which fewer pregnancies and elevated levels of CA-125, HE-4, PLR, and MLR may be independent risk factors for increased risk of recurrence. Individualized interventions based on these prognostic factors are essential to reduce risk and enhance patient quality of life.",

In most patients, the disease is driven by the KIT D816V mutation, leading to activation of the KIT receptor and subsequent downstream signaling, including the JAK/STAT pathway. In recent years, KIT-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have emerged for the treatment of systemic mastocytosis; however, the overall response rate is often not sufficient. In this study, we investigated whether targeting the JAK/STAT pathway might be a novel treatment approach in mastocytosis. Using human MC lines carrying the KIT D816V mutation and human primary cord blood-derived MC, we examined the effects of different JAK inhibitors. Our findings revealed that the JAK inhibitors fedratinib and gandotinib decreased viability, reduced proliferation, and induced apoptosis in KIT D816V-positive MC lines (HMC-1.2 and ROSA KIT D816V). In contrast, ruxolitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib and abrocitinib failed to affect MC functions. Combinatorial treatment with fedratinib, gandotinib and the two TKI avapritinib and midostaurin was more effective than treatment with TKI alone. Fedratinib also induced apoptosis and enhanced the efficacy of TKI in primary cord blood-derived MC. These results indicate that fedratinib and gandotinib, but not the other JAK inhibitors used in this study, can suppress viability and induce apoptosis in KIT D816V-mutant and KIT WT MC and increase effects of TKI. These findings suggest to explore fedratinib and gandotinib as novel treatment option in mastocytosis.",

This was achieved by modulating several genes that encode transport proteins, such as the downregulation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Using specific, sensitive and quantitative analytical techniques, we observed a more than 70% increase in intracellular concentrations of doxorubicin and vinorelbine in samples treated with TTFields, and a greater than 50% increase in drug uptake in cells exposed to TTFields and pemetrexed. This result indicates that the increased drug concentration observed in TTFields treated cells is significant not only for drugs that are P-gp substrates but also suggests that TTFields could potentially affect other efflux pumps. However, the co-exposure to the drug and TTFields was critical to increasing intracellular drug levels, highlighting the necessity of concurrent use with drugs to enhance the antiproliferative effects of treatment. The in vitro findings were further corroborated by in vivo pharmacokinetic experiments in mice subcutaneously injected with epithelioid PM tumors. Indeed, a 30% increase in intratumor concentrations was observed when vinorelbine was administered with TTFields. Our findings suggest that TTFields could be a well-tolerated approach for enhancing intratumoral drug levels and potentially achieving a more significant therapeutic impact on PM treatment.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4, have significantly advanced melanoma treatment by reactivating the immune system to target cancer cells. However, a substantial portion of patients do not respond or develop resistance, highlighting the need for more effective predictive biomarkers. Dysregulation of transcriptional programs has been implicated in cancer progression and immune evasion, with transcription factors (TFs) playing a crucial role. In this study, we investigated transcriptional gene signatures (TGSs) for their potential to predict ICI resistance in melanoma by analyzing two independent clinical trial datasets. Among the identified TFs, NFATC2 (Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells 2) was observed to be a promising marker for resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. NFATC2, a regulator of T cell activation, may be co-opted by melanoma cells to evade immune surveillance. Our analysis indicated that elevated NFATC2 TGS scores were associated with ICI resistance and poorer survival outcomes across multiple melanoma cohorts. Validation in independent datasets further suggested NFATC2's potential predictive value, particularly in patients without liver metastasis or with prior anti-CTLA-4 therapy. Elevated NFATC2 TGS scores also correlated with reduced immune cell infiltration, specifically of CD8+ T cells, increased markers of T cell exhaustion, and higher tumor purity. These findings support NFATC2 TGS as a candidate biomarker for stratifying melanoma patients and potentially informing ICI therapy response. Further research into NFATC2-associated immune evasion mechanisms may offer insights for overcoming resistance to immunotherapy.",

Combinations of platinum-based chemotherapies have demonstrated higher rates of pathologic complete responses of triple-negative breast cancer compared to combinations without platinum-based chemotherapies. However, there is a significant increase in general toxicity with the addition of platinum-based regimens. Some groups have investigated using tumor-treating fields as an alternative treatment method for triple-negative breast cancer, and chemosensitization by tumor-treating fields has been observed in vitro. With the goal of minimizing the toxicities associated with platinum-based chemotherapy, we investigated anti-mitotic effects of concurrent tumor-treating fields and cisplatin treatment to show that the addition of tumor-treating fields further inhibited cell growth in triple-negative breast cancer. We show that combining cisplatin with tumor-treating fields induces higher levels of apoptosis within triple-negative breast cancer cells as opposed to normal epithelial cells and the combination has a more immediate mechanism of cell death than either monotherapy. We also demonstrate that, when combined with tumor-treating fields, a lower dose of chemotherapy can be used to achieve the same efficacy of triple-negative breast cancer cell death as higher doses of individual therapy.",

In this study, we knocked down GDF15 in EOC cells before performing high-throughput sequencing to identify genes regulated by GDF15. GDF15 was overexpressed to determine its effect on the viability, migration, and response of EOC cells to gemcitabine, carboplatin, and paclitaxel. Reprogramming of glucose and cholesterol metabolism in EOC cells was evaluated based on oxygen consumption, lactic acid production, complex I activity, and free and esterified cholesterol levels. The activities of ATP-binding cassette (ABC)B1 and ABCC1 were assessed based on the expulsion efficiency of rhodamine 12. GDF15 overexpression promoted cell viability, migration, and resistance to gemcitabine. In addition, GDF15 induced glycolysis and increased cholesterol levels in EOC cells. Cholesterol metabolism regulated by GDF15 contributed to the resistance of EOC cells to gemcitabine by elevating ABCB1 and ABCC1 levels in lipid rafts. DHCR24 plays an important role in cholesterol synthesis. DHCR24 was identified as a downstream effector of GDF15, because knockdown of DHCR24, but not treatment with statins, suppressed the cancer-promoting effect of GDF15. Overall, GDF15 promoted the resistance of EOC cells to gemcitabine via DHCR24-mediated cholesterol metabolism to elevate ABCB1 and ABCC1 levels in lipid rafts. Therefore, GDF15 and DHCR24 are potential therapeutic targets for suppressing the growth of EOC cells and improving their sensitivity to gemcitabine.",

Although accumulating evidence supports 1q+ as a \"high-risk\" CA (HRCA), several issues remain to be addressed to understand its true prognostic property. We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 934 patients with NDMM from three centers in China, who had baseline data available for 1q+ [including 1q21 gain (3 copies) and amplification (> 3 copies)] detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization in isolated CD138+ cells, and who received first-line treatment with novel agents including proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs, or both. Minimal residue disease (MRD) was assessed using next-generation flow cytometry. In this cohort, 1q+ patients accounted for 53% of all patients. 1q+ patients were characterized by larger tumor burden, more advanced diseases, adverse complications, and frequent concurrence of other CAs (particularly HRCAs) at diagnosis. Concurrence of HRCAs [del(17p), t(4;14), and t(14;16); known as double-hit MM], but not standard-risk CA, markedly worsened the outcome of 1q+ patients, compared to those with 1q+ only (progression-free survival/PFS: hazard ratio/HR 1.63, 95% confidence interval/CI 1.21-2.20, P = 0.0013; overall survival/OS: HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.40-2.74, P < 0.0001). 1q+ modulated the risk levels defined by the Revised International Staging System (R-ISS). Although the overall response rate was not significantly different between patients with or without 1q+, fewer 1q+ patients achieved complete response or better and minimal residue disease negativity (MRD-). MRD- attainment substantially prolonged PFS (HR 4.03, 95% CI 2.59-6.29, P < 0.0001) and OS (HR 3.72, 95% CI 2.24-6.19, P < 0.0001) of 1q+ patients. While 1q+ patients had relatively shorter MRD- duration, sustained MRD- significantly improved the PFS and OS of 1q+ patients. Together, 1q+ is an HRCA and a major component of double-hit MM, while the risk-adapted and MRD-tailored therapy may best help manage this high-risk population.",

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of an Hsp90 inhibitor, luminespib (AUY922), and evaluate the synergistic effect of combining AUY922 with cisplatin on two cisplatin-resistant human NPC cell lines. The response of cisplatin-resistant NPC cells to AUY922 and/or cisplatin was assessed through proliferation assay, cell cycle analysis, Annexin V apoptosis detection, Western blot analysis, in vivo investigation, and histological analysis. Our results indicated that AUY922/cisplatin combination significantly inhibited the proliferation of both non-resistant and resistant NPC cells. Moreover, Annexin V analysis indicated apoptosis when AUY922 was administered alone or in combination with cisplatin. Consistently, Western blot analysis revealed increased cleavage of PARP. Most importantly, the combination treatment demonstrated enhanced tumor growth inhibition in nude mice xenograft models, without notable adverse effects. These findings highlight the antiproliferative effects and anticancer activity of the AUY922/cisplatin combination in cisplatin-resistant NPC cells. The combination treatment of AUY922 and cisplatin holds promise as a strategy to overcome drug resistance in NPC patients.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a disorder affecting women globally, and hence an early and precise classification is the best possible treatment to increase the survival rate. However, the breast cancer classification faced difficulties in scalability, fixed-size input images, and overfitting on limited datasets. To tackle these issues, this work proposes a Patho-Net model for breast cancer classification that overcomes the problems of scalability in color normalization, integrates the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network with the U-Net architecture to process images without the need for resizing and computational efficiency, and addresses the overfitting problems. The proposed model collects and normalizes histopathology images using automated reference image selection with the Reinhard method for color standardization. Also, the Enhanced Adaptive Non-Local Means (EANLM) filtering is utilized for noise removal to preserve image features. These preprocessed images undergo semantic segmentation to isolate specific parts of an image, followed by feature extraction using an Improved Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (I-GLCM) to reveal fine patterns and textures in images. These features serve as input into the classification U-Net model integrated with GRU networks to improve the model performance. Finally, the classification result is expanded, and XAI is used for clear visual explanations of the model's predictions. The proposed Patho-Net model, which uses the 100X BreakHis dataset, achieves an accuracy of 98.90% in the classification of breast cancer.",

Behavioral activation (BA) therapy, which increases engagement by enhancing positive reinforcement and reducing avoidance, has shown potential in managing these symptoms. Physical activity (PA) is also known to alleviate depression, though its role as a mediator in BA's effectiveness remains unclear. This clinical trial was retrospectively registered in ClinicalTrials.gov on April 5, 2024 (Effects of Behavioral Activation on Negative Emotions, Cancer-related Symptoms and Clinical Indicators in Cancer Patients, NCT06348940). This study explores PA's mediating effect within BA interventions. A total of 109 CRC patients with depressive symptoms were randomly assigned to a BA group (n=52) or a Usual Care (UC) group (n=57). Assessments occurred at baseline (T0), after the fourth session (T1), and post-intervention (T2). The BA group showed significant improvement compared to the UC group. Repeated measures ANOVA confirmed BA's effectiveness in reducing depressive symptoms, improving quality of life, alleviating psychological distress, increasing activation, and raising PA levels. PA changes accounted for 36.91% of the intervention's total effect on depression reduction. BA effectively reduces depression and enhances life quality in CRC patients. Changes in PA intensity are significantly associated with depression reduction, suggesting PA's mediating role in BA's impact. Incorporating PA into BA may enhance therapeutic outcomes for CRC patients with depression.",

    "abstract": "Over 70% of breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, with Tamoxifen (Tam) being a standard treatment. However, around 40% of these cancers develop resistance to Tam, which poses a significant clinical challenge. The ACOD1/itaconate (ITA) axis, a metabolic pathway that produces itaconate, has shown promise in inhibiting the growth of ER-positive breast cancer cells. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how effective ITA is against Tam-resistant breast cancer cells and the underlying mechanisms involved. The current report found that Tam-resistant cells exhibit increased sensitivity to ITA compared to their parental cells and show a synergetic effect in combination treatment with Tam. An unbiased proteomic analysis revealed that upregulating the ERK2 signaling pathway contributes to the sensitivity of ER-positive breast cancer cells to ITA. ITA treatment increases ERK2 phosphorylation at T185/Y187 sites by directly alkylating cysteine 254, leading to ERK2 activation and subsequent cell growth inhibition. These effects were abolished in ITA allylation-resistant cells when a cysteine residue was replaced with serine. Additionally, itaconate-induced ERK2 phosphorylation and activation inhibits the growth of Tam-resistant breast cancer cells, which effect is advanced in phosphorylation-mimic ERK2_T185E-expressing cells but blocked in those expressing non-phosphorylation-mimic ERK2_T185A. Furthermore, activated ERK2 interacts physically with API5 to disrupt API5's localization to the nucleus speckle, where API5 may interact with other molecules critical in regulating cell growth-related genes. Our findings clarify the mechanism through which ITA exerts its effects on tamoxifen-sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells and highlight the potential of itaconate as an alternative treatment strategy against breast cancer.",

Complex survey-weighted multivariable Poisson regression identified patient-level predictors and estimated risk ratios (RR) for telemedicine receipt. Two-way interaction between cancer type and race and ethnicity assessed effect modification. Telemedicine prevalence was 35.5% [95% CI: 34.8%-36.2%] for the overall study population and 48.7% [95% CI: 47.0%-50.4%] for cancer patients. Weighted multivariable Poisson regression revealed that non-Hispanic Black (NHB) and non-Hispanic Asian (NHA) individuals had lower receipt compared to non-Hispanic White (NHB RR: 0.87, 95% CI: [0.83-0.92], P<0.01; NHA RR: 0.8, 95% CI: [0.74-0.86], P<0.01).

Glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase (QPCT) promotes cancer progression by modifying the N-terminus of chemokine C-C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) to a pyroglutamate residue and stabilizing the protein. The role of QPCT in LUAD is still unknown. QPCT mRNA and protein expression were up-regulated in clinical LUAD specimens. By generating stable HCC44 cells with QPCT overexpression and stable A549 cells with QPCT knockdown, we found that QPCT knockdown notably inhibited LUAD cell proliferation. Additionally, QPCT deletion reduced the CCL2 contents in LUAD cell supernatants and inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced THP-1 macrophage chemotaxis toward tumor cells or tumor cell conditioned medium. The CD68+/CD206+ cell ratio was reduced by QPCT deletion in vitro. Nude mice inoculated with parental A549 or cells with stable QPCT knockdown were used to explore QPCT functions. The results were consistent with in vitro experiments. QPCT is predicted to be modified by N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and we performed methylated RNA immunoprecipitation PCR to confirm this result in A549 cells. The m6A demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) mRNA expression positively correlated with QPCT mRNA in LUAD samples. FTO bound to QPCT mRNA and FTO knockdown affected QPCT mRNA stability. FTO deletion in HCC44 cells abrogated the macrophage recruitment and macrophage M2 polarization induced by QPCT overexpression. In conclusion, QPCT promotes tumorigenesis in LUAD by increasing macrophage recruitment and M2 macrophage proportion. This may be due to FTO-mediated demethylation increasing the QPCT mRNA stability.",

Prognostic genes were screened using univariate Cox regression, refined via Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, and used to construct a 10-gene risk signature. The signature's performance was validated in independent cohorts through receiver operating characteristic curves, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and a nomogram. Its predictive ability for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy response was assessed in the IMvigor210 and GSE78220 datasets. Six distinct TAM subpopulations were identified, with two subsets significantly correlated with poor prognosis. The 10-gene risk signature, derived from TAM-related genes, demonstrated strong prognostic performance in both training and validation cohorts. High-risk patients exhibited markedly worse overall survival compared to low-risk patients. Additionally, the signature effectively stratified patients based on their response to anti-PD-L1 therapy, with high-risk patients exhibiting reduced clinical benefit. A nomogram combining the risk signature with clinicopathological parameters further enhanced survival prediction accuracy, supporting its clinical applicability. This study established a novel TAM-based prognostic risk signature with robust predictive power for both survival outcomes and immunotherapy response in LUAD. These findings enhance our understanding of TAMs' clinical significance and provide a foundation for personalized immunotherapy strategies in LUAD.",

    "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a rapidly proliferating malignancy with a poor prognosis, commonly treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy based on the etoposide and cisplatin (EP) regimen; however, this treatment is often complicated by febrile neutropenia (FN), a potentially life-threatening condition that can compromise treatment efficacy and patient safety. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for FN in SCLC patients undergoing EP-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy to enhance treatment outcomes and improve patient management. In this retrospective case-control study, data from 216 SCLC patients who underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy with the EP regimen between September 2014 and January 2020 were analyzed. Patients were categorized into FN (n = 106) and non-FN (n = 110) groups. Various clinical factors, including body mass index (BMI), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS), and pre-treatment laboratory values such as albumin, IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP), were examined. Statistical analyses, including univariate and multivariate logistic regression, were performed to identify independent risk factors for FN. Lower BMI (P = 0.016) and poorer ECOG Performance Status (P = 0.001) were associated with an increased risk of FN. Additionally, pre-albumin levels (P = 0.010), inflammatory markers CRP (P = 0.032), and IL-6 (P = 0.001) also showed significant associations, suggesting that nutritional status and systemic inflammation play important roles in the development of FN. Importantly, multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed pre-albumin levels (P = 0.003), IL-6 level (P = 0.001), MASCC score (P < 0.001), and ECOG PS (P = 0.019) as independent factors for FN risk. These findings highlight the importance of nutritional status, systemic inflammation, and overall health condition in predicting FN occurrence, underscoring the need for integrated risk assessment and management strategies to mitigate FN risk in SCLC patients undergoing EP-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prevalent and highly lethal malignancy, with current therapeutic efficacy limited by the tumor's high invasiveness and metastatic potential. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and the WNT (Wingless/Integrated) signaling pathway play key roles in the invasion and metastasis of CRC. Salidroside, a natural compound, has demonstrated inhibitory effects in several cancers, but its precise molecular mechanism in CRC cells remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the antitumor effect of salidroside on CRC and its molecular mechanism in influencing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by regulating MMP-12 and the WNT signaling pathway. The effects of salidroside on CRC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were evaluated through in vitro experiments using HCT-116 and SW620 cell lines. The antitumor effects of salidroside were validated using CCK-8, wound healing, and Transwell assays. Expression changes of MMP-12, WNT signaling-related proteins (e.g., β-catenin, GSK-3β), and EMT markers (e.g., E-cadherin, Vimentin) after salidroside treatment were measured by qRT-PCR and Western Blot. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis was performed using TCGA and GEO databases in combination with the BEST online tool to identify differentially expressed genes, followed by GSEA enrichment analysis. Salidroside showed significant antiproliferative and inhibitory effects on the migration and invasion of CRC cells. In vitro experiments demonstrated that salidroside significantly inhibited CRC cell proliferation and reduced their migration and invasion capabilities. qRT-PCR and Western Blot analyses showed that salidroside significantly downregulated MMP-12 expression and led to changes in the expression of WNT signaling and EMT-related proteins, specifically downregulating β-catenin, upregulating E-cadherin, and downregulating Vimentin. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis indicated that MMP-12 plays a crucial role in salidroside-mediated CRC inhibition, further supporting its potential as a key target. In conclusion, salidroside suppresses CRC invasion and migration by downregulating MMP-12 and modulating the WNT signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting the EMT process. These findings suggest that salidroside holds potential as a therapeutic agent for CRC, offering a novel approach to CRC treatment.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a fatal disease with a poor prognosis. While venous invasion is believed to contribute to liver metastasis and an unfavorable prognosis, the precise mechanisms involved remain unclear. Here, we conducted gene expression profiling on eight PDAC tissue samples exhibiting portal venous invasion (VI group) compared to PDAC samples without portal venous invasion (CA group) and normal portal vein tissues (NV group). A subset of genes, including tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), olfactomedin-like 2B (OLFML2B), and cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily B member 1 (CYP1B1), was found to be specifically expressed in the PDAC group with venous invasion. Immunohistochemical staining of 15 cases revealed significantly higher levels of TIMP1 (P=.026) and CXCR4 (P<.001) in the VI set compared to the CA set. In addition, the PDAC group with strong TIMP1 expression had a higher frequency of lymphovascular invasion (P<.001) and lower 5-year survival rates than the PDAC group with no/weak TIMP1 expression (P=.027). Specific TIMP1 expression in the venous invasion foci was highlighted on 3D reconstruction imaging. Invasion assays and/or Western blot analyses were performed on pancreatic cancer cells (Panc1), cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and human endothelial cells (EA.hy926). TIMP1 inhibition suppressed cancer cell invasion in the presence of CAFs. TIMP1 expression increased with PI3Kp110, phospho-AKT, and phospho-ERK1/2 in Panc1 cells co-cultured with CAFs and EA.hy926 endothelial cells. Our data demonstrate that TIMP1 in pancreatic cancer cells promotes venous invasion of PDACs by activating the PI3K/AKT and ERK1/2 pathways in collaboration with CAFs and endothelial cells. Therefore, TIMP1 may serve as a biomarker for venous invasion in PDACs.",

    "abstract": "Malignant melanoma is a highly fatal disease closely associated with sex hormones. This study aimed to evaluate the global burden and trends of malignant melanoma based on menopausal status. Data on the prevalence, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and mortality of malignant melanoma were obtained from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2021. Age 55 was used as a threshold for menopausal status to assess global, regional, and national trends in disease burden among women. In 2021, the age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) of malignant melanoma was higher in women than men under 55 years but lower in women over 55 years. From 1990 to 2021, the ASPR for premenopausal women increased from 14.23 [95% uncertainty interval (UI) (13.79-14.60)] to 16.53 [95% UI (15.09-17.78)], while the age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) decreased from 14.04 [95% UI (12.20-15.61)] to 11.83 [95% UI (9.20-14.35)], and the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) decreased from 0.27 [95% UI (0.24-0.30)] to 0.23 [95% UI (0.18-0.28)]. For postmenopausal women, the ASPR increased from 55.01 [95% UI (51.71-57.23)] to 81.43 [95% UI (74.33-87.03)], while the ASDR decreased from 63.88 [95% UI (58.39-69.64)] to 56.11 [95% UI (48.79-63.66)], and the ASMR decreased from 2.96 [95% UI (2.69-3.19)] to 2.73 [95% UI (2.36-3.07)]. The disease burden was highest in high socio-demographic index (SDI) regions but has recently decreased, whereas a gradual increase was observed in high-middle SDI regions. At the national level, New Zealand had the highest ASPR for both premenopausal and postmenopausal women, with values of 245.63 [95% UI (209.56, 279.91)] and 909.37 [95% UI (754.63, 1037.39)], respectively. Regional variations in population-level determinants of disease burden were identified. The risk and prognosis of malignant melanoma in women may differ by menopausal status due to the interplay of sex hormones and the immune system. Further research is needed to develop tailored screening and treatment strategies for women across diverse SDI regions and menopausal statuses.",

    "abstract": "Primary liver cancer (PLC) often presents with subtle early symptoms, leading to most diagnoses at advanced stages, which negatively impacts treatment outcomes. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-PTX) combined with Oxaliplatin (OXA) in the treatment of advanced PLC patients without surgical indications. A total of 126 patients with advanced PLC were divided into two treatment groups: the nab-PTX/OXA group (n=66) and the sorafenib (Sor)/OXA group (n=60), with a treatment cycle of 21 days. Clinical response rates, sleep quality (SQ), quality of life (QoL), prognosis, and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. The results indicated that, after treatment, the nab-PTX/OXA group demonstrated significantly higher objective response rate, sleep quality (PSQI score), and QoL (SF-36 score) compared to the Sor/OXA group (all P<0.05). Both groups demonstrated significant increases in Cluster of Differentiation 3-positive (CD3+) and CD4+ cell levels at Day 21 compared to Day 0 (P<0.05), with a greater increase observed in the nab-PTX/OXA group (P<0.05). Conversely, CD8+ cell levels were significantly decreased at Day 21 compared to Day 0 in both groups (P<0.05), with a more pronounced decrease in the nab-PTX/OXA group (P<0.05). Additionally, the CD4+/CD8+ ratio was significantly elevated at Day 21 compared to Day 0 in both groups (P<0.05), with a greater increase observed in the Sor/OXA group (P<0.05). Furthermore, the overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in the nab-PTX/OXA group were significantly longer than those in the Sor/OXA group (P<0.05). In the nab-PTX/OXA group, the incidence of abdominal pain and diarrhea, grade III-IV leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and liver and kidney dysfunction was significantly lower than that in the Sor/OXA group (P<0.05). In short, PTX combined with OXA demonstrated favorable efficacy in treating advanced PLC. This regimen not only improved SQ and QoL but also prolonged survival.",

It not only impairs wound healing but also delays postoperative treatment, adversely affecting patient survival rate and the overall quality of life. Thus, developing an accurate prediction model is crucial for early intervention and improving patient prognosis. To develop and validate a Nomogram model based on Logistic regression to assess the risk of postoperative flap necrosis in BC patients undergoing MRM. A retrospective study was conducted on 605 BC patients who underwent MRM. These patients were stratified into a training group (n=406) and a validation group (n=199) in a 33:67 ratio. Univariate and multivariate Logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors for flap necrosis, and a Nomogram prediction model was subsequently constructed. The model's discriminatory power (assessed via the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve), calibration accuracy (evaluated by calibration curve), and clinical benefit (analyzed through decision curve analysis) were comprehensively evaluated. Moreover, essential performance metrics such as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were systematically recorded and analyzed. Nine independent risk factors were identified, including age, body mass index (BMI), neutrophil count, hemoglobin level, drainage volume on the third postoperative day, axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM), surgical duration, intraoperative bleeding volume, and drainage duration. The area under the curve (AUC) of the Nomogram model was 0.898 in the training group and 0.886 in the validation group, indicating good discriminatory capacity. Calibration curves demonstrated good agreement between predicted values and actual values, with P-values for goodness-of-fit of 0.1761 (training) and 0.0648 (validation), respectively. Decision curve analysis revealed significant clinical benefits, with maximum benefit rates of 76.84% (training) and 80.40% (validation), respectively. The Nomogram model developed in this study accurately predicts flap necrosis risk in BC patients post-MRM, offering significant clinical utility for risk management and improved patient outcomes.",

The current therapeutic management combining chemotherapy and surgery remains partially inefficient. OS are very heterogeneous tumors, evolving in a complex and specific highly vascularized microenvironment. Upon microenvironmental signals, remodeling of tumor vessels may occur through angiogenic processes but also through endothelial differentiation process namely the endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). In a patient cohort of ten high-grade OS samples (at diagnosis, after surgery, and/or metastasis), we detected by a multiplexing immunohistochemistry approach the presence of endothelial cells co-expressing endothelial CD31/EMCN and mesenchymal ASMA/FSP1 markers. In order to partially mimic an OS microenvironment in vitro, we exposed human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to secreted factors of OS tumor or stromal cells. In this cellular model, we established that the secretome from stromal cells did not induce EndoMT in primary ECs. Nevertheless, soluble factors from the OS cell line KHOS were able to induce in ECs some of the EndoMT hallmarks such as induction of mesenchymal markers associated to increased migration, but without inhibition of tubulogenesis. In conclusion, this study identified the presence of endothelial-mesenchymal cells in the tumor microenvironment of OS patients and give cues for further investigation of the regulation and consequences of this remodeling in the biology of OS.",

Prognostic factors were analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model. Propensity score matching (PSM) at a ratio of 4:1 and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were employed for analysis. The prevalence of HAS in this cohort was 1.1%. Among the 84 HAS patients with a median follow-up of 28 months, 47.6% had serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels exceeding 20 ng/mL. During the follow-up period, 44.0% of patients experienced relapses, predominantly through hepatic metastasis (62.2%). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified preoperative serum AFP levels between 200-500 ng/mL and TNM stages III/IV as independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). Elevated preoperative levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and TNM stages III/IV were independently associated with poorer disease-free survival (DFS). Conversely, open surgery and a Ki-67 proliferation index exceeding 50% were found to act as protective factors for both OS and DFS, with postoperative chemotherapy improving OS outcomes. After PSM adjustment, the analysis included 248 non-HAS patients and 62 HAS patients, revealing significantly better OS (P=0.043) and DFS (P=0.009) among non-HAS patients. Open radical surgery followed by adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for the treatment of resectable HAS. Overall, patients with HAS exhibit a less favorable prognosis compared to those with non-HAS.",

The objective of the study is to identify the drugs that enhance anti-tumor activity of cisplatin (CDDP) in SCLC. Firstly, by a high-throughput drug screening, we found that disulfiram (DSF), a FDA-approved drug that is used to treat alcohol addiction, was able to sensitize CDDP-induced apoptosis in SCLC. RNA-seq analysis revealed that cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) was a potential target of combination treatment of DSF and CDDP in SCLC. CDDP treatment induced CBS expression, while the elevation of CBS expression was down-regulated by DSF and CDDP co-treatment in SCLC. Importantly, the down-regulation of CBS by siRNA silence increased CDDP-induced cellular apoptosis in SCLC. Furthermore, the study found that DSF combined with CDDP decreased the H2S level, and increased the level of ROS. The elevation of H2S level reduced the growth inhibition of SCLC cells by DSF and CDDP co-treatment. Finally, in nude mice bearing SCLC xenografts, DSF and CDDP co-treatment exhibited remarkable anti-tumor activity against SCLC tumors, evidenced by the significant reduction of tumor size, tumor weight and Ki-67 expression as compared with single treatment alone. Therefore, the study indicated that DSF could be re-purposed to potentiate CDDP-induced anti-tumor activity in SCLC, which are worth immediate assessment for SCLC in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Oridonin, a bioactive diterpenoid isolated from Rabdosia species, exhibits broad-spectrum anticancer activity across various tumor types. However, its impact on colon cancer and the underlying molecular mechanisms remains poorly understood. Our study revealed that oridonin significantly suppressed the proliferation of HCT8 and HCT116 colon cancer cells by inducing G2/M phase cell cycle arrest. Moreover, oridonin triggered apoptotic cell death, as indicated by elevated levels of cleaved caspase-3 and PARP. Simultaneously, it activated autophagy, as evidenced by increased expression of Beclin 1 and LC3-II, along with decreased LC3-I and p62 levels. In addition, inhibiting autophagy with 3-methyladenine (3-MA) reduced cell apoptosis, whereas blocking apoptosis using Z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-FMK (Z-VAD-FMK) enhanced autophagy. Furthermore, oridonin also induced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which contributed to apoptosis; this effect was largely reversed by the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Mechanistically, oridonin increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and suppressed phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1). Silencing AMPK with siRNA blocked oridonin's effects on the AMPK/mTOR pathway, as well as its regulation of autophagy and apoptosis. Moreover, co-treatment with NAC almost completely blocked activation of the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway. In vivo, oridonin significantly suppressed tumor growth in a xenograft model, accompanied by elevated expression of LC3-II and cleaved caspase-3. Collectively, these findings demonstrated that oridonin could exert potent anti-tumor effects in colon cancer by inducing cell cycle arrest and promoting autophagy-dependent apoptosis via ROS-mediated activation of the AMPK-mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Cancer's insidious reach extends far beyond its initial site, particularly manifesting in the skeleton, where it precipitates a spectrum of pathological conditions ranging from bone metastases and cachexia to primary bone cancers. This review highlights the critical impact of cancer on skeletal health, including the development of bone metastases, cachexia, and primary bone cancers, underscoring the importance of understanding the complex interaction between cancer and the bones. It emphasizes the global burden of cancer and its skeletal complications, which severely affect quality of life. The article reviews the prevalence of bone metastases in various cancers, such as breast, prostate, lung, renal cancers, and multiple myeloma, and stresses the need for targeted treatments. It also discusses the mechanisms behind tumor spread to bones and the systemic effects of cancer, including reduced bone mineral density and increased fracture risk, even without direct bone invasion. The challenges posed by primary bone cancers, which are rarer but highly aggressive, are also examined, highlighting the role of genetics and molecular research in treatment development. The review calls for a multidisciplinary approach to manage the severe symptoms of cancer-induced bone damage and explores the potential of personalized medicine to improve treatment outcomes. It concludes by advocating for continued research and collaboration to develop more precise and personalized therapies for cancer-related bone issues, aiming to improve the lives of those affected.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common malignancy in females with an increasing incidence in the last decade. The previously observed decline in BC mortality rates has also slowed down recently with an increase in the incidence of invasive BC. BC has various molecular subtypes. Among these subtypes, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents the most aggressive BC, with a poor prognosis. Because lack of the hormonal or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptors, TNBC is resistant to hormonal and HER2 targeted therapy effective for other BC subtypes. The good news is that TNBC has recently been considered an immunologically 'hot' tumor. Therefore, immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, represents a promising therapeutic approach TNBC. However, a considerable percentage of patients with TNBC do not respond well to immunotherapy, indicating that TNBC seems to adopt several mechanisms to evade immune surveillance. Thus, it is crucial to investigate the mechanisms underlying TNBC immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy. In this review, we examine and discuss the most recently discovered mechanisms for BC, with a particular focus on TNBC, to evade the immune surveillance via kidnapping the immune checkpoints, suppressing the immune responses in tumor microenvironment and inhibiting the tumor antigen presentation. Evaluation of these mechanisms in BC will hopefully guide future immunotherapeutic research and clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic dysregulation is a hallmark of kidney cancer, yet the causal roles of specific metabolites in its major subtypes remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the causal relationships between circulating metabolites and the three primary subtypes of kidney cancer - clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), papillary RCC (pRCC), and chromophobe RCC (chRCC) - and to identify potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets. A total of 1,400 circulating metabolites and metabolic ratios were evaluated as exposures, with kidney cancer outcomes derived from the FinnGen database. Genetic instruments were selected from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and harmonized with outcome data. Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method as the primary approach, supported by multiple sensitivity analyses, including Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger regression, leave-one-out analysis, and MR-PRESSO. To correct for multiple testing, metabolites were stratified into absolute levels and metabolic ratios, and the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) procedure was applied separately within each category. Causally associated metabolites were further analyzed via KEGG pathway enrichment. For clinical validation, untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed on paired tumors and adjacent normal tissues from 48 patients with ccRCC. In total, 85 metabolites were found to be causally associated with kidney cancer, including 57 for ccRCC, 71 for pRCC, and 51 for chRCC. After FDR correction, three metabolites remained statistically significant: carnitine (overall RCC: OR = 1.25, PFDR = 0.032), trigonelline (overall RCC: OR = 1.25, PFDR = 0.049), and gamma-glutamylthreonine (chRCC: OR = 2.90, PFDR = 0.012). KEGG analysis revealed significant enrichment in the valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis pathway for ccRCC (P = 1.2 × 10-5), and pyrimidine metabolism for chRCC (P = 6.5 × 10-6). Metabolomic profiling of ccRCC tissues confirmed aberrant levels of seven metabolites, including elevated 2-hydroxyglutarate (fold change [FC] = 3.1, P = 0.001) and reduced citrate (FC = 0.4, P = 0.001), both associated with disease progression. In conclusion, this integrative study identified carnitine and trigonelline as potential contributors to RCC progression, while gamma-glutamylthreonine appears to be specifically involved in chRCC pathogenesis. Additionally, altered expression of sphingosine 1-phosphate, acetylcarnitine, gamma-glutamylglutamine, and N-acetylcytidine in ccRCC highlights key metabolic disruptions and underscores their potential as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets in kidney cancer.",

This study investigated the roles and mechanisms of HECW2 in IH development. Our investigation revealed that HECW2 was up-regulated in proliferative and involuting IH tissues compared with normal adjacent tissues. Hemangioma endothelial cells (HemECs) were isolated and transfected with over-expressed HECW2 or knockdown plasmids. Functional studies demonstrated that HECW2 over-expression facilitated proliferation, migration, invasion as well as inhibited apoptosis in HemECs. Furthermore, over-expressed HECW2 markedly promoted glycolysis in HemECs, as evidenced by increased glucose uptake, lactate production, and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation. In contrast, HECW2 knockdown showed the opposite results. Mechanistically, HECW2 regulated the ubiquitination of AlkB homolog 5 (ALKBH5), subsequently enhancing the expression of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) through ALKBH5-mediated m6A demethylation of LDHA mRNA. HECW2 knockdown suppressed glycolysis and tumor-like cellular behaviors in HemECs, which were abrogated by LDHA over-expression. Additionally, in vivo validation using an IH xenograft mouse model demonstrated that HECW2 knockdown significantly suppressed tumor growth. These findings established HECW2 as a key regulator in IH progression through the regulation of ALKBH5/LDHA-mediated glycolysis, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target for IH treatment.",

    "abstract": "The development of new therapeutics for colorectal cancer (CRC) is urgently needed to address the limitations of current treatments. This study was performed to investigate the anticancer activity of cynaropicrin (a natural product) in CRC HCT116 cells and an oxaliplatin (Ox)-resistant HCT116 strain (HCT116-OxR). MTT cell viability assays showed that cynaropicrin inhibited the growth of HCT116 and HCT116-OxR cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Cynaropicrin also induced apoptosis, as identified by an Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining, and this apoptosis was accompanied by the phosphorylations of JNK and p38 MAPK. In addition, treatment with the kinase-specific inhibitors SP600125 and SB203580 confirmed that this apoptosis was mediated by JNK and p38 MAPK. Flow cytometry analysis using the CellROX™ kit showed cynaropicrin increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and N-acetylcysteine pretreatment confirmed ROS mediated the cytotoxicity of cynaropicrin. Flow cytometry with propidium iodide staining and western blot analysis indicated that cynaropicrin induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase by modulating cell cycle regulators, and western blot analysis revealed that cynaropicrin altered the balance of Bcl-2 family proteins. Also, flow cytometry using the Muse™ Multi-Caspase Kit showed cynaropicrin activated multiple caspases, the crucial roles of which were confirmed using the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. In conclusion, cynaropicrin demonstrated anticancer activity against CRC cells by elevating ROS levels, activating JNK and p38 MAPK, and inducing cell cycle arrest leading to apoptosis. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the therapeutic potential of cynaropicrin in CRC.",

Outcome measures included ICU-AW incidence, muscle strength Medical Research Council (MRC) scores, upper/lower limb strength, Barthel Index Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II scores, duration of ICU and hospital stay, mechanical ventilation time, complications, and patient satisfaction. Predictive variables for ICU-AW were also analyzed. On days 4 and 7 post-intervention, ICU-AW incidence was significantly lower in the observation group (both P < 0.05). MRC scores, limb muscle strength, Barthel Index, and satisfaction were significantly higher in the observation group (all P < 0.05), while SOFA, APACHE II scores, ICU stay, hospital stay, and ventilation duration were significantly lower (all P < 0.05). SOFA scores declined from day 5, with lower values in the observation group (P < 0.05). The risk of ICU-AW in the observation group was a significant reduction in risk than in the control group (OR = 0.067, 95% CI: 0.005-0.606, P = 0.017). No significant differences in complications were observed (P > 0.05). MDT-based cardiopulmonary rehabilitation significantly improves muscle strength, functional status, and patient satisfaction, while reducing ICU-AW incidence, ICU and hospital stay, and ventilation duration.

As a core subunit of the SF3b complex, SF3b4 participates in regulating alternative splicing, and its abnormal expression is linked to the onset of malignant tumors. However, the role of SF3b4 in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains undefined. This study demonstrates that in CRC, E1A binding protein p300 (EP300) and CREB binding protein (CREBBP) regulate SF3b4 expression by activating Histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) on the SF3b4 promoter. Additionally, enhanced autophagy counteracts the proliferation-inhibitory effect of SF3b4 knockdown in CRC cells. Implications Statement: SF3b4 may promote CRC proliferation by enhancing cellular autophagy. SF3b4 acts as a potential oncogene in CRC tumorigenesis and progression. SF3b4 serves as a promising prognostic biomarker for CRC.",

Rechallenging RAS/BRAF-wild-type tumours with an anti-EGFR antibody in combination with FTD-TPI is emerging, yet the two strategies have not been directly compared. We retrospectively identified consecutive RAS/BRAF-wild-type, chemotherapy-refractory mCRC patients treated at National Taiwan University Hospital between December 2018 and March 2023. All had received first-line anti-EGFR therapy; subsequent treatment comprised FTD-TPI with either anti-EGFR rechallenge (n = 20) or an anti-VEGF agent (n = 10). Anti-EGFR rechallenge yielded a higher objective response rate (30% vs 0%; P = 0.074) and disease-control rate (70% vs 30%; P = 0.440), plus numerically longer median progression-free (3.4 vs 2.3 months; P = 0.524) and overall survival (12.7 vs 9.9 months; P = 0.644). After adjustment for age, sex, tumour sidedness and time from metastatic diagnosis to FTD-TPI, anti-EGFR therapy remained the only independent predictor of response (posterior OR ≈ 7; 95% credible interval 1.1-66). These data suggest that FTD-TPI plus anti-EGFR rechallenge provides greater tumour shrinkage and at least comparable survival versus FTD-TPI plus anti-VEGF in heavily pre-treated, wild-type mCRC, supporting further prospective evaluation.",

Among the eight members, PLEKHA6 was uniquely overexpressed in LUAD tissues and significantly associated with poor prognosis. Integrated bulk RNA-Seq, single-cell RNA-Seq, DNA methylation, and pharmacogenomic analyses identified PLEKHA6 as a key modulator of oncogenic processes, including Wnt/β-catenin signaling, cadherin-mediated adhesion, and cytoskeletal remodeling. Functional assays in A549 LUAD cells revealed that PLEKHA6 knockdown suppressed β-catenin and VE-cadherin expression, leading to impaired proliferation, migration, and colony formation, along with enhanced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Single-cell RNA sequencing demonstrated a correlation between PLEKHA6 expression and tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) infiltration, implicating PLEKHA6 in immune remodeling within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Drug sensitivity analysis and molecular docking further identified potential therapeutic drugs targeting PLEKHA6-expressing LUAD cells.

We investigated PTBP1 expression in 533 ccRCC patients from TCGA and 30 ccRCC patients by immunohistochemistry, and found that PTBP1 expression levels were significantly increased in ccRCC tissues and that high PTBP1 expression was closely correlated with advanced tumor stage, AJCC stage and poor prognosis. Cell biological assays with siRNA-mediated knockdown and lentivirus vector-mediated over-expression demonstrated that PTBP1 promoted proliferation, migration and invasion in ccRCC cells in vitro. Furthermore, PTBP1 increased the transformation from pyruvate kinase muscle 1 (PKM1) to PKM2. Knockdown of PKM2 mainly abolished PTBP1-induced proliferation, migration and invasion in ccRCC cells in vitro.

Recently, it has caused extensive interest in researchers due to it has anti-cancer abilities in some types of carcinomas. However, the anti-cancer effect and mechanism of DHE in glioma remains unclear. The present study conducted to determine the biological effects of DHE on the glioblastoma cells, as well as the mechanisms underlying these effects. After treatment with DHE, the glioblastoma (U118, U251 or U87) cells were significantly inhibited in their viability, proliferation and migration. At the meantime, DHE also induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis by promoting the release of cytochrome c into cytosol, which activating caspase signaling pathway. Furthermore, our results fully demonstrate that DHE significantly suppressed COX-2 expression by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IKKβ via targeting the ATP-binding site, thereby abrogating NF-κB binding and p300 recruitment to COX-2 promoter. Moreover, the current study firstly demonstrated that DHE can cross blood-brain barrier (BBB). In addition, treatment with DHE markedly inhibited neoplastic weight and volume without the notable adverse effects in the xenograft nude mice model, and these effects may be mediated through inhibition of the IKKβ/NF-κB/COX-2 signaling pathway. These findings provide the pharmacological evidence for development of DHE as a potential agent against glioma.",

One reason is high expression in PDAC of the enzyme cytidine deaminase (CDA), which catabolizes decitabine within minutes. We therefore added tetrahydrouridine (THU) to inhibit CDA with decitabine. In this pilot clinical trial, patients with advanced chemorefractory PDAC ingested oral THU ~10 mg/kg/day combined with oral decitabine ~0.2 mg/kg/day, for 5 consecutive days, then 2X/week. We treated 13 patients with extensively metastatic chemo-resistant PDAC, including 8 patients (62%) with ascites: all had received ≥ 1 prior therapies including gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in 9 (69%) and FOLFIRINOX in 12 (92%). Median time on THU/decitabine treatment was 35 days (range 4-63). The most frequent treatment-attributable adverse event was anemia (n=5). No deaths were attributed to THU/decitabine. Five patients had clinical progressive disease (PD) prior to week 8. Eight patients had week 8 evaluation scans: 1 had stable disease and 7 PD. Median overall survival was 3.1 months. Decitabine systemic exposure is expected to decrease neutrophil counts; however, neutropenia was unexpectedly mild. To identify reasons for limited systemic decitabine effect, we measured plasma CDA enzyme activity in PDAC patients, and found a > 10-fold increase in those with metastatic vs resectable PDAC. We concluded that CDA activity is increased not just locally but also systemically in metastatic PDAC, suggesting a need for even higher CDA-inhibitor doses than used here.",

    "abstract": "Brain tumors are one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers of the central nervous system. Of all diagnosed malignant tumors, 80% are gliomas. An unequivocal diagnosis of gliomas is not always simple, and there is a great need for research to find new treatment options and diagnostic approaches. This paper is focused on the glioma-related protein profiles as compared to healthy brain tissue, which is reflected in multiple correlations between biological aspects that influence proliferation, apoptosis evasion and the invasiveness of neoplastic cells. The work presents the possibilities of facilitating clinical practice with proteomic biomarkers, which offer a wider diagnostic spectrum and reduce the margin of mistake in histopathological or imaging diagnostic methods. In fact, many changes in the body's homeostasis can be overlooked due to the lack of symptoms or their non-specificity. Nevertheless, a single marker has limited reliability in distinguishing a particular tumor subtype, since the increased or decreased level of the protein of interest may differ between the stages or locations of the tumor. Moreover, the correlations between proposed proteins - presented in this paper - may help clinicians to choose the most optimal therapy, and estimate its effectiveness, or indicate new therapeutic targets affecting disrupted biochemical pathways.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) αβ T cell adoptive immunotherapy has shown great promise for improving cancer treatment. However, there are several hurdles to overcome for the wide clinical application of CAR-αβ T cells therapy, including side effects and a limited T cells source from cancer patients. Therefore, we sought to identify an alternative T cell subset that could avoid these limitations and improve the effectiveness of CAR-T immunotherapy. γδ T cells are a minor subset of T cells, which share the characteristic of innate immune cells and adaptive immune cells. Vγ9Vδ2 T cells are a predominant γδ T subset in the circulating peripheral blood. In this study, we investigated the antigen-specific antitumor activity of CAR-Vγ9Vδ2 T cells targeting MUC1-Tn antigen. Vγ9Vδ2 T cells were expanded from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of healthy volunteers with zoledronic acid and interleukin-2. CAR-Vγ9Vδ2 T cells were generated by transfection of lentivirus encoding MUC1-Tn CAR. Cytotoxicity assays with various cancer cell lines revealed that CAR-Vγ9Vδ2 T cells could effectively lyse tumor cells in an antigen-specific manner, with similar or stronger effects than CAR-αβ T cells. However, CAR-Vγ9Vδ2 T cells had shorter persistence, which could be improved with the addition of IL-2 to maintain the function of CAR-Vγ9Vδ2 T cells with consecutive stimulation of tumor cells. Using a xenograft mouse model, we further showed that CAR-Vγ9Vδ2 T cells more effectively suppressed tumor growth in vivo than Vγ9Vδ2 T cells. Therefore, MUC1-Tn CAR-modified Vγ9Vδ2 T cells may represent a novel, promising ready-to-use product for cancer allogeneic immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy plays an important role in the survival of cancer cells under stressful conditions, such as nutrient or oxygen deficiency. Therefore, autophagy inhibition is being considered as a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer. Decursin is a natural compound derived from Angelica gigas; it has been used in the treatment of various diseases, including cancer. However, the mechanism by which decursin regulates autophagy in gastric cancer and other carcinomas remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated that decursin reduced the growth and induced cell cycle arrest in gastric cancer cells in vitro. Decursin blocked autophagic flux by reducing the expression of lysosomal protein cathepsin C (CTSC) and attenuating its activity, thereby causing autophagic dysregulation (i.e., accumulation of LC3 and SQSTM1). Decursin also inhibited cell proliferation and cell cycle progression by inhibiting CTSC and E2F3, both of which were linked to gastric cancer aggressiveness. The antitumor effects of decursin were confirmed in vivo. We established spheroid and patient-derived organoid models and found that decursin decreased the growth of spheroids and patient-derived gastric organoids, as well as modulated the expression of CTSC and autophagy-related proteins. Hence, our findings uncovered a previously unknown mechanism by which decursin regulates cell growth and autophagy and suggests that decursin may act as a potential therapeutic agent that simultaneously inhibits cell growth and autophagy.",

    "abstract": "The recurrence rate remains high even under nucleos(t)ide analogues (NUCs) therapy in patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after resection. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prognostic role of HBsAg in patients undergoing surgical resection for HBV-related HCC in NUCs era. Consecutive 522 patients undergoing surgical resection for HBV-related HCC were retrospectively enrolled. Factors associated with early (within 2 years), late (year 2 to 5), very late (beyond 5 years) recurrence and early or late mortality (within or beyond 5 years) were evaluated. During a median follow-up period of 59 months, 308 (59%), and 146 (28%) patients developed recurrence and mortality, respectively. HBsAg level did not correlate with early recurrence and mortality. By multivariate analyses, HBsAg >200 IU/mL (hazard ratio (HR)=1.778, P=0.037) and presence of cirrhosis (HR=2.157, P=0.001) were independent predictors of late recurrence, while HBsAg >50 IU/mL (HR=4.658, P=0.038), body mass index >25 kg/m2 (HR=2.720, P=0.013) and significant hepatic fibrosis (HR=2.509, P=0.039) were independent predictors of very late recurrence. HBsAg >50 IU/mL (HR=11.427, P=0.017), age >60 years (HR=2.688, P=0.006), albumin ≤3.5 g/dL (HR=4.739, P<0.001) and presence of cirrhosis (HR=2.781, P=0.006) were independent predictors of late mortality beyond 5 years. Combining these factors could well predict patients with minimal risk of long-term recurrence and mortality. In conclusion, tumor factors, liver function surrogate markers, metabolic factors and serum HBsAg levels play distinct roles in recurrence and survival at different time intervals after surgical resection for HBV-related HCC. Pre-operative HBsAg level is an important predictor of long-term recurrence and survival in patients with HBV-related HCC undergoing surgical resection.",

    "abstract": "Our study aimed to explore the value of applying the CT-based radiomic nomogram for predicting recurrence and/or metastasis (RM) of gastric stromal tumors (GSTs). During the past ten years, a total of 236 patients with GST were analyzed retrospectively. According to the postoperative follow-up classification, the patients were divided into two groups, namely non-recurrence/metastasis group (non-RM) and RM group. All the cases were randomly divided into primary cohort and validation cohort according to the ratio of 7:3. Standardized CT images were segmented by radiologists using ITK-SNAP software manually. Texture features were extracted from all segmented lesions, then radiomic features were selected and the radiomic nomogram was built using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. The clinical features with the greatest correlation with RM of GST were selected by univariate analysis, and used as parameters to build the clinical feature model. Eventually, model of radiomic and clinical features were fitted to construct the clinical + radiomic feature model. The performance of each model was evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). A total of 1223 features were extracted from all the segmentation regions of each case, and features were selected via the least absolute shrinkage and LASSO binary logistic regression model. After deletion of redundant features, four key features were obtained, which were used as the parameters to build a radiomic signature. The AUCs of radiomic nomogram in primary cohort and validation cohort were 0.816 and 0.946, respectively. The AUCs of clinical + radiomic feature model in primary cohort and validation cohort were 0.833 and 0.937, respectively. Using DeLong test, the differences of AUC values between radiomic nomogram and clinical + radiomic feature model in primary cohort (P = 0.840) and validation cohort (P = 0.857) were not statistically significant. To sum up, CT-based radiomic nomogram is of great potential in predicting the RM of GST non-invasively before operation.",

Thus, furthering our understanding of the mechanisms contributing to the lack of success of c-MET inhibitors in clinical trials is essential toward the development of rational and effective combination strategies. Here we show that exposure of NCSLC cell lines to c-MET inhibitor tivantinib increases their expression of PD-L1, which in turn causes cells to become more resistant to T-cell killing. Mechanistically, inhibition of c-MET suppresses p-GSK3β, leading to the stabilization of PD-L1 similar to that observed in liver cancer cells. Collectively, our findings suggest a potential crosstalk between c-MET inhibition and immune escape and provide a rationale for the combination therapy of c-MET inhibitors and immune checkpoint blockade in NSCLC.",

It is found that recurrent disease is finally observed in patients who occurred chemo-resistance after completely primary treatment. It is a challenge that monitoring treatment efficacy and tumor recurrence of CNS tumors are full of risks and difficulties by brain biopsies. However, the brain biopsies are considered as an invasive technique with low specificity and low sensitivity. In contrast, the liquid biopsy is based on blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) test, which is going to acceptable among the patients through it's minimally invasive and serial bodily fluids. The advantages of liquid biopsy are to follow the development of tumors, provide new insights in real time, and accurate medical care. The major analytical constituents of liquid biopsy contain the Circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating cell-free microRNAs (cfmiRNAs), and circulating exosomes. Liquid biopsy has been widely utilized in CNS tumors in recent years, and the CTCs and ctDNA have become the hot topics for researching. In this review, we are going to explain the clinical potential of liquid biopsy biomarkers in CNS tumor by testing circulating miRNAs and exosomes to evaluate diagnose, prognosis, and response to treatment.",

Pharmacological inactivation of BRD4 has recently been introduced as a promising anti-neoplastic approach that targets MYC oncogene expression. However, resistance against BRD4-targeting drugs has been described. We compared the efficacy of the small-molecule-type BET BRD inhibitor JQ1 with the recently developed BET protein degraders dBET1 and dBET6 in colon, breast, melanoma, ovarian, lung and prostate cancer cell lines. As determined by qPCR, all BRD4 targeting drugs dose-dependently decreased MYC expression, with dBET6 introducing the strongest downregulation of MYC. This correlated with the anti-proliferative activity of these drugs, which was at least one order of magnitude higher for dBET6 (IC50 0.001-0.5 µM) than for dBET1 or JQ1 (IC50 0.5-5 µM). Interestingly, when combined with commonly used cytotoxic therapeutics, dBET6 was found to promote anti-neoplastic effects and to counteract chemoresistance in most cancer cell lines. Moreover, JQ1 and both BET degraders strongly downregulated baseline and interferon-gamma induced expression of the immune checkpoint molecule PD-L1 in all cancer cell lines. Together, our data suggest that dBET6 outperforms first-generation BRD4 targeting drugs like dBET1 and JQ1, and decreases chemoresistance and immune resistance of cancer.",

We have sought to elucidate the role of collagen VI in promoting ovarian cancer tumor growth and metastasis. Here we examined the effects of collagen VI on ovarian carcinoma stromal progenitor cells (OCSPCs). Epithelial-like OCSPCs (epi-OCSPCs) and mesenchymal-like OCSPCs (msc-OCSPCs) were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Differentially expressed genes were integrated with survival-related genes using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data and confirmed in our samples. The roles of candidate genes and signaling pathways were further explored. We found that SKOV3/msc-OCSPCs possessed greater migration, invasion, and spheroid formation than SKOV3/epi-OCSPCs (P < 0.001). Expression of collagen alpha-3 (VI; COL6A3), which encodes collagen VI, was 90-fold higher in msc-OCSPCs than in epi-OCSPCs. Analysis of TCGA data and our samples indicated that high expression of COL6A3 was correlated with advanced-stage carcinoma (P < 0.01) and shorter overall survival (P < 0.01). In vitro, adding collagen VI, msc-OCSPCs, or knockdown collagen VI in msc-OCSPCs to epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) cells augmented or decreased invasion and spheroid formation. Tumor dissemination to the peritoneal cavity and lung in mice following intraperitoneal coinjection with msc-OCSPCs and SKOV3-Luc cells and intravenous injection with COL6A3 and ES2 cells derived spheroids was significantly greater compare to coinjection with SKOV3-Luc cells alone or in combination with msc-OCSPCs/shCOL6A3 cells and msc-OCSPCs and ES2 derived spheroids. Knockdown of COL6A3 abolished the expression of DNMT1, CDK4, CDK6, and p-Rb in msc-OCSPCs and EOC spheroids. In contrast, overexpression of COL6A3 enhanced the expression of CDK4, CDK6, and p-Rb in SKOV3 cells. EOC spheroid formation, invasion, tumor growth, and metastasis were inhibited when COL6A3 downstream signaling pathway was blocked using CDK4/6 inhibitor LEE011. Our results suggested that collagen VI regulates the CDK4/6-p-Rb signaling pathway and promotes EOC invasiveness, stemness, and metastasis.",

Several studies have indicated that abnormal chondroitin sulfate (CS) chains accumulate in breast cancer tissues; however, the functions and dysregulation of CS synthases are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that chondroitin polymerising factor (CHPF) is frequently upregulated in breast cancer tissues and that its high expression is positively associated with tumor metastasis, high stages, and short survival time. CHPF modulates CS formation in breast cancer cells. Additionally, we found that CHPF promotes tumor growth and metastasis accompanied by an increase in G-CSF levels and the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in tumor tissue. We revealed that tumor cell-derived G-CSF is co-localised with CS on the cell surface. Interestingly, our study is the first to identify that syndecan-4 (SDC4) is modified by CHPF and that it is involved in CHPF-mediated phenotypes. Moreover, breast cancer patients with high expression of both SDC4 and CHPF had worse overall survival compared to other subsets, which implied the synergistic effects of these two genes. In summary, our results indicated that the upregulation of CHPF in breast cancer contributes to the malignant behaviour of cancer cells, thereby providing novel insights on the significance of CHPF-modified SDC4 in breast cancer pathogenesis.",

In the last years, frailty has emerged as a good indicator of patient's functional reserve and it seems to be a predictor of negative outcomes in oncological patients. In this work, we analyzed the clinical utility of frailty as preoperative risk assessment tool in a brain tumor cohort from Donostia University Hospital (Spain). For that, we used several frailty tools consisting of questionnaires based on frailty phenotype (FRAIL scale), evaluating functional performance (Gait Speed) and a self-report questionnaire that includes variables related to the physical, cognitive and psychosocial domains of frailty (Tilburg Frailty Indicator). We identified a higher percentage of patients in vulnerable situation prior to surgery when using frailty tools compared to routine scales such as Karnosfky score and Barthel Index. Remarkably, patients diagnosed with malignant tumors were frailer and presented significant less six-month survival than patients with benign tumors by all the frailty scales abovementioned. In line with this, the vast majority of patients that became pre-frail or frail after neurosurgery (by FRAIL scale) harbored a malignant tumor. Moreover, frailty status significantly correlated with patient's mortality and autonomy, but not with the presence of postoperative outcomes in our cohort. Taken together, our results show that frailty measurement, mainly by FRAIL scale, is a useful tool to evaluate preoperative risk in brain tumor patients as well as patient's prognosis after neurosurgery.",

EMT plays a pivotal role in embryonic development, wound healing, tissue regeneration, organ fibrosis and cancer progression. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors TWIST1/2 are key EMT-inducing transcription factors that govern transcription of EMT-associated genes. Although regulation of TWIST1 activity and stability has been well studied, little is known about how TWIST2 is post-translationally regulated. Here we have identified ZNF451, a SUMO2/3 specific E3 ligase, as a novel regulator of TWIST2 in promoting its stability. ZNF451 directly binds to and SUMOylates TWIST2 at K129 residue, and consequently blocks ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of TWIST2. Ectopic expression of ZNF451 increases the protein level of TWIST2 in mammary epithelial cells, leading to increased expression of mesenchymal markers, whereas depletion of ZNF451 suppresses mesenchymal phenotypes. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that ZNF451 plays a vital role in EMT through SUMOylation-dependent stabilization of TWIST2.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance is one of the main causes of chemotherapy failure. Although several factors are involved in cancer drug resistant, the exporter pumps overexpression that mediates the drugs flow to outside the cells and reduces both the drugs intracellular concentration and effectiveness, has been one of the most important challenges. Overexpression of ABCC3, a member of the ABCC subfamily, has been strongly associated to the resistance to multiple drugs. ABCC3 has been found highly expressed in different types of cancers and is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to treatments. In this review, we summarize the molecular mechanisms involved in cancer drug resistance and discuss the current knowledge about the structure, function and role of ABCC3 in drug resistance, as well as, the expression status of ABCC3 in different types of cancer. We also provide evidences that place ABCC3 as a potential therapeutic target for improving the cancer treatment by focusing on the need of developing more effective cancer therapies to target ABCC3 in translational researches.",

    "abstract": "Hypertension is one of the most prevalent diseases in cardiology. The angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)/angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are widely used drugs to stabilize the blood pressure via inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Studies have found that the exposure to RAS inhibitors (RASi) can suppress the development of cancers via multimodal mechanisms and has attracted increased attentions in the recent past. Owing the potential of RASi to inhibit tumor growth, proliferation and metastasis, they are considered as the potential and exciting candidates to enhance the effect of chemo-radiotherapy and targeted therapy efficacy. However, there are conflicting reports as to the use of ARB/ACEI in all facets of tumor growth. In this study, we comprehensively summarize and review the potential mechanisms of RASi in cancer treatment, like inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, reduction of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and extracellular matrix (ECM), regulation of immune cells and improvement of hypoxia. Additionally, based on the basic and clinical experiments, we analyze the views and results regarding the role of RASi plays in tumor from genesis to recurrence, and certainly cancer treatment (chemo-radiotherapy and targeted therapy). In the last, not only do we discuss the prospects of using RASi to enhance cancer treatment efficacy but also point out the conflicting situation with the intention to give some directions and inspiration on this topic.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the major causes of cancer death among males worldwide. Our previous studies indicated that the proliferation of prostate cancer cells was reduced after BLM knockdown, however, the mechanism is still not clear. In this study, we identified a direct interaction between BLM and EZH2, which had extremely significantly positive correlations (P<0.001). In vitro, our research revealed that tumor growth was inhibited after EZH2 knockdown and that inhibition could be reversed by BLM overexpression; conversely, tumor growth was promoted after EZH2 overexpression, and promotion could be reversed by BLM knockdown. This suggests that BLM and EZH2 play important roles in the progression of prostate cancer cells. In vivo, the impact of BLM and EZH2 was investigated in mouse xenograft models, and the results showed that EZH2 could be regulated by BLM, which was consistent with our in vitro observations. Our results demonstrated that the expression of P53 is affected by the binding of BLM and EZH2 to the MDM2 promoter region. This finding indicated that EZH2 regulates the expression of MDM2 at the transcriptional level by interacting with BLM.",

    "abstract": "Our previous study introduced the oncogenic role of the long non-coding RNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) in endometrial cancer (EC). In this study, we aimed to construct a PVT1-centered competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network to outline a regulatory axis that might promote the malignant progression of advanced EC. Raw Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma (UCEC) datasets were collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and used for construction of the PVT1-centered ceRNA network. The ceRNA binding sites were established using dual-luciferase assays. FISH assays displayed the co-location of PVT1 and miR-612 in EC cells. Immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, qRT-PCR, and western blots were used to assess the expression of miR-612 and CENP-H in EC tissues, and their functions on biological behaviours were examined by a series of in vitro and in vivo assays. Molecule interactions were illustrated by co-transfection assays. The bioinformatics analysis showed that PVT1/miR-612/CENP-H/CDK1 axis played a vital role in the malignant progression of advanced EC. MiR-612 was downregulated in EC tissues and acted as a tumour suppressor to inhibit cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promote cell apoptosis. CENP-H was found overexpressed in EC tissues, and the expression level was correlated to diagnosis and prognosis of EC. Hyperactivated CENP-H promoted cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and inhibited cell apoptosis. Overexpressed CENP-H prevented the anti-tumour effects observed with upregulated miR-612; knockdown of miR-612 also suppressed the anti-tumour effects of downregulated PVT1. Knockdown of PVT1 together with upregulated miR-612 exerted the strongest anti-tumour effects in nude mice. These effects were mediated by CDK1 through modulation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In conclusion, the PVT1/miR-612/CENP-H/CDK1 axis promoted the malignant progression of advanced EC and could serve as a promising target for potential treatments.",

    "abstract": "Nivolumab monotherapy has a modest objective response rate (ORR) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To overcome the lack of biomarkers that predict delayed alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response beyond 4 weeks, we applied a novel 50-10 rule of AFP response for unresectable HCC patients under nivolumab monotherapy and proposed an algorithm based on on-treatment AFP reduction at different time-points. Ninety unresectable HCC patients who underwent nivolumab monotherapy in 2015-2019 were retrospectively recruited and divided into four classes: rapid AFP decrease of ≥ 50% of baseline at week 4 (class I), AFP changes within ± 50% of baseline at week 4 that later decreased to ≥ 10% of baseline (class II) or not (class III) at week 12, and rapid AFP increase of ≥ 50% of baseline at week 4 (class IV). ORR was 47.4%, 36.0%, 7.7%, and 5.0% in class I-IV patients, respectively. Rapid (class I) and delayed (class II) AFP responders had significantly higher ORR, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) than non-responders (class III and IV) (ORR: 40.9% vs. 6.5%, P<0.001; median OS: not reached vs. 9.6 months, log-rank P<0.001; median PFS: 9.6 vs. 2.8 months, log-rank P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, AFP response was an independent factor associated with good OS (hazard ratio [HR]=0.301, P=0.001) and PFS (HR=0.332, P<0.001). Moreover, AFP responders had higher ORR and better OS as well as PFS than non-responders, regardless of nivolumab as a first- or more than a second-line therapy (all P<0.05). In conclusion, the novel 50-10 rule of AFP response provides practical guidance for nivolumab monotherapy in unresectable HCC patients. However, this algorithm remains to be verified in a large prospective cohort.",

This study conducted a retrospective analysis of NSCLC patients with EGFR mutant or concurrent PIK3CA mutations from January 2015 to October 2019 in the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University. Relative to EGFR alone mutations (Single-Mt), we found that NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations coexisting with PIK3CA mutations (Double-Mt) treated with EGFR-TKIs had a shorter median time to progression (TTP): 7.8 months versus 10.9 months (Double-Mt versus Single-Mt, P = 0.001), and decrease in median overall survival (OS): 20.6 months versus 32.4 months (P < 0.001). The objective response rate (ORR) between Double-Mt and Single-Mt was 36.7% versus 61.9% (P = 0.044), disease control rates (DCR) was 80.1% versus 91.7% (P = 0.179).

    "abstract": "Actin is the most abundant protein in almost all the eukaryotic cells. Actin amino acid sequences are highly conserved and have not changed a lot during the progress of evolution, varying by no more than 20% in the completely different species, such as humans and algae. The network of actin filaments plays a crucial role in regulating cells' cytoskeleton that needs to undergo dynamic tuning and structural changes in order for various functional processes, such as cell motility, migration, adhesion, polarity establishment, cell growth and cell division, to take place in live cells. Owing to its fundamental role in the cell, actin is a prominent regulator of cell division, a process, whose success directly depends on morphological changes of actin cytoskeleton and correct segregation of duplicated chromosomes. Disorganization of actin framework during the last stage of cell division, known as cytokinesis, can lead to multinucleation and formation of polyploidy in post-mitotic cells, eventually developing into cancer. In this review, we will cover the principles of actin regulation during cell division and discuss how the control of actin dynamics is altered during the state of malignancy.",

    "abstract": "Distant metastasis is an important prognostic factor for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). It involves the direct spread of tumor cells through blood vessels or via lymph nodes; however, there are currently no well-established treatments for its prevention in patients with OSCC. To investigate the impact of metronomic neoadjuvant chemotherapy on OSCC, we conducted a retrospective analysis of the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 alone. Fifty-four patients underwent up-front surgery, while 106 received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 alone. A serious adverse event occurred in one of patient treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (1%); however, all patients underwent resection. The 5-year overall survival rate was higher with S-1 than with up-front surgery (96% vs. 81%, P = 0.002). Moreover, neoadjuvant chemotherapy significantly increased the overall survival rate of patients with poorly or moderately differentiated tumors, but not those with well-differentiated tumors. By analyzing a cohort of 523 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas, we identified genetic variants associated with histological differentiation. The frequency of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants or deletions in 5 genes associated with HNSCC correlated with histological differentiation, some of which indicated the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in well-differentiated HNSCC. The vessel marker CD31 was highly expressed in poorly differentiated OSCC, whereas the anti-angiogenic molecule, LCN2, which is induced by the activation of the Wnt pathway, was highly expressed in well-differentiated OSCC. The present study showed that overall survival rates were higher in patients with poorly or moderately differentiated OSCC who received metronomic neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which was attributed to a difference in angiogenesis based on the characteristic landscape of pathogenic mutations according to histological differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Although epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) have been effective targeted therapies for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), most advanced NSCLC inevitably develop resistance to these therapies. Combination therapies emerge as valuable approach to preventing, delaying, or overcoming disease progression. Duloxetine, an antidepressant known as a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, is commonly prescribed for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. In the present study, we investigated the combined effects of duloxetine and EGFR-TKIs and their possible mechanism in NSCLC cells. Compared with either monotherapy, the combination of duloxetine and EGFR-TKIs leads to synergistic cell death. Mechanistically, duloxetine suppresses 70-kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (p70S6K1) activity through mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), and this effect is associated with the synergistic induction of cell death of duloxetine combined with EGFR-TKIs. More importantly, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-induced regulated in development and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1) is responsible for the suppression of mTORC1/S6K1 activation. Additionally, we found that the combination effect was significantly attenuated in REDD1 knockout NSCLC cells. Taken together, our findings reveal that the ATF4/REDD1/mTORC1/S6K1 signaling axis, as a novel mechanism, is responsible for the synergistic therapeutic effect of duloxetine with EGFR-TKIs. These results suggest that combining EGFR-TKIs with duloxetine appears to be a promising way to improve EGFR-TKI efficacy against NSCLC.",

Data of 1048 patients with digestive system tumors admitted to Shanxi Provincial People's Hospital (College of Shanxi Medical University) from January 2020 to January 2023 were retrospectively analyzed, and 845 cases were screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The patients were divided into a training group (586 patients), and a validation group (259 patients), then feature selection was performed using six models, including Lasso regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Logistics. Predictive models were subsequently constructed from column-line plots, and the predictive validity of the models was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves, precision-recall curves, and decision-curve analysis. In the model comparison, the XGBoost model showed the largest area under the curve (AUC) on the validation set (P < 0.05), demonstrating excellent predictive performance and generalization ability. We selected the common characteristic factors in the six models to further develop the column line plots to assess the DVT risk. The model performed well in clinical validation and effectively differentiated high-risk and low-risk patients. The differences in BMI, procedure time, and D-dimer were statistically significant between patients in the thrombus group and those in the non-thrombus group (P < 0.05). However, the AUC of the Xgboost model was found to be greater than that of the column chart model by the Delong test (P < 0.05). BMI, procedure time, and D-dimer are critical predictors of DVT risk in patients with digestive system tumors. Our model is an adequate assessment tool for DVT risk, which can help improve the prevention and treatment of DVT.",

This study aimed to unravel the spectrum of DNA repair gene mutations in Pakistani UCEC patients through Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and explore their potential functional consequences via downstream analyses. NGS analysis of genomic DNA from 30 UCEC patients was conducted to identify clinically significant pathogenic mutations in DNA repair genes. This analysis revealed mutations in 4 key DNA repair genes: BRCA1, BRCA2, APC, and CDH1. Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis was employed to assess the prognostic value of these mutations on patient overall survival (OS) in UCEC. To delve into the functional impact of these mutations, we performed RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and western blot analyses on the mutated UCEC samples compared to their non-mutated counterparts. These results unveiled the up-regulation in the expression of the mutated genes, suggesting a potential association between the identified mutations and enhanced gene activity. Additionally, targeted bisulfite sequencing analysis was utilized to evaluate DNA methylation patterns in the promoters of the mutated genes. Strikingly, hypomethylation in the promoters of BRCA1, BRCA2, APC, and CDH1 was observed in the mutated UCEC samples relative to the non-mutated, indicating the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the altered gene expression. In conclusion, this study offers insights into the genetic landscape of DNA repair gene mutations in Pakistani UCEC patients. The presence of pathogenic mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, APC, and CDH1, coupled with their down-regulation and hypermethylation, suggests a convergence of genetic and epigenetic factors contributing to genomic instability in UCEC cells. These findings enhance our understanding of UCEC susceptibility and provide potential avenues for targeted therapeutic interventions in Pakistani UCEC patients.",

    "abstract": "Multimorbidity, the presence of a chronic condition in addition to cancer, is of particular importance to cancer survivors.It has an impact on the progression, stage at diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of cancer patients.Evidence is scarce on the prevalence of specific comorbidities in survivors of different cancers to inform prevention and management of multimorbidity.The objective of this study is to address this evidence gap by using large scale electronic health data from multiple linked UK healthcare databases to examine the prevalence of multimorbidity in 28 cancer sites.For this population-based cross-sectional study, we linked primary and secondary healthcare data from the UK Clinical Research Practice Datalink (CPRD) GOLD dataset and Hospital Episode Statistics (HES).We identified survivors of 28 common cancers aged 18 years or older at diagnosis who survived 2 years of cancer and compared their multimorbidity with matched controls without a history of cancer.To compare prevalence of individual comorbidity, multivariable logistic regression models, adjusted for confounding factors were used.Between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2020, we identified 347,028 cancer survivors and 804,299 controls matched on age, sex and general practice.Cancer survivors had a higher prevalence of multimorbidity compared to non-cancer controls across all the cancer sites.Hypertension (56.2%), painful conditions (39.8%), osteoarthritis (38.0%), depression (31.8%) and constipation (31.4%) were the five most frequent chronic conditions reported.Compared to the controls, higher odds of constipation were found in survivors of 25 of the 28 cancer sites and higher odds of anaemia were found in 23 cancer sites.Prevalence of constipation, anaemia and painful conditions were higher after cancer diagnosis compared to before diagnosis.Since these comorbidities are not uniformly assessed as part of any of the comorbidity scales, they tend to be underreported among cancer survivors.The elevated risk of certain comorbidities in cancer survivors suggests the potential for preventative efforts in this population to lower disease burden and improve quality of life.Long-term conditions should not be viewed as the inevitable result of cancer diagnosis and treatment.We need to consider integrated management of chronic conditions tailored to specific cancers to improve cancer survivorship.",

    "abstract": "Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 10 million fatalities occurred in 2023. Breast cancer (BC) ranked first among malignancies with 2.26 million cases, lung cancer (LC) second with 2.21 million cases, and colon and rectum cancers (CC, CRC) third with 1.93 million cases. These results highlight the importance of investigating novel cancer prognoses and anti-cancer markers. In this study, we investigated the potential effects of alpha-2 macroglobulin and its receptor, LRP1, on the outcomes of breast, lung, and colorectal malignancies. Immunohistochemical staining was used to analyze the expression patterns of A2M and LRP1 in 545 cases of invasive ductal breast carcinoma (IDC) and 51 cases of mastopathies/fibrocystic breast disease (FBD); 256 cases of non-small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs) and 45 cases of non-malignant lung tissue (NMLT); and 108 cases of CRC and 25 cases of non-malignant colorectal tissue (NMCT). A2M and LRP1 expression levels were also investigated in breast (MCF-7, BT-474, SK-BR-3, T47D, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-231/BO2), lung (NCI-H1703, NCI-H522, and A549), and colon (LS 180, Caco-2, HT-29, and LoVo) cancer cell lines. Based on our findings, A2M and LRP1 exhibited various expression patterns in the examined malignancies, which were related to one another. Additionally, the stroma of lung and colorectal cancer has increased levels of A2M/LRP1 areas, which explains the significance of the stroma in the development and maintenance of tumor homeostasis. A2M expression was shown to be downregulated in all types of malignancies under study and was positively linked with an increase in cell line aggressiveness. Although more invasive cells had higher levels of A2M expression, an IHC analysis showed the opposite results. This might be because exogenous alpha-2-macroglobulin is present, which has an inhibitory effect on several cancerous enzymes and receptor-dependent signaling pathways. Additionally, siRNA-induced suppression of the transcripts for A2M and LRPP1 revealed their connection, which provides fresh information on the function of the LRP1 receptor in A2M recurrence in cancer. Further studies on different forms of cancer may corroborate the fact that both A2M and LRP1 have high potential as innovative therapeutic agents.",

The novel tripartite motif (TRIM) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases have been reported to play crucial roles in the development, growth, and metastasis of various tumors. The TRIM family member TRIM27 acts as a potential promoter of tumor development in a wide range of cancers. However, little is known regarding the biological features and clinical relevance of TRIM27 in glioblastoma (GBM). Here, we report findings of elevated TRIM27 expression in GBM tissues and GBM cell lines. Further functional analysis showed that TRIM27 deletion inhibited GBM cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that TRIM27 promoted the growth of GBM cells by enhancing the Warburg effect. Additionally, the inactivation of the LKB1/AMPK/mTOR pathway was critical for the oncogenic effects of TRIM27 in GBM. Mechanistically, TRIM27 could directly bind to LKB1 and promote the ubiquitination and degradation of LKB1, which in turn enhanced the Warburg effect and GBM progression. Collectively, these data suggest that TRIM27 contributes to GNM pathogenesis by inhibiting the LKB1/AMPK/mTOR axis and may be a promising candidate as a potential diagnostic and therapeutic marker for patients with GBM.",

As the research on macrophages and cancer immunotherapy develops, the importance of appropriate research models becomes increasingly evident. The development of organoids has bridged the gap between traditional two-dimensional (2D) cultures and animal experiments. Recent studies have demonstrated that organoids exhibit similar physiological characteristics to the source tissue and closely resemble the in vivo genome and molecular markers of the source tissue or organ. However, organoids still lack an immune component. Developing a co-culture model of organoids and macrophages is crucial for studying the interaction and mechanisms between tumour cells and macrophages. This paper presents an overview of the establishment of co-culture models, the current research status of organoid macrophage interactions, and the current status of immunotherapy. In addition, the application prospects and shortcomings of the model are explained. Ultimately, it is hoped that the co-culture model will offer a preclinical testing platform for maximising a precise cancer immunotherapy strategy.",

    "abstract": "Poor oral health is an independent risk factor for upper-aerodigestive tract cancers, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Our previous findings suggest that high expression of toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, which recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS) released from periodontal pathogens, correlates with a poor prognosis after esophagectomy for ESCC. We therefore hypothesized that LPS influences cancer cell proliferation and disease progression in ESCC. We used 8 ESCC cell lines to investigate how LPS affects ESCC cell proliferation and migration activity. We also assessed mRNA and protein expression to determine how LPS affects cytokine production and whether blocking TLR4 signaling attenuates that effect. We also used a mouse xenograft model to investigate whether LPS upregulates ESCC tumor progression in vivo. We then determined whether C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) expression in clinical samples correlates with 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) in ESCC patients after esophagectomy. LPS significantly upregulated cell proliferation and migration in all ESCC lines. It also upregulated CCL2 production. In vivo, subcutaneous LPS administration significantly increased ESCC tumor volume in mice. In clinical samples, high CCL2 expression significantly correlated with 5-year OS and DSS. There was also a significant correlation between CCL2 and TLR4 expression status, suggesting the involvement of an LPS-TLR4-CCL2 cascade in clinical settings. LPS significantly upregulates cell proliferation and tumor progression through an LPS-TLR4-CCL2 cascade and influences prognosis after esophagectomy for ESCC. This suggests improving the oral environment has the potential to improve the prognosis of ESCC patients after esophagectomy.",

The Nrf2 upregulation can elevate the levels of antioxidant enzymes to support against damage and death. In spite of protective function of Nrf2 in the physiological conditions, the stimulation of Nrf2 in the cancer has been in favour of tumorigenesis. Since the dysregulation of molecular pathways and mutations/deletions are common in tumors, Nrf2 can be a promising therapeutic target. The Nrf2 overexpression can prevent cell death in tumor and by increasing the survival rate of cancer cells, ensures the carcinogenesis. Moreover, the induction of Nrf2 can promote the invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. The Nrf2 upregulation stimulates EMT to increase cancer metastasis. Furthermore, regarding the protective function of Nrf2, its stimulation triggers chemoresistance. The natural products can regulate Nrf2 in the cancer therapy and reverse drug resistance. Moreover, nanostructures can specifically target Nrf2 signaling in cancer therapy. The current review discusses the potential function of Nrf2 in the proliferation, metastasis and drug resistance.

Cancer cells are characterized with genetic instability and abundant somatic mutations, leading to the production of tumor specific antigens (TSA) called neoantigens. The main goal of neoantigen-based cancer vaccines is to activate the immune system and elicit effective tumor-specific T-cell responses. There have been no reports of advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cases achieving partial remission after personalized mRNA (messenger RNA) vaccine treatment. As personalized neoantigen-based immunotherapies are emerging, here we report a 67-year-old male patient diagnosed with ESCC and multiple enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes, where mRNA vaccines were used for the first time. Tissue samples from the recurrence focus in the esophagus were subjected to whole transcriptome sequencing. The neoantigens were identified by bioinformatics analyses. The top 20 neoantigens were selected to compose the polyneoantigen vaccine, which were administered at 1 mg every 3 weeks for 4 cycles in combination with a PD-1 (programmed death-1) inhibitor. The patient was boosted with a single dose of the PD-1 inhibitor 8 weeks after the 4th cycle. In addition, immune responses were evaluated before and after the 4 cycles of vaccine therapy, and the lesions were evaluated by imaging examination. Our results revealed that neoantigen-based vaccines significantly activated the tumour-specific immune response. TCR (T cell receptor) V-J pairing analysis showed an increase in the abundance of oligoclonal TCRs, indicating improved homogeneity. No grade 3 or higher drug-related adverse events were observed, except for grade 4 thrombocytopenia caused by PD-1 inhibitor treatment. The patient achieved a partial response (PR), with a progression-free survival (PFS) time of 457 days, the OS (overall survival) time of 457 days, and DOR (duration of response) of 377 days. Our report suggests that combining the personalized mRNA vaccine therapy with PD-1 blockade therapy may be an effective treatment strategy for patient with advanced esophageal cancer. However, further clinical trials are necessary to confirm the efficacy and safety of personalized neoantigen-based immunotherapies in the treatment of advanced ESCC. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03468244 on March 16, 2018, and is now complete.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a multifactorial disease driven by acquired genetic and epigenetic changes that lead to aberrant regulation of cellular signaling pathways. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), a class of critical receptors, are involved in the initiation and progression of breast cancer. RTKs are cell surface receptors with unique structures and biological characteristics, which respond to environmental signals by initiating signaling cascades such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer, activator of transcription (STAT) pathway, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway. The critical role of RTKs makes them suitable targets for breast cancer treatment. Targeted therapies against RTKs have been developed in recent years, evaluated in clinical trials, and approved for several cancer types, including breast cancer. However, breast cancer displays molecular heterogeneity and exhibits different therapeutic responses to various drug types, leading to limited effectiveness of targeted therapy against RTKs. In this review, we summarize the structural and functional characteristics of selected RTKs and discuss the mechanisms and current status of drug therapy involving different protein tyrosine kinases in breast cancer progression.",

Pancreatic cancer harbors ~90% KRAS driver gene mutation frequency. Small molecules targeting KRAS G12C gained FDA approval for KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC. ONC212, a fluorinated imipridone with nM anti-cancer activity has preclinical efficacy against pancreatic cancer and other malignancies. MRTX1133, identified as a noncovalent selective KRAS G12D inhibitor that suppresses G12D signaling by binding to the switch II pocket thereby inhibiting protein-protein interactions. We investigated cell viability, drug synergies, pERK suppression and cytokine, chemokine or growth factor alterations following treatment with 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) or ONC212 plus MRTX1133 in 6 human CRC and 4 human pancreatic cancer cell lines. IC50 sensitivities ranged from 7 to 12 µM for 5-FU, 0.2-0.8 µM for ONC212, and > 100 nM to > 5,000 nM for MRTX1133 (G12D N = 4: LS513 > 100, HPAF-II > 1,000, SNUC2B > 5,000, PANC-1 > 5,000). For non-G12D, the range of IC50 for MRTX1133 was > 1,000 to > 5,000 nM for CRC lines with G12V, G13D, or WT KRAS (N = 7). Synergies between MRTX1133 plus 5-FU or ONC212 were observed regardless of KRAS G12D mutation with combination indices of < 0.5 indicating strong synergy. Observed synergies were greater with MRTX1133 plus ONC212 compared to MRTX1133 plus 5-FU. pERK was suppressed with mutant but not wild-type KRAS at nM MRTX1133 doses. Immunostimulatory profiles included reduction in IL8/CXCL8, MICA, Angiopoietin 2, VEGF and TNF-alpha and increase in IL-18/IL-1F4 with MRTX treatments and combinations. Our studies reveal preclinical activity of MRTX1133 alone or synergies when combined with 5-FU or ONC212 against mCRC and pancreatic cancer cells regardless of KRAS G12D mutation. The results suggest that KRAS G12V and KRAS G13D should be further considered in clinical trials including combination therapies involving MRTX1133 and 5-FU or ONC212.",

Photosensitizer Verteporfin has been proven as an inhibitor of YAP1 through preventing the combination of YAP1 with TEA domain transcription factor (TEAD). We showed previously that the total and phospho-levels of YAP1 were related to the clinical characteristics and outcomes in endometrial cancer (EC) patients, and that YAP1 promoted the proliferation and metastasis of EC cells in vitro cell line studies and in animal models. We also reported that Verteporfin inhibited cell growth and induced cell death through inhibiting YAP1 in EC in our previous study. However, the mechanism of how Verteporfin inhibits the function of YAP1 remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the global effects of Verteporfin on cell function by using Reverse Phase Protein Arrays (RPPA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Furthermore, we demonstrated that Verteporfin induced the SUMOylation of YAP1 for the first time. Interestingly, we found that the SUMOylation of YAP1 was regulated by YAP1 phosphorylation. Together, our study revealed a novel mechanism by which Verteporfin inhibits the function of YAP1 through regulating YAP1 SUMOylation. Our study may provide a rationale for the clinical use of Verteporfin in endometrial cancer by targeting YAP1.",

However, the biological functions of circular RNAs in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) tissues remain a mystery. In this study, we detected the function of circEEF2 (has-circ-0048559) in EOC tissues. Firstly, the basic characteristics including closed circular structure and spliced mature sequence length of circEEF2 were confirmed. The location and expression in EOC tissues was detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The regulatory effect of circEEF2 on autophagy, proliferation, and invasion were investigated in SKOV3 and A2780 cells. The relationship between circEEF2 and mir-6881-3p was confirmed using dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. The binding of circEEF2 with ANXA2 was confirmed using RNA-pulldown assay and MALDI-TOF-MS. We found that the expression level of circEEF2 was higher in EOC tissue than in normal tissue. CircEEF2 promoted autophagy, proliferation, and invasion. CircEEF2-regulated EOC proliferation and invasion are closely related to the occurrence of autophagy. Mechanistically, circEEF2 harbor miR-6881-3p to upregulate the latter's targets ATG5 and ATG7. Moreover, circEEF2 could directly bind with ANXA2 to inhibit the expression of p-mTOR. In conclusion, findings of the current study illustrate that circEEF2 promoted autophagy, proliferation, and invasion of EOC by interacting with miR-6881-3p and ANXA2.",

    "abstract": "Patients with advanced-stage colon cancer often exhibit resistance against treatment and distant metastasis, both key contributors to poor prognosis. Emerging evidence indicates that cancer stem cells (CSCs), characterized by the enhanced ability to self-renew, resist therapeutics, and promote metastasis, represents a clinical challenge to target. Alternative therapeutic approaches are urgently required. Here, we explored the feasibility of disrupting the intracellular communications between CSCs and the tumor microenvironment by way of exosomes. First, we demonstrated that exosomes secreted by colon tumorspheres (Exosp) promoted 5-FU resistance, migration, and tumorsphere formation. Exosp also increased the generation of cancer-associated fibroblasts and M2 polarized macrophages in vitro. Oncogenic molecules, including IL-6, p-STAT3, TGF-β1, and β-catenin, were identified as the cargoes of Exosp. Furthermore, the public database revealed the high abundance of miR-1246 in serum exosomes from colon cancer patients, and we verified in the Exosp from HCT116 and HT29 cells. Therapeutically, we demonstrated the ovatodiolide treatment reduced exosomal cargoes from tumorspheres (Exosp_OV). Exosp_OV were significantly less capable of promoting 5-FU resistance, migration, and tumorsphere formation when co-cultured with HCT116 and HT29 cells. Notably, Exosp_OV was less CAF- and M2 TAM-transformative. Computational docking analysis revealed that OV could bind and significantly reduced β-catenin activity. Finally, mouse xenograft data indicated that ovatodiolide suppressed tumor growth via down-regulating IL-6, STAT3, β-catenin expression, and serum exosomal miR-1246. In conclusion, our findings provided preclinical supports for ovatodiolide as a colon CSC inhibitor by reducing β-catenin/STAT3/miR-1246 signaling conveyed by CSC derived exosomes.",

However, the biological functions and regulatory mechanism have not been explored in cervical cancer. In our study, we used multiple approaches to determine the functions and underlying molecular mechanism of MEX3A in cervical tumorigenesis, including CCK-8 assay, BrdU assay, FACS for cell cycle and apoptosis, wound healing assay, Transwell migration and invasion assays, immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay, Transfection, real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. IHC results showed that the expression levels of MEX3A were decreased in cervical cancer patients with advanced clinical stages and lymph node involvement. Moreover, upregulation of MEX3A attenuated cell proliferation, migration and invasion and induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase in human cervical cancer cells, whereas knockdown of MEX3A exhibited the opposite effects. Mechanistically, MEX3A exerted its tumor suppressive functions via inactivation of Akt signaling pathway and inhibiting epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Importantly, Akt activation by its activator SC79 reversed the biological functions of MEX3A overexpression. Furthermore, MEX3A inhibited tumor growth in xenograft models. Overall, our investigation suggested that MEX3A participated in antitumor activity in cervical cancer by inhibition of the Akt signaling pathway and EMT. Hence, targeting MEX3A might have a therapeutic potential to treat cervical cancer.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells prone to utilize aerobic glycolysis other than oxidative phosphorylation to sustain its continuous cell activity in the stress microenvironment. Meanwhile, cancer cells generally suffer from genome instability, and both radiotherapy and chemotherapy may arouse DNA strand break, a common phenotype of genome instability. Glycolytic enzyme PFKFB3 (6-Phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase isoform 3), plays essential roles in variety physiology and pathology processes, and generally maintain high level in cancer cells. Although this protein has been reported to involve in genome instability, its role remains unclear and controversial. Here, we showed that PFK-15, a PFKFB3 inhibitor, obviously induced apoptosis, cell viability loss, and inhibited cell proliferation/migration. Besides, PFK-15 was also found to induce necroptosis, as it not only up-regulated the phosphorylated RIP1, RIP3 and MLKL, but also enhanced the interaction between RIP3 and RIP1/MLKL, all of which are characterization of necroptosis induction. Both genetically and pharmacologically deprivation of necroptosis attenuated the cytotoxic effect of PFK-15. Besides, PFK-15 increased the γ-H2AX level and micronuclei formation, markers for genome instability, and inhibition of necroptosis attenuated these phenotypes. Collectively, the presented data demonstrated that PFK-15 induced genome instability and necroptosis, and deprivation of necroptosis attenuated cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of PFK-15 in colorectal cancer cells, thereby revealing a more intimate relationship among PFKFB3, necroptosis and genome instability.",

In recent decades, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have attracted increasing attention and have been reported to play important roles in human cancers, making them ideal candidates for precise disease assessment and treatment. Our previous study found that the loss of linc00261 was significantly correlated with the malignant biological behaviors of HCC, particularly MVI, and serves as an excellent independent prognostic factor for recurrence-free survival. In this study, our in-depth research demonstrated that linc00261 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in liver cancer cells, thereby suppressing migration, invasion, and the formation of lung metastatic lesions. Moreover, linc00261 and its neighbor gene FOXA2 were positively correlated in HCC, the gain- and loss-of-function analyses indicated that linc00261 transcriptionally promotes the expression of FOXA2. Additionally, bioinformatic analysis and rescue assays confirmed that linc00261 partially suppresses migration, invasion, and EMT by upregulating FOXA2 expression. Molecular mechanism studies showed that linc00261 transcriptionally upregulates FOXA2 in cis by recruiting SMAD3. Finally, we identified EZH2 is responsible for linc00261 transcription repression via modulating trimethylation of H3K27 at Lys27 (H3K27Me3), both EZH2 and H3K27Me3 were negatively correlated with linc00261 expression in HCC. In conclusion, these findings demonstrated a crucial role of linc00261 in HCC metastasis, and that EZH2/linc00261/FOXA2 axis might reveal potential prognostic factors and be applied as therapeutic targets for HCC metastasis.",

Thus, this study aimed to analyze trends in treatment for prostate cancer in the U.S. from 2010 to 2015 and examine whether the treatment for the prostate cancer in the U.S. is compliant with clinical practice guidelines. Using joinpoint regression models, we examined trends in the rate and proportion of age-standardized utilization (ASUR and ASUP) of treatments for prostate cancer diagnosed during 2010-2015 in the U.S. based on the data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER, 2018 data-release, with linkage to active surveillance/watchful waiting [AS/WW]) cancer registry program. Among 316,690 men with prostate cancer diagnosed during 2010-2015, ASUR and ASUP for radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy, AS/WW and NOS treatment were 32.7, 34.4, 10.0 and 40.1 per 100,000, and 27.9%, 29.3%, 8.5% and 34.2%, respectively. Trends in the overall ASUR for prostate cancer treatments differed by cancer risk group, patients' age, race/ethnicity, Gleason score, insurance status, and the average education level, average poverty-level and foreign-born person percentage of the patient's residence-county, but not by rural-urban continuum or region.

As tumor biology influences the prognosis and clinical treatment, a deep understanding of how the molecular mechanisms regulate hormone sensitivity or resistance is critical in improving the efficacy and overcoming the endocrine resistance. This article comprehensively reviews the endocrine resistance in hormone-positive BC from a molecular and genetic perspective, encompassing the updated treatment and developing direction. This review includes the mechanisms of hormone resistance, which vary from epigenetic changes, crosstalk between signaling networks, cell cycle aberrance, and even change in the tumor microenvironment (TME) or stem cell. These mechanisms may contribute to treatment resistance. Current targeted therapy for hormone-resistant tumors includes PI3K/AKT/mTOR and cdk4/6 inhibitors. Several relevant pathways, biomarkers, and predictor genes have also been identified. Immunotherapy so far has a relatively less crucial role in hormone-positive than in triple-negative BC. Furthermore, the methodology to identify the PDL1 is not standardized. In a molecule and gene study, next-generation sequencing with circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has recently appeared as a sensitive and minimally invasive tool worth investigating.",

    "abstract": "Glioma, the most common primary malignant brain tumor, is characterized by infiltrating immune cells that contribute to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) constitute a significant proportion of these infiltrating immune cells and have been implicated in glioma progression. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which TAMs promote glioma progression remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the role of PU.1, a crucial transcription factor involved in myeloid cell development, in glioma-associated macrophage polarization and activation. First, bioinformatics and analysis of clinical glioma samples demonstrated a positive correlation between PU.1 expression in TAMs and disease severity. Further experiments using in vitro coculture systems revealed that the expression of PU.1 is increased in glioma cells vs. control cells. Importantly, PU.1-overexpressing macrophages exhibited a protumorigenic phenotype characterized by enhanced migration, invasion, and proliferation. Mechanistically, we found that PU.1-induced activation of the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling pathway led to Akt/mTOR pathway activation in macrophages, which further enhanced their protumorigenic functions. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the BTK or Akt/mTOR pathway reversed the protumorigenic effects of macrophages in vitro and impaired their ability to promote glioma progression in vivo. In conclusion, our study elucidates a novel mechanism by which PU.1 induces the polarization and activation of TAMs in the glioma microenvironment. We highlight the significance of BTK-mediated Akt/mTOR pathway activation in driving the protumorigenic functions of TAMs. Targeting PU.1 and its downstream signaling pathways in TAMs may provide a promising therapeutic strategy to suppress glioma progression and improve patient outcomes.",

We designed a laboratory-friendly method to culture endometrial CAFs on a patient-to-patient basis for studying the CAF-TME and CAF-tumor cell interaction(s). Here, we present a comprehensive characterization of endometrial CAFs derived from patients' tumor tissues (T) and tumor-adjacent normal tissues (N). We used more than 80 T and N from 53 consecutive consented patients with endometrial cancers at the Avera Cancer Institute. We derived TCAF and NCAF in a non-enzymatic feeder-layer culture and characterized their expression of markers by qRT-PCR, flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, immunofluorescence, and Western blot. Although similar in the expression pattern of EpCAM-/CK18-/vimentin+ as in ovarian CAFs, endometrial NCAFs, and TCAFs characteristically presented dual morphology in culture. Endometrial CAFs were EpCAM-/CK18-/CD45-/CD31-/SMA+/TE-7+/PDGFRA+/CXCL12+/Meflin+/CD155+/CD90+ with patient-specific positivity for S100A4/FAP/PD-L1/CD44. Endometrial CAFs expressed mRNAs for signaling proteins of several pathways and receptor-ligands, including (1) cell cycle pathway, (2) TGF pathway, (3) FGF pathway, (4) Wnt-beta-catenin pathway, (5) HER pathway, (6) tyrosine kinase receptor ligands, and (7) steroid receptors. We tested the hypoxic response of CAFs to show that endometrial CAFs upregulate MMP1 in a HIF-1a-independent manner. In trying to delineate the relationship between expressions of CAF markers and T-cells in the tumor tissue, we observed that FAP-positive CAFs that are derived from CD4/CD8 positive tumor tissue expressed CXCL12 mRNA. The data indicate the role of the CXCL12-CXCR4 pathway of the CAF-rich stroma in the lymphocytic infiltration of the tumor. We demonstrate that endometrial CAFs can be cultured in an enzymatic-digestion-independent manner, and their signaling landscape can be mapped toward understanding CAF-TME dialogue. Our data will help unearth the functional relevance of endometrial CAFs in the context of clinical outcomes and designing CAF-inclusive therapy in the future.",

In this study, we focused on the expression, function and molecular mechanism of circRNA_0023685 in gastric cancer (GC) to provide new ways for the diagnosis and treatment of GC. Firstly, a novel differentially expressed circRNA, circRNA_0023685, was identified, and its differential expression in GC plasma, tissue, and cell lines was further verified by RT-qPCR. Next, circRNA_0023685 was verified to promote the proliferation, migration and apoptosis of GC cells in vitro. CircRNA_0023685 was also proved to enhance the growth of GC tumors in xenograft models. Finally, for excavating the mechanism to promote GC, downstream microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs were screened by bioinformatics analyses. After intersecting the target genes and genes enriched in GO analysis, a circRNA competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) network was built. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was then constructed to find the candidate gene, APP.

Although advances in the targeted treatment and immunotherapy have improved the management of some cancers, the prognosis of metastatic cancers remains unsatisfied. Therefore, the specific mechanisms in tumor metastasis need further investigation. 6-O-endosulfatases (SULFs), comprising sulfatase1 (SULF1) and sulfatase 2 (SULF2), play pivotal roles in the post-synthetic modifications of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Consequently, these extracellular enzymes can regulate a variety of downstream pathways by modulating HSPGs function. During the past decades, researchers have detected the expression of SULF1 and SULF2 in most cancers and revealed their roles in tumor progression and metastasis. Herein we reviewed the metastasis steps which SULFs participated in, elucidated the specific roles and mechanisms of SULFs in metastasis process, and discussed the effects of SULFs in different types of cancers. Moreover, we summarized the role of targeting SULFs in combination therapy to treat metastatic cancers, which provided some novel strategies for cancer therapy.",

The cohort included 30 different tumor types, with colorectal cancer being the most common (27%). When RNA percentile rank values were categorized as \"Low\" (0-24), \"Intermediate\" (25-74), and \"High\" (75-100), each patient had a distinctive portfolio of the categorical expression of 16 checkpoint markers. Association between some checkpoint markers and cancer types were observed; NOS2 showed significantly higher expression in colorectal and stomach cancer (P < 0.001). Principal component analysis demonstrated no clear association between combined RNA expression patterns of 16 checkpoint markers and cancer types, TMB, MSI or PD-L1 IHC. Immune checkpoint RNA expression varies from patient to patient, both within and between tumor types, though colorectal and stomach cancer showed the highest levels of NOS2, a mediator of inflammation and immunosuppression.

And drug resistance emerges during the application of the most widely used chemotherapeutic regimens such as modified FOLFIRINOX regimen, gemcitabine monotherapy or 5-Fluorouracil combination therapy, which further reduces the therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, it is urgent to explore better treatment strategies for pancreatic cancer. In recent years, more and more studies have found that natural products have significant anti-pancreatic cancer properties. In this paper, we reviewed the possible mechanisms by which natural products inhibit the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, including the possible mechanisms of targeting the inhibition of the growth and proliferation regulatory pathways of pancreatic cancer cells, inducing apoptosis and autophagy of pancreatic cancer cells, inhibiting the EMT process of pancreatic cancer cells, and inhibiting the angiogenesis of pancreatic cancer. Meanwhile, natural products have also hindered the progress of their basic and clinical research due to the complexity of their composition and the limitation of biological extraction technology. Further exploration of the specific molecular mechanisms of natural products to inhibit the proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, optimization of purification and preparation techniques, and enrichment of basic and clinical trials to verify their efficacy and safety may be the future direction of natural products in the field of anti-pancreatic cancer research.",

    "abstract": "Various first-line gemcitabine-based or fluorouracil-based combination regimens were approved in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Recent randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have investigated chemotherapy backbones in combination with novel investigational drugs, including chemotherapy agents or targeted drugs. However, the comparative efficacy of these different combination therapies remains limited. This systematic review and network meta-analysis aimed to assess the efficacy of first-line combination therapies for advanced pancreatic cancer. The study included 46 RCTs with 10,499 patients and 47 distinct regimens, using data sources from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Clinical Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov from January 1, 2010 to April 23, 2024. The primary outcomes were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), while secondary outcomes included overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR). The analysis revealed that gemcitabine+nab-paclitaxel (GA), GA with platinum and fluorouracil (GA+Plat+FU), gemcitabine with fluorouracil (G+FU), G+Plt+FU, and FOLFIRINOX were associated with superior OS and PFS compared to gemcitabine monotherapy. Triplet or quadruplet polychemotherapy combinations, such as GA+Plat+FU, G+Plt+FU, and FOLFIRINOX, demonstrated better OS benefit with hazard ratios of 0.42 (95% CI, 0.26-0.68), 0.41 (95% CI, 0.24-0.71), and 0.58 (95% CI, 0.48-0.71), respectively, compared to doublet regimens like GA and G+FU, which had hazard ratios of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.59-0.82) and 0.82 (95% CI, 0.72-0.95), respectively. Notably, no targeted drugs, monoclonal antibodies, or other medications showed improved survival when added to chemotherapy backbones. These findings support the use of gemcitabine-based or fluorouracil-based triplet or quadruplet regimens for better survival outcomes in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Further research is warranted to explore the potential benefits of adding chemotherapy agents, such as fluorouracil, to the GA doublet regimen.",

However, the role of PDE4B in gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear. We used the GEPIA2 (Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis 2) database to analyze the differential expression level of PDE4B across tumor samples and verified our findings via qPCR and immunohistochemical analysis. We also analyzed the correlation between PDE4B expression levels and clinical pathological parameters, and prognosis, in the database. The effects of PDE4B on GC proliferation, migration, and invasion were evaluated through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Enrichment analysis was performed using bioinformatic tools, and results were validated by western blot analysis. The correlation between PDE4B expression and immune cell infiltration was investigated using bioinformatics tools. PDE4B is highly expressed in GC and is significantly associated with deep infiltration, distant metastasis, tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stage, and preoperative CA199 levels. Over-expression of PDE4B promotes proliferation, clonal formation, migration, and invasion of GC cells and is associated with poor prognosis. PDE4B promotes the infiltration of immune cells into the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the phosphorylation of PI3K/AKT pathway, increasing MYC expression. PDE4B can serve as an independent prognostic biomarker for GC. We found that PDE4B can promote immune cell infiltration of the TME and mediate malignancy in gastric cancer through the PI3K/AKT/MYC pathway.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is an aggressive and metastatic tumor that lacks effective early detection and treatment methods. There is an urgent need to further understand its underlying molecular mechanisms and identify new biomarkers for early detection. Zinc, a critical trace element and catalytic cofactor, is tightly regulated within cells. ZIP4, a zinc transporter protein significantly overexpressed in human pancreatic cancer, appears to play a pivotal role in tumor development by modulating intracellular zinc concentration. This review highlights the role of ZIP4 in tumorigenesis, including its impact on pancreatic cancer growth, proliferation, migration, and drug resistance. ZIP4 exerts its effects by regulating zinc dependent transcriptional factors like CREB, STAT3, and ZEB1, resulting in upregulation of Cyclin D1, TP53INP1, ITGA3, CD44, ENT1 proteins, and miR-373. Moreover, ZIP4 mediates the miR373-PHLPP2-AKT signaling axis, which increases TGF-β expression. Coupled with CREB-activated macrophage catabolism-related genes SDC1 and DNM2, ZIP4 promotes cancer cachexia and supports amino acids to tumor cells under metabolic stress. Furthermore, ZIP4 facilitates bone resorption by osteoclasts via the RANKL-activated NF-κB pathway. A deeper understanding of these mechanisms may unveil potential targets for early diagnosis, prognosis assessment, and dietary recommendations for pancreatic cancer. These findings hold clinical significance not only for pancreatic cancer but also for other malignancies exhibiting heightened ZIP4 expression.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) is the main cause of mortality in lung cancer. This study aimed to investigate the roles of neuropilin 1 (NRP1) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NRP1 expression was assessed in tumor tissues from patients with osimertinib-resistant (OR) NSCLC and osimertinib-responsive NSCLC as well as in patients with paracancerous NSCLC tissues who did not undergo radiotherapy or chemotherapy. In vitro experiments were conducted using five cell lines: BEAS-2B, HCC827, and PC9 cells, and the constructed OR cell lines, HCC827-OR and PC9-OR. HCC827-OR cells showing significant differences in osimertinib IC50 were selected for further study. After investigating the effects of altering NRP1 expression on cell sensitivity to osimertinib, NRP1 expression was inhibited to further investigate changes in cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis in OR cells. Additionally, bioinformatics techniques were used to detect targets (Integrin β3) and signaling pathways (PI3K/AKT) downstream of NRP1; subsequent cell experiments verified their interactivity. Finally, an orthotopic mouse tumor model was constructed using HCC827-OR cells treated with a PI3K/AKT signaling pathway activator (740Y-P), allowing exploration of the role played by the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via NRP1 regulation on NSCLC resistance both in vivo and in vitro. Results showed that NRP1 expression was significantly increased in the cells of patients with NSCLC-OR, and increased NRP1 expression reduced HCC827 cell sensitivity to osimertinib. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that NRP1 deficiency mediated by NRP1 inhibitors inhibited HCC827-OR cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, promoted tumor cell apoptosis, and enhanced osimertinib efficacy. In contrast, 740Y-P partially inhibited the effects of NRP1 inhibitors combined with osimertinib on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and on tumor growth in vivo and in vitro. Cellular experimental results showed that NRP1 positively regulates the Integrin β3 expression and activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Bioinformatics analysis showed that both NRP1 and Integrin β3 may jointly participate in regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In conclusion, our findings suggest that elevated NRP1 expression in NSCLC tumor tissues may promote NSCLC resistance to osimertinib by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and integrin β3 potentially being involved in this process. These insights may provide a novel strategy for combination therapy for OR NSCLC.",

The receptor EphA2 signaling pathway may provide attractive therapeutic strategy for MM. Apoptosis was determined by Cell Death ELISA in MM Cells transfected with siRNA-EphA2 and control siRNA. The gene expression profile of apoptosis pathways were analyzed by GEArray. Selected genes were further studied by quantitative PCR, Western analysis, and immunofluorescence. Caspases activities were measured by fluorescence spectrometer. Silencing EphA2 expression induced apoptosis in MMC. Apoptosis was characterized by FADD expression, activated caspase-8, caspase-3 and induction of Bax, Bak, and Bid as revealed by GEArray and protein fractionation assays. The expression of FADD, Bid, caspase-8, cytochrome-c and apaf-1 were significantly higher in the cytosolic fractions of EphA2-siRNA transfected cells. Furthermore, blocking the expression of caspase-8 by an inhibitor blunted FADD expression, indicating that caspase-8 is implicated in EphA2-siRNA induced apoptosis in MMC. Our data indicates that targeting the EphA2 gene by siRNA induced both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways in MM Cells.

Parallel mRNA expression array analysis of the normal and tumor microenvironments identified a distinct cytokine profile in cancer, with 24 dysregulated genes in tumor epithelium and nine altered in tumor-associated stroma.

After chemoradiotherapy, CSCs are enriched because of their survival advantages and lead to tumor relapse and metastasis. Elimination of CSCs is critically important for the radical treatment of human cancers. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a group of RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides and have no protein-coding potential. Aberrant expressions of lncRNAs are associated with human diseases including cancer. LncRNAs function as cancer biomarkers, prognostic factors and therapeutic targets. They induce cancer stemness by chromatin modification, transcriptional regulation or post-transcriptional regulation of target genes as a sponge or through assembling a scaffold complex. Several factors caused aberrant expressions of lncRNAs in CSCs such as genes mutations, epigenetic alteration and environmental stimuli. Targeting of lncRNAs has been demonstrated to significantly reverse the chemoradioresistance of CSCs. In this review, we have summarized the progress of studies regarding lncRNAs-mediated therapy resistance of CSCs and clarified the molecular mechanisms. Furthermore, we have for the first time analyzed the influences of lncRNAs on cell metabolism and emphasized the effect of tumor microenvironment on lncRNAs functions in CSCs. Overall, the thorough understanding of the association of lncRNAs and CSCs would contribute to the reversal of therapy resistance.",

Thus, this study aimed to investigate both the predictors for CR and the long-term prognosis of the patients with CR after TACE. The study recruited new diagnosed HCC patients initially treated with TACE from 2010 to 2013. Post TACE response was assessed by scheduled image studies according to the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST). Then, pre-TACE factors were compared between patients with and without CR. After the first session of TACE, 22.3% of the 669 TACE treated patients achieved CR. During a median of 26.6 months follow-up, patients with CR had better overall survival than those without (median: 35.8 vs. 24.0 months, P 150 k/μl, OR: 0.482, P=0.002) were unfavorable predictors for CR after first TACE. In addition, macrovascular invasion (HR: 3.113, P=0.001) and higher AFP levels (≥15 ng/ml, HR: 2.601, P=0.007) were predictors for early HCC recurrence whereas diabetes mellitus (DM) (HR: 2.166, P=0.006) was the only significant predictor for late HCC recurrence in CR patients. In conclusion, more than one-fifth of HCC patients achieved CR after first TACE and these patients had favorable prognosis. Furthermore, tailored post-TACE follow-up strategies shall be considered in patients with different risk factors of early or late recurrence after CR.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression features that are valuable for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) prognosis are still largely unknown. We aimed to explore pivotal molecular signatures for PDAC progression and establish an efficient survival score to predict PDAC prognosis. Overall, 163 overlapping genes were identified from three statistical methods, including differentially expressed genes (DEGs), coexpression network analysis (WGCNA), and target genes for miRNAs that were significantly related to PDAC patients' overall survival (OS). Then, according to the optimal value of the cross-validation curve (lambda = 0.031), 7 non-zero coefficients (ARNTL2, DSG3, PTPRR, ANLN, S100A14, ANKRD22, and TSPAN7) were selected to establish a prognostic prediction model of PDAC patients. We further confirmed the expression level of 7 genes using RT-PCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry staining in PDAC patients' tissues. Our results showed that the ROC curve of the 7-mRNA model indicated good predictive ability for 1- and 2-year OS in three datasets (TCGA: 0.71, 0.69; ICGC: 0.8, 0.74; GEO batch: 0.61, 0.7, respectively). The hazard ratio (HR) of the low-risk group had a similar significant result (TCGA: HR = 0.3723; ICGC: HR = 0.2813; GEO batch: HR = 0.4999; all P < 0.001). Furthermore, Log-rank test results in three cohorts showed that the 7-mRNA assay excellently predicted the prognosis and metastasis, especially in TNM stage I&II subgroups of PDAC. In conclusion, the strong validation of our 7-mRNA signature indicates the promising effectiveness of its clinical application, especially in patients with TNM stages I&II.",

    "abstract": "It has been estimated that worldwide up to 10% of all human cancers are the result of viral infection, with 7.2% of all cancers in the developed world have a viral aetiology. In contrast, 22.9% of infections in the developing world are the result of viral infections. This number increases to 30% in Sub-Saharan Africa. The ability of viral infections to induce the transformation of normal cells into cancerous cells is well documented. These viruses are mainly Hepatitis B and C viruses, Epstein Barr virus, Human papillomavirus and Human Cytomegalovirus. They can induce the transformation of normal cells into cancer cells and this may be the underlying cause of carcinogenesis in many different types of cancer. These include liver cancer, lymphoma, nasopharyngeal cancer, cervical cancer, gastric cancer and even glioblastoma. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) can function by regulating the expression of their target genes by controlling the stability of the target mRNAs or by blocking translation of the target mRNA. They can control transcription by regulating the recruitment of transcription factors or chromatin modification complexes. Finally, lncRNAs can control the phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination of proteins at the post-translation level. Thus, altering protein localisation, function, folding, stability and ultimately expression. In addition to these functions, lncRNA also regulate alternate pre-mRNA splicing in ways that contribute to the formation of tumours. This mainly involves the interaction of lncRNAs with splicing factors, which alters their activity and function. The ability of lncRNAs to regulate the stability, expression and function of tumour suppressor proteins is important in the development and progression of cancers. LncRNAs also regulate viral replication and latency, leading to carcinogenesis. These factors all make lncRNAs ideal targets for the development of biomarker arrays that can be based on secreted lncRNAs leading to the development of affordable non-invasive biomarker tests for the stage specific diagnosis of tumours. These lncRNAs can also serve as targets for the development of new anticancer drug treatments.",

Due to the concealed location and intrinsic invasiveness of this disease, majority of NPC patients are diagnosed with advanced stages (III and IV) and poor prognosis. Chemoradiotherapy resistance is a major problem for NPC patients, leading to incomplete local elimination, recurrence and metastasis. Therefore, it is of great significance to seek novel biomarkers and effective therapeutic regimen for clinical management of this deadly cancer. Exosomes are tiny membrane vesicles with a lipid bilayer secreted by most cells in the body, which are widely distributed in various body fluids. They are functionally active in different physiopathological process by carrying and transmitting important signal molecules such as miRNA, mRNA, protein, lipid, etc. Exosomal miRNAs play an important role in tumorigenesis and development of NPC. They are extensively involved in NPC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, neovascularization, radiotherapy resistance and the regulation of tumor immune microenvironment through intercellular communication and control of gene expression. Moreover, exosomal miRNAs can be used as valuable biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapeutic targets of NPC.",

    "abstract": "The distal-less (dlx) homeobox transcription factors have been implicated roles in bone development. DLX5, in particular, was shown to play essential roles in osteoblast differentiation by targeting RUNX2, a master transcription factor for bone development. Interestingly, DLX5 has also been shown to play an oncogenic role in lung and other cancers, possibly via regulation of MYC expression. Given its dual roles in bone and cancer, this study aimed to investigate the effect of DLX5 on progression of osteosarcoma (OS), the primary bone cancer that is characterized by abnormal bone formation and osteoblast activity. Expression of DLX5 in OS cell lines was detected by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot (WB). In vitro and in vivo assays were performed to investigate the oncogenic function of DLX5 in OS cells and xenograft models. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to determine the underlying mechanism of DLX5-mediated OS aggressiveness. The results showed that DLX5 was differentially expressed in OS cell lines, with significantly upregulated levels in HOS and MG-63 and relatively low levels in U2OS and 143B cell lines, compared with the normal bone cell line. DLX5 knockdown in HOS and MG-63 cell lines by siRNA inhibited OS cell growth and progression, and induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle changes both in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, DLX5 overexpression had the opposite effect on U2OS and 143B cell lines. Notably, a positive correlation between the expression patterns of NOTCH1 and DLX5 was also observed. The expression levels of NICD (NOTCH1 intracellular domain) and HES1 (classical target of NOTCH) were closely associated with DLX5 expression. Whereas knockdown of DLX5 in OS cells resulted in decreased expression of NOTCH1 and reduced cell proliferation and migration, which were rescued by overexpression of NOTCH1. We further analyzed DLX5 and NOTCH1 genes using JASPAR software and found two potential DLX5 binding sites within the NOTCH1 promoter. Dual-luciferase assay demonstrated that DLX5 specifically activates the NOTCH1 promoter and controls its expression. Taken together, our results support that DLX5 plays an oncogenic role in OS development, which can at least partially, be attributed to activation of the NOTCH signaling pathway.",

Since its initial discovery more than three decades ago, DDX5 is gradually recognized as a potential biomarker and target for the treatment of various cancer types. Studies over the years significantly expanded our understanding of the functional diversity of DDX5 in various cancer types and extended our knowledge of its Mechanism of Action (MOA). This provides a rationale for the development of novel cancer therapeutics by using DDX5 as a biomarker and a therapeutic target. However, while most of the published studies have found DDX5 to be an oncogenic target and a cancer treatment-resistant biomarker, a few studies have reported that in certain scenarios, DDX5 may act as a tumor suppressor. After careful review of all the available relevant studies in the literature, we found that the multiple functions of DDX5 make it both a superior independent oncogenic biomarker and target for targeted cancer therapy. In this article, we will summarize the relevant studies on DDX5 in literature with a careful analysis and discussion of any inconsistencies encountered, and then provide our conclusions with respect to understanding the MOA of FL118, a novel small molecule. We hope that such a review will stimulate further discussion on this topic and assist in developing better strategies to treat cancer by using DDX5 as both an oncogenic biomarker and therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Angiogenesis is one of the crucial events for cancer development and growth and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family plays an essential role in this biological phenomenon. The members of VEGF family mainly involved in angiogenesis are VEGF-A, VEGF-B and placental growth factor (PlGF), which exert their activity through the binding and activation of two VEGF receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2. Human VEGF-A and PlGF are expressed in different isoforms and have the peculiarity to form heterodimer if co-expressed in the same cell. The difference of two main human PlGF isoforms, PlGF1 and PlGF2, consist in the exclusive ability of PlGF2 to bind heparin and Neuropilin receptors. As previously reported for PlGF1 isoform, we have generated a PlGF2 variant named PlGF2 -DE, in which the residues D(72) and E(73) were substituted with alanine, that is unable to bind and activate VEGFR-1 but is still able to heterodimerize with VEGF. Here we report that overexpression in VEGF-A producing human tumor cell line derived from ovarian carcinoma (A2780) of PlGF2-DE variant by stable transfection, significantly reduces the production of VEGF-A homodimer via heterodimerization, determining a strong inhibition of xenograft tumor growth and associated neoangiogenesis, as well as significant reduction of monocyte-macrophage infiltration. Conversely, the overexpression of PlGF2wt, also reducing the VEGF-A homodimer production comparably to PlGF2-DE variant through the generation of VEGF-A/PlGF2 heterodimer, does not inhibit tumor growth and vessel density compared to control, but induces increase of monocyte-macrophage infiltration. Interestingly the comparison of PlGF2wt with PlGF1wt overexpression evidences a significant reduction of monocyte-macrophages recruitment as unique difference among the activity of the two PlGFwt isoforms. Therefore, the 'less soluble' PlGF2 shows a limited potential in monocyte-macrophages recruitment. In conclusion data here reported demonstrate that PlGF-DE variant acts as 'dominant negative' of VEGF-A independently from the PlGF isoform utilized, that the expression of active PlGF2 homodimer and VEGF-A/PlGF2 heterodimer is sufficient to rescue pro-angiogenic activity lost for reduction of VEGF-A due to heterodimerization mechanism, and that PlGF2 shows lower activity into recruitment of monocyte-macrophage cells compared to PlGF1 isoform.",

    "abstract": "RUNX1 is frequently mutated as chromosomal translocations in a variety of hematological malignancies. Recent studies show that RUNX1 is also mutated somatically in many solid tumors. We have recently identified a 260 kb un-spliced intragenic overlapping long noncoding RNA RUNXOR in the RUNX1 locus, yet its role as an epigenetic regulator in tumors remains to be characterized. To delineate this RUNXOR-RUNX1 regulatory interplay in breast cancer cells, we devised a novel gene in situ cis-activation approach to activate the endogenous RUNXOR gene. We found that the in situ activation of RUNXOR lncRNA upregulated RUNX1 in cis from the P1 promoter. The preferred activation of the P1 promoter caused a shift to the RUNX1c isoform expression. Using a chromatin conformation capture (3C) approach, we showed that RUNXOR lncRNA epigenetically activated the RUNX1 P1 promoter in cis by altering the local chromatin structure. The binding of RUNXOR lncRNA triggered DNA demethylation and induced active histone modification markers in the P1 CpG island. Changes in RUNX1 isoform composition correlated with a trend to cell cycle arrest at G0/G1, although cell proliferation rate, apoptosis, and migration ability were not significantly changed. Our results reveal an underlying epigenetic mechanism by which the lncRNA regulates in cis the RUNX1 promoter usage in breast cancer cells, thereby shedding light on potential genetic therapies in malignancies in which RUNX1 loss-of-function mutations frequently occur.",

Therefore, it is hypothesized that the abrogation of the G2/M checkpoint with Wee1 inhibitor might preferentially sensitize TP53-defective ovarian cancer cells.

A combination of Wee1 and mTOR inhibits synergistically inhibiting tumor growth in ovarian cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft that closely mimic the heterogeneity of patient tumors. Mechanistically, dual Wee1/mTOR inhibition induced massive DNA replication stress, leading to fork stalling and DNA damage. Moreover, we found that the addition of nucleotide metabolic substrate dNTPs alleviated replication stress, restored the cell cycle and reduced apoptosis to some extent, supporting dNTPs depletion is necessary for the synergy between Wee1 and mTOR inhibits.

However, details of the mechanisms underlying malignancy are still largely unknown. Our mouse model indicated that knockdown of CDK6 inhibited lung metastasis significantly compared to parental cells. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the levels of collagen and the angiogenic marker matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 were much lower in CDK6-deficient cells. To examine mechanisms in the CDK6-mediated phenotype of cancer cells, we studied its role in MMP-2 expression. CDK6 mediated the recruitment of transcription factors including c-Jun and Sp1 to the MMP2 promoter. Knockdown of CDK6 significantly suppressed the expression of MMP2 mRNA. Consistent with the in vitro data, the expression of CDK6 was positively correlated with the angiogenic and fibrotic tumor microenvironment in TNBC patient tissues as shown by MMP-2 and fibronectin staining, respectively. More importantly, after screening a small molecule library of 31 protein kinase inhibitors, we found that the Raf inhibitor sorafenib displayed the highest cytotoxicity in CDK6-depleted cells. These data indicate that CDK6 serves as an anti-microenvironment target and affects the drug response in retinoblastoma-proficient TNBC, suggesting that combining a CDK6 inhibitor and sorafenib leads to a synthetic effect that may represent a personalized therapeutic approach for patients with TNBC.",

The expression of GFAP and NF-M was enhanced when the cells were treated with the conditioned medium of U-251MG cells indicating the potential of differentiation. Sphere forming ability was more efficient than that of U-251MG cells and was enhanced in the presence of hyaluronic acid, which enhanced the cell growth as well. U-251MGSC1 cells exhibited rapid growth tumor in nude mice and efficient metastatic ability in transmembrane assay when compared with U-251MG cells. As the result, we concluded U-251MGSC1 cell was a glioblastoma CSC line derived from the parental U-251MG cells. U-251MGSC1 cells will be a good tool to develop effective therapeutic agents against CSCs and to elucidate the properties of glioma derived CSCs and the mechanism of tumor development in brain.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent/metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is known for having a poor prognosis due to its unfavorable response to chemoradiotherapy. However, the specific processes involved remain poorly understood. This study focused on the cisplatin-resistance mechanism in NPC to help understand the occurrence of advanced NPC and aims to explore the potential therapeutic target for cisplatin-resistant NPC. Two cisplatin-resistant NPC cell lines, HNE-1/DDP and CNE-2/DDP, were established and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between parental and cisplatin-resistance cell lines, filtering from high-throughput sequencing results, were analyzed. Next, the effects of IAP-1 on cisplatin-resistant nasopharyngeal cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis, drug resistance and associated cell signaling were evaluated in vitro and in vitro. From our bioinformatic results, more than 15,000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found between parental and resistant cell lines. Nine related DEGs were found in the classic platinum resistance pathway, three of which (ATM, IAP-1, and IAP-2) also appeared in the top five differentially expressed pathways, with elevated IAP-1 showing the highest fold change. Further studies revealed that high IAP-1 expression can lead to an increased cisplatin inhibitory concentration and apoptosis inhibition. IAP-1 silencing can induce upregulation of the caspase-3 and enhance the antiproliferation and proapoptotic effects of cisplatin. Clinical data also showed that IAP-1 overexpression was associated with a worse survival status. In summary, in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that IAP-1 plays a vital role in cisplatin resistance by regulating caspase induced apoptosis and serve as a potential novel therapeutic target and a prognostic indicator for advanced NPC.",

    "abstract": "Hepatoblastoma is a rare childhood liver cancer without known explicit etiology. Base excision repair (BER) pathway genes have been implicated in the pathophysiology of cancer, yet the role of BER pathway gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on hepatoblastoma risk still awaits to be explored. This study aims to determine whether hepatoblastoma risk be modulated by polymorphisms in the BER pathway genes based on genotyped data from 313 cases and 1446 controls. We applied TaqMan assay to genotype these included samples. We comprehensively genotyped 20 SNPs across six genes of BER, and estimated odds ratio (ORs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and P-values of the selected SNPs' contribution to the risk of hepatoblastoma using logistic regression models. Only SNP rs293795 in the hOGG1 gene could significantly enhance hepatoblastoma risk under recessive model (adjusted OR=3.78, 95% CI=1.01-14.17, P=0.047). Stratified analysis revealed that rs159153 TC/CC genotype decreased hepatoblastoma risk in male subgroup. Moreover, rs293795 GG and 1-3 risk genotypes could increase hepatoblastoma risk in clinical stages I+II and male subgroups, respectively. False-positive report probability validated the reliability of the significant results. Our findings provide some clues of a potential risk effect of BER pathway gene hOGG1 SNPs on hepatoblastoma. Further investigation is warranted to confirm these findings and to better elucidate the biological pathways involved.",

AKIP1 expression was modified by pcDNA and pGPH1 vectors in U-87 MG and U-251 MG cells. Subsequently, multiple compensative experiments were conducted via adding CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL8 in the pGPH1-AKIP1 (AKIP1 knockdown) transfected U-87 MG and U-251 MG cells, respectively. Furthermore, AKIP1, CXCL1/2/8 expressions in 10 GBM and 10 low-grade glioma (LGG) tumor samples were detected. AKIP1 was elevated in various GBM cell lines compared to normal human astrocytes. AKIP1 overexpression promoted U-87 MG and U-251 MG cell proliferation and invasion while inhibited apoptosis; and it enhanced chemoresistance to temozolomide (but not cisplatin) and radiation resistance; then AKIP1 knockdown showed the opposite effects. Meanwhile, AKIP1 positively regulated CXCL1/2/8, NF-κB pathway, AKT pathway and PD-L1 expression. Further multiple compensative experiments uncovered that CXCL1 and CXCL8 promoted proliferation, invasion, chemoradiation resistance, NF-κB pathway, AKT pathway and PD-L1 expression in U-87 MG and U-251 MG cells, also in pGPH1-AKIP1 (AKIP1 knockdown) transfected U-87 MG and U-251 MG cells; although CXCL2 exhibited similar treads, but its effect was much weaker. Besides, NF-κB pathway inhibitor and AKT pathway inhibitor attenuated the effect of CXCL1&CXCL8 on promoting GBM cell malignant behaviors. Clinically AKIP1 and CXCL1/8 were elevated in GBM compared to LGG tumor samples, and they were inter-correlated.

Tumor-derived exosomes are enriched with kinds of tumorigenesis mediators which are derived from the cytoplasm of cancer cells and fully reflect the tumor conditions. Indeed, the major topics and challenges on current oncological research are the identification of tumorigenic and metastatic molecules in tumor-cell-derived exosomes as well as elucidating the pathways that guarantee these components to be included in exosomes. The bacterial EVs have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal (GI) tumors and chronic inflammatory diseases; however, the possible function of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) in tumorigenesis remains largely underestimated. We suggest that EVs from both eukaryotic cells and different microbes in GI tract act as regulators of intracellular and cross-species communication, thus particularly facilitate tumor cell survival and multi-drug resistance. Therefore, our review introduces comprehensive knowledge on the promising role of EVs (mainly exosomes and OMVs) production of GI cancer development and gut microbiome, as well as its roles in developing novel therapeutic strategies.",

Several studies reported that Siglec15 is a prognostic biomarker of cancer patients, and targeting Siglec15 may be a promising strategy for cancer therapy. However, the regulation of Siglec15 function remains unclear. Here we show that the immunosuppression activity of Siglec15 is largely modulated by N-glycosylation. Through mass spectrum and site mutation analysis, we identified that Siglec15 was extensively glycosylated at N172 (N173 for mouse) in cancer cells. Meanwhile, Siglec15 N172Q had a similar molecular weight with PNGase-F-treated Siglec15, suggesting N172 as the only one glycosylation residue. In xenograft model, glycosylation deficiency of Siglec15 reduced tumor growth in C57BL/6 mice, but had no impact in nude mice, indicating the requirement of N-glycosylation for immunosuppressive function of Siglec15. Furthermore, colorectal cancer patients with high Siglec15 expression had a poor response to neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy and short survival time. Interestingly, removal of N-glycosylation enhances the detection of Siglec15, which may be employed in the prediction of immunotherapy response. Together, our results disclose a pivotal role of glycosylated Siglec15 in tumor immune escape, which may be a therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy.",

In clinical cohort of breast cancer, the expression of SIK1, SIK2 and SIK3 increased expression of SIKs was associated with good clinical outcome in breast cancer cohort. In vitro, reduced expression of SIK2 and SIK3, by way of knockdown increased the proliferation of breast cancer cells. However, SIK2 and SIK3 had contrasting effects on adhesion in breast cancer cells. Knockdown of SIK2 only enhanced the adhesion of triple negative breast cancer cell, while knockdown of SIK3 can decrease the adhesion of both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Interestingly, knockdown of SIK1 and SIK3 was seen to increase the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. Furthermore, reduced SIKs, even triple knockdown of SIK1, SIK2 and SIK3 rendered the breast cancer cells to confer chemoresistance to paclitaxel and cisplatin.

The purpose of the study was to investigate whether orchiectomy in C57BL/6 male mice reduces colorectal tumorigenesis and whether testosterone administration increases tumorigenesis after orchiectomy in an azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse model. Clinical symptoms, including colitis and tumor incidence, were evaluated in the absence or presence of testosterone in AOM/DSS-treated male, as well as orchiectomized (ORX) male and female mice. The levels of serum testosterone and colonic myeloperoxidase, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 were measured by ELISA. Target mRNA expression was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR. Orchiectomy significantly diminished the AOM/DSS-induced colitis indices, including disease activity index, colon shortening, and histological severity at week 2, and decreased tumor numbers and incidence rates in the distal part of the colon increased following AOM/DSS administration at week 13; this reduction was reversed by testosterone supplementation. Furthermore, it was confirmed that the ELISA level (MPO and IL-1β) and the mRNA expression of the inflammatory mediators (COX-2 and iNOS) were maintained at high levels in the tumors of the testosterone-treated group compared with AOM/DSS groups. Interestingly, both endogenous and exogenous testosterone administrations were associated with tumor development (> 2 mm in size) and submucosal invasive cancer. Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, testosterone was identified as a reasonable hazard factor for the progression of submucosal invasive cancer of the distal colon. In conclusion, endogenous and exogenous testosterone presented a stimulating effect on AOM/DSS-induced colitis and carcinogenicity.",

Currently, many lncRNAs have been identified among mammalian genomes, and their known functions are associated with various physiological activities or pathological processes. Some lncRNAs are dysregulated in a variety of malignant tumors, while increasing evidence indicates that abnormal expression can contribute to the regulation of immune cells in tumors and to shaping the immune response. More specifically, lncRNAs participate in regulating the differentiation of immune cells, also known as myeloid and lymphoid cells, as well as recruiting various immunosuppressive factors to influence the tumor microenvironment, thereby promoting tumor cell immune escape. However, we still know very little about the specific mechanism of lncRNAs in immune escape of cancer. Nonetheless, although unprecedented achievements have allowed the development of a new generation of anti-tumor immune therapies to be applied in clinical trials, the drug resistance caused by immune escape has become a major clinical challenge. The focus of this review is to describe the relationship among lncRNAs, immune cells, and tumor immune escape, in order to identify novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets in human cancers.",

Importantly, the validity of these IVs was confirmed with a previous large-scale GWAS (Biobank Japan Project, BBJ).

Furthermore, higher level of genetically predicted T2D (as indicated by T2D IVs) was associated with an increased risk of recurrence of and mortality from breast cancer (HR = 1.43; P < 0.001). Sensitivity analyses, including the weighted-median approach, MR-Egger regression, Radial regression and Mendelian randomization pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) supported the consistency of our findings. Finally, the causal relationship between BMI and poor breast cancer prognosis was confirmed in a prospective cohort study. Our MR analyses demonstrated the causal relationship between the genetic prediction of elevated BMI and a greater risk of T2D with poor breast cancer prognosis.

We hypothesized that MBC possesses unique genetic profile and tumor immune microenvironment. MBC cases were identified from a total of 10827 breast cancer entries in the Cancer Genome Atlas Data Set (TCGA) and the AACR-GENIE (Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange) cohorts. Tumor infiltrated immune cells were estimated by xCell. Baseline clinical characteristics were compared, and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed. MBC comprised 0.66% of the cohorts (1.2% of TCGA and 0.6% of GENIE). MBC cases were predominantly triple-negative (TNBC) (8 (61.5%) vs 151 (14.4%), P<0.001), and high Nottingham histological grade (8 (61.5%) vs 222 (21.1%), P=0.02) compared to non-MBC in the TCGA cohort.

MBC had increased intratumor heterogeneity (P<0.001), macrophage regulation (P=0.008) and TGF-beta response (P<0.001). Disease-specific survival was decreased in MBC (P=0.018). Angiogenesis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition pathways were enriched in triple-negative MBC by GSEA (P=0.004 and P<0.001, respectively).

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive cancer that lack effective therapeutic strategies. The response rate of PDAC for treatment with gemcitabine, a current first-line chemotherapeutic for this tumor, is lower than 20%. Identifying key targetable molecules that mediate gemcitabine resistance and developing novel strategies for precision PDAC medicine are urgently needed. Most PDACs have either intratumoral hypoxia or high reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; cytotoxic chemotherapy can elevate ROS production in PDACs. Although excessive ROS production leads to oxidative damage of macromolecules such as DNA, pancreatic cancer cells can survive high DNA damage stress levels. Therefore, identifying molecular mechanisms of overcoming ROS-induced stress in pancreatic cancer cells is important for developing novel therapeutic strategies. ROS-induced DNA damage is predominantly repaired via poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1)-mediated DNA repair mechanisms. A recent clinical trial reported that PARP inhibitors are effective in treating pancreatic patients carrying BRCA mutations. However, only less than 10% of pancreatic cancer patients bearing BRCA mutated tumors. Activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-MET positively correlates with poor prognosis for PDAC, and our previous study showed that nuclear c-MET can phosphorylate PARP1 at tyrosine 907 under ROS stimulation to promote DNA repair. As described herein, we proposed to expand PARP inhibitor-targeted therapy to more pancreatic cancer patients regardless of BRCA mutation status by combining olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, with c-MET inhibitors as we demonstrated in our previous studies in breast cancer. In this prospective study, we found that ROS-inducing chemotherapeutic drugs such as gemcitabine and doxorubicin stimulated nuclear accumulation of c-MET in BxPC-3 and L3.6pl pancreatic cancer cells. We further showed that combining a c-MET inhibitor with gemcitabine or a PARP inhibitor induced more DNA damage than monotherapy did. Moreover, we demonstrated the synergistic antitumor effects of c-MET inhibitors combined with a PARP inhibitor or gemcitabine in eliminating pancreatic cancer cells. These data suggested that accumulation of ROS in pancreatic cancer cells promotes nuclear localization of c-MET, resulting in resistance to both chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors. Our findings suggest that combining c-MET inhibitors with PARP inhibitors or gemcitabine is a novel, rational therapeutic strategy for advanced pancreatic cancer.",

Predictive value of 1q21 gain by itself or in concurrence with other cytogenetic abnormalities is evaluated in 737 real-world plasma cell neoplasm (PCN) patients under current therapies. Ten-year progression-free survival (10y-PFS) rates for patients with 2, 3 and >3 copies of 1q21 were 72.2%, 42.5% and 43.4% (P<1.1×10-17). Cox regression analysis confirmed that 1q21 gain was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (HR=1.804, P<0.0001, Harrell C-statistic =0.7779±0.01495) but not for OS (P=0.131). Gain of 1q21 was strongly associated with hypodiploidy (38.8% vs. 7.0%, P=1.3×10-22), hyperdiploidy (44.1% vs. 16.4%, P=1.6×10-13), HRCAs (12.6% vs. 3.5%, 1.8×10-5), IGH breaks (12.3% vs. 2.1%, P=2.1×10-7) and del(13q) (8.0% vs. 4.0%, P=0.031). In our series, 1q21 gain by itself did not improve RISS predictive capacity in patients either eligible or ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). However, compared with patients with other 1q21 gains: concurrence with hyperdiploidy improved the prognosis of ASCT-eligible patients from 62.5% to 96.0% 10-year overall-survival (10y-OS, P<0.002); concurrence with hypodiploidy improved the prognosis of ASCT-ineligible patients from 35.7% to 71.0% (P=0.013); and concurrence with del(13q) worsened the prognosis of ASCT-ineligible patients from 12.5% to 53.4% (P=0.035). Gain of 1q21 should be patient-wisely evaluated, irrespective of the RISS, considering its concurrence with other cytogenetic abnormalities and eligibility for ASCT.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin specific peptidase-2 (USP2) plays important roles in a myriad of cellular activities through deubiquitinating target proteins and its implications in various diseases, especially cancers, are starting to emerge. Our current understanding on USP2 expression in subjects with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its roles in the pathogenesis of HCC is limited. In this study, we found that USP2 protein and mRNA levels were significantly dysregulated in HCC tumor (HCC-T) when compared to adjacent non-tumor (HCC-NT) or normal liver tissues from both human and mouse HCC model. Among the USP2 isoforms, USP2b was the predominant isoform in the normal liver and markedly down-regulated in HCC-T tissues in both human and mice. Data from overexpression, chemical inhibition and knockout studies consistently demonstrated that USP2b promoted cell proliferation, colony formation and wound healing in HepG2 and Huh 7 cells. On the other hand, USP2b exhibited proapoptotic and pronecrtotic activities through enhancing bile acid-induced apoptosis and necrosis in both HepG2 and Huh 7 cells. Unbiased proteomic analysis of USP2-knockout (KO) and parental HepG2 cells resulted in identification of USP2-regulated downstream target proteins involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis, including serine/threonine kinase 4 (STK4), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) and fatty acid binding protein 1 (FABP1). In conclusion, USP2b expression was dysregulated in subjects with HCC and contributed to the pathogenesis of HCC by promoting cell proliferation and exerting proapoptotic and pronecrotic activities. The findings provide the molecular basis for developing therapies for HCC through modulating USP2b expression or activities.",

As a result, the application of preoperative treatments can lead to tumor downstaging in a high proportion of patients and consequently provide initially ineligible patients with opportunities for surgical intervention, representing a breakthrough treatment strategy for liver cancer. Since conversion study is still in its infancy, there remain controversies in terms of patient selection, choice of treatment method, and postoperative management.

    "abstract": "Transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) plays an oncogenic role in prostate cancer as the fusion gene with ERG, and has also been demonstrated to be essential for the cellular entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV). Thus, targeting TMPRSS2 is a promising strategy for therapies against both prostate cancer and coronavirus infection. Although Nafamostat and Camostat have been identified as TMPRSS2 inhibitors, severe side effects such as cerebral hemorrhage, anaphylactoid reaction, and cardiac arrest shock greatly hamper their clinical use. Therefore, more potent and safer drugs against this serine protease should be further developed. In this study, we developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based platform for effectively screening of inhibitors against TMPRSS2 protease activity. The disruption of FRET between green and red fluorescent proteins conjugated with the substrate peptide, which corresponds to the cleavage site of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, was measured to determine the enzymatic activity of TMPRSS2. Through an initiate pilot screening with around 100 compounds, Flupirtine, a selective neuronal potassium channel opener, was identified as a potential TMPRSS2 inhibitor from an FDA-approved drug library by using this screening platform, and showed inhibitory effect on the TMPRSS-dependent infection of SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped lentiviral particles. This study describes a platform proven effective for rapidly screening of TMPRSS2 inhibitors, and suggests that Flupirtine may be worthy of further consideration of repurposing to treat COVID-19 patients.",

To overcome the limitations of this treatment, there is an urgent need to identify more effective treatment targets. High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is known to be associated with progression, metastasis, and poor prognosis of several solid tumors; however, its role in PCa remains unclear. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the clinical significance and biological roles and mechanism of HMGB1 in PCa. We showed that increased expression of HMGB1 correlated with increased risk of aggressive PCa, and high expression of HMGB1 was associated with poor biochemical recurrence-free survival in a Korean cohort. Additionally, the inhibition of HMGB1 expression significantly reduced cell proliferation, invasive capacity, and NF-κB signaling in vitro. Our results indicated that HMGB1 is a critical factor in the development and progression of PCa. Moreover, we found that HMGB1 directly interacts with TNFR1, and TNFR1 overexpression in HMGB1 knockdown cells reversed the effects of HMGB1 knockdown. Importantly, our results suggest that HMGB1 binding to TNFR1 promotes tumor progression by activating the NF-κB signaling pathway in PCa; therefore, the HMGB1/TNFR1/NF-κB signaling pathway could serve as a novel therapeutic target for improving PCa therapy.",

Here, we leveraged mRNA expression data from 2 gene expression omnibus datasets (GSE142083 & GSE117005) of Chinese samples and the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) datasets of Caucasian samples to demonstrate the expression signature of LSCC. The GSE142083 dataset was used as the discovery set since it had 53 pairs of LSCC tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues, and the GSE117005 dataset was treated as the validation set with 5 pairs of tissues. Differential gene expression analysis and enrichment pathway analysis were performed. Besides, we employed weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify hub genes in validated pathways. The TCGA datasets were used to evaluate ethnic specificity. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to further validate the hub gene. Overall, the IL-17 signaling pathway was significantly enriched for upregulated genes in two Chinese datasets while not in TCGA datasets; and IL17RC, MAPK3, S100A8, MMP3, CXCL8, and TNFA1P3 were hub genes regulating such pathway. Therein, IL17RC might be the most important one and the IHC results displayed that the IL17RC gene upregulated in the LSCC tissue. IL-17 signaling pathway has an ethnicity-specific effect in LSCC where it is upregulated in the Chinese while not in the Caucasians and IL17RC might play a key role. Targeting genes located in the IL-17 signaling pathway may be beneficial for Chinese LSCC patients.",

Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) accounts for 80% of all ECs worldwide, with the majority of the remaining 20% being esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Due to its occult and insidious presentation, ESCC is typically diagnosed and treated in its advanced stages, thereby limiting the success of present therapeutic modalities. microRNAs (miRNAs) can function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes, playing critical roles in cancer initiation and progression by regulating target genes in oncogenic pathways. In the current study, we demonstrated that microRNA-196b (miR-196b) is one of the most upregulated miRNAs in both ESCC and EAC. miR-196b was overexpressed in ESCC and EAC cell lines, cellular exosomal RNAs, and ESCC tissue samples. Functional studies revealed that miR-196b acted as an oncomiR by directly targeting a tumor suppressor, ephrin type-A receptor 7 (EPHA7). EPHA7 abrogates the activity of ephrin type-A receptor 2 (EPHA2), a key molecule involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and MAPK/ERK pathways, mediating resistance to UV and chemoradiotherapy in both ESCC and EAC. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-196b is a strong candidate molecular target for EC treatment.",

However, the effects of KLF9 on cancer metastases and the underlying mechanisms still need to be understood. Here, we found that KLF9 evidently inhibited the capabilities of migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. The expression of KLF9 was markedly decreased in breast cancer patients compared with benign tumors, and was positively correlated with the expression of E-cadherin in the tissues of breast cancer patients. Mechanistically, chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with site-directed mutagenesis-luciferase assay revealed that KLF9 activated the E-cadherin promoter by binding to GT-box elements located +84 bp and -143 bp from the TSS in the E-cadherin promoter, leading to elevated expression of E-cadherin mRNA and protein. In vivo experiments confirmed that KLF9 strongly inhibited the lung metastasis of breast cancer and increased mouse E-cadherin expression in 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that KLF9 could suppress breast cancer invasion and metastasis by upregulating E-cadherin, which provided new insight into aggressive treatment of breast cancer by targeting the KLF9/E-cadherin axis.",

    "abstract": "The Human Epidermal Growth Receptor 2, or the HER2 is one of the highest expressed negative receptor that constitutes approximately 15-20% of malevolent breast cancerous tumors among women. The prevalence of HER2 has untimely and unfavorable consequences on breast cancer, and its underlying carcinomous cell processes, structures, and growth. Trastuzumab (TRZ), a humanized antibody that is rooted in relatively recent foundations, has been found operational in its construction of treatments against HER2-positive breast cancer. This drug is combined with radiotherapy or chemotherapy to deregulate HER2 genes in the body. However, patients who suffer from evolved tumors in advanced stages of cancer exhibit a good amount of tolerance towards singularly used TRZ treatment. Inversely, the factorization of Tumor Testing Fields (TTFields or TTFs) into cancer therapy revives the functions of a TRZ treatment plan, by sensitizing the HER2 genes to the drug. In turn, this facilitates TRZ to continue limiting cancerous cell multiplication and toxicity levels within the treatment. This research evaluates the aspects and effects of this pairing, both in vivo and in vitro through BT474 cells. The TTFields conduct an electromagnetic boundary, which generates sine-wave radiations to manipulate the HER2 gene structure. The methods followed in the research also examines the gene cell cultures and their viability through solutions like Tryptophan blue, or the Crystal violet which may or may not deliver certain testmants to the experiment. The Western Blot Test and the IHC confirm the presence of antibodies and negative receptors in the BT474 cells. These procedures contribute to the formulation of a treatment plan that overcomes the TRZ-resistant nature of the tumor, which is essentially the aim of the research. Thus, the paper substantiates that a healthy combination of TTF's with TRZ can enhance the penetration of TRZ after inducing apoptosis due to TTFields therapy. The success of a TTField in undertaking this pursuit makes room for more utilization of it in future cancerous treatment ventures.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent and deadly form of cancer globally with typically unfavorable outcomes. Increasing research suggests that lactate serves as an important carbon contributor to cellular metabolism and holds a crucial part in the progression, sustenance, and treatment response of tumors. However, the contribution of lactate-related genes (LRGs) in HCC is still unclear. In this study, we analyzed TCGA datasets and screened 21 differentially expressed LRGs related to long-term survivals in HCC patients. Pan-cancer assays revealed that 21 LRGs expression exhibited a dysregulated level in man types of tumors and associated with clinical prognosis of tumor patients. The analysis of 21 LRGs successfully classified HCC samples into two molecular subtypes, and these two subtypes showed significant differences in clinical information, gene expression, and immune characteristics. Subsequently, based on the aforementioned 21 LRGs, a novel prognostic signature (DTYMK, IRAK1, POLRMT, MPV17, UQCRH, PDSS1, SLC16A3, SPP1 and LDHD) was generated by LASSO-Cox regression analysis. Survival assays demonstrated that the signature performed well in predicting the overall survival of patients with HCC. The results of Gene Set Variation Analysis indicated that the high GSVA scores were associated with poor prognosis. Moreover, we also investigated the correlation between GSVA scores and various signaling pathways in HCC. Among the nine prognostic genes, our attention focused on POLRMT which was highly expressed in HCC specimens based on TCGA datasets and several HCC cell lines. In addition, functional assays indicated that POLRMT distinctly promoted the proliferation, migration and energy metabolism of HCC cells via regulating Wnt/β-Catenin signaling. Overall, through the establishment of a novel prognostic signature, we have provided potential clinical value for assessing the prognosis of HCC patients. Furthermore, our study has identified the high expression of POLRMT in HCC and demonstrated its crucial role in HCC cell proliferation. These findings hold great importance in advancing our understanding of the pathophysiology of HCC, identifying new therapeutic targets, and improving patient survival rates.",

To improve pharmacotherapy for GBM, galectins are being studied provided their positive correlation with the malignancy and disease severity. Despite the use of galectin inhibitors and literature displaying the ability of the lectin proteins to decrease tumor burden and decrease mortality within various malignancies, galectin inhibitors have not been studied for GBM therapy. Interestingly, anti-galectin siRNA delivered in nanoparticle capsules, assisting in blood brain barrier penetrance, is well studied for GBM, and has demonstrated a remarkable ability to attenuate both galectin and tumor count. Provided that the two therapies have an analogous anti-galectin effect, it is hypothesized that galectin inhibitors encapsuled within nanoparticles will likely have a similar anti-galectin effect in GBM cells and further correlate to a repressed tumor burden.",

    "abstract": "Follicular lymphoma (FL), derived from germinal centre (GC) B cells, is a kind of systemic neoplasm. Even though FL is indolent, it remains an incurable haematology Neoplasm. Accumulating evidence has suggested that the circulating cytokine is associated with the development of FL, yet the causal relationship between FL and circulating cytokines remains undetermined. Therefore, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) to confirm the causal link between FL and levels of circulating cytokines with the use of summary data on circulating cytokines and FL. All these data from genome-wide association study were derived from the Genome-wide pQTL mapping which contains 14,824 individuals. FL data were acquired exclusively from FinnGen, where 218,792 individuals (522 cases vs. 218,270 controls) were involved. Various statistical methods, including the inverse variance weighted method (IVW), weighted median (WME), simple model, weighted model (WM) and MR-Egger, were used to evaluate the potential causal connection between circulating cytokines and FL. Sensitivity analysis, which involves the examination of the heterogeneity, pleiotropy, and leave-one-out method, was also performed to ensure more trustworthy results. A bidirectional MR test was performed to evaluate the direction of causal association between circulating cytokines and FL. Combining all the steps of MR analysis, we revealed four causal cytokines: C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5), interleukin-15 receptor A (IL15RA), interleukin-20 (IL20), and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3). The risk of FL may be inversely linked to CXCL5 (OR=0.73, CI: 0.545-0.979, P=0.036), IL-15RA (OR=0.669, CI: 0.451-0.993, P=0.046), and IL-20 (OR=0.565, CI: 0.325-0.981, P=0.043) but positively linked to NT-3 (OR=1.872, CI: 1.063-3.297, P=0.03). In addition, in our study, no causal effect of FL on cytokines was demonstrated and no significant heterogeneity and pleiotropy were found. Our research revealed the causal relationship between cytokines and FL, along with both the anti-protective effect of CXCL5, IL-15RA, and IL-20 and the protective effect of neurotrophin-3 on FL. These findings aim to provide new clues regarding the pathogenesis of FL and to extend the potential of circulating cytokines to therapeutic interventions.",

ITM2A, a transmembrane protein, has been identified as a suppressor in tumor progression recently. Our study underscored a significant correlation between low ITM2A expression in bladder cancer tissues and high tumor grade, AJCC stage, and poor overall survival time. Additionally, our findings demonstrated that reinstating ITM2A expression impeded cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while conversely, its suppression enhanced these malignant behaviors. Furthermore, we elucidated that ITM2A could suppress malignant phenotypes of bladder cancer cells via inhibiting activation of the STAT3 induced by IL-6.

However, resistance to imatinib may occur during treatment. BCR::ABL1 dependent imatinib resistance has been well resolved with more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but BCR::ABL1 independent resistance still remains to be resolved. This study is devoted to find novel targets for BCR::ABL1 independent imatinib-resistant patients. It is reported BCR::ABL1 independent resistance is mainly related to the activation of alternative survival pathway, and mTOR is an important regulator for cell growth especially in tumor cells. Hence, we explored the role of mTOR in BCR::ABL1 independent resistance, the possibility of mTOR to be a therapeutic target for imatinib resistant patients and the related mechanism. We found mTOR was upregulated in imatinib-resistant cells. mTOR inhibition by AZD2014 led to growth inhibition and synergized with imatinib in apoptosis induction in K562/G01. AZD2014 exerted its anti-leukemia effect through enhancing autophagy. mTOR signal pathway is poorly inhibited by imatinib and AZD2014 shows little effect on BCR::ABL1 signal pathway, which indicates that mTOR is involved in imatinib resistance via a BCR::ABL1 independent manner. Taken together, mTOR represents a potential target to overcome BCR::ABL1 independent imatinib resistance.",

    "abstract": "Lymphoma is a disease that affects countless lives each year. In order to combat this disease, researchers have been exploring the potential of DNMTi and HDACi drugs. These drugs target the cellular processes that contribute to lymphomagenesis and treatment resistance. Our research evaluated the effectiveness of a combination of two such drugs, hydralazine (DNMTi) and valproate (HDACi), in B-cell and T-cell lymphoma cell lines. Here we show that the combination of hydralazine and valproate decreased the viability of cells over time, leading to the arrest of cell-cycle and apoptosis in both B and T-cells. This combination of drugs proved to be synergistic, with each drug showing significant growth inhibition individually. Microarray analyses of HuT 78 and Raji cells showed that the combination of hydralazine and valproate resulted in the up-regulation of 562 and 850 genes, respectively, while down-regulating 152 and 650 genes. Several proapoptotic and cell cycle-related genes were found to be up-regulated. Notably, three and five of the ten most up-regulated genes in HuT 78 and Raji cells, respectively, were related to immune function. In summary, our study suggests that the combination of hydralazine and valproate is an effective treatment option for both B- and T-lymphomas. These findings are highly encouraging, and we urge further clinical evaluation to validate our research and potentially improve lymphoma treatment.",

More specifically, this investigation probes into the potential utility of these steroids in providing therapeutic interventions, diagnostic insights, and prognostic indicators. Furthermore, this study also delves into the mechanistic pathways through which sex steroid interventions exert influence on colorectal cancer. It was discovered that the trio of sex steroid hormones partakes in an array of biological processes, thereby influencing the onset and progression of colorectal cancer.

ADT leads to altered testosterone levels that may affect brain morphology as well as cognition. Considering the reliability of cortical thickness (CT) as a marker of cognitive and brain changes, e.g., in Alzheimer's disease, we assessed the impacts of ADT on CT and working memory. Thirty men with non-metastatic prostate cancer receiving ADT and 32 patients not receiving ADT (controls or CON), matched in age and years of education, participated in N-back task and quality-of-life (QoL) assessments as well as brain imaging at baseline and prospectively at 6 months. Imaging data were processed with published routines to estimate CT and the results of a group by time flexible factorial analysis were evaluated at a corrected threshold. ADT and CON did not differ in N-back performance or QoL across time points. Relative to CON, patients receiving ADT showed significantly higher frontopolar cortex (FPC) CT at 6-month follow-up vs. baseline. Follow-up vs. baseline FPC CT change correlated negatively with changes in 2-back correct response rate and in testosterone levels across all participants. In mediation analysis, FPC CT change mediated the association between testosterone level change and 2-back accuracy rate change. Increases in FPC CT following 6 months of ADT may reflect early neurodegenerative changes in response to androgen deprivation. While no significant impact on working memory or QoL was observed over 6 months, further research of longer duration of treatment is warranted to unravel the full spectrum of cognitive and neural consequences of ADT in prostate cancer patients.",

In hypoxia, DOX transport into cells was 2.5 to 5-fold lower than in normoxia. The subline F5 monolayer-cultured cells exhibited the highest DOX uptake, while subline H2 cells showed the lowest uptake in normoxia and hypoxia. In 3D cultures, DOX transport was up to 2-fold lower in spheroids formed from subline H2 cells. Spheroids from subline D8 and MDA-MB-231 parent cells had the highest DOX uptake.

    "abstract": "To investigate the value of prognostic nutrition index (PNI) and systemic immunoinflammatory index (SII) for predicting pathological responses of patients with advanced gastric cancer (GC) after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). The clinicopathological data of 326 patients with advanced GC who received NACT in Xiangya School of Medicine, Central South University (The First People's Hospital of Changde City) from January 2017 to December 2021 were retrospectively collected. The SII and PNI of patients were calculated. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was leveraged for getting the optimal cutoff values of SII and PNI. The pathological response of patients after NACT, as obtained from their postoperative pathological examinations, was evaluated based on the tumor regression grade (TRG) criteria. Multivariate regression analysis was employed for identifying factors that led to various pathological responses after NACT in advanced GC patients. The log-rank test was utilized for between-group comparison of patients' survival curves. The SII and PNI were 507.45 and 48.48 respectively, and their levels were divided into high and low groups. Pathological response (TRG 0-1) was observed in 66 cases (20.25%), while non-pathological response (TRG 2-3) was observed in 260 cases (79.75%). The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that tumor diameter < 5 cm, ypT T0-T2, ypN N0, chemotherapy regimen XELOX (capecitabine combined with oxaliplatin), SII < 507.45 (P=0.002), PNI > 48.48 were all independent factors affecting the pathological responses of advanced GC patients after NACT (all P < 0.05). With SII and PNI being included, the AUC was 0.821 (95% CI: 0.765-0.876), and the specificity was 87.90% and the sensitivity was 64.20%. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that NACT patients with tumor diameter < 5 cm, ypT T0-T2, ypN N0, XELOX chemotherapy regimen, SII < 507.45 and SII ≥ 507.45 had a higher survival rate. (P < 0.001). Before treatment, tumor diameter < 5 cm, ypT T0-T2, ypN N0, chemotherapy regimen XELOX, SII < 507.45, PNI > 48.48 were all independent factors affecting the pathological response of advanced GC patients after NACT. Moreover, the inclusion of SII and PNI increased the accuracy of predicting the pathological response of patients after NACT.",

New advancement is half-breed technique has recently been recognized that photodynamic therapy (PDT) can be considered as a potentially effective modality by using photosensitizers which work through the generation of localized ROS on exposure to light. This review analyzes the recent progress in PDT and evaluation of its effectiveness in the cure of skin malignancies: with the emphasis on its applicability to BCCs and SCCs, as well as the limitations concerning the cure of melanomas. This review gives an insight to how PDT works and how it can be combined with other forms of therapy, and the prospects of photosensitizer carriers with special reference to nanotechnology. Also, the optimization of the parameters associated with the use of PDT is explored in an attempt to improve on its safety and efficacy in treatment. As such, the purpose of this systematic review of the literature is to advance the knowledge of PDT usage in contemporary dermatologic oncology and to contribute to the eventual expansion of this therapy into other skin diseases and potential use as a first-line treatment for skin neoplasia.",

Our study aimed to evaluate the antitumor effects of NK cell-based adoptive transfer immunotherapy for PDAC in an orthotopic mouse model. Orthotopic KrasLSL-G12D p53LSL-R172H Pdx1-Cre (KPC) mice were used to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy. Mouse NK cells (LNK cells) (1×106) were intravenously injected to tumor-bearing mice once a week for 3 weeks. MRI measurements (tumor volume and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values) and survival were compared between control and LNK treated tumors. Flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were used to determine LNK cells cytotoxicity and IFN-γ level, respectively. LNK cells can produce a higher level of IFN-γ and more effectively lyse PDAC cells compared with spleen NK cells in vitro. LNK-cell adoptive transfer therapy elicited potent in vivo antitumor activity, resulting in delayed tumor growth (P=0.033) in KPC mice. The ADC values at the last timepoint ((0.94±0.06)×10-3 mm2/s) were significantly higher than that at first timepoint ((0.75±0.04)×10-3 mm2/s) in treated tumors (P<0.001).

    "abstract": "The detection and monitoring of prostate cancer (PrCa) malignancies using most of the conventional strategies is challenging. As an over-expressed biomarker of PrCa, the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) can be delineated by non-invasive imaging to address such issue. Herein, we report the positron emission tomography (PET) of VEGFR-2 expression in a PrCa mice models by composing a novel tracer, [89Zr]zirconium-labeled clinical VEGFR-2 antibody (Ramucirumab), i.e. 89Zr-Df-R. The VEGFR-2 expression levels among three different PrCa cell lines (PC-3, LNCAP and LAPC-4) were confirmed by flow cytometry. The immuno-PET imaging and bio-distribution (Bio-D) study were conducted in subcutaneous PrCa mice models via the 89Zr-Df-R. The regions of interest (ROI) data showed that the uptake of 89Zr-Df-R in the positive PC-3 (9.5±3 %ID/g) tumors are obviously higher than those ones in the negative LNCAP (6.0±1.7 %ID/g) or LAPC-4 (4.3±0.7 %ID/g) tumors at 120 hours post-injection, while the accumulation of 89Zr-Df-R in PC-3 tumors (4.3±1.2 %ID/g)) could be significantly reduced by the blockade of unlabeled Ramucirumab. These quantitative data coincide with the Bio-D data and proves the specificity. Additionally, the immuno-fluorescent staining results confirmed the expression pattern of VEGFR-2 among various PrCa tumors. Finally, the flow cytometry of PC-3 tumor tissue further proved that the binding of 89Zr-Df-R to VEGFR-2 primarily occurs on the PC-3 tumor cells. In summary, the description of the VEGFR-2 expression in PrCa by in-vivo PET with 89Zr-Df-R is feasible and it may shed light on the early detection of foci and dynamic monitoring of anti-VEGFR-2 therapy in PrCa.",

Immunohistochemical staining of samples from the registration ECOG E3200 trial of bevacizumab with FOLFOX demonstrated that only patients with carcinomas expressing low levels of VEGF-A165b, an anti-angiogenic splice variant of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor family of proteins, benefited from bevacizumab treatment. To identify a more useful biomarker of response we tested the hypothesis that circulating VEGF-A165b levels correlate with immunohistochemical staining. 17 patients with biopsy proven colorectal adenocarcinoma had pre-operative blood samples drawn. They underwent resection and had post-resection blood drawn. The plasma was analysed for levels of VEGF-Axxxb using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the tumour blocks stained for VEGF-Axxxb and pan-VEGF-A. The normalised ratio of VEGF-Axxxb expression to that of panVEGF-A expression scored by IHC was calculated and correlated with plasma VEGF-A165b levels. Plasma levels of VEGF-Axxxb significantly correlated with the VEGF-Axxxb:panVEGF-A ratio (r=0.594, P<0.02) in colorectal cancers. Median plasma VEGF-Axxxb levels were 151 pg/ml. The mean (1.5±0.17) and median, IQR (1.8, 1-2) IHC scores of the patients with greater than median plasma VEGF-Axxxb were significantly greater than those with less than median plasma VEGF-Axxxb levels (mean ± SEM=0.85±10.12, median, IQR=1, 0.54-1). These results suggest that plasma VEGF-Axxxb levels could be an effective biomarker of response to Bevacizumab. These results indicate that a prospective trial is warranted to explore the use of plasma VEGF-Axxxb levels to stratify patients for colorectal cancer treatment by bevacizumab.",

Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the most important host cells in the tumor microenvironment. Some studies have found that CAFs can promote tumor angiogenesis, but there are few reports on the relationship between CAFs and VM. Tissue samples were collected from 60 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 10 persons with normal liver function. The relationship between VM expression and clinicopathologic features was analyzed. Furthermore, the relationship between VM expression and vimentin or α-SMA expression was analyzed. Primary culture of hepatocellular CAFs and the collection of conditioned media were carried out. The effects of hepatocellular CAF conditioned medium on the formation of VM and the levels of VM-related proteins and genes in MHCC-97H cells were studied. The positive rate of VM was 35.0% in HCC tissues. There was no VM expression in normal liver tissues. VM expression was related to tumor diameter, Edmondson grade, clinical stage, and liver cirrhosis. The expression of vimentin and α-SMA in VM-positive patients was higher than in VM-negative patients. Different concentrations of hepatocellular CAF conditioned medium could promote the formation of VM and increase the expression of VM-related genes and proteins (MMP2 and EphA2) in MHCC-97H cells. The results show that there was a significant correlation between VM formation and the expression of vimentin or α-SMA in HCC tissues. The conditioned medium of hepatocellular CAFs may promote VM formation and the expression of VM-related genes and proteins (MMP2 and EphA2) in hepatoma cell line MHCC-97H.",

Transcriptome analyses have revealed significant changes in the cell cycle- and senescence-related pathways in differentiated GBM cells induced by dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP). Further investigations showed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) derived from enhanced mitochondrial function are involved in senescence induction and proliferation inhibition. Moreover, we found that IL-6 from dbcAMP- or temozolomide (TMZ)-induced senescent cells facilitates the glycolytic phenotype of GBM cells and that inhibiting the IL-6-related pathway hinders the proglycolytic effect of either agent. In patient-derived GBM xenograft models, a specific antibody targeting the IL-6 receptor tocilizumab (TCZ) significantly prolongs the survival time of TMZ-treated mice. Taken together, these results suggest that both the differentiation-inducing agent dbcAMP and the chemotherapy drug TMZ are able to drive GBM cells to senescence, and the latter releases IL-6 to potentiate glycolysis, suggesting that IL-6 is a target for adjuvant chemotherapy in GBM treatment.",

However, the upstream regulating mechanisms of c-Myc in PC are unclear. Herein, we reported that E3 ubiquitin ligase RING-finger protein 6 (RNF6) was upregulated in PC tissues, and an elevated RNF6 level was closely associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in patients with PC. In functional experiments, RNF6 over-expression accelerated the metastatic ability of PC cells, whereas RNF6 knockdown impaired PC cell motility and invasiveness along with metastasis in an orthotopic mouse model. Furthermore, we found that RNF6 promoted PC cell metastasis by enhancing c-Myc-mediated aerobic glycolysis. Mechanistically, RNF6 increased the expression level of c-Myc by catalyzing the ubiquitination of Max-dimerization protein-1 (MAD1), a cellular antagonist of c-Myc. Lastly, RNF6 promoted the degradation of MAD1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and this reduction in the MAD1 levels enabled c-Myc to promote the Warburg effect in PC. Our results demonstrate that RNF6 may be a novel biomarker in PC carcinogenesis, thereby indicating that targeting the RNF6/MAD1/c-Myc axis is a potential strategy for PC therapy.",

In this study, ENO1 monoclonal antibodies (ENO1mAb) was prepared to blockade ENO1 and the therapeutic role was observed in cervical cancer cells. First, ENO1mAb was prepared and screened by evaluating the inhibitory effect on migration and invasion of cervical cancer cells, which is supposed to block ENO1 expressed on cell membrane. Second, folic acid (FA) conjugated PLGA nanoparticles (FA-SS-PLGA) targeting tumor cells were prepared to mediate ENO1mAb entry into cells and its anti-tumor effects were investigated in vitro. We found that PLGA/FA-SS-PLGA nanoparticles-mediated ENO1mAb could antagonize the activity of ENO1 enzyme, significantly decreased the contents of lactic acid and pyruvate, and inhibited the proliferation, migration and clone formation of cervical cancer cells compared with the sham control (P < 0.05). In summary, ENO1mAb could specifically block ENO1 expressed on cell membrane and inhibit ENO1 glycolysis enzyme activity inside tumor cells, and plays a therapeutic role against cervical cancer cells.

Mortalin was also demonstrated to promote Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and was considered as a factor for maintaining the stemness of the cancer stem cells. However, the underlying mechanisms about mortalin maintaining the stemness of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) remain unclear. Here, we identified that increased expression of mortalin in breast cancer was associated with poorer overall survival rate. Mortalin was elevated in breast cancer cell lines and BCSC-enriched populations. Additionally, knockdown of mortalin significantly inhibited the cell proliferation, migration and EMT, as well as sphere forming capacity and stemness genes expression. Further study revealed that mortalin promoted EMT and maintained BCSCs stemness via activating the Wnt/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling pathway in vivo and in vitro.

The hypoxia/HIF-1α-regulated lncRNAs that also regulate a specific histone mark and promote EMT and metastasis have not been identified. We performed RNA-sequencing dataset analysis to search for such lncRNAs and lncRNA RP11-367G18.1 was the hypoxia-induced lncRNA with the highest hazard ratio. High expression of lncRNA RP11-367G18.1 is correlated with a worse survival of head and neck cancer patients. We further showed that lncRNA RP11-367G18.1 is induced by hypoxia and directly regulated by HIF-1α in cell lines. Overexpression of lncRNA RP11-367G18.1 induces the EMT and increases the in vitro migration and invasion and in vivo metastatic activity. Knockdown experiments showed that lncRNA RP11-367G18.1 plays an essential role in hypoxia-induced EMT. LncRNA RP11-367G18.1 specifically regulates the histone 4 lysine 16 acetylation (H4K16Ac) mark that is located on the promoters of two core EMT regulators, Twist1 and SLUG, and VEGF genes.

    "abstract": "Irreversible electroporation (IRE) has been postulated to have an off-target effect on lesions not in the tumor-ablative field, possibly through heightened immunologic response. In this study, we evaluated whether combination IRE and immunotherapy would lead to increased tumor necrosis and T cell recruitment to both the treated tumors and tumors outside the local ablative field. An in vitro cell-IRE model was established to evaluate the ability of T lymphocytes (EL4 cell and HH cells) migration in response to Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells (Hepa1-6 and HepG2) with IRE treatment. An orthotopic HCC mouse model was established by implantation of 1mm^3 sections of Hepa1-6 tumor tissues into the right and left lobes of the liver. The Hepa1-6 cells and HepG2 cells with IRE treatment increased the migration ability of EL4 cell and HH cells, specifically when they were pretreated with immunotherapeutic agents in vitro. In the orthotopic HCC mouse model, IRE+immunotherapy treatment enhanced the necrosis and subpopulation of infiltrated CD8 positive cells, but attenuated the tumor associated inflammatory cells in both IRE target tumor tissues and IRE off-target tumor tissues from the mice with 4 weeks of immunotherapy following IRE. This study provided the evidence that combination of IRE and immunotherapy enhances tumor necrosis and immune responses, not only in the IRE-treated tumor but also in the off-target tumor.",

In this study, we aimed to reveal the mechanisms of miR-374b-5p in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in PC. Gene Expression Omnibus datasets (GSE24279 and GSE71533) and the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas were employed to screen for potential prognostic miRNAs. The expression of miR-374b-5p was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in 78 paired PDAC tissue samples. The biological effects of miR-374b-5p were investigated using in vitro and in vivo assays. Luciferase reporter assays and immunohistochemical tests were conducted to verify the interaction between miR-374b-5p and its predicted direct target, KDM5B. MiR-374b-5p was downregulated in PC tissues, and a low level of miR-374b-5p was associated with poor overall survival, greater tumor size, and more lymph node metastasis in PC. In vitro assays indicated that overexpression of miR-374b-5p suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PC cells. Mechanistically, miR-374b-5p suppressed the expression of KDM5B, which inhibited E-cadherin expression but promoted N-cadherin and vimentin expression. Finally, in vivo assays demonstrated that miR-374b-5p overexpression suppressed tumor growth and lung metastasis in PANC-1 cells. Thus, our findings indicate that miR-374b-5p could be a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for KDM5B-induced EMT in PC.",

This study aimed to establish a prognostic score using unique transcriptomic profiles of long-term survivors to be used as a patient selection tool for meaningful clinical intervention in PDAC. In TCGA PDAC cohort, 16 genes were significantly upregulated in the long-term survivor tumors. A prognostic score was established using these 16 genes by LASSO Cox regression, and PHKG1, HOXA4, ISL2, DMRT3 and TRA2A gene expressions were included in the score. The prognostic value was confirmed in both testing and validation cohorts. The characteristics of the high score tumor was investigated by bioinformatical approach. The high score tumor was associated with TP53 mutation but not with other commonly enhanced signaling pathways in PDAC. The high score tumor was associated with higher tumor mutational burden and unfavorable tumor microenvironment (TME), such as lower infiltration of CD8-positive T cells and dendritic cells, and less cell composition of mature blood vessels and fibroblasts. The high score tumor was also associated with enhanced cell proliferation and margin positivity after surgery. The impact of score component genes on the cell proliferation was investigated by in vitro experiments. Silencing of the score component genes promoted cell proliferation. In conclusion, the prognostic score predicted PDAC patient survival and was associated with cancer aggressiveness such as unfavorable TME and enhanced cell proliferation.",

Experimental studies on immunotherapy drugs, molecular inhibitors, radiation dosage escalation and vascular growth factor blockers have all failed to provide satisfactory outcomes. TTFields therapy, on the other hand, have emerged as a viable substitute to therapies like radiation in GBM patients having a highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To enhance the biofunctional impacts, we explored the combination events with TTFields and proton treatment in this study. We conducted a cell viability test, a cell death detection evaluation, a ROS analysis, a three-dimensional (3D) culture system, and a migration assay. The combination of proton radiation and TTFields therapy laid a substantial anticancer impact on the F98 and U373 as compared to the consequences of either of these therapies used separately. The combination proton beam therapy used by TTFields was very successful in curbing GBM from migrating. GBM cell metastasis is restricted by TTFields combined proton by downregulating the MAPK, NF-κB, and PI3K/AKT indicating pathways, caused by reduced EMT marker expression. These findings furnish biological proof for the molecular grounds of TTFields in combination with proton used for GBM therapy.",

    "abstract": "Despite the significant progress in cancer cure, the development of new approaches to cancer therapy is still of great importance since many deadly tumors remain untreatable. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT), proposed more than eighty years ago, is still considered a potentially advantageous approach. Irradiation of cells containing 10B isotopes with epithermal neutrons and the consequent decay of boron nuclei releases particles that deposit high energy along a very short path, inflicting heavy damage on the target cells but sparing the neighbouring tissue. Delivery and preferential accumulation of boron in cancer cells are the major obstacles that slow down the clinical use of BNCT. Since DNA damage caused by irradiation is the major reason for cell death, the incorporation of boron-containing nucleotides into the DNA of cancer cells may significantly increase the efficacy of BNCT. In this review, we discuss the current state of knowledge in the synthesis of boron-containing nucleosides and their application for BNCT with a special focus on their possible incorporation into genomic DNA.",

However, the safety and efficacy of this regimen was unknown in older myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) patients. From January 2018 to December 2021, 68 consecutive older patients (aged over 50) using the RTC regimen for T-cell replete haplo-HSCT (RTC group) at our center were eligible, 68 patients aged under 50 using modified busulfan, cyclophosphamide plus antithymocyte globulin regimen (Bu/Cy/ATG) (Bu/Cy/ATG group) were randomly selected from 223 MDS patients during the same period in a 1:1 ratio matched-pair analysis for patient sex, World Health Organization (WHO) category, international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) risk group, time from diagnosis to HSCT, chemotherapy in advanced, response after chemotherapy, donor sex, infused mononuclear cells and the CD34-positive cell count. The transplant outcomes were also compared between the RTC group and the matched sibling donor (MSD) haploidentical stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with the busulfan and cyclophosphamide (Bu/Cy) conditioning regimen. The cumulative incidences of grade II-IV acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD) in the RTC group were significantly lower than that in the Bu/Cy/ATG group. The 3-year cumulative incidences of treatment related mortality (TRM) in the two groups were 12.3% versus 14.7% (P=0.613). The cumulative incidences of relapse, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were comparable between the two groups. The outcomes were better in RTC group than those patients received MSD transplant, with lower incidence of TRM, and higher OS and DFS. The advantages were still significant when comparing patients receiving children donors HSCT in RTC group with MSD transplant in survival and TRM. Children donor with the RTC regimen could be a better choice than the MSD HSCT with Bu/Cy regimen for the elderly MDS patients. The encouraging results suggest that the RTC regimen followed by haplo-HSCT is a potentially promising method for older MDS patients.

This cohort study included 189 DTC patients treated at Shidong Hospital between April 2016 and February 2021. Patients were divided into an experimental group, which received combined radioactive iodine (131I) therapy and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression therapy (n = 119), and a control group, which received only TSH suppression therapy (n = 70). Messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of METTL3 and METTL14 in patients' serum were measured before and six months after treatment using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Thyroid function indicators, including free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), TSH, and thyroglobulin (Tg), were assessed using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed using Cox regression analysis, and data visualization was performed with the ggplot2 package in R. Both METTL3 and METTL14 expression levels significantly decreased after treatment in both the experimental and control groups (P < 0.001). Regarding thyroid function indicators, FT3 and FT4 levels significantly increased, while TSH and Tg levels significantly decreased post-treatment (P < 0.001). Lower post-treatment expression levels of METTL3 and METTL14 were significantly associated with a higher risk of recurrence. Cox regression analysis further indicated that post-treatment METTL3, METTL14, TSH, and Tg levels were independent predictors of DFS (P < 0.05). Low expression levels of METTL3 and METTL14 are closely associated with malignant progression and an increased risk of recurrence in DTC. Patients receiving combined 131I and TSH suppression therapy demonstrated longer DFS. These findings suggest that METTL3 and METTL14 could serve as potential biomarkers for prognosis evaluation in DTC patients.",

Subsequently, BT-474 cells were treated with different concentrations of pertuzumab (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 μg/mL), pyrrolizinib (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 nMol/L) or a synergistic mixture of pertuzumab and pyrrolizinib.

Subsequently, the effects of HER-2 knockdown on PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and cell function were investigated. Elevated HER-2 expression was observed in breast cancer tissues and cells. The combination of pertuzumab and pyrrolitinib effectively reduced HER-2 levels, inhibited cell viability, proliferation, migration and infiltration, and promoted apoptosis. Knockdown of HER-2 inhibited the viability, proliferation, migration and invasion, downregulated the expression of PI3K and AKT, and increased the apoptosis of BT-474 cells, with these effects restored by IGF-1.

The combination of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and the targeted agent sorafenib has been proposed to improve treatment outcomes. This study investigates the prognostic factors influencing the effectiveness of this combined treatment in HCC patients with PVTT. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 299 patients diagnosed with HCC and PVTT who underwent TACE and sorafenib treatment between January 2018 and December 2022. Patients were categorized into good-prognosis (n = 197) and poor-prognosis (n = 102) groups based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) assessed four weeks post-treatment. Prognostic factors were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses to identify significant determinants affecting therapeutic outcomes. Key prognostic factors included tumor number, differentiation, size, PVTT extent, Child-Pugh class, ECOG performance status, hospitalization duration, and AFP levels. Patients with a single tumor had better outcomes (OR 0.358, P = 0.002), whereas poor differentiation (OR 4.561, P = 0.005) and larger tumor size (OR 0.347, P < 0.001) were associated with worse prognosis. A higher Child-Pugh class (OR 0.563, P = 0.035) and better ECOG performance (OR 2.710, P = 0.025) improved prognosis, while prolonged hospitalization and elevated AFP levels were linked to poorer outcomes. ASA classification and HCC morphology did not significantly impact prognosis. The prognosis of HCC with PVTT treated with TACE and sorafenib is significantly influenced by tumor characteristics, liver function, and overall patient health. Identifying these factors can aid in refining personalized treatment strategies to improve survival outcomes.",

Comparing recruitment strategies on participant accrual and cost can inform the use of cost-effective recruitment strategies for enrollment of diverse populations of cancer patients. In this study, we compared social media, internet sites, and clinic-based recruitment on accrual, cost, and characteristics of cancer patients (i.e., sociodemographic, cancer type/stage, and smoking habits) enrolled in a randomized trial of app-based smoking cessation interventions. Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and analysis of variance for continuous variables were used to compared data between recruitment strategies. In 35 months, 427 cancer patients from 45 US states enrolled in the trial out of 3,936 screened (rate of participation, 10.8%). Social media recruited over eight times the number of enrolled participants (n=340, 79.6%) compared with Internet sites (n=43, 10.1%) and clinics (n=42, 9.8%). Most (80.1%) participants were women, with mean age 52.3 years. About 20.4% of participants were from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds, 23.0% were rural residents, and 23.7% were uninsured. Over 32 cancer types and all cancer stages were represented. Breast cancer was the most common diagnosis (n=129/427, 30.2%), followed by lung cancer (n=96/427, 23.8%). Internet recruitment generated a higher proportion of men (30.2% vs. 26.2% clinics vs. 17.4% social media, P=.005). Clinics generated a higher proportion of Hispanic participants (9.5% vs. 7.0% Internet vs. 2.6% social media, P=.04) and cancer patients aged 65 and older (28.6% vs. 11.5% social media vs. 4.7% Internet, P=.01). Social media recruited a higher proportion of participants with low income (<$20,000: 39.1% vs. 23.3% Internet vs. 19.0% clinics, P<.001), who tended to have later stage cancers (stage IV: 17.4% vs. 14.0% Internet vs. 7.1% clinics, P=.05). Cost per randomized participant ranged from $270 via social media to $454 via Internet sites to $2,240 via clinic-based recruitment. In conclusion, social media was the most efficient and cost-effective method for recruiting a quality sample of racially/ethnically, geographically, socioeconomically, and clinically diverse sample of cancer patients into a smoking cessation clinical trial.

Ultrasound assessment was employed to evaluate axillary and brachial artery parameters using specific techniques, and arterial characteristics were analyzed. Significant differences were observed in the ultrasound parameters of both axillary and brachial arteries between the non-LNM and LNM groups. Specifically, axillary and brachial artery diameters and resistive index exhibited significant differences and correlations with axillary LNM. Furthermore, molecular markers such as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status, estrogen receptor (ER) status, and progesterone receptor (PR) status were found to be significantly correlated with LNM. Additionally, a nomogram was constructed, demonstrating the predictive value of the integrated arterial parameters. The combined model, incorporating axillary and brachial artery parameters, exhibited a higher predictive capability for axillary LNM compared to individual arterial parameters (AUC = 0.984). Ultrasound assessment of axillary and brachial artery parameters, in conjunction with molecular markers, holds promise as a non-invasive tool for predicting LNM in BRCA patients. The observed correlations provide insights into the potential clinical relevance of arterial parameters in risk stratification and treatment planning. Further research in larger, prospective cohorts is warranted to validate the findings and enhance the precision of BRCA management.",

We conducted a proteome-wide association study (PWAS) mainly using mendelian randomization (MR) to explore the causal proteins associated with BCa. Protein quantitative trait locis (pQTLs) were derived from two large proteome genome-wide association studies. After validation by multiple sensitivity analysis and two replication analyses, we identified five plasma proteins showed significant causal associations with BCa. Our study indicated that GSTM4 (OR = 0.81 (0.74-0.89), P = 5.14 × 10-6, PPH4 = 0.89) emerged as the most reliable target. Besides, PSCA, LY6D, SLURP1 and GSTM1 also showed clear causal association but only failed in colocalization. We also performed several downstream analyses. Protein-protein interactions analysis found these causal targets came from glutathione S-transferase family or lymphocyte antigen-6 family. Phenome-wide MR analysis revealed PSCA may lead to peptic ulcer and local infections of skin and subcutaneous tissue. We then employed single-cell analysis, protein-protein interactions, and druggability evaluation. Phenome-wide MR analysis was to assess the possible side effects of these drug targets. Finally, the reliability of GSTM4 in BCa was confirmed via colony formation assay.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between interstitial lung disease (ILD) and lung cancer in nonsmokers (LCINS) has garnered increasing interest. However, the causal associations and underlying pathogenesis between ILD and LCINS remain poorly understood. This research utilized a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) method, utilizing forward MR analysis to assess the causal impact of ILD on LCINS and reverse MR analysis to evaluate the causal effect of LCINS on ILD. Additionally, transcriptome data and bioinformatics analyses were used to explore the associations between ILD and LCINS. An ILD-related gene signature (ILD risk score) was identified to examine its influence on the hallmark signaling pathways and the immune microenvironment in LCINS. The study revealed a significant causal relationship between ILD and LCINS, with ILD increasing the risk of lung cancer in nonsmoking European populations. We developed a 5-gene risk model, which includes CD1A, CDH3, KRT6B, MMP1, and MMP10, via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The ILD risk score independently influences the prognosis of nonsmoking patients with lung cancer, and these five genes are also significantly associated with overall survival (OS) rates. Patients in the high-ILD risk subgroup exhibited significantly poorer survival rates. A highly accurate nomogram was developed to increase the clinical applicability of the ILD risk score. Additionally, the ILD risk scores were significantly correlated with hallmark signaling pathways and immune cell infiltration. This study suggested that ILD may have a positive causal effect on LCINS, with the ILD risk score serving as an effective predictor of the prognoses in LCINS patients. It is associated with tumor proliferation and the activation of metabolism-related signaling pathways. These findings also indicate that ILD may contribute to the occurrence and progression of LCINS through its influence on immune cell infiltration.",

    "abstract": "β-Sitosterol (BS), is a significant bioactive component of phytosterols found in plants, foods, and dietary supplements. Its nutritional benefits include lowering of cholesterol levels, boost immune system as well as reduce inflammation. Previous studies have demonstrated its significant anticancer effects across various human cancers. However, the specific mechanisms of action of BS in lung cancer remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms through which BS exerts its anticancer properties in human lung cancer cells, focusing on its anti-proliferative, apoptotic, cytotoxic, and anti-migratory effects. We conducted an in vitro study to assess the effects of BS on lung cancer cell lines A549 and H1975. We used a range of assays, including MTT, western blot, wound healing, transwell migration, immunofluorescence, TUNEL, and cell survival assays, to evaluate the impact of BS on cell proliferation, apoptosis, cytotoxicity, and migration. Our findings indicate that BS inhibits the proliferation of lung cancer cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. It significantly promotes apoptosis and impairs both cancer cell migration and survival. Additionally, BS suppresses the expression of both fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) and epidermal growth factor (EGFR), leading to the downregulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/CD1 signaling pathway. BS demonstrates significant anticancer potential in lung cancer cells by inhibiting proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and reducing cell migration. These effects are likely mediated by the concurrent downregulation of FGFR1 and EGFR, leading to the inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/CD1 signaling pathway, thereby warranting further investigation of BS as a potential therapeutic agent for lung cancer.",

Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) plays a pro-tumorigenic role in solid tumors and chronic myeloid leukemia by promoting initiation, invasion, metastasis and drug resistance, and has gained increasing attentions as a therapeutic target. However, ALL cells show a low expression status of LCN2. Meanwhile, the clinical significance and biological role of LCN2 remain unclear in childhood ALL. Therefore, we collected bone marrow, peripheral blood, and cerebrospinal fluid samples from children with ALL and control individuals to assess LCN2 expression. Lentiviral transduction was used to establish stable LCN2 overexpression in Nalm6, CEM-C1, CEM-C7, and Molt4 cell lines. The cell growth, proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, ferroptosis, and sensitivity to dexamethasone were detected to clarify the function of LCN2. Compared with healthy individuals, non-tumor patients and intracranial solid tumors, LCN2 expression was down-regulated in patients with childhood ALL at diagnosis. Lower LCN2 expression in the bone marrow was associated with poor prognostic features and a lower disease relapse-free rate. Effective chemotherapy could restore the expression of LCN2. Overexpression of LCN2 led to an inhibition of cell growth and an induction of ferroptosis in GC sensitive ALL cells (Nalm6 and CEM-C7), and reversed GC resistance by up-regulating the expression of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and phosphorylated-GR (p-GR) and inhibiting the Notch signaling pathway. On the contrary to solid tumors, our results suggest that inducing the expression of LCN2 might be a novel therapeutic protocol in childhood ALL.",

In this study, we demonstrate that elevated expression of GTSF1 is significantly correlated with reduced disease-free survival (DFS) in UCS patients and promotes enhanced invasive, migratory, and stem-like phenotypes in tumor cells. Mechanistically, we show that GTSF1 drives tumor progression via activation of CCL1, which induces chemotaxis of M1 macrophages toward malignant cells and subsequent IL-6 secretion, thereby amplifying cancer stemness. Multiplex immunohistochemical analysis revealed spatial co-localization and positive correlations among GTSF1, CCL1, and M1 macrophage infiltration in UCS tissue specimens. In vitro co-culture experiments further confirmed that GTSF1-mediated CCL1 expression promotes M1 macrophage recruitment and IL-6 production, shaping an immune-permissive microenvironment that supports metastatic progression and maintenance of tumor stemness. This comprehensive investigation highlights actionable therapeutic targets within both tumor cells and their immune niche, offering translational insights for the development of multimodal treatment strategies against this aggressive malignancy.",

Patients were randomly divided into training (n=257) and validation (n=110) sets at a 7:3 ratio. Logistic regression was used to identify independent risk factors, and a Nomogram was built to predict progression risk. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Compared with the non-progression group, patients in the progression group had significantly higher rates of perineural invasion (P=0.011), Gleason score ≥8 (P=0.002), and T4 stage (P=0.012). Laboratory markers including ALP (P<0.001) and LDH (P<0.001) were also elevated in the progression group.

The Nomogram demonstrated strong discrimination power (AUC=0.845 in the training set; AUC=0.746 in external validation), with LDH being the most influential predictor. DCA indicated a net clinical benefit up to 77.82%. Perineural invasion, Gleason score ≥8, and elevated ALP and LDH are closely associated with progression from HBTB-PCa to CRPC. The constructed Nomogram (internal AUC=0.845; external AUC=0.746) offers a practical tool for individualized risk assessment and guiding treatment planning in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that virginal microbiota dysbiosis is a distinct feature of cervical cancer. As cervical lesions progress towards malignancy, the dominance of Lactobacillus species within the vaginal microbiota is progressively replaced by anaerobic bacteria, with Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (P. anaerobius) being a noticeable one. Despite this well-documented microbial shift, the precise functional role of P. anaerobius in cervical cancer development and progression has remained unclear. Our study demonstrated that P. anaerobius promoted cervical cancer cells proliferation and enhanced tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, we identified a significant upregulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD) following the introduction of P. anaerobius, leading to subsequent activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Moreover, supplement with P. anaerobius failed to reverse the ERK1/2 inhibitor-induced suppression of the tube-formation. In vivo validation revealed that P. anaerobius exerted its influence on angiogenesis by regulating SCD expression and ERK pathway acvivation. Collectively, these findings reveal an oncogenic role of P. anaerobius in cervical cancer, mediated by the SCD-ERK signaling axis to drive angiogenesis.

Dabrafenib was administered orally at 150 mg twice daily, alongside trametinib at 2 mg once daily. Response was determined using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. A total of 71 PTC patients who received systemic therapy were identified, including 21 patients who experienced dabrafenib plus trametinib. For these 21 patients, the objective response rate (ORR) was 66.7%, with a disease control rate (DCR) of 85.7%. In the first-line setting, the ORR and DCR were higher at 75.0% and 91.7%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 40.7 months, and the overall survival (OS) was 47.7 months. While patients treated in the first-line setting (n=12) showed better PFS (40.7 months vs. 18.9 months) and OS (47.7 months vs. 39.4 months) compared to those treated in the second-line setting (n=9), the differences were not statistically significant.

Co-culture experiments with macrophages and lung cancer cells were performed to evaluate the influence of RNF200 on radiotherapy sensitivity. In NSCLC tissues and macrophages, radiotherapy was found to downregulate RNF200 expression while upregulating PD-L1 expression. Overexpression of RNF200 led to marked suppression of PD-L1 expression, whereas RNF200 knockdown produced the opposite effect. Co-immunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays revealed that RNF200 physically interacted with PD-L1 and promoted its polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Furthermore, co-culture studies demonstrated that macrophages overexpressing RNF200 enhanced the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to radiotherapy, as evidenced by reduced proliferation, increased necrosis, and decreased secretion of transforming growth factor beta TGF-β. Collectively, these findings indicate that RNF200 enhances radiotherapy sensitivity in lung cancer by regulating PD-L1 expression through ubiquitination. Targeting RNF200 may represent a promising strategy to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy in lung cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "To investigate the surgical outcomes and prognostic factors of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) combined with interval debulking surgery (IDS) in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical data of 97 patients with advanced ovarian cancer admitted to Xijing Hospital of The Fourth Military Medical University from January 2018 to December 2019. The patients were divided into two groups based on their treatment methods: a control group (primary debulking surgery (PDS), n=48) and an observation group (NACT combined with IDS, n=49). Short-term efficacy, perioperative outcomes, tumor markers, immune function, quality of life, adverse reactions, and survival status were compared between the two groups. Factors affecting prognosis were analyzed, a Nomogram prediction model was constructed and validated. The observation group demonstrated superior short-term efficacy than the control group, with lower intraoperative blood loss, shorter hospitalization duration, and reduced transfusion volume (P<0.05). After treatment, tumor marker levels, immune function, and quality of life improved significantly in both groups compared to pre-treatment levels, with more pronounced improvements in the observation group (P<0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions such as liver injury, kidney injury, nausea and vomiting, and myelosuppression was lower in the observation group than in the control group (P<0.05). Additionally, no significant difference in 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was observed between the two groups (P>0.05). Univariate and multivariate regression analyses identified age ≥50 years, tumor size >10 cm, low differentiation, PDS, and presence of residual lesions as independent prognostic factors. The Nomogram prediction model achieved an AUC of 0.955 (95% CI: 0.917-0.993), with calibration curves closely aligning with the ideal line, indicating high predictive accuracy and reliability. NACT combined with IDS demonstrated superior short-term efficacy compared to traditional PDS in patients with advanced ovarian cancer, with improved perioperative conditions, reduced adverse reactions, and enhanced survival rates. Age, tumor size, histological differentiation, and treatment modality independently affect patient prognosis. The Nomogram prediction model developed in this study demonstrates excellent discriminative power and clinical applicability for prognostic evaluation.",

A total of 120 patients were included, with an overall BRAF mutation frequency of 0.9%. Among the mutations detected, the Val600Glu (V600E) substitution constituted 54.2% of cases. Clinical characteristics were compared between V600E and non-V600E subgroups, and treatment efficacies were analyzed. Ninety-five patients received first-line treatment.

There is an urgent need for innovative treatment strategies. CAR-T therapy has shown revolutionary potential in the treatment of DLBCL, but its efficacy is limited by immune suppression and metabolic competition mediated by the tumor microenvironment (TME). Immunosuppressive cells and cytokines in the TME lead to the exhaustion of CAR-T cell functions, while metabolic competition puts CAR-T cells at a disadvantage in the uptake of key metabolites, limiting their proliferation and effector functions. Metabolic reprogramming, as a core mechanism of TME regulation, connects the functions of tumor cells and immune cells and is a key hub for enhancing the efficacy of CAR-T therapy. Among them, low glucose levels in the TME can activate the glycolytic pathway of CAR-T cells, but also lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced cytotoxicity. Targeting the metabolic remodeling of the TME, in combination with metabolic regulatory drugs and CAR-T synergy strategies, as well as the development and translation of drugs, is expected to significantly enhance the efficacy of CAR-T therapy in the treatment of DLBCL, bringing new hope to patients. Future research should further explore the specific mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming, optimize the design and application of metabolic regulatory drugs, and accelerate the clinical translation of drugs to achieve the maximum potential of CAR-T therapy in the treatment of DLBCL.",

This retrospective analysis included 597 DTC patients admitted between March 2019 and January 2025 (training set: n=353; validation set: n=133: external validation set: n=111). Patient features (age, sex, body mass index, diabetes history, etc.), surgical factors (thyroidectomy extent, lymph node dissection, etc.), pathological characteristics (capsular invasion, Tumor, Node, Metastasis [TNM] staging, etc.), and postoperative biochemical indicators (intact parathyroid hormone [iPTH] and blood calcium) were collected. Independent risk factors were screened by univariate and multivariate logistic regression. A Nomogram was constructed based on these factors, and its predictive performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA), with comparisons made to postoperative iPTH-based predictions. Multivariate logistic regression identified the following as independent predictors of hypocalcemia: diabetes history (OR=3.132, P=0.006), bilateral thyroidectomy (OR=2.142, P=0.023), lateral compartment lymph node dissection (OR=2.011, P=0.037), capsular invasion (OR=3.196, P<0.001), surgical time (OR=10.843, P<0.001), and intraoperative bleeding (OR=7.493, P<0.001). The Nomogram model exhibited excellent discriminatory ability across the training (AUC=0.888), validation (AUC=0.866), and external validation sets (AUC=0.913).

Diabetes history, bilateral thyroidectomy, lateral lymph node dissection, capsular invasion, prolonged surgical time (≥82.5 min), and increased intraoperative bleeding (≥25.5 mL) are significant risk factors for postoperative hypocalcemia in DTC patients. The Nomogram model, integrating these factors, outperforms iPTH-based predictions and offers a precise tool for preoperative risk assessment and postoperative management to reduce hypocalcemia and improve patient outcomes.",

Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the independent and combined effects of PCOS and MetS on EC risk.

The diagnostic performance of our comprehensive model was compared to traditional tumor markers (cancer antigen 125/199, human epididymis protein 4). LASSO regression identified 14 clinically significant predictors. Logistic regression revealed that HE4 levels, endometrial thickness, and fasting blood glucose were independent risk factors for EC, while high-density lipoprotein was an independent protective factor. The nomogram based on these variables demonstrated excellent discrimination, with AUCs of 0.984 in the training set, 0.987 in the internal validation set, and 0.964 in the external validation set.

However, immune evasion mechanisms can limit the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of PD-1/PD-L1 expression is therefore critical to enhancing immunotherapeutic outcomes. A previous study demonstrated that the adenosine A1 receptor (Adora1) regulates PD-L1 expression and tumor immune evasion in human melanoma; however, its role in colon cancer and associated immune escape remains poorly defined. To investigate this, we downregulated Adora1 expression in CT26 colon cancer cells using lentiviral transduction of Adora1-targeting shRNA. We assessed Adora1 and PD-L1 expression levels and evaluated cell proliferation in CT26 cells. In vivo, we inoculated CT26 cells into mice and monitored tumor growth, immune cell phenotypes, and T cell exhaustion within the tumors. Additionally, we evaluated T cell exhaustion in vitro by co-culturing T cells with CT26 cells. While Adora1 knockdown did not impact CT26 cell viability or proliferation in vitro, it significantly suppressed tumor growth in vivo (P<0.0001). Furthermore, Adora1 downregulation reduced T cell exhaustion (all P=0.0025) by decreasing PD-L1 expression in CT26 cells. Knockdown of Adora1 did not alter Atf3 expression but led to reduced Irf1 expression (P=0.0268), which contributed to the downregulation of PD-L1. Overall, these findings suggest that Adora1 downregulation inhibits immune escape in colon cancer by suppressing PD-L1 expression.",

    "abstract": "In Asian populations, early-stage ovarian cancers account for approximately half of cases, substantially exceeding proportions observed in Western cohorts, with clear cell carcinoma (CCC) and endometrioid carcinoma (EMC) demonstrating markedly higher prevalence in Asian women. The tumor immune microenvironment critically influences oncological progression, and systemic inflammatory biomarkers can serve as surrogates of host immunological responses. This study evaluated the prognostic value of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), an established index of systemic inflammation and immune dysregulation, across histologic subtypes in early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer. We retrospectively analyzed patients with FIGO stage I-II epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosed between 2011 and 2018. Pretreatment NLR was calculated to reflect the balance between neutrophil-driven inflammation and lymphocyte-mediated immunity. Among 217 enrolled patients, CCC (28.1%) and EMC (34.6%) constituted the predominant histotypes, consistent with Asian demographic patterns. In univariable analyses, elevated NLR and advanced stage significantly correlated with diminished progression-free survival (HR 5.04, P<0.001; HR 3.81, P<0.001) and overall survival (HR 4.54, P=0.013; HR 3.91, P=0.003). In multivariable models, NLR remained an independent prognostic factor for both endpoints (PFS: HR 5.38, P=0.001; OS: HR 4.27, P=0.048). Histology-stratified analyses revealed distinctive immunological signatures, with elevated NLR in CCC patients exhibiting exceptionally strong prognostic value (univariable PFS: HR 8.14, P=0.001; OS: HR 22.42, P=0.005; multivariable PFS: HR 8.00, P=0.007; OS: HR 32.43, P=0.025), providing information beyond FIGO stage. Conversely, NLR demonstrated no prognostic relevance in EMC patients, indicating heterogeneous immune microenvironments across histological variants. Elevated pre-treatment NLR independently predicts adverse outcomes in early-stage epithelial ovarian cancer, with particularly pronounced prognostic utility in CCC. These findings may be especially relevant in Asian populations, in which CCC is more common, and could inform personalized risk stratification.",

    "abstract": "The aggressive nature of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is profoundly shaped by a complex interplay between malignant cells and the host immune system. A key feature of this interplay is the formation of cell-in-cell (CIC) structures, which facilitate immune evasion and contribute to shaping the tumor microenvironment. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), including MIR31HG, have emerged as crucial modulators of tumor immunity and metastasis. In this study, we investigated the role of MIR31HG in orchestrating heterotypic CIC formation and assessed its impact on tumor growth, immune surveillance, and chemoresistance in HNSCC. Analysis of TCGA and GTEx datasets confirmed the differential expression of CIC-related genes between HNSCC and normal tissues. Functional assays demonstrated that CIC structure formation substantially augmented the malignant properties of Cal27 cells, including increased resistance to both cisplatin and gemcitabine. Critically, genetic depletion of MIR31HG in CIC-positive cells (CIC+ sh-MIR31HG) potently suppressed tumor progression, as evidenced by reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, silencing MIR31HG also remodeled the immunosuppressive landscape; it downregulated the expression of immune checkpoint protein PD-L1 and decreased the secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines TGF-β and IL-10. This intervention also reversed therapeutic resistance, rendering CIC+ sh-MIR31HG cells more susceptible to cisplatin- and gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. These findings were validated in a murine xenograft model, where histological analyses confirmed that tumors originating from CIC+ sh-MIR31HG cells displayed reduced volume and elevated apoptotic activity. Collectively, MIR31HG is a pivotal regulator of heterotypic CIC formation in HNSCC. This mechanism promotes HNSCC cell survival, fosters an immunosuppressive microenvironment, and drives chemoresistance. Therefore, targeting MIR31HG represents a viable therapeutic avenue to disrupt immune resistance and enhance chemosensitivity in HNSCC.",

Natural compounds derived from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), such as quercetin and curcumin, exert multi-targeted anti-tumor effects by modulating ferroptosis, EMT, angiogenesis, and the immune microenvironment. This review synthesizes evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies supporting the role of TCM monomers in co-regulating ferroptosis and immune surveillance in GC. Furthermore, it proposes a dual-target approach against EMT and angiogenesis to advance the theoretical framework and promote the clinical application of TCM in precision oncology, thereby guiding the development of novel, low-toxicity, and high-efficacy anti-cancer agents.",

    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is a prevalent pediatric malignancy, yet the role of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in NB progression remains unclear. MSCs are known to secrete various cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-6, and their influence on NB cells and tumor xenografts were investigated in this study. Placenta-derived mesenchymal stem cells (PMSCs) were isolated from chorionic villi and characterized via flow cytometry. The obtained PMSCs were co-cultured with NB cells or IL-6-silenced PMSCs. Comprehensive assays were conducted to assess proliferation, colony formation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). RNA-seq identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in NB cells, predominantly enriched in Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways (P < 0.05). qRT-PCR revealed elevated levels of IL-6 and other oncogenic cytokines in PMSCs (P < 0.05). In vivo, IL-6 knockdown in PMSCs significantly suppressed NB xenograft growth, accompanied by reduced expression of Ki-67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Caspase 9, and Snail as shown by immunohistochemistry (P < 0.05). Western blotting confirmed activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT) pathway in NB cells after co-culture with PMSCs, which was attenuated by PI3K inhibition. Notably, IL-6 knockdown markedly suppressed NB xenograft progression and downregulated associated signaling markers (P < 0.05). Collectively, PMSC-derived IL-6 potentiates NB progression via PI3K-AKT signaling, presenting a potential therapeutic target in neuroblastoma.",

This retrospective study included 260 patients undergoing thoracoscopic lung cancer surgery. Patients were divided into two groups based on anesthesia methods: the liposomal bupivacaine group (n = 134) and the ropivacaine group (n = 126). Both groups received general anesthesia followed by ESPB. Perioperative inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-α, CRP), immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM), and analgesic outcomes (Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) scores) were measured at various postoperative time points. Cellular inflammatory markers, including white blood cell (WBC) counts and neutrophil percentages, were also assessed. Tumor markers (galectin-3 (Gal-3), carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125), cytokeratin 21-1 fragment (CY-FRA21-1), soluble programmed death ligand-1 (sPD-L1)) were analyzed at 3-month follow-up. The liposomal bupivacaine group exhibited significantly reduced inflammatory responses with lower levels of IL-6 (P = 0.005), TNF-α (P = 0.007), and CRP (P = 0.01) at 12-72 hours postoperatively. Immunoglobulin levels were better preserved in this group (IgA P = 0.007, IgG P = 0.016, IgM P = 0.033). Analgesia outcomes were superior, with lower NRS scores at 36 h (P = 0.002) and 72 h (P = 0.006). Cellular inflammatory markers, including WBC counts and neutrophil percentages, were also significantly reduced (P < 0.05). At the 3-month follow-up, the liposomal bupivacaine group showed significantly lower levels of tumor markers, particularly sPD-L1 (all P < 0.001).

We performed non-targeted metabolomics analysis and analyzed the impact of Aurora-A inhibitor Alisertib on anti-PD-1 therapy efficacy on xenograft tumors and co-culture models of CD8+ T cells and HCC cells. We determined reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) production in HCC cells to evaluate lipid peroxidation. Confocal images of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria in HCC cells were taken to assess the role of Aurora-A and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp-1) on mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs) formation. The results showed that Aurora-A was upregulated in HCC cells and its knockdown significantly augmented phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) production while having no effect on phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD). Further, Aurora-A inhibitor Alisertib enhanced the sensibility of HCC cells to anti-PD-1 therapy and CD45+CD8+ T cell infiltration in HCC tumors. To conclude, our work revealed that Aurora-A dysregulated PS/PE metabolism via facilitating Drp1-Ser616 phosphorylation to disrupt MAMs formation, resulting in suppressed ferroptosis in HCC cells to reduce their sensitivity to anti-PD-1.",

The 5-FU molecule was chemically modified to bypass dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD)-mediated inactivation, enhancing drug retention and increasing lipophilicity for improved cellular uptake. The analog cytotoxic activity was evaluated in 2D monolayer cultures and 3D pancreatic cancer spheroids and organoid models derived from MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells to simulate a more complex tumor environment. In the 2D model, AGY1, AGY2, AGY3, AGY4, and AGY5 displayed significantly higher cytotoxicity than 5-FU, with AGY2 achieving up to six-fold higher potency in MiaPaCa-2 cells. In 3D spheroid models, both AGY1 and AGY2 showed dose-dependent reductions in spheroid size, with AGY2 causing the most pronounced shrinkage, suggesting effective disruption of the tumor architecture. In pancreatic organoids, AGY2 demonstrated substantial decreases in cell viability and structural proliferation, inhibiting cell migration and organoid budding that exceeded the effects of 5-FU. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis revealed that AGY2 induces significant cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase in MiaPaCa-2 cells and the S phase in PANC-1 cells. Apoptosis assays showed a higher percentage of apoptotic cells following AGY2 treatment compared to 5-FU, which was supported by Western blot analysis, indicating increased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins p53 and Bax and decreased levels of survival proteins epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2), and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Put together, our findings showed that AGY2 analog was the most effective anti-anticancer analog with significantly improved metabolic stability.",

    "abstract": "Perioperative strategies for resectable gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinomas are continuously evolving, with recent regimens, particularly those incorporating immunotherapy, showing promising results, although their comparative efficacy remains uncertain. We conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2004 and March 2025 that compared perioperative treatments involving chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted agents. Five outcomes were analyzed: overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), R0 resection, pathological complete response (pCR), and major pathological response (MPR). A Bayesian random-effects model was applied to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs), and surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) values were used for treatment ranking. A total of 25 RCTs involving 11,317 patients were included. Neo/Peri DOS/DOX, comprising neoadjuvant or perioperative docetaxel-oxaliplatin-S-1 (DOS) or docetaxel-oxaliplatin-capecitabine (DOX), ranked highest for OS and PFS, showing significant survival benefits over both surgery alone and adjuvant chemotherapy. Regimens combining perioperative chemotherapy with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (Neo/Peri CT+PD1/PDL1) achieved the greatest improvement in pCR and MPR, although their survival benefit was limited to comparisons with surgery alone. None of the regimens significantly improved R0 resection. The findings were robust across sensitivity analyses, with no major inconsistencies detected. In conclusion, DOS/DOX demonstrated superior survival outcomes and may represent a leading perioperative option, while PD-1/PD-L1-based combinations improved early pathological responses but require further validation with mature survival data.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxia plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various cancers, especially lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), by altering cancer metabolism to promote escape mechanisms. Anoikis, a specialized form of programmed cell death, is evaded by LUAD cells during tumor progression and metastasis through upregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins. Investigating the impact of hypoxia-anoikis-related genes on prognosis and therapy prediction in LUAD is essential. Gene expression and clinical data from 489 LUAD patients and 49 normal tissues in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset were used as the training set, while GSE72094, GSE31210, and GSE30219 datasets were used for validation. Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified genes associated with hypoxia and anoikis. Machine learning models were evaluated using the C-index. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, immune cell infiltration, tumor mutational burden (TMB), and sensitivity to therapy were assessed based on risk scores. A total of 21 hypoxia-anoikis-related prognostic genes were identified. The Random Survival Forest (RSF) model had the highest C-index. High-risk patients had significantly lower survival rates. Immune analysis showed higher immune infiltration in the low-risk group, with lower immune escape potential in these patients. Risk scores were correlated with sensitivity to targeted therapy and chemotherapy. MCF2 was identified as a key prognostic gene, and its knockdown inhibited LUAD cell proliferation and metastasis. These 21 genes offer insights into LUAD prognosis and therapy response, guiding personalized treatment strategies for LUAD patients.",

To date, inactivation of LKB1 tumor suppressor has rarely been reported in glioblastoma. In this study, we investigated LKB1 status, biological significance, and therapeutic implications in glioblastoma. Loss of LKB1 immunostaining was identified in 8.6% (5/58), while decrease of LKB1 immunostaining was found in 29.3% (17/58) of glioblastoma tissues. Notably, mining TCGA database of LKB1 expression in glioblastoma revealed that lower mRNA level of LKB1 was associated with shorter survival in glioblastoma. We found that knockdown of LKB1 significantly promoted in vitro proliferation, adhesion, invasion, and metformin-induced apoptosis, and simultaneously enhanced activation of ERK and mammalian-target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways in LKB1-compenent U87 and T98 glioblastoma cells. Moreover, global transcriptional profiling revealed that adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins such as Vinculin, Talin and signaling pathways including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), extracellular martrix (ECM) receptor interaction, and cellular motility were significantly enriched in U87 and T98 glioblastoma cells upon LKB1 knockdown. Additionally, we demonstrated that the enhanced activation of FAK by LKB1 knockdown was dependent on differentially expressed cytoskeletal proteins in these glioblastoma cells. Importantly, we further found that mTOR1 inhibitor rapamycin dominantly inhibited in vitro cellular proliferation, while FAK inhibitor PF-573288 drastically decreased invasion of LKB1-attenuated glioblastoma cells. Therefore, downregulation of LKB1 may contribute to the pathogenesis and malignancy of glioblastoma and may have potential implications for stratification and treatment of glioblastoma patients.",

We utilized 2 published NAC cohorts, 105 women with gene expression data before, Baseline, and that changed during NAC, Delta, and TCGA database with 1068 BC patients to investigate the relationship between the efficacy of NAC and survival utilizing differentially expressed-mRNAs, construction and analysis of the mRNA-hub gene network, and functional pathway analysis. In mRNA expression profiling, S100A8 was a gene involved in survival after pCR in Baseline and NDP was a gene involved in recurrence after pCR in Delta. In functional pathway analysis, we found multiple pathways involved in survival after pCR. In mRNA-hub gene analysis, HSP90AA1, EEF1A1, APP, and HSPA4 were related to recurrence in BC patients with pCR due to NAC. TP53, EGFR, CTNNB1, ERBB2, and HSPB1 may play a significant role in survival for patients with pCR. Interestingly, high HSP90AA1, HSPA4, S100A8, and TP53, and low EEF1A1, EGFR, and CTNNB1 expressing tumors have significantly worse overall survival in TCGA BC cohort. We demonstrated the genes and functional pathway features associated with pCR and survival utilizing the bioinformatics approach to public BC cohorts. Some genes involved in recurrence after pCR due to NAC also served as prognostic factors in primary BC.",

However, the prognostic value of mutational VAF across the genetic spectrum of MDS has not been extensively evaluated. In this study, we profiled the mutational spectrum of 382 newly diagnosed MDS patients using targeted next-generation sequencing. Exploratory analysis found that mutational VAF of some genes including TET2, TP53, and SF3B1 had significant associations with patient survival. Specifically, TET2 VAF ≥ 32% (HR 1.69, P = 0.025) and TP53 VAF ≥ 27% (HR 3.58, P < 0.001) were independently associated with shorter overall survival (OS). In contrast, SF3B1 VAF ≥ 15% had an independent association with better prognosis (HR 0.52, P = 0.048). In addition, high TET2 VAF was associated with an increased response to hypomethylating agents relative to low TET2 VAF (P = 0.009). Patients with high TP53 VAF more often possessed complex karyotypes than those with low VAF (P = 0.034). And patients with high SF3B1 VAF were more frequently classified as MDS with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS) category than those with low VAF (P = 0.012). Meanwhile, we found that for some other genes like EZH2 and NRAS, once their mutations appeared, it meant poor survival regardless of mutational VAF. These findings suggest that mutational VAF of certain genes should be considered into the routine prognostic prediction and risk stratification of MDS patients.",

However, due to their significant toxicity and often lack of efficacy, cytokines have given their spotlight to other cancer immunotherapeutics such as immune checkpoint inhibitors. Nevertheless, only a subset of cancer patients respond to checkpoint inhibitors. Therefore, developing a novel cytokine-based immunotherapy is still necessary. Among an array of cytokine candidates, IL-27 is a unique one that exhibits clear anti-tumor activity with low toxicity. Systemically delivered IL-27 by adeno-associated virus (AAV-IL-27) is very well tolerized by mice and exhibits potent anti-tumor activity in a variety of tumor models. AAV-IL-27 exerts its anti-tumor activity through directly stimulation of immune effector cells and systemic depletion of Tregs, and is particularly suitable for delivery in combination with checkpoint inhibitors or vaccines. Additionally, AAV-IL-27 can also be delivered locally to tumors to exert its unique actions. In this review, we summarize the evidence that support these points and propose AAV-delivered IL-27 as a potential immunotherapeutic for cancer.",

Histological analysis and flow cytometry were used to evaluate tumor progression and antitumor immunity after different routes of DC vaccination.

    "abstract": "Reprogramming of metabolism is one of the hallmarks of cancer, among which glucose metabolism dysfunction is the most prominent feature. The glucose metabolism of tumor cells is significantly different from that of normal cells. Glucose metabolism reprogramming of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has become an important research hotspot in the field of HCC, a variety of tumor metabolic interventions have been applied clinically. Moreover, various Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) including microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding (lncRNAs) as well as circular RNAs (circRNAs), have recently been proved to play potential roles in glucose metabolism. This review summarizes the effects of ncRNAs on HCC that participate in glucose metabolism and discuss the related mechanisms to find potential and effective targeted treatments for HCC.",

    "abstract": "In this study, in vitro cytotoxic effects of seven adamantyl isothiourea derivatives were evaluated against five human tumor cell lines using the MTT assay. Compounds 5 and 6 were found to be the most active derivatives particularly against hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To decipher the potential mechanisms involved, in vivo studies were conducted in rats by inducing HCC via chronic thioacetamide (TAA) administration (200 mg/kg, i.p., twice weekly) for 16 weeks. Compounds 5 and 6 were administered to HCC rats, at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day, for further 2 weeks. In vitro and in vivo antitumor activities of compounds 5 and 6 were compared to those of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOXO). In the HCC rat model, compounds 5 and 6 significantly reduced serum levels of ALT, AST with ALP and α-fetoprotein. H & E and Masson trichrome staining revealed that both compounds suppressed hepatocyte tumorigenesis and diminished fibrosis, inflammation and other histopathological alterations. Mechanistically, compounds 5 and 6 markedly decreased protein expression levels of α-SMA, sEH, p-NF-κB p65, TLR4, MyD88, TRAF-6, TNF-α, IL-1β and TGF-β1, whereas they increased caspase-3 expression in liver tissues of HCC rats. In most analyses, the effects of compound 6 were more comparable to DOXO than compound 5. These findings suggested that the compounds 5 and 6 displayed in vitro and in vivo cytotoxic potential against HCC, probably via inhibition of TLR4-MyD88-NF-κB signaling.",

    "abstract": "Due to the difficulties and long periods of establishment, preclinical animal models of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) are scarce but imperative. The researches involving molecular features and therapeutic targets of ACC require an integrated group of preclinical animal models which can credibly retain the heterogeneity of this tumor. Currently chemotherapies and targeting therapies have modest efficacy in ACC and the overall response rate is rather low. Therefore, novel therapeutic regimen of ACC is urgently needed and remains a major clinical challenge. We transplanted a group of tumor samples from human salivary ACC into immunodeficient mice to establish patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Patient tumors and their matched PDXs were conducted histological analyses, whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA-seq respectively. 13 PDXs were successfully established from 34 ACC, involved in 3 histological types, including cribriform, tubular, and solid. These ACC PDXs generally reflected the histopathological and molecular features of their corresponding original tumors. MYB/MYBL1-NFIB fusion (53.85%) and high-frequency mutation genes, such as KDM6A, KMT2C, KMT2D, NOTCH1, NOTCH2, SMARCA4 and PIK3CA were mainly conserved in PDXs. Guided by the genetic alterations, the efficiencies of retinoic acid (RA) and a PI3K inhibitor were evaluated in ACC PDX models harboring both MYB fusion and PIK3CA amplification/mutation. Combination treatment of the PI3K inhibitor and RA demonstrated remarkable inhibition of tumors in PDXs harboring both PIK3CA mutation/amplification and MYB-NFIB fusion gene in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we displayed the morphologically and genetic featured PDXs which recapitulated the heterogeneity of original ACC tumors, indicating that the models could be used as a platform for drug screening for therapy response. The feasibility of combination treatment approaches for dual targets were confirmed, providing new regimens for personalized therapies in ACC.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide, and is associated with a prior diagnosis of endometriosis in several cases. Our aim was to correlate genetic and methylation profile of ovarian endometrioid ovarian cancer and endometriosis patients. We evaluated the genetic profile of 50 ovarian endometriosis and 20 ovarian endometrioid carcinoma samples using next generation sequencing technology. In addition, the DNA methylation profile was evaluated for both cohorts of patients. We observed several mutated genes that were common for both types of patients, but we also identified mutated genes that were characteristic for each group: JAK3, KRAS and RB1 for endometriosis; and ATM, BRAF, CDH1, EGFR, NRAS, RET and SMO for ovarian endometrioid cancer. Also we idenfied genes that are highly methylated only in endometriosis samples (PYCARD, RARB, RB1, IL2, CFTR, CD44 and CDH13) and MLH3 gene was methylated only in endometrioid ovarian carcinoma samples. Also, BRCA1, CADM1, PAX6 and PAH genes are mainly methylated in endometrioid ovarian carcinoma patients. We identified a correlation for the cancer group between tumor stage, copy number aberrations and the presence of metastases; more specifically, the presence of BRCA1 pathogenic variants was correlated with tumor differentiation degree, TP53 variants and copy number aberrations. This study was able to demonstrate the presence of similar pathways being altered in both endometriosis and ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, which could mean that a diagnosis of endometriosis could be an early marker for cancer diagnosis. In addition, we showed that GATA2 hypomethylation, ATM hypermethylation, CREM hypomethylation, higher tumor differentiation degree or higher tumor stage is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with ovarian endometrioid carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the leading causes of deaths in men globally. This is a heterogeneous and complex disease that urgently warrants further insight into its pathology. Developed countries have thus far the highest PCa incidence rates, with comparatively low mortality rates. Even though PCa in the Asian population seems to have high incidence and mortality rates, the African countries are emerging as the focal center for this disease. It has also been reported that the Sub-Saharan (SSA) countries have both the highest incidence and mortality rates. To date, few studies have reported the link between PCa and African populations. Adequate evidence is still missing to fully comprehend this relationship. While it has been brought to attention that racial, geographical and socioeconomic status are contributing factors, men of African descent across the globe, irrespective of their geographical position have higher PCa incidence and mortality rates compared to their white counterparts. To date, hormone therapy is the mainstay treatment of PCa, while the dysregulation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a hallmark of PCa. One of the emerging problems with this therapeutic approach is resistance to antiandrogens, and that AR splice isoforms implicated in the progression of PCa lack the therapeutic ligand-binding domain (LBD) target. AR splice variants targeted therapy is emerging and in clinical trials. Leveraging PCa transcriptomics is key towards PCa precision medicine. The aim of this review is to outline the PCa epidemiology globally and in Africa, PCa associated risk factors, discuss AR signaling and PCa mechanisms, the role of dysregulated splicing in PCa as novel prognostic indicators and therapeutic targets.",

Here, miR-22 expression in the circulating T cells from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and healthy controls was analyzed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Diethylnitrosamine (DEN)/phenobarbital (PB)-mediated primary HCC and Hepa1-6 subcutaneous tumor mouse models were established and subjected to lenti-miR-22 injection. Mice immunoreconstituted with miR-22-overexpressing T cells were employed to investigate the antitumor effect of miR-22 in mice. Luciferase assay, immunofluorescent staining, in vitro Th17 cell differentiation assay, and rescue experiments were employed to investigate the mechanism underlying the miR-22-mediated regulation of Th17 cell differentiation and liver tumor growth. Results confirmed the dramatic downregulation of miR-22 expression in malignant tissues and circulating T cells from patients with HCC. MiR-22 expression correlated with good prognosis of patients. Overexpression of miR-22 impaired the DEN/PB-induced primary HCC formation and the growth of Hepa1-6 subcutaneous tumors by promoting Th17 differentiation. Injection of miR-22-overexpressing T cells in irradiated mice resulted in the inhibition of Hepa1-6 subcutaneous tumor growth via Th17 differentiation promotion. MiR-22 could directly bind to Jarid2, which played an important role during the miR-22-mediated regulation of Th17 differentiation. Taken together, our study expands the understanding of miR-22 function and provides a therapy target for HCC.",

Previous studies have shown that Reticulocalbin-2 (RCN2) was a crucial factor for HCC proliferation, but invasion and migration mechanism of RCN2 contributing to HCC is poorly investigated. In this study, we estimated the RCN2 expression in both patient tissues and cell lines by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blotting (WB), as well as the clinical information of HCC patients from public databases. Biological function induced by RCN2 in vitro and vivo was also researched through multiple functional experiments. Upstream and downstream signal of RCN2 was identified by bioinformatics. We found that up-regulated RCN2 was related to poorer prognosis in HCC patients and attached significance to HCC proliferation, invasion and migration. Luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation validated that YY1 as the upstream transcription factor of RCN2, facilitating the expression of RCN2. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated that HCC progression induced by RCN2 might be related to MYC signaling. Furthermore, we demonstrated RCN2 reduced proteasomal degradation of MYC and lead to HCC progression. The effects of overexpressed RCN2 in HCC were attenuated by MYC silencing. In conclusion, our study highlighted the vital role of RCN2 in tumor progression and the potential benefit for the treatment of HCC.",

In recent ten years, with the emergence of new drugs and the optimization of treatment mode, the treatment of lung cancer is entering an era of precision and individualization. Neoadjuvant therapy can reduce tumor size, degrade tumor stage, kill circulating tumor cells and micrometastases in the body, afford operation possibility, and benefit the long-term survival of patients. However, the traditional neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with surgical treatment seems to have entered the bottleneck period of efficacy and is difficult to achieve breakthrough progress. At the same time, the amazing efficacy of immunotherapy is gradually innovating the treatment mode of lung cancer. In recent years, the research data of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) shows an explosive growth. Immunotherapy has been applied to the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC. Therefore, some clinical trials have applied immunotherapy to neoadjuvant treatment of resectable NSCLC patients. In this paper, the efficacy, possible mechanisms, potential risks and existing problems of neoadjuvant immunotherapy for resectable NSCLC patients are reviewed, and the future development direction of neoadjuvant immunotherapy is discussed.",

High-risk HPV cancers, including cervical cancer, are driven by major HPV oncogene, E6 and E7, which promote uncontrolled cell growth and genomic instability. We have previously shown that the presence of HPV E7 sensitizes cells to inhibition of aurora kinases (AURKs), which regulates the control of cell entry into and through mitosis. Such treatment is highly effective at eliminating early tumors and reducing large, late tumors. In addition, the presence of HPV oncogenes also sensitizes cells to inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), a family of enzymes involved in cellular functions such as cell growth and proliferation. Using MLN8237 (Alisertib), an oral, selective inhibitor of AURKs, we investigated whether Alisertib treatment can improve tumor response when combined with either radiotherapy (RT) treatment or with a PI3K inhibitor, BYL719 (Alpelisib). Indeed, both RT and Alpelisib significantly improved Alisertib-mediated tumor killing, and the promising achieved results warrant further development of these combinations, and potentially translating them to the clinics.",

To know that, we included 13,084 patients from the SEER database and 476 patients in T1 stage from our hospital to analyze difference of LNM and prognosis. Univariate and multivariate logistic analyses revealed that early-onset CRC was more likely than late-onset CRC to be positive for LNM. In addition, we found that T1b stage, poor differentiation and lymphatic invasion were risk factors for LNM. Specifically, we found that black race was a risk factor. Before propensity-score matching (PSM), we also found that early-onset CRC patients had better survival, as demonstrated by SEER data. After adjusting for confounding factors by PSM, we found that early onset remained a risk factor for LNM. Moreover, we found that patients diagnosed with early-onset CRC had a poorer prognosis than those diagnosed with late-onset CRC, which was demonstrated by analysis of SEER data and our own data. In conclusion, our study was the first to find that early-onset T1 stage CRC more frequently developed LNM, suggesting that endoscopic submucosal resection should be performed more carefully in these patients. Moreover, early-onset patients in the T1 stage also had poorer survival, suggesting that clinical doctors should pay more attention to early-onset patients.",

Tumor-specific pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) is essential for cancer metabolism and tumorigenesis. Shikonin, a specific inhibitor of PKM2, but not PKM1, exhibits significant anticancer effect in HCC, and was deemed as a promising drug for cancer therapy. However, shikonin-mediated bypass signaling in HCC remained unclear. Here, we performed forward/reverse stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based proteomics to identify the early molecular events controlled by shikonin. We demonstrated for the first time that shikonin could induce the nuclear translocation of PKM2 for recruiting Nrf2, and transcriptionally activated Nrf2 downstream target gene BAG3, therefore increasing protective effect to sustain cell survival. Knockdown of BAG3 by si-RNA significantly potentiated the anticancer effect of shikonin. These findings provided the first evidence of a new noncanonical function of inhibited PKM2 could act as a transcriptional coactivator of Nrf2 in cancer survival, highlight that shikonin in combined with BAG3 inhibitor could be a promising therapeutic strategy for HCC therapy.",

ER inhibitors through modulating the transcriptional function of ER have been the frontline anti-estrogens to which refractory phenotype often developed in advanced cancer. The anti-estrogen fulvestrant is currently the only clinically approved pure anti-estrogen which causes ER degradation. However, resistance to fulvestrant still occurs and unfortunately it leaves few choices other than chemotherapy as the later-line treatments to fulvestrant-resistant tumors. Here we show that fulvestrant resistance was accompanied by increased expression of a number of innate immune response genes including the natural killer (NK) cell ligand B7-H6 on the cell surface. In an attempt to overcome the drug resistance phenotype, a NK-based molecular approach taking advantage of a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) system targeting B7-H6 was established and tested in cells with acquired resistance to fulvestrant. The results demonstrate that the cell therapy approach as a single agent can effectively induce cell death of the resistant cancer cells which is enhanced by the increased expression of cell surface B7-H6. This approach departs from the traditional strategies of conquering anti-estrogen resistant breast cancer and offers a new avenue to eradicate hormone-refractory malignant solid tumors.",

The limited options especially toward HCC with metastasis prompts us to identify novel molecules for either diagnostic/prognostic or therapeutic purposes. GRPEL2 is well defined in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, which is critical to multiple biological processes for cancer survival. However, its role in HCC progression was not investigated before. In our analysis using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA LIHC) dataset and tissue microarray, higher expression levels of GRPEL2 were obseved in HCC tissues compared to in normal liver tissues, and indicated higher tumor grade, higher tumor stage, and shorter overall survival (OS). Consistent with the results of above analyses, the functional experiments validated that GRPEL2 acted as a tumor-promoting factor in HCC progression. GRPEL2 knockdown suppressed cell growth, migration, and invasion in vitro, as well as inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, GRPEL2 deficiency also accelerated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and increased mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), leading to cell apoptosis. In addition, we found that the cell cycle and NF-κB signaling pathways were responsible for GRPEL2-induced HCC progression, based on the results of Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and subsequent experimental validation. Our study, for the first time, identified the role of GRPEL2 in HCC development and provided a compelling biomarker for targted therapy in HCC treatment.",

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) contain lower amounts of VA and express lower levels of retinoic acid receptors (RARs) compared to normal human pancreatic tissues. Our goal was to determine if VA signaling directly impacts molecular events underlying pancreatic carcinogenesis using cell-type specific genetic approaches in mice. We knocked out retinoic acid receptor beta (RAR-β) selectively in pancreatic cells by tamoxifen treatment after crossing these adult RAR-βfl/fl mice with Pdx1/CreER (PCer) and lox-stop-lox KRasG12D transgenic mice. Our data show that the rounds of tamoxifen we used were able to induce the knockout of the RAR-β gene in pancreatic cells in this PCer;KRas;RAR-βfl/fl transgenic model. We detected increases in proteins involved in RA metabolism (CYP26A1, RBP1, and ALDH1A2) in the PCer;RAR-βD/wt pancreata, but the levels of RBP1 and ALDH1A2 were decreased in PCer;RAR-βD (both RAR-β alleles deleted) compared to PCer;KRas;RAR-βD and wild-type pancreata. Ki67 and vimentin proteins exhibited lower levels in the PCer;KRas;RAR-βD and PCer;RAR-βD pancreata compared to wild-type, indicating that deletion of RAR-β reduced cell proliferation in acinar cells. Expression of SOX9, a key protein required for formation and maintenance of PDAC, was higher in PCer;RAR-βD/wt and PCer;RAR-βD pancreata compared to wild-type, indicating that deletion of RAR-β increases SOX9 levels even without the KRas activating mutation. In summary, lack of RAR-β in pancreatic acinar cells reduced cell proliferation and increased SOX9 protein levels in this transgenic model.",

Conventional treatments, such as enucleation and radiotherapy, have limitations in fully addressing prognosis. This study aimed to establish and validate an early-warning prognostic model for RB based on the XGBoost algorithm to improve the prediction accuracy of the 5-year survival rate in children. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 320 children with RB treated at Changzhi People's Hospital between February 2012 and April 2019. The patients were randomly divided into a training group (n=224) and a validation group (n=96). Clinical data, including age, gender, tumor characteristics, and tumor marker levels, were collected. Prognostic factors were analyzed using XGBoost and Cox regression models, and model performance was evaluated using various statistical methods. No significant differences were observed in baseline data between the two sets (P>0.05). Cox regression analysis identified tumor diameter (P=0.032), IIRC stage (P<0.001), and NSE (P=0.016) as independent prognostic factors. The XGBoost model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.951 in the training group, significantly higher than the Cox model (P=0.001), while in the validation group, the XGBoost model's AUC was 0.902, with no significant difference compared to the Cox model (P=0.117). The XGBoost model demonstrated high accuracy and clinical utility in predicting the 5-year survival of children with RB. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and calibration curves further confirmed that the XGBoost model offers higher clinical net benefits and superior calibration ability across various thresholds.",

    "abstract": "Capicua transcriptional repressor (CIC)-rearranged sarcoma, also known as CIC-rearranged sarcoma (CRS), is a recently recognized sarcoma subtype characterized by specific molecular features. It is associated with aggressive clinical course and a poor prognosis. Here, we present a rare case of CRS, including a detailed clinical, pathological, and molecular analysis, to enhance understanding of this disease and provide a reference for future diagnosis and treatment. A 15-year-old female adolescent initially presented with a rapidly growing mass in her left buttock, accompanied by intermittent pain. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a 12.7 × 8.6 × 11.9 cm mixed-intensity mass, suggesting a mesenchymal sarcoma. After histological and immunohistochemical analysis, a preliminary diagnosis of malignant small round cell tumor was made, which was later confirmed as CRS by Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). A course of VDC/IE regimen was administered as first-line neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, a follow-up MRI showed a 28% increase in tumor volume. Given the poor response to chemotherapy, we decided to perform a wide resection surgery. Unfortunately, lung metastases developed only one month postoperatively, and local recurrence occurred two months postoperatively. The patient then underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy. At the time of data cutoff, the patient achieved a stable disease state and retained satisfactory walking function. In conclusion, treatment paradigms for CRS have yet to be defined. For patients with large tumor volumes, preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy may be ineffective and could potentially delay more effective treatment. Early surgical resection is probably a more suitable treatment option. Multidisciplinary collaboration is essential in the treatment of CRS, and large studies exploring novel therapeutic options are urgently needed to bring hope to patients with this aggressive disease.",

The results demonstrated that the constructed immunomagnetic spheres could effectively capture CTCs and that the constructed lipid nanoparticles exhibited high capture efficiency and low cytotoxicity. The results of the concordance or complementarity analyses of PD-L1 expression at the CTC and tissue levels indicated good concordance between the two at up to 70%. The analysis of PD-L1 expression and the changes in CTCs in PD-L1-positive cells plays an auxiliary role in clinical diagnosis and can be used as a dynamic detection index for the course of head, neck, and throat tumor treatment and as a predictor of recurrence risk.",

Novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to improve outcomes for patients with advanced or metastatic disease. Triptolide (TL), a key component of the Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii, has shown potent anticancer effects in various malignancies. In this study, we investigated the anticancer effects of TL on cervical cancer cells in vitro and in vivo, focusing on its ability to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). TL exhibited potent cytotoxicity, inhibited proliferation, induced apoptosis, and suppressed tumor growth in cervical cancer models. Mechanistically, TL induced ICD in cervical cancer cells, as evidenced by the calreticulin (CRT) exposure on the cell surface and the release of HMGB1 and ATP. TL-induced CRT exposure was mediated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as demonstrated by the upregulation of ATF3 and the activation of oxidative stress and immune pathways. Oral administration of TL significantly inhibited tumor growth in a cervical cancer xenograft model, without overt toxicities. These findings highlight the potential of TL as a novel immunotherapeutic agent for cervical cancer and warrant further investigation into its clinical translation. The combination of TL with immune checkpoint inhibitors or other immunotherapies may provide a promising strategy to enhance the efficacy of cervical cancer treatment while minimizing adverse effects.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a common, yet often overlooked, complication in thyroid cancer patients, potentially influenced by various demographic, clinical, biochemical, and psychological factors. This study aims to analyze the prevalence and determinants of cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) in thyroid cancer patients. A retrospective case-control study was conducted involving 246 thyroid cancer patients treated at our The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from January 2021 to January 2023. Patients were categorized into high cognitive function (n = 125) and low cognitive function groups (n = 121) based on Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Data were collected on demographic variables, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), disease duration, clinical stage, blood test results, inflammatory factors (interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), C-reactive protein (CRP)), psychological status (Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Self-Esteem Scale (SES)), sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)), and quality of life (36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36)). Additionally, an external validation set was established, with patients being divided into a high cognitive level group (n = 135) and a low cognitive level group (n = 128), and the model's predictive performance was validated through the external dataset. Factors significantly associated with lower cognitive function included age (P < 0.001), education level (P < 0.001), CCI scores (P < 0.001), disease duration (P < 0.001), clinical stage (P = 0.003), IL-6 (P < 0.001), IL-8 (P = 0.005), TNF-α (P < 0.001) and CRP (P < 0.001). SDS (P < 0.001), SAS (P < 0.001) and PSQI (P < 0.001) were also associated with reduced cognitive function. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model demonstrated strong predictive performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.903 in the training set and an AUC of 0.835 in the validation set. CRCI in thyroid cancer patients is multifactorial, with significant contributions from demographic, clinical, inflammatory, and psychological factors. The developed predictive model may serve as a valuable tool in clinical practice for identifying thyroid cancer patients at high risk of cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "Natural compounds are an invaluable source for bioactive small molecules. Cellular activities modulated by them are generally achieved by binding specific cellular targets. However, identification of target(s) for a natural compound is challenging and a hurdle for further development of them as drugs. Sinensetin is derived from Schisandra sphenanthera and the major component of a traditional medicine. Although Sinensetin possesses pharmacological activities, including antioxidants, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer, the molecular mechanisms for its activities remain unclear due to lack of information for its target. In addition, the anticancer effects of sinensetin against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have not been studied. Here, we described sinensetin as a specific inhibitor of MKK6 with a KD value of 66.27 μM. Sinensetin inhibited the proliferation of NSCLC cells and lung patient-derived xenograft-derived organoids (LPDXO), and induced G1 phase cell-cycle arrest. Sinensetin attenuated the MAPK signaling pathway by directly inhibiting MKK6, but not MKK3. In silico molecular docking analysis indicated that sinensetin was specifically bound near the αG-helix of MKK6, but not MKK3. High MKK6 expression levels were observed in NSCLC patients. MKK6 knockout abolished the sinensetin-mediated inhibition of NSCLC cell proliferation. Taken together, sinensetin is a novel MKK6 inhibitor with therapeutic potential for NSCLC.",

TLY012 is pegylated recombinant Tumor necrosis factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL), an orphan drug for chronic pancreatitis and systemic sclerosis. Innate immune TRAIL signaling suppresses cancer. We hypothesized that the combination of immune checkpoint-blocking anti-PD-1 antibody and TLY012 would have synergistic anti-tumor efficacy in immune-competent PDAC-bearing mice. PDAC tumor-bearing C57Bl/6 mice treated with 10 mg/kg anti-mouse PD-1 antibody twice weekly and 10 mg/kg TLY012 three times weekly had reduced tumor growth and tumor volume at 70 days compared to either drug alone (all P < 0.005). B-cell activating factor (BAFF), which promotes PDAC tumors, decreased to 44% of control mice with dual treatment at 7 days and remained decreased at 3 months. Long-term dual treatment showed the highest plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines interferon-gamma (average 5.6 times control level, P=0.046), CCL5 (average 14.1 times control level, P=0.048), and interleukin-3 (IL-3, average 71.1 times control level, P=0.0053). Flow cytometry showed trends toward decreased circulating regulatory T cells, increased NK cells, and a higher proportion of CD8+ T cells within tumors in the dual treatment group. In summary, the combination of anti-PD-1 and TLY012 prevented the growth of PDAC in an immunocompetent mouse model while increasing tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, decreasing circulating T-regulatory cells and altering plasma cytokine expression of CCL5, interferon-gamma, and IL-3 to promote proinflammatory, antitumor effects. Combining TLY012 and anti-mouse PD-1 modifies immune cell and cytokine levels to induce a more proinflammatory immune environment that contributes to decreased PDAC tumor growth.",

    "abstract": "Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) refers to malignant diseases originating from placental trophoblast cells. Despite high complete remission rates with standard treatments, the adverse effects of chemotherapy, variation in treatment regimens, and the psychological impact on patients significantly influence the prognosis. This study aims to identify factors influencing the time to serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) negativization, thereby contributing to the optimization of patient management strategies. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 206 patients diagnosed with invasive mole and gestational choriocarcinoma treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine from January 2014 to May 2022. Patients- and treatment-related risk factors were collected. We evaluated 33 variables potentially related to the duration of serum hCG negativization with statistically significant variables from univariate analyses subsequently included in multivariate Cox regression analysis. Through univariate analysis, we identified 11 significant predictors that related with hCG negativization, including body mass index (BMI), age at menarche, number of miscarriages, prior pregnancy status, time since prior pregnancy, maximum tumor diameter, maximum lung tumor diameter, alkaline phosphatase levels, pre-chemotherapy hCG levels, initial chemotherapy regimen, and whether hysterectomy was performed. Cox regression analysis highlighted that increased BMI was associated with a shorter time to hCG negativization (HR=1.730, P=0.001). In contrast, higher pre-treatment hCG levels, longer time since the last pregnancy, and undergoing hysterectomy were associated with prolonged hCG conversion times. In conclusion, this study underscores the importance of individual factors such as BMI, pre-treatment hCG levels, and surgical interventions in determining the duration of hCG negativization in GTN patients. These findings suggest that tailored treatment strategies considering these factors could enhance treatment efficacy and patient outcomes. Increased awareness and careful consideration of these factors should be integral to pre-treatment planning and patient counseling.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies identified that SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains 2 (SHANK2) is located in a gene-amplified region 11q13 of various human cancers, and has oncogenic functions as a Hippo pathway suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma. In this study, we tested whether SHANK2 acts as a cancer-promoting gene through its activation or overexpression in gastric cancer (GC). We analyzed 5 GC cell lines and 172 primary tumor samples of GC, which were curatively resected in our hospital. Overexpression of SHANK2 protein was frequently detected in GC cell lines (4/5 cell lines, 80%). Knockdown of SHANK2 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells in a TP53 mutation-independent manner, and induced the overexpression of the Hippo pathway genes. Fluorescent immunostaining showed that overexpression of SHANK2 in cytoplasm was inversely correlated with Yes1-associated transcriptional regulator (YAP) expression, suggesting that SHANK2 may play a role in suppressing the Hippo pathway in GC. In primary GC samples, both overexpression of SHANK2 in cytoplasm and low expression of SHANK2 in nucleus, which are defined as high SHANK2 index, correlated with more aggressive venous invasion, advanced tumor and nodal stage. Patients with high SHANK2 index tumors had a lower overall survival rate than those with non-expressing tumors. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that high SHANK2 index was independently associated with poor outcomes. These findings suggest that SHANK2 plays a crucial role in tumor malignant potential through the Hippo pathway suppression and highlight its usefulness as a prognostic factor and potential therapeutic target in GC.",

The SHAP algorithm was employed to evaluate feature importance, and a nomogram was developed for individual risk prediction. LASSO regression identified 10 independent risk factors for myelosuppression: age, body mass index (BMI), white blood cell count, neutrophil count, platelet count, total protein, gender, treatment regimen, targeted therapy, and first chemotherapy cycle. In the training cohort, the XGBoost model exhibited the best performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.855 (95% CI: 0.813-0.897), while the AUC in the validation cohort was 0.793. SHAP analysis identified white blood cell count, platelet count, neutrophil count, BMI, and age as the most influential predictors. The SHAP analysis based on the XGBoost model demonstrated substantial value. This study successfully developed an individualized prediction model for myelosuppression risk in lung cancer patients following platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, with the XGBoost model achieving high predictive accuracy and clinical utility. The model provides a valuable tool for guiding precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients face an increased risk of developing various malignancies due to shared risk factors and underlying systemic inflammation. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has shown potential anticancer properties in preclinical studies, but clinical evidence in COPD patients is limited. We conducted a nationwide propensity score-matched cohort study using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database to evaluate the anticancer effects of NAC in COPD patients. Patients diagnosed with COPD between 2008 and 2019 were included, and those with pre-existing cancer were excluded. NAC use was defined as consistent administration for most days with an average dose exceeding 28 cumulative defined daily doses (cDDDs) annually. Cox regression models were adjusted for various covariates was employed. PSM yielded 91,546 patients, evenly distributed between NAC and non-NAC groups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed a lower cancer risk in patients with long-term NAC use compared to non-users (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66-0.72; P<0.001). Dose-dependent relationships were observed, with higher daily NAC intake associated with reduced cancer risk. Time-varying Cox regression analysis demonstrated significant reductions in the risk of specific cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer, among NAC users compared to non-users. Our study provides clinical evidence supporting the potential anticancer effects of NAC in COPD patients. These findings highlight the importance of exploring NAC as a chemopreventive agent in high-risk populations and inform clinical practice and future research endeavors.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer patients' maximal O2 uptake (V̇O2max) values average 60-80% of age-predicted values which is often attributed to adjuvant therapy rather than risk factors, comorbidities, or the tumor and associated factors (e.g., pro-inflammatory cytokines). It is crucial to understand the physiological mechanisms behind exercise intolerance in breast cancer patients to enhance targeted interventions; however, the effect of breast cancer, as an isolated condition on V̇O2max, exercise tolerance, and resting cardiac function has not been investigated. We hypothesized that breast cancer, in the absence of underlying conditions or chemotherapy, would lower V̇O2max, exercise tolerance, and cardiac function in proportion to tumor mass. Female Fischer-344 rats (~6-8 months, n = 8) were acclimatized to treadmill running for 5 days at 25 m/min for 5 min/day. To measure V̇O2max, rats were placed within a plexiglass metabolic chamber connected to CO2 and O2 analyzers. Tests began at 25 m/min and increased (5 m/min) until exhaustion. Cardiac function was determined by echocardiography before rats received a mammary intraductal injection of rat adenocarcinoma cells (MATBIII, 6 × 103 in 50 µl saline). Tumor growth was monitored daily and ~7 days following palpation (~24 days post-injection), V̇O2max and echocardiography measurements were repeated. Tumor mass and volume were 2.1 ± 0.6 g and 1685 ± 428 (range 256-3749) mm3, respectively. Body mass (217 ± 6 vs 218 ± 6 g), V̇O2max (72.1 ± 2.7 vs 70.0 ± 2.8 ml/kg·min; P > 0.05), and all measures of cardiac function were unchanged following tumor formation, with no significant correlation between tumor mass and V̇O2max (P > 0.05). However, time to exhaustion (376 ± 20 vs 297 ± 25 s), final treadmill speed (48 ± 1 vs 42 ± 2 m/s), distance run (209 ± 16 vs 152 ± 18 m), and total work (45 ± 3 vs 32 ± 4 m·kg) were significantly reduced with tumor bearing. Contrary to our hypothesis, breast cancer did not affect V̇O2max or cardiac function, but reduced exercise tolerance.",

The overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of SCARA5 high expression were higher those of SCARA5 low expression in patients with CC. Sh-SCARA5 promoted CC in mice model. SCARA5 up-regulation reduced cell growth of CC. SCARA5 up-regulation promoted Ferroptosis of CC by the inhibition of mitochondrial damage. SCARA5 up-regulation induced ferritin light chain (FTL) protein expression. Si-FTL attenuated the effects of SCARA5 on Ferroptosis in CC. The SCARA5 protein interlinked with the FTL protein. SCARA5 up-regulation reduced FTL protein ubiquitination. Up-regulation of SCARA5 suppressed cell growth in CC. SCARA5 up-regulation enhanced ferroptosis in CC by inhibiting mitochondrial damage. We conclude that SCARA5 promoted ferroptosis in CC cells by inhibiting FTL ubiquitination-induced mitochondrial damage, which may contribute to the treatment of CC.",

    "abstract": "The advent of immunotherapy has transformed the therapeutic landscape for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); nonetheless, the emergence of resistance to immunotherapy poses a considerable obstacle. Our research sought to identify factors contributing to immunotherapy resistance and to assess the effectiveness of subsequent treatments in patients with advanced NSCLC who have been exposed to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). This retrospective study analyzed data from 232 individuals with advanced NSCLC who were treated with ICIs during January 2020 to December 2023. Based on their response to ICIs, these patients were classified into two groups: immunoresistance group (IM group) and non-immunoresistance group (NIM group). Data collected included demographics, clinical parameters, cytokine profiles, tumor mutational burden (TMB), PD-L1 expression, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events. The association between risk factors and immunoresistance were assessed, and second-line treatment outcomes were evaluated. Key risk factors for immunoresistance included lower TMB, higher levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10), and PD-L1 expression ≥ 50%. TMB was inversely correlated with immunoresistance (rho = -0.838, P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, IL-10 remained a significant risk factor (OR = 33.654, P = 0.021), whereas TMB was protective (OR = 0.786, P < 0.001). Second-line targeted therapy significantly improved OS (8.72 ± 2.02 months) and PFS (5.37 ± 2.15 months) compared to chemotherapy (OS: 7.93 ± 2.13 months; PFS: 4.86 ± 1.68 months) (P < 0.05). The targeted therapy group experienced distinct side effects, notably increased hypertension and hand-foot syndrome, while chemotherapy group had higher rates of fatigue (P < 0.05). Immunoresistance in advanced NSCLC is influenced by IL-10, TMB, and PD-L1 expression. Targeted therapies offer superior outcomes than chemotherapy, though side effect management remains crucial.",

A decision tree model was constructed to estimate and compare costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), incremental net health benefits (INHBs), and incremental net monetary benefits (INMBs). One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness and uncertainty of the economic analysis. The base case analysis indicated that from the perspective of US payers, trilaciclib was cost-saving at the WTP threshold of $241,230.00, with an incremental cost of $-12,626.08, an INMB of $16,788.02, and an INHB of 0.07 QALYs. Conversely, from the perspective of Chinese payers, the use of trilaciclib was not economical at the WTP threshold of $35,817.44, with an ICER of $691,541.63/QALY, an INMB of -$8,765.52, and an INHB of -0.24 QALYs. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of these results. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated that, from the Chinese payers' perspective, trilaciclib treatment was not economical, with a probability of 100%. In contrast, from the US payers' perspective, it was economical, with a probability of 90.05%. Given the limited clinical data available for trilaciclib in the Chinese population, the cost-effectiveness of trilaciclib may improve with the inclusion of new data or changes in health insurance policies.",

    "abstract": "Locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) is primarily treated with weekly cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT); however, predicting acute tumor response remains challenging. This study aimed to identify plasma exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) that could predict rapid tumor regression in patients with LACC undergoing CCRT. Overall, 41 patients with stage IB-IVB cervical cancer were included. All patients received CCRT, and plasma exosomal RNA samples were collected before treatment and 2 weeks after radiation therapy (RT). Acute tumor response (AR) was defined as the regression rate of tumor volume (TV) (cm3) measured at the fourth week of treatment compared with the initial TV (iTV). The log2 fold change of miRNA and mRNA was calculated by comparing RNA read counts before and after the second week of CCRT for each patient. A correlation matrix identified RNAs associated with AR. The selected RNAs were validated through linear regression and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Leave-one-out cross-validation was performed in subgroups based on iTV. miR-150-3p, NMT2, and PRDM1 were identified as key predictors of AR, demonstrating significant associations with immune-mediated tumor responses. A decrease in post-RT levels of these RNAs was significantly associated with poor AR, particularly in patients with large iTVs. The predictive model combining miR-150-3p, NMT2, and PRDM1 showed strong correlation with AR (R2 = 0.831, P < 0.0001) in the test dataset and was validated in an independent cohort (R2 = 0.496, P = 0.006). Cross-validation indicated the robustness of these biomarkers in predicting AR across varying TVs. These findings highlight the potential of plasma exosomal miR-150-3p, NMT2, and PRDM1 are promising biomarkers for predicting AR in patients with LACC undergoing CCRT. These findings could facilitate personalized RT strategies and improve patient outcomes. Further multicenter studies are warranted to validate these biomarkers in larger, diverse cohorts.",

Due to this rapid metabolism, the effective dose of Gem is high, thereby predisposing patients to severe adverse effects. This study aimed to improve Gem's metabolic and therapeutic stability by modifying the amine group (4-NH2) with hydroxylamine to form 4-N-hydroxylGem hydrochloride (GemAGY). Micro-elemental analysis and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) were used to characterize GemAGY, and its anticancer activity was investigated against MiaPaCa-2, BxPC-3, and PANC-1 pancreatic cancer cell lines. The GemAGY metabolic stability was evaluated in human liver microsomal solution. In the 2D cytotoxicity assay, the IC50 values of GemAGY-treated MiaPaCa-2, PANC-1, and BxPC-3 cells were significantly lower when compared to GemHCl-treated cultures. More so, in 3D spheroid assay results, GemAGY IC50 values were found to be 9.5 ± 1.1 µM and 12.6 ± 1.0 µM when compared to GemHCl IC50 values of 24.1 ± 1.6 µM and 30.2 ± 1.8 µM in MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells, respectively. GemAGY was stable, with 60% remaining intact after 2 hours of digestion in microsomal enzymes, compared to GemHCl, which had less than 45% remaining intact after 30 minutes. GemAGY-treated MiaPaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells at 3.12 and 6.25 μM concentrations demonstrated a significantly reduced cell migration towards the wound area compared to the GemHCl-treated cultures at the same concentrations. Further, GemAGY-treated MiaPaCa-2 cells significantly increased the expression of p53 and BAX compared to GemHCl-treated cells. GemAGY demonstrated significant anticancer activity and improved metabolic stability compared to GemHCl and is most likely to have potential anticancer activity against pancreatic cancer.",

This study explored the effect of the coexistence of MASLD and HBV on clinicopathological features and long-term clinical prognoses in patients with MASLD-related and/or HBV-related HCC after curative hepatectomy. The study retrospectively collected the data of 653 patients with HCC who had undergone curative hepatectomy between 2011 and 2022. We assessed the association of histologically confirmed MASLD with HCC recurrence and mortality. Of 653 patients, 320 (49.0%), 103 (15.8%), and 230 (35.2%) had concomitant MASLD and HBV, MASLD only, and HBV only, respectively. The median follow-up period was 5.1 years. Patients with concomitant MASLD and HBV were at a significantly increased risk of HCC recurrence (P = 0.013 and P = 0.041) and mortality (P = 0.044 and P = 0.026) than those with MASLD or HBV alone.

This study compares survival outcomes of radiotherapy versus supportive care in MIBC patients ineligible for cystectomy or bladder preservation with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Using the Taiwan Cancer Registry and National Health Insurance Research Database (2011-2020), we identified patients with cT2-T4N0-1M0 urinary bladder urothelial carcinoma. Patients were excluded if they had undergone cystectomy or chemotherapy. Patients received either radiotherapy or supportive care, with endpoints of overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression. Among 485 MIBC patients, 301 (62%) received radiotherapy, and 184 (38%) supportive care. After 13.93 months of median follow-up, radiotherapy significantly improved OS and CSS (P<0.001). Mortality rates were 26.9% for radiotherapy and 76.1% for supportive care at one year, and 59.5% vs. 94.0% at three years. OS and CSS benefits were confirmed for stages II-IV (adjusted hazard ratios: 5.47, 3.23, and 12.44, respectively), with T3, T4, N1, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) predicting worse OS. In conclusion, radiotherapy offers superior survival benefits compared to supportive care in MIBC patients who are unfit for cystectomy or chemoradiotherapy. These findings provide valuable insights for clinicians in making treatment decisions, particularly for elderly or medically unfit patients with early or locally advanced-stage MIBC.",

PC survival rates are lower in Blacks compared to other races, and this has been attributed to socioeconomic and genetic factors. In this study, we evaluated sociodemographic and genetic characteristics associated with PC incidence and mortality among Blacks. Data from the SEER 22 registries (2000-2020) were used to calculate the incidence rates and relative survival. County mortality rates from 2017 to 2021 were analyzed. Incidence rate ratios based on gender, age, primary disease site, stage, level of education, and poverty were calculated. Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method. Mutant gene expression was obtained from the MSK-CHORD tumor registry. Overall, 48,606 Black patients were diagnosed with malignant PC between 2000 and 2020: females (53.53%) and males (46.47%). Both males and females experienced a slight increase in Annual Percent Change (APC) of PC incidence (0.24, 95% CI, -0.02-0.53) and (0.22, 95% CI, -0.05-0.51), respectively, from 2000 to 2020. Males aged 55 to 75 years were most frequently affected. Overall incidence risk from 2000-2020 by age was higher in Black males IRR > 1 (1.18, 95% CI, 1.16-1.21). The most common primary PC site for Black males and females was the head of the pancreas, 49.06% and 49.88%, respectively. By staging, distant PC had the highest frequency in Blacks. Poverty level was associated with PC incidence among females and PC mortality among both males and females. Stage was associated with survival among males with localized and regional PC. The 5-year relative survival was less than 11% across combined PC stages for both sexes. Black males had a relatively lower 5-year survival than Black females in localized (31.7 vs. 37.2%) and distant PC (2.6% vs. 2.90%). Mutant KRAS expression was higher in Black males. PC incidence and mortality were significantly higher in Black males. Our analysis points to the importance of poverty alleviation programs that target females are likely to reduce PC incidence. Furthermore, receiving recommended screening for PC and early-stage diagnostics is important to lower PC mortality.",

    "abstract": "Gastrin-releasing peptide precursor (ProGRP) is a bioactive precursor of GRP and might play an important role as an emerging tumor marker in early cancer diagnosis. It might also be abnormal in the nonmalignant disease and renal function abnormalities. The present study was undertaken to investigate the changes of ProGRP levels in patients with kidney injuries, especially with chronic kidney disease (CKD), determine the upper reference intervals and clinical diagnostic value of ProGRP in CKD, and thus help oncologists in interpreting ProGRP levels and making clinical judgments of malignances. 676 individuals were enrolled in this cross-sectional study and divided into five groups: healthy control (n=194), CKD (n=272), nephrotic syndrome (NS) (n=137), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) (n=41), and urinary tract infection (UTI) (n=32). A total of 27 features including age, gender, and 25 laboratory markers were analyzed. Machine learning algorithms were built for the diagnostic models of CKD. Statistical analysis was performed by R software. It was shown that serum ProGRP level in CKD was significantly higher than that in healthy controls, UTI and NS (P < 0.01). The upper reference limit of ProGRP was 188.42 pg/ml for CKD, 245.40 pg/ml for CKD IV-V, and 97.25 pg/ml for NS. Compared with the healthy control, the level of serum ProGRP in CKD stages II, III, IV-V was significantly increased and elevated progressively with CKD grade (P < 0.01). Random Forest (RF) model works best among 4 building machine learning algorithms. 5 vital indicators, ProGRP, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), urea, albumin (ALB), and direct bilirubin (DBIL), were selected to establish RF model for diagnosing CKD with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94-0.97) and high sensitivity (0.89) and specificity (0.92). This study demonstrates that the level of ProGRP in patients with CKD, nephrotic syndrome or AAV, was significantly higher than that in the healthy population. The machine learning model of ProGRP with DBIL, eGFR, ALB, and urea, could provide good clinical value for CKD evaluation.",

The radiomics model included 11 features, while the clinical-radiological model incorporated lobulation, age, and long diameter. The nomogram outperformed both individual models in terms of accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) in both the training and test sets. Calibration curve analysis confirmed good consistency between actual and predicted outcomes, and DCA indicated the nomogram's clinical utility.

    "abstract": "Percutaneous ablative therapies are widely used to treat colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), particularly in patients who are not candidates for surgical resection. Frailty has been associated with poor outcomes in colorectal cancer (CRC) and liver resections. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of frailty on short-term outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous ablative therapies for CRLM. This population-based, retrospective study used data from the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample database (2005-2020). Adults aged ≥ 50 years diagnosed with CRLM who underwent percutaneous ablative therapies were included. Frailty was confirmed using the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Associations between frailty and in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS), non-home discharge, total hospital charges, and postoperative complications were evaluated using univariate and multivariable regression analyses. A total of 670 patients (mean age: 66.3 years) were included, of whom 23% were categorized as frail (HFRS ≥ 5). Multivariable analysis showed that frail patients had significantly increased risks of complications (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.04-7.59), longer LOS (adjusted Beta [aBeta] = 1.69 days, 95% CI: 1.68-1.70), and higher total hospital charges (aBeta = $22.04 thousand, 95% CI: $21.92-$22.16). Complications with the highest risks in frail patients included, sepsis/shock (aOR = 17.39), surgical site infection (aOR = 3.55), respiratory failure/mechanical ventilation (aOR = 4.43), acute kidney injury (aOR = 9.37), and bleeding (aOR = 4.79). In conclusion, in adults aged ≥ 50 years undergoing percutaneous ablative therapies for CRLM, frailty independently predicted worse short-term outcomes, including higher complication rates, longer LOS, and increased hospital charges. The absence of detailed tumor characteristics and specific types of ablative therapy performed underscores the need for further research.",

This retrospective study analyzed the baseline data from 156 endometrial cancer patients who received postoperative radiotherapy at the gynecology department of ChangZhi People Hospital Affiliated to ChangZhi Medical College. Optimal cutoff values for preoperative hematological indicators were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for univariate analysis to describe survival time and the 5-year overall survival rate of patients, as well as to plot the survival curve for endometrial cancer. Multivariate regression analysis was employed to identify independent risk factors for patient survival prognosis and to establish a multivariate prediction model. By the end of the follow-up period, 42 patients (26.9%) were alive, and 114 patients (73.1%) had died. The shortest survival period was 21 months, the longest was 73 months, and the median survival time was 51 months. The 5-year survival rate was 39.3%. The prognostic nomogram model for endometrial cancer included 7 risk factors: age, pathological stage, interval time to postoperative chemotherapy, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR). The Hosmer-Lemeshow test result for this model showed that the area under the ROC curve was 0.995 (95% CI: 0.989-1.000), with an optimal cutoff value of 0.485, a sensitivity of 0.951, and a specificity of 0.71616. The internal validation results of the model showed a C-index of 0.995, indicating a good fit and high predictive value of the model. Pre-treatment peripheral blood levels of PLR, NLR, and MLR were higher in deceased patients who received postoperative radiotherapy for advanced endometrial cancer compared to survivors.

    "abstract": "Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (rAAA) is a life-threatening condition with high mortality. This study compared the efficacy and safety of open surgical repair (OSR) and endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) in the treatment of rAAA. A retrospective analysis of clinical data was conducted for 232 rAAA patients treated at Taizhou Central Hospital and the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical College. Patients were divided into two groups based on surgical methods: OSR group (n=84) and EVAR group (n=148). Perioperative indicators, perioperative complication rates, and 1-year mortality rates were compared. Patients were further divided into a survival group (n=160) and a death group (n=72) based on their 1-year survival status, and the risk factors affecting the prognosis of rAAA patients were analyzed. Postoperative pain was evaluated using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Verbal Rating Scale (VRS), and Present Pain Intensity (PPI). Serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cells (WBC), pro-inflammatory interleukins (IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured before and after treatment using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Compared with the OSR group, the EVAR group had significantly shorter surgical time, less intraoperative bleeding (IOB) and intraoperative blood transfusion volume, reduced intraoperative infusion volume, shorter fasting and first walk time, and shorter ICU and hospital days. The incidence of complications in the EVAR group was significantly lower than that in the OSR group (P<0.05). Pain scores (VAS, VRS, and PPI) and serum levels of CRP, WBC, IL-1α, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α were significantly lower in the EVAR group than those in the OSR group (all P<0.05). There was no significant difference in perioperative mortality between the two groups (28.95% vs. 11.80%, P>0.05). However, the 1-year mortality rate was significantly lower in the EVAR group (38.1% vs. 27.0%, P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified Alb<40 g/L (P=0.004), Cre≥1.5 mg/dL (P=0.007), urea nitrogen ≥25 mg/dL (P=0.001), ALT≥40 U/L (P=0.002), and treatment method (OSR) (P=0.024) as independent risk factors for poor postoperative prognosis. EVAR demonstrates significant advantages over OSR in reducing surgical trauma, decreasing postoperative complications, alleviating pain and inflammatory responses, and improving postoperative survival rates.",

Employing clinical samples and NPC cell lines, we conducted in vitro and in vivo xenograft experiments to assess the impacts of modulating EP300-AS1 expression. Techniques such as CCK8, migration, scratch, apoptosis assays, cell cycle analysis, immunoblotting, and fluorescence experiments elucidated EP300-AS1's role in NPC. The interaction between EP300-AS1 and TFAP2C in regulating CST6 expression was verified using FISH, ChIP, RNA pull-down, and silver staining assays. Results indicated lower expression levels of EP300-AS1 and CST6 in NPC, with EP300-AS1 suppression inhibiting cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, while promoting apoptosis and maintaining the cell cycle in the G1 phase. EP300-AS1 also modulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker expression, suggesting a role in metastasis control. Conclusively, EP300-AS1 acts as a potential tumor suppressor in NPC by interacting with TFAP2C and targeting CST6, offering novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets through its influence on methylation and the tumor microenvironment.",

BromAc®, a mixture of bromelain and acetylcysteine, has demonstrated anticancer properties with chemotherapeutic agents. Although bromelain and acetylcysteine have anti-inflammatory, anti-coagulant and wound healing properties, their effect with Mitomycin C is unknown in HIPEC. Hence, we investigated their safety using a rat model. Sixteen Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups (N=4). Controls received saline, whilst the others received BromAc®, Mitomycin C (MMC) or BromAc®+MMC. Three doses were given at 30-minute intervals. Animal weights were monitored for 7 days before euthanasia. Peritoneal fluid and blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. Colon anastomosis healing was evaluated with burst pressure and collagen density assessment. Internal organ histology and coagulation factor X were performed in plasma with an enzyme-linked immune assay. All rats were healthy, with similar weight fluctuation patterns, although the MMC-treated rats, with or without BromAc®, showed higher weight loss during the first 4 days. Whilst the burst pressure was similar in all groups, the BromAc® group showed a slightly higher value. Collagen densities were similar in all groups. The results showed that the histology of vital organs of the treated and controls were similar. BromAc® concentration in peritoneal fluids increased over 90 min with a higher increase when given with MMC. BromAc® or the combination did not affect coagulation Factor X. In conclusion, general well-being, wound healing, organ histology, pharmacokinetics and coagulation factor evaluations indicated that BromAc® with or without MMC was safe during HIPEC.",

We investigated the clinical significance of GDF-15 in CRC patients by a unique triangular comparison of tissue and preoperative serum GDF-15 levels with host factors. We evaluated 428 tissue and 214 serum samples from 214 CRC patients. We measured tissue and serum levels of GDF-15 and assessed their association with oncological outcomes and host factors. While cancer tissue GDF-15 levels showed no significant associations with clinicopathological factors or survival, preoperative serum GDF-15 levels were significantly correlated with indicators of disease progression, such as advanced T stage and advanced pathological stage. High preoperative serum GDF-15 level was associated with poor disease-free survival and overall survival and was an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival and overall survival. Significant correlations were observed between preoperative serum GDF-15 levels and host factors, including body mass index, psoas muscle mass index, intramuscular adipose tissue content, and C-reactive protein. In conclusion, preoperative serum GDF-15 reflects host factors such as body composition and inflammation and is a useful marker for the oncological management of CRC patients.",

The included patient were assigned into an experimental group (EG, n=62, warm acupuncture in conjunction with conventional FRT) and a control group (CG; n=56; conventional FRT only). Postoperative outcomes, including surgery duration, intraoperative blood loss (IOBL), drainage volume (DV), length of hospital stay, upper limb mobility, immune function indicators, and pain scores, were compared between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to identify factors affecting treatment outcomes. The EG demonstrated significantly lower visual analog scale (VAS) scores at post-operative 2, 4, and 8 weeks compared to the CG (all P < 0.05). The incidence of upper limb lymphedema in the EG was 9.26%, notably lower than the 24.07% observed in the CG (P < 0.05). Immune function indicators, including CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio, were significantly higher in the EG postoperatively (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the EG reported significantly improved scores in role physical, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, mental health, and physiological functioning, alongside significantly lower scores in bodily pain compared to the CG (all P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed CD3+ and CD4+/CD8+ ratio as independent factors affecting patient treatment efficacy (both P < 0.05). In conclusion, the combination of warm acupuncture and conventional FRT significantly enhances immune function, pain management, and overall QoL in BC patients after surgery, with CD3+ and CD4+/CD8+ ratios being crucial factors influencing recovery.",

We observed a higher incidence of thymoma in the Taiwanese population compared to other Western populations, suggesting the existence of different genomic features. Since most genomic studies are based on Western populations, we aimed to characterize the genomic profile of the Taiwanese population and compare it to the TCGA cohort in this study. We analyzed the genome of 47 thymoma patients using the Tumor Mutational Burden Panel to discover the genetic profile of the Taiwanese population. We also characterized the mutational signatures of these samples. Additionally, we leveraged RNA seq to estimate the gene expression profile and explored the featured pathways of thymoma in the Taiwanese population through gene set enrichment analysis.We identified several frequently mutated genes related to transcription, such as FAT1, KMT2D, and ZFHX3, as well as consensus mutational signatures associated with nucleotide excision repair (NER) and mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency. Our study also revealed increased activity of NER and MMR functions in our study cohort. Upon comparison with the TCGA cohort, we found dramatic differences in the most frequently mutated genes and mutational profiles between the Taiwanese and TCGA cohorts. Furthermore, we identified mismatch repair deficiency as a Taiwanese population-specific mutational signature with higher activity. These results highlight the distinct genomic background and molecular mechanisms of thymoma in the Taiwanese population, which may contribute to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the future.",

The inhibition of NUCKS1 notably decreased the proliferation and migration of SNU449 and HepG2 cells. However, NUCKS1 overexpression exacerbated cell growth and migration. Additionally, NUCKS1 depletion reduced the sphere formation efficiency and inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo. Mechanistically, depletion of NUCKS1 downregulated the expression of cell division control protein 42 (Cdc42), and NUCKS1 directly bound to the promoter of Cdc42 and transcriptionally upregulated Cdc42, which promoted the development and progression of HCC. Furthermore, the expression of NUCKS1 was positively associated with Cdc42 in HCC tissues. Collectively, our data indicate that the increasing expression of NUCKS1 plays an oncogenic role and promotes progression via transactivation of Cdc42 expression in HCC.",

    "abstract": "Advanced esophageal cancer presents significant treatment challenges, especially after immunochemotherapy failure. This study evaluates the efficacy of further treatment with combination chemotherapy versus combination immunotherapy crossover in terms of tumor regression, quality of life, and identifies factors influencing treatment outcomes. In a retrospective case-control study, clinical data from 293 patients with advanced esophageal cancer treated at Shanxi Province Cancer Hospital between February 2021 and February 2023 were analyzed. Patients excluded from radical resection due to failure of first-line immunotherapy were divided into two groups: 95 received combination chemotherapy with Irinotecan and Tigio (S-1, Tegafur/Gimeracil/Oteracil Potassium), and 198 underwent Anlotinib targeted therapy combined with immunotherapy crossover. Treatment efficacy was assessed using tumor regression grading (TRG), and quality of life was evaluated using EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OES18 scales. Potential factors affecting treatment efficacy were examined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Baseline characteristics, including age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and history of smoking and alcohol consumption, were comparable between the two groups. TRG showed no significant differences in distribution, with objective response rates of 40% in the Irinotecan/S-1 group and 44.44% in the combined immunotherapy crossover group (P = 0.472). However, quality of life measures indicated superior outcomes from immunotherapy crossover in physical (P = 0.024), emotional (P = 0.002), and general health scores (P = 0.003). Factors negatively impacting treatment success included male gender, smoking, alcohol consumption history, and certain tumor locations. Elevated CEA levels positively correlated with treatment efficacy. Logistic regression analysis identified male gender (OR, 2.109; P = 0.021), smoking (OR, 2.575; P = 0.003), alcohol consumption (OR, 1.995; P = 0.043), and CEA levels (OR, 0.742; P = 0.017) as significant predictors of treatment efficacy. Immunotherapy combined with targeted therapy and chemotherapy alone showed comparable efficacy in tumor regression. However, immunotherapy combined with targeted therapy improved certain aspects of quality of life. Factors such as gender, lifestyle habits, and CEA levels can significantly influence treatment outcomes.",

Endometrial cancer, common gynecological malignancy, has exhibited promising responses to immunotherapies. This study aims to assess the prognostic significance of various immune cell subsets in endometrial cancer, focusing on potential novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. A systematic literature review and meta-analysis were conducted. Eleven eligible studies, comprising 2,319 patients with endometrial cancer, were included. The primary outcome was the association between levels of immune cell types, particularly CD8+ T cells, and overall prognosis. The meta-analysis found that high levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), particularly CD8+ T cells, were significantly associated with better overall prognosis in endometrial cancer patients. These findings suggest that the tumor immune microenvironment plays a crucial role in endometrial cancer prognosis. This meta-analysis indicates that higher levels of CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment are linked to improved prognosis in endometrial cancer, underscoring the immune system's potential in prognostication and therapy.",

    "abstract": "Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) belongs to the non-endometrioid subtype of endometrial cancer that is known for its highly aggressive behavior and poor prognosis, highlighting the warrant of novel strategies for the treatment of USC. PLK1 is a type of serine/threonine kinase that is crucial for controlling the progression of the cell cycle, DNA damage response, and genome stability. Targeting PLK1 exhibits potent anti-tumorigenic activity in pre-clinical models of multiple cancer types, and several PLK1 inhibitors have shown significant clinical benefit and favorable safety profiles alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents. Onvansertib is an oral, selective PLK1 inhibitor that exhibits anti-proliferative activity in multiple types of cancer cell and animal models and has demonstrated clinical activity and a favorable safety profile in recent clinical trials. Hence, we investigated the anti-tumorigenic effects of onvansertib in USC cell lines. Nanomolar concentrations of onvansertib significantly inhibited cellular proliferation, led to cell cycle G2 arrest, induced cellular stress and apoptosis, caused DNA damage, and reduced cell adhesion and invasion in ARK-1 and SPEC-2 cells. The combination of onvansertib with paclitaxel demonstrated a synergistic effect in cell proliferation inhibition via inducing cell apoptosis and DNA damage. Our results provide preclinical evidence that onvansertib may be an effective strategy to treat USC and deserves further evaluation in animal models and clinical trials.",

This self-controlled case series (SCCS) analyzed cancer patients who received ICIs from January 2019 to December 2020 using the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). Exposure periods were defined as the duration of ICI prescriptions plus 90 days. Poisson regression estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for heart failure (primary outcome) and arterial events or perimyocarditis (secondary outcomes) during and after ICI exposure compared to baseline. Among 1,146 ICI users, 15 developed heart failure, 33 experienced arterial events, and 11 had perimyocarditis. Cardiovascular events were uncommon but showed elevated risks for heart failure (IRR: 7.73; CI: 2.05-29.14, P<0.01) and perimyocarditis (IRR: 8.25; CI: 1.60-42.50, P = 0.01) within 30 days of ICI exposure. Subgroup analysis identified higher risks in patients aged ≥65, males, and those with diabetes, hypertension, or hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, when focusing on patients who received more than two doses of ICIs or exclusively anti-PD-1 inhibitors, we observed a similarly increased risk of HF within 30 days post-exposure. Collectively, ICI exposure significantly elevates the risk of heart failure and perimyocarditis within 30 days, particularly in older adults and those with preexisting cardiovascular risk factors.",

The expression levels of DDX11-AS1 were assessed by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis in 10 pairs of colorectal cancer tissues and corresponding non-tumor tissues. Functional evaluations of DDX11-AS1 and DDX11-AS1-ORF were conducted using cell counting kit-8 (CCK8) assays, colony formation assays, Transwell migration assays, and in vitro tube formation assays. The coding potential of DDX11-AS1 was validated by western blot and immunofluorescence. The activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) pathway by DDX11-AS1-ORF through VEGFA was analyzed using western blot. The results showed that DDX11-AS1 was significantly upregulated in colorectal cancer tissues and cells, promoting cancer cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. DDX11-AS1 translated into a functional small protein, DDX11-AS1-ORF, which independently enhanced the malignant behaviors of tumor cells. DDX11-AS1-ORF promoted colorectal cancer progression by activating the p38-MAPK signaling pathway through Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A (VEGFA). The critical role of the p38-MAPK pathway in DDX11-AS1-ORF mediated tumor promotion was confirmed using the p38-MAPK pathway inhibitor SB203580. In conclusion, the small protein DDX11-AS1-ORF, encoded by DDX11-AS1, plays a crucial role in the development of colorectal cancer by promoting tumor proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis through the activation of VEGFA and the p38-MAPK signaling pathway. These findings provide a novel potential target for molecular targeted therapy in colorectal cancer.",

Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter (DLR) assays identified interactions between XIST, miR-124, and STAT3. Western blotting and RT-qPCR assessed changes in downstream targets, while a xenograft tumor model evaluated the in vivo effects of XIST knockdown. XIST was significantly upregulated, and miR-124 was downregulated in GC tissues and cell lines, with the strongest effects observed in MGC803 cells. Knockdown of XIST or overexpression of miR-124 suppressed GC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, invasion, and promoted apoptosis, effects that were reversed by miR-124 inhibitors. Bioinformatics and DLR assays confirmed that XIST directly targeted miR-124 and regulated STAT3 expression. XIST knockdown increased miR-124 levels, reducing STAT3, PD-1, PD-L1, N-cadherin, and MMP9 expression, while elevating E-cadherin levels; these effects were reversed by miR-124 inhibitors. Additionally, sh-STAT3 mitigated the pro-tumorigenic effects of pcDNA-XIST, confirming the regulatory relationship. In vivo, XIST knockdown suppressed tumor growth by increasing miR-124 expression.

    "abstract": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance is a key factor affecting the prognosis of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Previously, our group demonstrated that HCC patients with high stomatin-like protein 2 (STOML2) expression were poorly sensitive to systemic therapy. Whether STOML2 is involved in sorafenib resistance is unclear. Recent mechanistic studies have demonstrated that selective activation of ferroptosis pathways is expected to restore sorafenib sensitivity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the STOML2-ferroptosis axis and its contribution to sorafenib resistance. In this study, STOML2 expression was detected in tissue microarrays from patients with primary HCC and in human cell lines. Functional proliferative clone formation assay was used to study the biological function of STOML2. Ferroptosis was detected by flow cytometry, cellular lipid peroxidation and the malondialdehyde (MDA) test. Western blotting and qPCR assays were used to verify the STOML2-AKT-solute carrier family 7 membrane 11 (SLC7A11) axis and to explore the possible mechanism of the combination of LY294002 (an AKT inhibitor) in patients with advanced HCC. The results indicated that patients with poor efficacy demonstrated higher expression of STOML2 compared with that in samples derived from patients with good efficacy. Knockdown of STOML2 expression inhibited colony formation and IC50 in HCC cell lines treated with sorafenib. High STOML2 expression was negatively correlated with ferroptosis as shown by Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis. STOML2 inhibited ferroptosis by activating the AKT-SLC7A11 axis, which promoted increased intracellular antioxidant capacity. The AKT inhibitor LY294002 exhibited synergistic antitumor effects with sorafenib in HCC. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that STOML2 could enhance the AKT-SLC7A11-mediated antioxidant capacity in HCC, inhibit ferroptosis and reduce the sensitivity of HCC to sorafenib, providing a theoretical basis for the combination of LY294002 and sorafenib.",

The effects of VPS9D1-AS1 regulating VEGFA and affecting the proliferation, migration and invasion of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were examined using cell biology, in vitro tubeformation and Chorioallantoic membrane vascular assay. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and dual luciferase assays were performed to verify the specific sites of transcription factor binding to the promoter region of VPS9D1-AS1. VPS9D1-AS1 is highly expressed in colorectal cancer. Interfering with VPS9D1-AS1 inhibited the proliferation, invasion and migration of HUVECs. Mechanistically, VPS9D1-AS1 can promote angiogenesis by upregulating VEGFA expression and activating the downstream PI3K/AKT pathway. In addition, CEBPB is a transcription factor of VPS9D1-AS1 predicted by database, and the results of ChIP experiments showed that CEBPB could directly bind to the VPS9D1-AS1 promoter region at the -698 bp to -794 bp site. The results of dual luciferase assay showed that CEBPB could enhance VPS9D1-AS1 promoter activity and promote its transcription. VPS9D1-AS1 can be activated by CEBPB transcription factor and target VEGFA to activate its downstream pathway to promote colorectal cancer angiogenesis, which may suggest that VPS9D1-AS1 is critical for regulating colorectal cancer angiogenesis.",

Cognitive function was assessed before and after the intervention in both groups using the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scale. Pre- and post-intervention rs-fMRI data were also collected for regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) analyses in the CALM group. A total of 68 BCs were randomly assigned to either the CALM group (n = 33) or the care-as-usual (CAU) group (n = 35). Cognitive function was evaluated pre- and post-intervention using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). In the CALM group, rs-fMRI data were acquired before and after the intervention to assess alterations in regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC). CALM intervention demonstrated a greater enhancement in cognitive function compared to CAU (P = 0.004).

    "abstract": "Gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma, located at the esophagus-stomach junction, poses significant clinical challenges due to its complex physiological structure. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is standard for tumor downstaging, but response variability necessitates reliable predictive markers. This study evaluates baseline computed tomography (CT) imaging parameters and serum markers as predictors for chemotherapy response in GEJ adenocarcinoma. A retrospective study included 304 GEJ adenocarcinoma patients treated with the SOX regimen (S-1 + Oxaliplatin) between January 2020 and December 2024. Patients were categorized based on Tumor Regression Grade (TRG) into effective (TRG 0-1) and poor response (TRG 2-3) groups. Baseline CT characteristics were assessed alongside serum markers, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9), and carbohydrate antigen 72-4 (CA 72-4). Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors, and a combined predictive model was developed and validated using an external cohort. The effective treatment group showed significantly lower serum markers (CEA, AFP, CA 19-9, CA 72-4) and distinct CT parameters, including decreased maximum tumor thickness and area, and lower CT enhancement values. Extramural vascular invasion (EMVI) and tumor surface ulceration were associated with poor response. The combined predictive model demonstrated high accuracy, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.813 in the training set and 0.846 in the validation cohort. Baseline CT characteristics, when combined with serum markers, effectively predict NAC response in GEJ adenocarcinoma.",

    "abstract": "δ-Catenin is a member of the p120-catenin subfamily of armadillo proteins and is known to be upregulated in prostate cancer, promoting tumorigenesis. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. The carcinogen 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer. In this study, we explored the effect of TCDD on δ-catenin in prostate cancer cells. TCDD increased the protein levels of δ-catenin in a dose-dependent manner by enhancing its stability. Moreover, TCDD led to an increase in β-catenin expression but a decrease in E-cadherin levels. Further experiments revealed that TCDD stabilized the expression of δ-catenin by inhibiting its ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Finally, TCDD enhanced the motility and migration ability of prostate cancer cells through δ-catenin. These findings suggest that TCDD plays a role in stabilizing δ-catenin in prostate cancer cells, offering a new perspective on preventing δ-catenin degradation and potentially increasing the predictive value of δ-catenin for prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "Acute leukemia is the most common malignancy in children. While chemotherapy is effective, it significantly compromises immune function, leading to a high incidence of infectious complications, such as secondary pneumonia, particularly Mycoplasma pneumonia (MP). The treatment of infections in pediatric leukemia patients faces challenges such as antibiotic resistance and drug interactions during chemotherapy. This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of doxycycline in treating MP in pediatric leukemia patients post-chemotherapy, as well as it impact on chemotherapy continuity. This study employed a target trial emulation design using retrospective data from pediatric leukemia patients diagnosed with MP. Patients aged 12-17 years with confirmed leukemia and clinical evidence of pneumonia following chemotherapy were included. Doxycycline was compared to azithromycin and other empirical treatments. Follow-up assessments at 3 days, 5 days, 30 days, and 180 days evaluated fever resolution, radiological improvement, additional interventions, and adverse events. Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. In Trial 2, doxycycline demonstrated a significantly higher treatment success rate than other empirical treatments (87.72% vs. 73.13%, P = 0.013) and was associated with faster fever resolution (P = 0.048) and shorter time to chest X-ray improvement (P = 0.048). The 30-day survival rate was significantly higher in the Doxycycline group compared to other empirical treatments (100% vs. 91.04%, P = 0.019). Fewer patients require additional interventions such as ICU admission (P = 0.019). Furthermore, patients in the Doxycycline group had a significantly higher likelihood of completing chemotherapy without delays (84.21% vs. 59.70%, P = 0.01). In Trial 1, no significant differences were observed in treatment success rate, fever resolution time, hospitalization duration, or chemotherapy tolerance between Doxycycline and Azithromycin (P > 0.05). Doxycycline, as a broad-spectrum antibiotic, demonstrates efficacy comparable to azithromycin in treating MP with advantages in reducing chemotherapy-related delays, hospitalization duration, and the need for additional interventions. It enhances chemotherapy tolerance and continuity. Doxycycline may serve as an economical and effective alternative for managing post-chemotherapy infections in pediatric leukemia patients, especially in cases of antibiotic resistance or intolerance.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the predictive role of peripheral blood indicators in the prognosis of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Clinical data of 139 cSCC patients receiving ICIs treatment were retrospectively collected. Peripheral blood indicators, including blood cell counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), liver and kidney function markers, and inflammation markers, were examined. A binary logistic regression model was used to identify risk factors for non-response to ICIs, and a predictive model was constructed. Additionally, multiple linear regression and Pearson correlation analysis were employed to assess relevant influences and relationships. Results showed that immunotherapy timing, lymphocyte count, NLR, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were influencing factors for non-response to ICIs (all P<0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) for these indicators in predicting non-response risk was 0.651 (95% CI: 0.529-0.773), 0.671 (95% CI: 0.542-0.801), 0.775 (95% CI: 0.682-0.868), and 0.717 (95% CI: 0.573-0.861), respectively. The combined AUC of these four factors was 0.878 (95% CI: 0.790-0.966), with sensitivity and specificity of 76.0% and 93.0%, respectively. After internal verification, the constructed model exhibited predicted sensitivity and specificity of 80.00% and 94.29% respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that these four factors were independent predictors of progression-free survival (PFS) in cSCC patients. Immunotherapy timing, NLR, and CRP were negatively correlated with PFS (r = -0.235, -0.330, -0.494), while lymphocyte count was positively correlated with PFS (r = 0.326). In conclusion, peripheral blood indicators are valuable for predicting the response to ICIs in cSCC and can influence patients' PFS.",

    "abstract": "Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is a significant risk factor affecting treatment outcomes and prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) survivors. Behavioral activation (BA), a structured therapeutic approach based on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) principles, has demonstrated efficacy in alleviating psychological distress among cancer patients. This study aims to investigate the effect of BA on FCR in patients with NSCLC and explore the underlying mechanisms. A total of 82 eligible patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (BA) (n = 41) or the usual care group (CAU) (n = 41). Assessments were conducted at baseline (T0), week 4 (T1), and week 8 (T2) using the Cancer Recurrence Fear Scale-Brief Form (FCRI-SF), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS), and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) version 3.0. Negative emotions (depression and anxiety), as well as resilient coping, were identified as potential mediators. The intervention effect and its potential mediating effects were analyzed using generalized estimating equations (GEE). GEE analysis revealed significantly lower FCR scores in the BA group at weeks 4 and 8 (Group*T1: Wald X2 = 25.79, P < 0.001; Group*T2: Wald X2 = 59.59, P < 0.001). Depression and anxiety scores decreased over time in the BA group and remained consistently lower than those in the usual care group (depression: Group*T1 Wald X2 = 34.67, P < 0.001; Group*T2 Wald X2 = 56.05, P < 0.001; anxiety: Group*T1 Wald X2 = 36.22, P < 0.001; Group*T2 Wald X2 = 64.85, P < 0.001). Scores for resilient coping and quality of life increased over time in the BA group and were significantly higher than those in the usual care group (resilient coping: Group*T1 Wald X2 = 19.49, P < 0.001; Group*T2 Wald X2 = 66.19, P < 0.001; quality of life: Group*T1 Wald X2 = 19.86, P < 0.001; Group*T2 Wald X2 = 64.46, P < 0.001). Furthermore, negative emotions (depression and anxiety), as well as resilient coping, were found to mediate the effect of BA on changes in FCR. The BA intervention can alleviate FCR symptoms and improve the quality of life in NSCLC patients by reducing negative emotions (depression and anxiety) and enhancing resilient coping.",

The objectives of this study were to investigate whether the levels of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) reflect the prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after hepatectomy (Hx) and to determine whether the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) from diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) reflects CAF and TAM expression. The study cohort comprised 109 patients who underwent initial curative resection for HCC. Alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA) was selected as a CAF marker and CD204 as a TAM marker. Protein expression was immunohistochemically evaluated in the intratumoral regions of resected specimens. Clinicopathological factors, including the long-term prognosis after Hx, were investigated between αSMA-negative and -positive tumors and between CD204-negative and -positive tumors. The correlation between CAF/TAM marker expression and the calculated minimum ADC using DWI was also evaluated. αSMA-positive expression was correlated with tumor number, invasive growth pattern, and advanced stage. CD204-positive expression was correlated with the presence of venous invasion. Both αSMA-positive expression and CD204-positive expression were significant prognostic factors in the univariate analysis of overall survival and disease-free survival. αSMA/CD204 double positivity was associated with an extremely poor prognosis after Hx and was a significant independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P=0.02, hazard ratio: 3.27). Patients with double positivity also showed a significantly higher ADClow rate (83%). In conclusion, expression of both CAF and TAM markers reflected a poor prognosis after Hx. Furthermore, the preoperative ADC could be a clinical surrogate marker in the tumor microenvironment in patients with HCC.",

A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data of 192 patients with advanced lung cancer. 108 patients who received conventional radiotherapy were included in the control group, and the rest 84 patients who received Gamma Knife SBRT were included in the experimental group. Treatment outcomes, disease progression one year after radiotherapy, blood cell counts, coagulation function, quality of survival scores, and adverse reactions were compared between the two groups. The experimental group exhibited a significantly higher disease control rate (DCR) and objective response rate (ORR) compared to the control group (both P<0.05). Radiotherapy modality was identified as an independent factor influencing disease progression within one year. Both groups experienced reductions in leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, erythrocytes, and platelets after radiotherapy, but the experimental group had less pronounced reductions (P<0.05). Alterations in blood cell morphology were observed in both groups, with the experimental group showing fewer alterations (P<0.05). Coagulation function tests indicated a rise in prothrombin time (PT), a decrease in activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), and an increase in fibrinogen (Fib) and D-Dimer (D-D) levels in both groups, with more favorable coagulation indices observed in the experimental group. Patients in both groups showed improvement in quality of survival scores post-treatment, with the experimental group outperforming the control group (P<0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions was lower in the experimental group compared to the control group (P<0.05). Compared to traditional radiotherapy, Gamma Knife SBRT has a less detrimental impact on the blood cell level, morphology, and coagulation function in patients with moderate to advanced lung cancer. It also improves patients' quality of survival with fewer adverse reactions and better disease control.

Functional studies revealed that PSPH overexpression markedly enhanced ESCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, while PSPH knockdown exerted opposing effects. Mechanistically, transcriptomic and phosphoproteomic analyses identified the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway as the key downstream effector of PSPH. In vivo xenograft studies corroborated these findings, demonstrating that PSPH overexpression markedly promoted tumor growth. Notably, the pharmacological inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) effectively abrogated PSPH-induced tumor progression, unequivocally establishing the MAPK pathway as the dominant mediator of PSPH oncogenic functions. Our findings establish PSPH as a key driver of ESCC progression, promoting migration, proliferation, and invasion via MAPK signaling activation.

    "abstract": "With the increasing popularity of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in tumor treatment, the incidence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), including acute kidney injury (AKI), is on the rise. Renal biopsy serves as the gold standard for determining the true etiology of AKI following ICIs administration; however, due to potential risks and associated losses with this procedure, comprehensive analysis of physiological data and predictive models are gradually being incorporated into clinical practice to differentiate AKI etiologies. These include criteria such as a ≥ 100% increase in serum creatinine (Scr) from baseline or a 50% increase accompanied by other pathological manifestations, renal replacement therapy (RRT), or absence of any other reasonable cause. Currently, cessation of ICIs and steroid therapy represent commonly employed treatment approaches; nevertheless, these strategies have inherent side effects and may not be feasible for certain patient populations, such as those with diabetes, posing challenges for clinicians. Recent studies have demonstrated that rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), and infliximab can potentially replace steroid therapy in managing ICIs-induced AKI (ICIs-AKI), offering a novel therapeutic perspective. This review provides an overview of non-invasive methods for distinguishing between AKI following ICIs use and ICIs-AKI while discussing strategies for treating ICIs-AKI.",

N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common RNA modification in eukaryotes and exerts regulatory effects on RNA expression and metabolism, including splicing, translation, stability, decay, and transport. m6A demethylases belong to the AlkB family of dioxygenases that can catalyze m6A demethylation. Accumulating evidence in recent years has shown that abnormal m6A levels caused by m6A demethylases play crucial roles in different aspects of human cancer development. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the recent findings on the functions and underlying molecular mechanisms of m6A demethylases in cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, resistance to chemo- and radiotherapy, and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of digestive system tumors.

However, aggressive subtypes, particularly anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, present significant treatment challenges due to their high metastatic potential and resistance to conventional therapies. Therefore, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms is essential for improving treatment strategies. Herein, we aimed to investigate the role of SEMA6B in THCA progression and explore its associated molecular mechanisms. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in THCA was screened using RNA sequencing data from paired THCA and normal tissues of 10 patients. The expression and functional role of SEMA6B in THCA were further examined using datasets from TCGA and GEO. Functional assays were conducted to evaluate the effects of SEMA6B overexpression and knockout on THCA cell proliferation. In vivo xenograft assays were performed to validate these findings. Additionally, the impact of SEMA6B on the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway was verified. SEMA6B was highly expressed in THCA and significantly associated with poor clinical outcomes. SEMA6B overexpression significantly increased cell proliferation and colony formation, whereas its knockout reduced cell proliferation and enhanced sensitivity to Doxorubicin. Mechanistically, SEMA6B was found to promote activation of the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway. In conclusion, these data reveal a novel oncogenic role for the SEMA6B/WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway in THCA, providing new insights and potential avenues for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNA (circRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) play critical roles in regulating proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. To investigate their functional significance, we employed quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) to assess the differential expression of circ_0000190, miR-301a, and mesenchyme homeobox 2 (MEOX2) between TNBC cell lines and normal breast epithelial cells. Subsequently, we established overexpression and knockdown systems for these molecules to examine their effects on TNBC cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Additionally, we evaluated the impact of circ_0000190 overexpression on tumor growth using a mouse xenograft model, measuring tumor volume and weight. Our findings revealed that circ_0000190 and MEOX2 expression were significantly downregulated (P<0.05) in TNBC cells compared to normal breast epithelial cells, whereas miR-301a was upregulated (P<0.05). Knockdown of circ_0000190 promoted TNBC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT, while suppressing apoptosis. Mechanistically, circ_0000190 functioned as a molecular sponge for miR-301a, and its overexpression significantly inhibited miR-301a expression (P<0.001). Notably, miR-301a mimics partially reversed the suppressive effects of circ_0000190 overexpression on proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT, as well as its pro-apoptotic effects (P<0.001). Furthermore, we identified MEOX2 as a direct target of miR-301a. MEOX2 knockdown attenuated the inhibitory effects of miR-301a silencing on proliferation, migration, invasion, and EMT, while also counteracting its pro-apoptotic function. In vivo experiments demonstrated that circ_0000190 overexpression significantly reduced tumor volume and weight (P<0.001), concomitant with elevated MEOX2 mRNA and protein levels (P<0.001) and decreased miR-301a expression (P<0.001). In conclusion, our study elucidates that circ_0000190 suppresses TNBC progression by downregulating miR-301a and upregulating MEOX2, forming a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network of circRNA-miRNA-mRNA.",

    "abstract": "The oncoprotein MYC, overexpressed in more than 70% of human cancers, plays a pivotal role in regulating gene transcription and has long been recognized as a promising target for cancer therapy. However, no MYC-targeted drug has been approved for clinical use, largely due to the lack of a well-defined druggable domain and its nuclear localization. MYC-overexpressing cancer cells exhibit increased replication stress, driven by factors such as elevated replication origin firing, nucleotide depletion, replication-transcription conflicts, and heightened reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Simultaneously, MYC activates compensatory mechanisms, including enhanced DNA repair, checkpoint-mediated cell cycle regulation, and metabolic reprogramming, to mitigate this stress and support cell survival. Interfering with these compensatory pathways exacerbates replication stress, leading to synthetic lethality in MYC-driven cancer cells. In this review, we summarize recent advances in leveraging replication stress to achieve synthetic lethality in MYC-driven cancers. Furthermore, we discuss current strategies targeting replication stress, highlighting new opportunities for the development of therapies against MYC-driven malignancies.",

    "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) represents a malignancy within the hematological system, in which the reprogramming of cholesterol metabolism plays a pivotal role in its pathogenesis. This review focuses on the specificity of cholesterol metabolism abnormalities in the diagnosis of MM and their implications for the immune microenvironment, aiming to provide new perspectives for both diagnosis and treatment of MM. The expression changes of cholesterol metabolism-related genes (CMGs), such as ANXA2 and CHKA, closely correlate with the prognosis of MM. These CMGs are linked not only to clinical parameters, including the number of transplants and the International Staging System, but also to tumor incidence, progression, and treatment resistance. Consequently, they offer new biological markers for both the prognosis assessment and therapeutic strategies for MM. In terms of the immune microenvironment, reprogramming of cholesterol metabolism significantly influences tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TIICs), including T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), dendritic cells (DCs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Moreover, the cholesterol metabolite 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC) enhances the activity of immunosuppressive macrophages by modulating lysosomal AMPK activation and metabolic reprogramming, thus presenting a new metabolic target for tumor immunotherapy. The regulatory effects of cholesterol metabolism on MDSCs are also noteworthy; these cells promote tumor progression by inhibiting T-cell responses. High-fat diets and obesity can induce the accumulation of MDSCs, where molecules involved in the cholesterol metabolic pathway, such as the synthase CYP27A1 for 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HC), have been associated with poor prognoses in ovarian cancer. Genetic knockout of this enzyme significantly inhibits tumor progression. Regarding the diagnostic specificity of cholesterol metabolism abnormalities, these changes present novel biomarkers for the early diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of MM. Analyzing the correlation between immune cell proportions in the tumor microenvironment and lipid metabolism genes has unveiled potential links between cholesterol metabolism and immune responses, paving the way for precision medicine in MM. Thus, the reprogramming of cholesterol metabolism in MM offers a multidimensional and interdisciplinary research avenue. Future studies need to delve deeper into the specific mechanisms through which cholesterol metabolism contributes to MM development and leverage these findings to formulate new therapeutic strategies, ultimately improving outcomes for MM patients.",

Increasing evidence has supported that many natural products from plants or other resources display anticancer activities, whereas only limited data reported them in the treatment of KSHV-related malignancies. In the current study, we identified 7 natural compounds displaying prominent anti-KS and anti-PEL activities after high-throughput screening of a natural compound library on TIVE-LTC and BCBL-1 cell lines, respectively. Remarkably, most of these compounds showed much less or no toxicity on normal cells. Some of these natural compounds effectively repress PEL expansion in vivo. RNA-Sequencing and functional validation assays revealed the anticancer mechanisms of these new compounds, and identified new cellular factors such as FN1 which is required for PEL survival and growth.

A total of 312 patients with ovarian cancer undergoing treatment between Jan. 2020 and Jan. 2022 were selected for the retrospective study. Patients were eligible if they were ≥ 18 years old and diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer. In addition, they received platinum-sensitive treatment (PFS ≥ 6 months) and niraparib as a maintenance therapy. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate the influence of clinical and pathological variables on PFS. Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the predictive power of significant factors. Univariate Cox regression analysis identified significant associations between patients' PFS and BRCA mutation status, BMI, CA125 levels, FIGO staging, platinum sensitivity, and niraparib usage and timing. Patients with BRCA mutations, BMI ≥ 24 kg/m2, CA125 level ≤ 500 U/mL, FIGO stage II, or platinum sensitivity demonstrated a significantly longer PFS. Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed BRCA mutations (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.754, P = 0.049), BMI ≥ 24 kg/m2 (HR = 2.317, P = 0.015), CA125 level ≤ 500 U/mL (HR = 2.517, P = 0.005), FIGO stage III/IV (HR = 0.159, P < 0.001; HR = 2.558, P = 0.011), and platinum sensitivity (HR = 2.599, P = 0.043) as independent predictors for PFS. Time-dependent ROC analysis demonstrated that platinum sensitivity and FIGO staging were the most influential prognostic factors to predict the 1-year and 3-year PFS. In addition, it was found that niraparib-associated adverse events occurred in 62.84% of the enrolled patients, primary of which were mild to moderate hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities. BRCA mutations, CA125 levels, FIGO staging, BMI, and platinum sensitivity are critical factors influencing the efficacy of niraparib in PSROC patients. These findings have provided valuable insights into the individualized application of niraparib and the optimization of treatment strategies for PSROC patients.",

Inclusion criteria included pathologically confirmed NMIBC, initial transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT), and a minimum follow-up of one year. Patients who underwent radical cystectomy, had other malignancies, or suffered from severe comorbid conditions were excluded. Recurrence within one year post-treatment was used to stratify patients into recurrence and non-recurrence groups. Statistical analyses were performed to identify factors significantly associated with recurrence. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were employed to evaluate predictive performance. The recurrence rate was significantly lower in the IIT group (33.12%) compared to the no-IIT group (95.16%, P < 0.001). IIT significantly reduced the risk of recurrence (P < 0.001). Among vitamin supplements, only vitamin K3 demonstrated a significant association with recurrence (P = 0.010). Logistic regression confirmed IIT as an independent protective factor (OR = 0.026, P < 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) for individual predictors ranged from 0.587 to 0.754, while the combined model achieved an AUC of 0.877, indicating strong predictive performance. IIT and self-supplementation with vitamin K3 are associated with a reduced risk of NMIBC recurrence. These findings suggest that adjunctive strategies alongside standard transurethral resection of bladder tumor may enhance patient outcomes. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these associations and support their integration into clinical practice.",

Zandelisib, a selective PI3Kδ inhibitor, is under clinical development for treating B cell malignancies. Its intermittent dosing regimen sustains therapeutic effects while minimizing adverse effects. We explored zandelisib's pharmacological activity, focusing on its long-lasting property as a PI3Kδ inhibitor. To gain mechanistic insights, we compared the crystal structure of PI3Kδ in complex with zandelisib with other PI3K inhibitors. The binding kinetics of zandelisib, parsaclisib, idelalisib, and duvelisib to PI3Kδ were evaluated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis with the BiacoreTM system, and their binding in living cells was confirmed using the NanoBRETTM TE Intracellular Kinase Assay system. We assessed the effects of drug wash-out on intracellular drug concentrations, AKT phosphorylation inhibitory activity, and cell growth inhibitory activity in SU-DHL-6 or WSU-FSCCL B cell lymphoma cell lines. Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics analysis and anti-tumor activity evaluation were performed in mice bearing SU-DHL-6 tumors. The binding mode of zandelisib to PI3Kδ was revealed by X-ray crystallography. SPR analysis showed that zandelisib had a slower dissociation rate than other compounds, which was confirmed in cell-based binding assays. Idelalisib, parsaclisib, and duvelisib lost their PI3Kδ inhibitory activity by wash-out and showed a decreased cell growth inhibitory activity. In comparison, zandelisib exhibited sustained inhibitory activity against PI3Kδ and showed a more gradual decrease in cell growth inhibitory activity. Drug concentration after wash-out was highest for zandelisib. In vivo experiments using SU-DHL-6 tumor-bearing mice found zandelisib sustained PI3Kδ inhibitory effects for 8 hours at 50 mg/kg and 24 hours at 100 mg/kg. These results reflected significant anti-tumor activity of zandelisib in the B cell lymphoma model. The crystal structure of PI3Kδ in complex with zandelisib was determined at 2.5 Å resolution, revealing the benzimidazole group in zandelisib formed a hydrogen bond to the side chain of Lys779 in p110δ, the catalytic subunit of PI3Kδ. These studies demonstrated a longer duration of action of zandelisib compared to the other compounds, which was attributable to the hydrogen bond between zandelisib and Lys779 in p110δ.",

Kaplan-Meier curve analysis indicated that the CR rate of the high-risk group was lower than the low-risk group (training set P<0.001, internal validation set P=0.018), which exhibited a better stratification of patients than the International Staging System (ISS, training set P=0.850, internal validation set P=0.900), Revised International Staging System (R-ISS, training set P=0.740, internal validation set P=0.720) and the Second Revision of the ISS (R2-ISS, training set P=0.480, internal validation set P=0.590). This study effectively constructed a Nomogram for short-term risk assessment of NDMM patients based on three widely used clinical markers, thereby enriching factors related to NDMM prognosis and aiding in the evaluation of the short-term complete remission.",

This retrospective case-control study included 217 patients with recurrent EC treated between January 2020 and December 2023. Patients were divided into response (n = 102) and non-response (n = 115) based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (1.1). An internal validation cohort (n = 142) and an external cohort (n = 168) were also analyzed. Preoperative CE-MRI and CT scans were reviewed by experienced radiologists. Biomarker positivity rates - including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), cancer antigen 125 (CA125), cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and ovarian cancer-related protein 1 (OVX1), were assessed. Multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed to evaluate diagnostic performance, and an integrated model combining imaging and biomarkers was developed. CE-MRI achieved an AUC of 0.864, sensitivity of 78.3%, and specificity of 86.3%, while CT showed an AUC of 0.854, sensitivity of 81.2%, and specificity of 83.4%. The integrated model improved performance with an AUC of 0.889, sensitivity of 94.3%, and specificity of 81.2%. Internal and external validation models yielded AUCs of 0.859 and 0.918, respectively. Both CE-MRI and CT are effective in assessing treatment response, with CE-MRI offering slightly superior specificity. Integration of imaging and biomarker data significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy, supporting its potential in optimizing individualized treatment strategies for recurrent EC.",

Patients were assigned to either the MWA group (n = 135) or the TAE group (n = 120). Evaluated parameters included operative characteristics, liver function changes, recovery metrics, complications, treatment efficacy, quality of life, and patient satisfaction. MWA resulted in a higher overall efficacy rate compared to TAE (76.30% vs. 61.67%, P = 0.011), but was associated with significantly elevated postoperative alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (P < 0.001), indicating greater hepatocellular injury. Although ablation procedures were longer (P = 0.005), they were associated with reduced intraoperative blood loss (P = 0.010). TAE was linked to faster recovery, reflected in shorter hospital stays (P = 0.003). The MWA group experienced fewer overall complications, though hemolysis was uniquely observed in this cohort. The TAE group had higher rates of fever and ischemic events. Both groups showed improved quality of life post-treatment, with the MWA group demonstrating greater gains in physical functioning (P = 0.004). Patient satisfaction was comparable between groups. MWA and TAE are both effective treatment options for hepatic hemangioma, each with distinct advantages. MWA offers superior lesion control at the expense of greater hepatic stress, while TAE facilitates quicker recovery with a higher incidence of transient complications.",

The age at diagnosis ranged from 7 to 36 months (mean 16.00 ± 8.61 months). Bilateral involvement was observed in 10 patients, and unilateral in 5. Thirteen patients presented with leukocoria, while 2 were diagnosed during routine physical examinations due to vision loss. None of the patients had a family history of retinoblastoma. Whole-exome sequencing revealed heterozygous RB1 mutations in 14 cases and a mosaic mutation in one case. Five novel mutations not previously reported in the literature were identified: c.608-1G>A, c.1818T>A, c.962dupA, c.2086A>T, and c.574A>T. All patients received treatment, including intra-arterial chemotherapy, cryotherapy, photocoagulation, systemic chemotherapy, and/or enucleation. The follow-up duration ranged from 12 to 132 months, with a mean of 39.20 ± 24.07 months. Genetic testing remains a valuable tool for confirming RB1 mutations.

    "abstract": "To identify lipid metabolism associated biomarkers in colorectal cancer (CRC). To refine our list of candidate genes, we utilized the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) plug-in within Cytoscape software and performed protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis to extract hub genes centrally located within the networks, which potentially possess important regulatory functions. Hub gene-associated miRNAs and transcription factors (TFs) were analyzed using miRNet. Immunohistochemical staining was employed to verify the expression levels of hub genes in clinical CRC tissues. Concurrently, cellular experiments were designed to explore the functional roles of the hub gene DHCR7 at the cellular level, providing scientific evidence for the precision treatment of CRC. A total of 9008 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between CRC and control samples. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that these DEGs were mainly enriched in biological processes such as myogenesis, adipogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and fatty acid metabolism. Using Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), we found that the pink and yellow modules were most significantly associated with CRC. Cytoscape analysis identified six hub genes (DHCR7, FABP4, FASN, FAXDC2, PTGIS, SLC27A6). Their diagnostic performance was verified in the external GSE23878 dataset. Clinical studies showed a downregulation trend in the expression of FAXDC2 and PTGIS in CRC tissue samples, while FASN and DHCR7 were up-regulated in colon cancer tissues. However, the expression trend of FABP4 was inconsistent with previous bioinformatics predictions. Further cellular experimental results demonstrated that DHCR7 knockdown significantly inhibited CRC cell proliferation and induced apoptosis, which strongly supported the previous bioinformatics analysis. Our research successfully identified six hub genes in CRC through a series of rigorous analyses and experimental validations. These findings provide important molecular basis for further investigation into the pathogenesis and progression of CRC.",

A systematic analysis of clinicopathological transcriptome profiles of urothelial carcinoma patients reveals that dysregulated levels of LRRC15 are associated with tumor malignancy features and poor prognosis. A clinically based molecular simulation model highlights potential mechanisms whereby LRRC15 mediates urothelial carcinoma cell motility and growth, primarily through the extracellular matrix organization pathway. Further molecular interaction mapping identifies SCG5 as a novel molecule linking to LRRC15 via protein-protein interactions, positively correlating with advanced pathological features and worse prognosis in urothelial carcinoma patients. Kaplan-Meier plotter results indicate that the LRRC15/SCG5 axis can serve as a prognostic marker for low survival rates in both non-muscle invasive and muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Molecules affected by the LRRC15/SCG5 axis in bladder cancer and upper tract urothelial carcinoma contribute to signatures of poor prognosis in urothelial carcinoma. These findings support targeting the LRRC15/SCG5 axis as a potential therapeutic strategy to intervene in urothelial carcinoma progression.",

    "abstract": "Minimally invasive procedures are common in colorectal cancer (CRC) surgeries, but the impact of frailty on postoperative outcomes is unclear. This study aimed to assess how frailty status affects postoperative outcomes after minimally invasive CRC surgery. This study examined the impact of frailty on postoperative outcomes following minimally invasive colorectal cancer (CRC) surgery. Using data from the 2016-2020 U.S. National Readmission Database, the study included patients aged ≥ 60 years who underwent first-time minimally invasive (laparoscopic or robotic) CRC resection during hospitalization. Patients were categorized into low, intermediate, and high frailty risk groups based on the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS). Outcomes assessed included 90-day readmissions, in-hospital mortality, and complications. The analysis of 6,417 patients revealed that intermediate frailty was associated with higher in-hospital mortality (OR = 2.01), and high frailty had an even greater risk (OR = 3.83). Frailty also showed a dose-response relationship with complications, with the odds of complications being significantly higher in both intermediate (OR = 4.59) and high frailty groups (OR = 37.12). Only the high frailty group had an elevated risk of 90-day readmission (OR = 1.27). Certain subgroups, such as patients aged < 80, without diabetes or chronic kidney disease, with rectal tumors, and those undergoing robotic surgery, were particularly affected by frailty in terms of in-hospital mortality. The study highlights that higher frailty, as measured by the HFRS, is a strong predictor of adverse postoperative outcomes and early readmission in older patients undergoing minimally invasive CRC surgery, with especially notable effects in certain subgroups, possibly due to the greater surgical complexity or physiological burden in these groups.",

Dysregulation of the GPCRs has been associated to metabolic diseases, inflammatory and cancers, and making them key targets for therapeutic intervention. The structural characterization of GPCR-ligand interactions remains challenging due to the difficulty in obtaining complex structures. In this study, we chose CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), a member of the GPCR family, as the receptor and employed AlphaFold3 to predict the interaction sites between ligands and GPCRs. The results show that the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) region is crucial for CXCL12-CXCR4 interactions. Using this epitope-guided approach, we selected antibodies from a combinatorial library that bind to CXCR4 and block CXCL12 signaling. Two antibodies, C5 and F4, were found to inhibit CXCL12 signaling in reporter cell lines. Furthermore, these antibodies also exhibited antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against the acute T cell leukemia cell line and the B cell lymphoma cell line. This approach provides a promising way to develop effective antibodies for treating CXCR4-expressed cancer cells, as well as for other diseases linked to GPCR dysfunction.",

From a translational medicine perspective, Traditional Chinese Herbal Medicine (TCHM) offers promising integrative approach to bridge the experimental findings with clinical application, enhancing cancer treatment outcomes and mitigate drug resistance. In this study, we evaluated a TCM herbal formulation, Kang Ru (KR), comprising Artemisia argyi, Ohwia caudata, and Scoparia dulcis Linn, each traditionally and experimentally recognized for their potential therapeutic properties. We aimed to evaluate the anti-cancer effects of KR on breast cancer and its potential to enhance the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel. Using breast cancer cell lines we evaluated the effects of KR, both alone and in combination with paclitaxel on cell growth, viability, migration, and invasion. We further evaluated the potential of KR in enhancing paclitaxel to reduce tumor progression using a breast cancer xenograft model in mice. Our findings demonstrated that KR significantly inhibited cell growth and migration in breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, the combination of KR with paclitaxel demonstrated synergistic effects, effectively reducing cell viability, inducing cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell migration. In an animal model, the combination of KR and paclitaxel significantly enhanced breast cancer suppression, corroborating the in vitro findings. In conclusion, KR is a novel Chinese herbal formulation, with significant anti-cancer potential, enhancing paclitaxel's efficacy in inhibiting breast cancer progression. These findings suggest that KR could be a promising adjunctive strategy to improve breast cancer treatment and warrant further translational research to facilitate its clinical development as a complementary therapeutic option.",

A retrospective study was conducted on 549 PHC patients who underwent TACE at Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital, Naval Military Medical University from June 2020 to January 2024. Data on demographics, liver function, imaging findings, and TACE regimens were collected. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was employed to identify the independent risk factors for liver function impairment and PES. The predictive performance of these factors was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Among the 549 PHC, 61.93% (340/549) developed liver function impairment and 26.96% (148/549) experienced PES after TACE. ROC analysis indicated that alcohol consumption, cirrhosis, liver function grade, and TACE frequency demonstrated predicted value for liver impairment (AUCs: 0.565-0.619) and PES (AUCs: 0.581-0.656). Multivariate logistic regression identified neutrophils (OR=2.349, P=0.001), prealbumin (PA) (OR=1.674, P=0.028), liver function grade (OR=3.135, P<0.001), alcohol consumption (OR=0.296, P<0.001), cirrhosis (OR=0.528, P=0.005), and TACE frequency (OR=0.482, P=0.001) as independent predictors for liver impairment; For PES, alcohol consumption (OR=1.959, P=0.003), body mass index (BMI) (OR=0.288, P<0.001), albumin (ALB) (OR=0.384, P=0.005), PA (OR=0.288, P<0.001), and ECOG score (OR=0.527, P=0.006) were identified as the independent predictors, whereas liver function grade (P=0.287) and TACE frequency (P=0.634) were not.

We conducted a single-institute retrospective analysis on patients diagnosed with advanced EOC between January 2021 and January 2024. Clinicopathological factors, HR status, and PARPi use were evaluated for their association with survival outcomes. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified independent predictors of progression-free survival (PFS), and a nomogram was constructed and validated using bootstrap resampling. Among 128 patients, PARPi maintenance therapy was administered after front-line chemotherapy to 43 patients as indicated. Multivariate analysis identified optimal surgery [hazard ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27-0.83], CA-125 > 10.7 U/mL after front-line chemotherapy [hazard ratio 3.41, 95% CI 1.85-6.31], neoadjuvant chemotherapy [hazard ratio 2.55, 95% CI 1.32-4.91], and PARPi use [hazard ratio 0.22, 95% CI 0.12-0.42] as independent predictors of PFS.

The nomogram demonstrated strong predictive accuracy, with a concordance index of 0.78, and calibration plots showed excellent agreement. Internal validation confirmed the reliability of the nomogram. Our findings indicate that HR-deficient patients who respond well to upfront optimal debulking surgery and chemotherapy (indicated by a post-treatment CA125 level below 10.7 U/mL) may experience excellent PFS when followed by PARPi maintenance.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have emerged as key regulators in cancer progression, yet their specific roles in NSCLC are underexplored. This study identified hsa_circ_103089 as a novel circRNA upregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines through circRNA profiling using the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. We aimed to investigate its functional roles and molecular mechanisms in NSCLC progression and cisplatin (DDP) sensitivity. Using A549 and HCC827 cell lines, we assessed the effects of hsa_circ_103089 silencing on proliferation, migration, invasion, glycolysis, and DDP resistance via techniques such as dual-luciferase reporter assays, RNA pull-down, Western blotting, and in vivo xenograft models. Results revealed that hsa_circ_103089 silencing suppressed tumor cell malignancy and glycolysis while enhancing DDP sensitivity. Mechanistically, hsa_circ_103089 acts as a sponge for miR-876-5p, upregulating EGFR expression and downstream glycolysis-related genes (e.g., LDHA, HK2, GLUT1). In vivo, hsa_circ_103089 knockdown inhibited tumor growth and potentiated DDP efficacy in nude mice. Clinically, high hsa_circ_103089 expression correlated with poor prognosis in NSCLC patients.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between TACSTD2 (encoding TROP2) and PD-L1 expression through transcriptome analysis, immunohistochemistry, and single-cell RNA sequencing in lung cancer cell lines, tumor tissues, and immune cells, focusing on PC9 parental and drug-resistant variants. TACSTD2 expression strongly correlated with poor clinical outcomes, particularly in immunotherapy-treated patients (HR 1.71 for OS, 2.95 for PFS). Our transcriptome analysis revealed distinct resistance mechanisms involving MAPK signaling and immune receptor regulation pathways. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated significantly elevated TROP2 expression in tumor tissues compared to normal samples, with notably higher levels in PD-L1 positive specimens. We observed significant negative correlations between TACSTD2 expression and CD8+ T cell infiltration (Rho = -0.11, P = 1.44e-02), alongside positive correlations with cancer-associated fibroblasts (Rho = 0.094, P = 3.68e-02). Single-cell RNA sequencing identified two distinct cancer subtypes with differential TACSTD2 expression, while gene ontology analysis highlighted enrichment in cell adhesion and immune interaction pathways. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying TROP2 and PD-L1 interactions in LUAD, offering potential new diagnostic markers and therapeutic strategies through improved understanding of tumor microenvironment dynamics and resistance mechanisms.",

A total of 257 patients diagnosed with TET between January 2013 and April 2024 were retrospectively analyzed, with 181 cases from the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University served as the training cohort and 76 cases from the Second Affiliated Hospital used as an external test set. All patients underwent preoperative enhanced CT scans. After manual segmentation of the volume of interest (VOI), 1,038 radiomic features were extracted. Feature selection was performed using PCA and LASSO methods. Three models (clinical semantic, radiomics, and a fusion model combining both) were built using random forest algorithms. The fusion model achieved the highest performance in the external test set, with an accuracy of 0.908 and F1 score of 0.896 for histological subtype classification, and an accuracy of 0.803 and F1 score of 0.833 for WHO staging. The radiomics model shows slightly lower performance, while the clinical semantic model performs the weakest. Our findings suggest that machine learning models integrating radiomics and clinical features can effectively predict TET subtypes and stages, offering a non-invasive tool for accurate preoperative assessment with strong generalization ability.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzed cancer-specific systemic immune responses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from dogs with benign tumors, malignant tumors, and normal conditions. By examining gene expression patterns - particularly immune checkpoint and TNFRSF genes - the study aimed to assess the immune state of cancer PBMCs. Surprisingly, half of the tumor PBMCs exhibited downregulation of both immunosuppressive genes (Pdcd1, Ctla4, Tigit) and immune activation molecules (CD27, CD357), suggesting immune inactivity rather than suppression. Additionally, cytokine expression varied significantly, with upregulation of IL-18 and IL-7, despite their controversial roles in tumor progression. Analysis of T-cell exhaustion markers did not reflect established exhaustion signatures, implying a naive-like immune state. Instead, a distinct immune signature emerged, characterized by the broad downregulation of TNFRSF genes (TNFRSF18, TNFRSF14, TNFRSF6, and CD27). We designated this group as PI (PBMC-impaired). Deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data further revealed a significant reduction in CD4+ T cells and a lower CD4+/CD8+ ratio in the PI group. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway analyses linked CD4+ cell differentially expressed genes (DEGs) to regulatory T-cell differentiation, inflammatory responses, and key immune pathways (IL-2/STAT5, NF-kappa B). Notably, CD7, CXCL6, FASN, FLT3LG, LTB, and TNFRSF18 were significantly downregulated, marking a potential transcriptomic signature of systemic immune impairment. These findings suggest that immune dysfunction in the PI group is not solely attributable to conventional immune suppression but rather to a diminished immune activation state driven by reduced TNFRSF gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Prostate carcinoma (PC) is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among men in the United States, with over 160,000 new cases reported annually. While prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening has advanced the early detection and management of PC, its diagnostic accuracy, particularly in distinguishing malignant from benign conditions, remains controversial. Therefore, this study aimed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of early PC diagnosis by constructing a diagnostic model based on hematological indicators. Emerging inflammatory markers such as the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were incorporated to supplement traditional PSA testing. This study employed a retrospective design and included 317 patients receiving prostate puncture at Foshan Fosun Chancheng Hospital of Guangdong Medical University between January 2019 and January 2022 as the research subjects. These patients were grouped into two categories: 126 diagnosed with PC and 191 diagnosed with benign prostatic hyperplasia, based on histopathological examination of the biopsy samples. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from the electronic medical record system. Diagnostic markers for PC were screened by logistic regression and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The diagnostic performance of the model was evaluated using ROC and decision curve analysis. PSA, Neu, Mono, CRP, NLR, NAR, and CK-MB were identified as independent diagnostic indicators, effectively distinguishing PC from benign prostatic hyperplasia. The LASSO regression-based predictive model achieved an AUC of 0.850, significantly outperforming the traditional logistic regression model (AUC=0.792; P=0.042, Delong test), indicating superior diagnostic accuracy and model performance. In conclusion, the combination of traditional PSA testing and emerging inflammatory markers can significantly enhances early diagnostic accuracy for PC and the proposed model offers a promising approach for early detection and clinical decision-making.",

This study assesses the effectiveness of combining ablative stereotactic MRI-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (SMART) with chemotherapy for treating locally advanced and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. We retrospectively analyzed 235 pancreatic cancer patients treated between 2020 and 2023. Patients were divided into chemoradiation (SMART + chemotherapy, n = 106) and chemotherapy-only (n = 129) groups. Key outcomes included progression-free survival, overall survival, margin-negative resection rates, lymphovascular invasion, and toxicities. The chemoradiation group demonstrated improved PFS (8.30 ± 1.20 vs. 7.90 ± 1.30 months, P = 0.015) and OS (14.30 ± 2.60 vs. 13.50 ± 2.40 months, P = 0.015), with higher rates of margin-negative resections (92.45% vs. 80.62%, P = 0.009) and reduced LVI (37.74% vs. 52.71%, P = 0.022) compared to chemotherapy alone. However, acute toxicities, including fatigue and abdominal pain, were more frequent in the chemoradiation group. Locoregional control and distant metastasis-free survival showed no significant group differences (P > 0.05). Overall, SMART enhances local tumor control and survival outcomes in severe pancreatic cancer, albeit with increased acute toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Adenocarcinoma is the most common malignant tumor of the bile duct, originating from the mucosal epithelium. Surgical resection is typically recommended for biliary adenocarcinoma to achieve the best therapeutic outcome and prognosis. However, early detection and diagnosis remain significant global challenges. This paper presents a case of a 55-year-old female patient who was admitted to the Second People's Hospital of Nanning with complaints of dull pain in the right upper abdomen for 4 months and yellowing of the skin and sclera for the past half month. The patient was diagnosed as early well-differentiated biliary adenocarcinoma by probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE), biliary ultrasonography, choledochoscopy and biopsy. After pancreaticoduodenectomy, exploratory laparotomy, partial bowel resection, afferent loop and efferent loop anastomosis, the patient underwent surgery successfully. After 1 year of surgical treatment, no significant postoperative complications were found in the follow-up. There was no recurrence after operation and the patient made a full recovery. Bile duct adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor, and early screening, diagnosis and treatment are crucial for improving patient prognosis. In this case, early cholangiocarcinoma was detected by a combination of choledochoscopy, biliary ultrasound, and biliary confocal endoscopy. The tumor and surrounding tissues were completely removed through pancreaticoduodenectomy. The operation was successful and the patient recovered well. Confocal microendoscopy shows great promise in the early diagnosis of digestive tract diseases, owing to its high-resolution imaging capabilities and potential to detect early lesions.",

Microarray profiling analysis revealed hepsin (HPN) as a potential target gene regulated by T3/TR. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed that T3/TR upregulates HPN expression. Promoter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis further demonstrated that TR directly binds to the HPN promoter region (+506/+523), activating its transcription. Functional studies showed that ectopic expression of HPN significantly inhibited cell proliferation. Furthermore, HPN was found to be involved in T3/TR-mediated suppression of cell growth by modulating the expression of CDK2 and cyclin E1. Clinically, HPN expression levels were inversely correlated with CDK2 and cyclin E1 in HCC tissues. These findings establish a novel regulatory relationship among T3/TR, HPN, CDK2, and cyclin E1, highlighting their potential role in controlling liver cancer cell proliferation.",

This model aims to provide a theoretical foundation for individualized prediction of postoperative recurrence risk and support clinical decision-making. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from 614 patients with glottic laryngeal cancer who underwent surgery between April 2010 and December 2021. The study included inflammatory and immune-related indicators (such as NLR, PLR, PNI, IL-6, IL-8), alongside traditional clinical features like age, T stage, lymph node metastasis, and degree of differentiation. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression, as well as Cox regression analyses, were performed to identify factors associated with recurrence. A Nomogram model was constructed based on Cox regression results. The model's predictive performance was evaluated using ROC curves, the concordance index (C-index), and calibration curves, with validation conducted in both training and validation cohorts. Multivariate analysis identified age, T stage, lymph node metastasis, degree of differentiation, IL-6, IL-8, PNI, and PLR as independent factors influencing postoperative recurrence in patients with glottic laryngeal cancer. The Nomogram model demonstrated excellent predictive performance in both the training and validation cohorts, with AUCs for 12-, 24-, and 36-month recurrence-free survival predictions of 0.887, 0.906, and 0.915 (training cohort) and 0.895, 0.906, and 0.907 (validation cohort), respectively. The model's concordance indices were 0.860 and 0.857 in the training and validation groups, respectively. Calibration curves revealed a high degree of agreement between predicted and actual outcomes. The Nomogram model developed in this study integrates multiple clinical and inflammatory-immune indicators, enabling accurate prediction of 12-, 24-, and 36-month recurrence-free survival rates in post-surgical patients with glottic laryngeal cancer. The model holds significant clinical value, with IL-6, IL-8, and PNI identified as crucial indicators for predicting recurrence risk, providing valuable insights for postoperative follow-up and individualized treatment strategies.",

This study investigated the effects of integrating high-dose methotrexate with cisplatin and paclitaxel on survival outcomes in osteosarcoma patients, and to identify prognostic factors influencing these outcomes. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 208 osteosarcoma patients treated between January 2013 and December 2018. Patients were divided into two groups: standard chemotherapy group (SC, n = 104) and cisplatin + paclitaxel + high-dose methotrexate (CPM, n = 104). The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), while secondary endpoints included efficacy assessments. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to assess survival distributions, and statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 29.0. The CPM group demonstrated significantly longer PFS (16.85 ± 3.40 months vs. 15.72 ± 3.21 months, P = 0.015) and higher 5-year OS rates (54.81% vs. 40.38%, P = 0.037) compared to the SC group. Completion of chemotherapy and a response rate greater than 90% were identified as strong positive prognostic indicators. In contrast, pathologic fractures at diagnosis, lung metastases, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels were associated with poorer outcomes. Multivariate analysis underscored chemotherapy response and treatment adherence as independent survival predictors. The combination of cisplatin and paclitaxel with high-dose methotrexate significantly improves PFS and OS compared to standard chemotherapy.

Expression levels of PINX1 and interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 (ILF3) were assessed in NPC cells and tissues via western blotting and immunohistochemistry, and their correlation with patient prognosis was analyzed. The effects of ILF3 on NPC cell proliferation and cisplatin resistance were evaluated using cell cycle analysis, EdU incorporation, CCK-8, and IC50 assays. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence confirmed the interaction between PINX1 and ILF3, while qPCR and western blotting assessed their regulatory relationship. Bioinformatics analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and dual-luciferase assays were performed to identify transcription factors regulating PINX1. Additional in vitro experiments explored the antagonistic relationship between PINX1 and ILF3. Results showed that PINX1 expression was downregulated in NPC and associated with favorable prognosis, whereas ILF3 was upregulated and linked to poor outcomes. PINX1 physically interacted with ILF3 and promoted its ubiquitination through Speckle-type BTB/POZ protein (SPOP). Furthermore, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 suppressed PINX1 transcription, while PINX1 antagonized the oncogenic effects of ILF3. Mechanistically, PINX1 facilitated ILF3 degradation via SPOP, suppressed the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, inhibited tumor proliferation, and enhanced cisplatin sensitivity in NPC cells. These findings highlight the tumor-suppressive role of PINX1 and underscore its potential as a therapeutic target in NPC.",

Repurposing marketed non-cancer drugs in oncology is emerging as a fast-tracking approach to speed up the development of new treatment options, urgently needed for DMG. Repurposed anthelmintic mebendazole (MBZ) is in the spotlight against brain tumors, because it joins promising anticancer properties with high neuropenetrance, favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile. Although MBZ is undergoing Phase I/II trials against brain tumors, including DMG, MBZ anticancer properties and the underlying mechanisms of actions have poorly been characterized in DMG preclinical models. We found that MBZ robustly reduced cell viability in six out of seven DMG cell lines with either K27M-mutated or wild-type H3. All IC50 values (range 102 to 958 nM) fell in a clinically attainable range. The antiproliferative MBZ properties were mediated by an arrest of DMG cells in the G2/M phase with a concomitant upregulation of the key cell cycle regulators p21 and p27, whereas p53 upregulation and activation were cell context-dependent. At the same growth-inhibitory concentrations, MBZ triggered apoptotic cell death, as evidenced by higher levels of the apoptotic markers caspase-3 and PARP cleavage. Consistently, Annexin V-Propidium iodide (PI) double staining showed MBZ dose-dependent increase in both stages of apoptosis. Of interest, the combination of MBZ with the first-in-class imipridone ONC201 sinergistically increased the antiproliferative effects in two DMG cell lines as assessed by combination scores with different algorithms, showing additive effects in two others cell lines. Mechanistically, the combination potentiated the proapoptotic activity of either MBZ or ONC201, while not changing the cytokinetic perturbations induced by the single drugs. Finally, one pair of ONC201-sensitive and ONC201-resistant DMG cell lines with acquired resistance showed same responsiveness to MBZ with similar values of IC50 and Emax. In conclusion, MBZ demonstrates high growth-inhibitory/proapoptotic activity, chemosensitization property to ONC201 and the ability to overcome ONC201 resistance in DMG cell cultures, proposing as a new low-toxicity therapeutic for DMG, with a potential to be used in second-line treatment and/or in combination protocols.",

Growing evidence indicates that targeted therapy for CAF can influence tumor progression. Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) and artemether (ARM), semisynthetic derivatives of the natural compound artemisinin, have exhibited anticancer effects in various tumors. In this study, we found that tumor cells secreted platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), which stimulated fibroblasts to transition into the CAF phenotype (cell phenotype and secretory phenotype). CAFs promote Cal-27 cell proliferation by secreting lactate. We focused on the mechanisms by which DHA and ARM affect the tumor-stroma interactions. These findings demonstrated that DHA and ARM effectively suppressed the secretion of PDGF-BB from Cal-27 cells, maintaining the normal state of hOMF and preventing the proliferative effect on Cal-27 cells. These findings were confirmed in xenograft models. Our study showed that artemisinin derivatives prevent the progression of oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) by inhibiting the production of PDGF-BB in cancer cells to maintain the normal state of fibroblasts, thus providing a potential avenue for targeted OTSCC treatment.",

Multivariate analysis identified IO infusion as protective factor for lactate metabolism (HR=0.289, 95% CI: 0.092-0.864), while advanced age (HR=1.125), diabetes (HR=3.23), and low LA clearance (HR=0.016) were independent risk factor for mortality. Causal mediation analysis revealed that 6-hour LA clearance mediated 68% of the IO-associated mortality reduction (P<0.001), whereas diabetes history was not a significant mediator (P=0.156). Complication rates were comparable between groups (P>0.05). These findings indicate that IO infusion improves survival in AGIB due to gastrointestinal tumors by rapidly restoring hemodynamics and enhancing lactate metabolism. The mortality benefit is primarily driven by accelerated LA clearance rather than comorbidities like diabetes. Given its safety profile comparable to IV, IO infusion should be prioritized in critical care settings.",

We also explored the risk factors for HCC recurrence and mortality in this population of patients. This retrospective cohort study enrolled 238 ALD-related HCC patients underwent hepatectomy from 2011 to 2022 at the E-Da Hospital, I-Shou University. Data analyses were finalized on October, 2023. Alcoholism was defined as consuming over 20 g of ethanol each day for at least 5 years. Patients with HBsAg-positive or/and HCV-positive status were excluded. ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism was analyzed. The endpoint was HCC recurrence and overall mortality. Of the 238 patients enrolled, 196 (82.4%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 62.3 (10.2) years. HCC recurrence occurred in 70 patients, and 64 patients died. ALDH2 rs671 polymorphism was significantly associated with HCC recurrence and mortality. The 10-year cumulative HCC recurrence and mortality rates were significantly higher in patients with the ALDH2 rs671 genotype GA/AA relative to those with the ALDH2 rs671 genotype GG.

In NPC tissues and cell lines, the level of SNHG12 was significantly elevated, and high levels of SNHG12 were associated with advanced TNM staging, as well as increased cell viability and invasiveness. We further explored the mechanism by which SNHG12 promotes NPC progression and found multiple binding sites between SNHG12 and miR-30a-3p (miR-30a). The expression of miR-30a was significantly decreased in NPC tissues and cell lines, showing a strong negative correlation with SNHG12 levels. Moreover, SNHG12 could counteract the anti-cancer effects of miR-30a, enhancing the viability and migratory ability of CNE-2 cells. Further studies revealed that miR-30a could target and inhibit AKT3 levels, while SNHG12 could antagonize miR-30a and restore AKT3 levels. Thus, SNHG12 can regulate the malignant biological characteristics of NPC by targeting the miR-30a/AKT3 axis. In animal experiments, we found that APS can downregulate SNHG12 and upregulate miR-30a in tumor tissues, effectively suppressing NPC progression. Additionally, APS demonstrated significant antioxidant effects. Therefore, APS can inhibit oxidative stress and suppress NPC progression by targeting the SNHG12/miR-30a/AKT3 signaling pathway.",

The model will facilitate the initiation of early interventions for high-risk patients. This retrospective multicenter cohort study included BC patients from two hospitals in China who received NAC but did not achieve PCR. Four ML algorithms were utilized to construct models based on patients' clinicopathological data, followed by a performance evaluation of these models. To improve the interpretability of the model, the shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method was employed to analyze the contribution of each feature to the predictive outcomes. A total of 463 non-PCR patients were included in the study. Of these, 385 patients were from Ruijin Hospital, affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, and were randomly split into a training cohort and an internal validation cohort in a 3:1 ratio for model development and preliminary performance evaluation. In addition, 78 patients enrolled from Jiaxing Women and Children's Hospital were assigned to the external validation cohort to evaluate the model's generalizability. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses demonstrated that age, residual tumor size, Ki67 change, molecular subtype, and axillary lymph node metastasis were independent factors influencing DFS. Among the four ML models, the random survival forest (RSF) model showed the best performance, with a concordance index of 0.820 in the training cohort, 0.642 in the internal validation cohort, and 0.689 in the external validation cohort. Further analysis revealed that the RSF model had excellent discriminative ability with a high area under curve value, while its low Brier score indicated excellent calibration. Decision curve analysis indicated that the RSF model offered a higher clinical net benefit at various time points and effectively stratified risk, successfully identifying high-risk patients. SHAP analysis underscored residual tumor size as the most influential predictive feature. The RSF model can effectively predict DFS and risk of BC patients with non-PCR following NAC, offering a critical reference for developing individualized treatment strategies.",

A total of 210 NPC patients receiving IMRT and 160 healthy controls were enrolled. Baseline levels of PDGF-BB and coagulation markers were compared between groups. The association of PDGF-BB with clinical staging was analyzed, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess its diagnostic performance.

A total of 451 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, including 221 upregulated and 230 downregulated genes. Eleven apoptosis - related upregulated DEGs were selected for further analysis using three machine learning algorithms: random forest, logistic regression, and support vector machine.

Among the evaluated genes, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) consistently achieved an AUC > 0.8 in all three validation datasets and had a weighted sum rank > 10, meeting stringent selection criteria. In a CC mouse model, CDK2 expression was significantly elevated and positively correlated with squamous cell carcinoma antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen, vascular endothelial growth factor, and heparanase. siRNA-mediated knockdown of CDK2 reduced cell proliferation and migration while promoting apoptosis. Mice with high CDK2 expression showed significantly lower 4-week survival rates, indicating poor prognosis. This study identified CDK2 as a key apoptosis - related gene with strong diagnostic and prognostic value in cervical cancer. CDK2 promotes tumor progression and is associated with poor survival, suggesting its potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target for personalized treatment strategies in CC.",

Samples were collected from 133 patients with both COPD and lung cancer (Comorbidity Group) and 91 patients with COPD alone (COPD Group), diagnosed at Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University between January 2022 and January 2024. Baseline data from both groups were analyzed, and peripheral blood levels of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, and IL-33 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The levels of these inflammatory cytokines were compared between the two groups to assess their correlation with disease severity. Significant differences were observed between the Comorbidity Group and the COPD Group in terms of age (P<0.001), sex (P=0.012), duration of COPD (P=0.001), smoking history (P=0.006), glucocorticoid treatment (P=0.014), and GOLD Staging (P<0.001).

Patients were divided into two groups based on their total aesthetic outcome score: the satisfied group (score ≥27, n=87) and the dissatisfied group (score <27, n=41). Additionally, patients were categorized into recurrence (n=29) and non-recurrence groups (n=99) based on postoperative recurrence status. Results showed that age (OR=1.080, 95% CI: 1.015~1.149, P=0.015), tumor size (OR=1.625, 95% CI: 0.681~0.887, P<0.001), and tumor stage (OR1=0.007, 95% CI: 0.001~0.070; OR2=0.019, 95% CI: 0.003~0.145, P<0.001) significantly influenced aesthetic outcomes following surgical resection combined with eyelid defect reconstruction.

Although its physiological and pathophysiological roles in cancer are increasingly understood, the specific functions and molecular mechanisms of GDF15 in gallbladder cancer remain unclear and require further investigation. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to evaluate the expression of GDF15 in tissue samples from 57 patients with gallbladder cancer. The biological function of GDF15 and the molecular mechanism underlying this were further elucidated through knockdown experiments in NOZ and OCUG-1 gallbladder cancer cell lines. Our results demonstrate that there was a significant correlation be-tween high GDF15 expression and poor survival indicating a poor prognosis in individuals with gallbladder cancer. NanoString analysis results showed that VEGFA, a key angiogenic factor, was significantly upregulated in the GDF15 high-expression group. Moreover, GDF15 knockdown significantly reduced cell motility, as well as migration and invasion. Additionally, GDF15 knockdown in gallbladder cancer cells decreased VEGFA expression via the AKT/NF-κB pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that GDF15 contributes to the aggressive behavior of gallbladder cancer by promoting activation of the AKT/NF-κB pathway. These findings suggest that the GDF15 signaling pathway may represent a promising therapeutic target for gallbladder cancer treatment.",

Our findings indicate that ESRP1 is significantly up-regulated in breast cancer tissues and correlates positively with adverse clinical outcomes, particularly in estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer. In vitro experiments with cells demonstrated a dual regulatory mechanism: in ER-positive breast cancer cells, reduced expression of ESRP1 suppresses tumor cell proliferation but does not significantly affect tumor cell invasion and migration; conversely, in ER-negative breast cancer cells, ESRP1 hinders tumor progression by regulating the alternative splicing of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related genes. To investigate whether the presence of ER is a decisive factor in ESRP1's role, we treated ER-positive breast cancer cells with an ER inhibitor to induce EMT, followed by the knockdown of ESRP1, which further promoted the EMT process and enhanced the cells' invasive and migratory abilities. This study demonstrates that ESRP1 is a potential breast cancer prognostic marker with subtype specificity and its value as a molecular target needs to be accurately assessed in the context of breast cancer subtypes, as ESRP1 function may be highly dependent on the ER background.",

Resistance models were classified as 1) original site failure (OF), distant site failure (DF), and combined failure (ODF) based on the failure site or 2) oligo-progression (OP) and non-oligoprogression based on the disease progression (PD) pattern. Among the patients, 58.7% (n = 61 of 104) developed OF, while 25 (24.0%) and 18 (17.3%) developed DF and ODF, respectively. A high OP rate (76.9%, n = 80) was observed, with primary progression accounting for 30.8%. OF was related to sex (odds ratio = 3.961, 95% confidence interval: 1.629-9.631, P = 0.002). Over 50% of patients with third-generation EGFR-TKI treatment failure developed OF. Sex, central nervous system metastases, and disease stage influenced the resistance patterns of the EGFR-TKI therapy.",

    "abstract": "Previously, our group showed that mianserin, an atypical antidepressant, exerts stronger cytotoxicity against liver cancer cells than normal hepatocytes, supporting its potential application as a therapeutic agent for liver cancer. However, the anti-tumor effects of mianserin in vivo and its mechanisms are yet to be established. In this study, we explored the inhibitory effects and mechanisms of mianserin and evaluated its efficacy in combination with sorafenib against liver cancer cells. Effects on cell viability were assessed via MTT and flow cytometry assays and antitumor activity evaluated using a xenograft model. Changes in the expression and distribution of specific proteins within cells were examined via immunoblot assay. Our results indicate that mianserin exerts cytotoxic effects by inhibiting cell viability through suppression of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Therapeutic effects of mianserin were validated via intratumoral injection in the xenograft model. Mechanistically, our data indicate that mianserin-induced cytosolic HSP60 translocates to cell surface and participates in the downregulation of CCR9, leading to inactivation of the AKT-(β-catenin/NFκB) signaling pathway. Combination treatment with mianserin and sorafenib induced significant synergistic effects on cell viability, apoptosis, and in vivo tumor growth in both parental and sorafenib-resistant liver cancer cells. This study is the first to demonstrated that mianserin effectively limits the growth of liver cancer by downregulating CCR9, in turn, inactivating the AKT-(β-catenin/NFκB) pathway. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments highlight mianserin's potential as an adjuvant therapy to sorafenib, offering a promising strategy to overcome current challenges in liver cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors of the head and neck region. Plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1), a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), has been found to be overexpressed in multiple cancers, including OSCC. However, the upstream and downstream regulatory mechanisms through which PVT1 influences the malignant progression of OSCC remain to be further explored. In this study, PVT1 was confirmed to be overexpressed in OSCC tissues, and its roles in promoting OSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion were identified. RNA-sequencing was used to screen the candidate target genes of PVT1, among which serpin family B member 4 (SERPINB4) was the most downregulated. SERPINB4 promoted OSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In addition, mechanistic investigations demonstrated that PVT1 regulates SERPINB4 by sponging miR-185-5p in OSCC cells. Furthermore, SERPINB4 overexpression or miR-185-5p knockdown partly restores the decrease of OSCC cell proliferation and metastasis induced by PVT1 knockdown. Additional studies revealed that methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3)-mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification induced the upregulation of PVT1 by stabilizing its RNA transcript. In conclusion, elevated expression of PVT1 in OSCC is associated with poor prognosis and promotes tumor development. METTL3 promotes PVT1 stability through m6A deposition and upregulates its expression in OSCC, which could upregulate SERPINB4 by sponging miR-185-5p, and ultimately promoting OSCC growth and metastasis. These findings suggest that PVT1 could serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for OSCC.",

Clinical data, including demographic information, clinicopathological features, immunoinflammatory markers, and tumor markers, were collected. Survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and compared with the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify factors associated with overall survival (OS). Logistic regression was applied to predict 2-year mortality risk, and model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves, area under the curve (AUC), calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. By the end of follow-up, 183 patients had died (mortality rate: 59.80%). Univariate analysis showed that high neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), high platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), low lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), and elevated levels of CEA, CA125, and CYFRA 21-1 were significantly associated with worse prognosis (all P<0.001). Multivariate analysis identified high PLR (HR=1.94, P=0.041) and high CEA (HR=2.13, P=0.002) as independent risk factors, while high LMR (HR=0.52, P=0.043) was protective. A logistic model combining CEA, PLR, and LMR showed high predictive accuracy for 2-year mortality (AUC=0.926). Combined assessment of immunoinflammatory and tumor markers improves prognostic accuracy in NSCLC patients receiving first-line chemotherapy and may guide individualized treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "Elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) often have limited tolerance for standard therapies and experience reduced efficacy with lower-intensity treatments. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of single-agent chemotherapy combined with either microwave ablation (MWA) or radioactive iodine-125 seed ablation brachytherapy (RSABT) as first-line treatments, aiming to establish personalized, high-efficacy, and low-toxicity options for this vulnerable population. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 128 untreated elderly patients with advanced NSCLC from November 2013 to November 2023. 71 patients received RSABT plus chemotherapy, while 55 underwent MWA plus chemotherapy, with single-agent pemetrexed, docetaxel, or gemcitabine initiated 5-7 days post-procedure. Overall outcomes, including time to local progression (TTLP), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS), did not differ significantly between the RSABT and MWA groups. However, in patients with tumors ≥ 4 cm, the RSABT group demonstrated significantly longer TTLP (14 versus 8 months, P = 0.005) and OS (15 versus 11 months, P = 0.039). The MWA group exhibited higher rates of postoperative pectoralgia (58% versus 34%, P < 0.001) and pleural effusion (18% versus 4%, P = 0.013). Additionally, tumors located within 10 mm of the pleura in the MWA group were linked to increased pulmonary complications, including pneumothorax and bronchopleural fistula (odds ratio [OR] = 9.455, P = 0.041), whereas no such association was observed in the RSABT group (OR = 0.872, P = 0.79). In conclusion, combining single-agent chemotherapy with either MWA or RSABT is effective and safe for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC. RSABT demonstrated superior safety and efficacy compared to MWA for tumors ≥ 4 cm or those located within 10 mm of the pleura, making RSABT a more suitable first-line treatment option in these cases.",

Although lactate and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) are important for the development and progression of various tumors, their function in HCC progression remained largely unclear. The study aimed to identify molecular subtypes in HCC based on lactate metabolism and BCAA metabolism. Clustering 370 HCC patients revealed two distinctive subtypes associated with unfavorable prognosis. Differential expression analysis identified 941 DEGs in lactate metabolism subtypes and 518 in BCAA metabolism subtypes, primarily linked to tumor and metabolism pathways. Prognostic analysis identified 27 LRG-BCAA-DGEs inversely correlated with long-term survival across various cancers. Methylation analysis showed a negative correlation between methylation and mRNA expression of these genes, with limited impact on survival outcomes. NXPH4, dysregulated across tumors, exhibited complex associations with immune cells and prognostic implications in HCC. Functional analysis revealed DEGs associated with endodermal cell differentiation and metabolic pathways. NXPH4 knockdown suppressed HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target. Additionally, NXPH4 modulated glucose metabolism via the PI3K/Akt pathway. FOXK1 was identified as a potential transcriptional regulator of NXPH4, suggesting a regulatory axis in HCC tumorigenesis. The study highlights the molecular complexity of HCC, providing insights into potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",

The study included 756 patients with RAS wild-type mCRC who received cetuximab and chemotherapy as first-line therapy at multiple institutions in Taiwan from November 2016 to January 2021. After the prognoses of two age groups (≥ 70 and < 70 years) were determined, progression-free survival (PFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were regarded as the primary endpoints and severe adverse events (SAEs) were also compared. The median PFS and CSS were similar in the two age groups (14.0 vs. 14.0 months, P = 0.098; 32.0 vs. 35.0 months, P = 0.226, respectively). Subgroup analysis revealed similar PFS and CSS in the two age groups for patients with synchronous versus metachronous mCRC and left-sided versus right-sided tumors (all P > 0.05). In terms of hematologic SAEs, the incidence of grade 3 or more severe anemia was significantly higher in the older group (13.3% vs. 5.0%, P = 0.003). No significant between-group difference was found in the incidence of nonhematologic SAEs (all P > 0.05). According to our nationwide real-world registry data, older patients with RAS wild-type mCRC who are treated with first-line cetuximab-based chemotherapy may experience similar benefits to those experienced by younger patients. Significant differences between patients aged ≥ 70 and < 70 years were found for no hematologic and nonhematologic SAEs except grade 3 or more severe anemia. In summary, cetuximab is an effective therapeutic agent as first-line therapy for older patients with RAS wild-type mCRC.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are the first-line treatment for advanced EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite this, most patients experience tumor progression. The optimal immunotherapy (IO)-based strategy and its timing after EGFR-TKI failure remains under debate. A retrospective analysis was performed to assess the outcomes for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who were treated with either IO alone or in combination with chemotherapy (C/T) following disease progression. Data from January 2014 to December 2022 at Taipei Veterans General Hospital were reviewed. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to evaluate overall survival (OS) and time to treatment failure (TTF), while a Cox proportional hazards model evaluated the impact of clinical factors on survival. This study enrolled 107 patients with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC, all of whom had previously been treated with first- to second-generation EGFR-TKIs. The IO alone group included 33 patients, while 74 patients were in the IO combined with chemotherapy (IO+C/T) group. The median number of prior treatment lines before immunotherapy was 2. The IO+C/T group demonstrated a trend toward longer OS compared to the IO alone group (OS: 20 vs. 16 months, P=0.70). Patients with more than four lines of treatment before IO-based therapy had significantly worse OS (6 vs. 29 months, P<0.001) and TTF (2 vs. 5, P=0.018) than those less than 4 lines of treatment. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients who had undergone more than 4 lines of treatment before IO-based therapy had poorer OS (HR 2.21, 95% CI 1.16-4.21, P=0.01) and TTF (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.11-3.19, P=0.019) compared to those with fewer than 4 lines of treatment. The HRs for OS were 4.32 (95% CI 1.95-9.61, P<0.001) for patients with more than 4 lines of treatment and 2.05 (95% CI 1.04-4.05, P=0.038) for those with 2-4 lines of treatment, in comparison to patients who had 0-1 lines of treatment. This study highlights the potential benefits of early initiation of IO-based regimens in advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC following EGFR-TKI failure. Combination therapy with chemotherapy showed a trend toward improved survival compared to IO monotherapy, although not statistically significant. Moreover, poorer outcomes associated with multiple prior treatments underscore the importance of timely implementation of IO-based strategies to optimize clinical benefit in this patient population.",

Our analyses revealed melanocytes as the most acetylation-enriched cell population and identified a six-gene lactylation signature that stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct survival outcomes. Mechanistically, high-risk tumors demonstrated significant immunosuppressive features characterized by M2 macrophage accumulation and depleted CD8+ T-cell activity, corresponding to reduced sensitivity to certain chemotherapeutic drugs. Pathway enrichment studies implicated DNA repair, Hedgehog, and JAK-STAT signaling in driving the aggressive phenotype of high-acetylation tumors. Additionally, pseudotime trajectory analyses highlighted developmental shifts in gene expression related to lactylation during melanocyte differentiation. The signature demonstrated robust predictive accuracy in training, testing, and external validation cohorts. Functional validation confirmed the critical role of RAN in promoting proliferation and migration in vitro.

Moreover, they have been widely detected in human biological matrices such as blood, milk, et al. In view of this, it is particularly urgent to comprehensively evaluate the toxicological properties of TBBPS/TCBPA. In this study, in vitro experiments were carried out with cervical cancer cell models and normal cervical cell models. Comprehensive biochemical experiments were conducted to examine the effects of TBBPS and TCBPA on cervical cancer cells. Cell proliferation assays with CCK8 and EdU demonstrated that TBBPS and TCBPA enhance cervical cancer cell proliferation and enhance the expression of proliferation-related molecules. Subsequent research demonstrated that TBBPS/TCBPA enhance the secretion of inflammatory factors in cervical cancer cells, influencing cell proliferation. In the cervical epithelial cell model, our study revealed that TBBPS/TCBPA suppressed the proliferation of normal cervical epithelial cells. Mechanistic studies revealed that TBBPS/TCBPA treatment enhanced ds-DNA release, thereby activating the cGAS-STING signaling pathway and inhibiting cell proliferation. This study concludes that TBBPS/TCBPA exhibit dual effects by promoting cervical cancer cell growth while inhibiting normal cervical cell proliferation, which was mediated through the regulation of the inflammatory response. This study's findings will serve as a foundation for evaluating the potential health risks posed by TCBPA/TBBPS exposure.",

Ibrutinib benefits patients with ABC subtype DLBCL by inhibiting Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), but there are still a lot of patients who are resistant to Ibrutinib. In this study, we found that post-translational modification played a regulatory role in mediating Ibrutinib resistance in DLBCL. The expression of USP13 was significantly higher in Ibrutinib-resistant U2932 cells compared with Ibrutinib-sensitive WSU-DLCL2 cells, and its expression was further increased both in WSU-DLCL2 and U2932 after exposure to Ibrutinib. USP13 overexpression significantly promoted cell growth and decreased Ibrutinib sensitivity in DLBCL while knockdown of USP13 significantly increased Ibrutinib-induced apoptosis and improved the sensitivity to Ibrutinib. Further studies showed that USP13 interacted with FHL1 and stabilized the expression of FHL1 via deubiquitination, thereby mediating the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, resulting in the decrease expression of Bax and the increase expression of Bcl-xL, thus mediating Ibrutinib resistance in DLBCL. The results of immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue also indicated that the expression level of USP13 was negatively related to the prognosis of DLBCL patients. These new findings provided an experimental basis for overcoming Ibrutinib resistance in DLBCL and showed that USP13 is a potential therapeutic target and prognostic marker in DLBCL.",

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 520 prostate cancer patients who underwent RP between January 2016 and January 2024. Baseline characteristics, pathological data, laboratory parameters, and surgery-related factors were collected. Urinary continence status at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively was assessed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors, and nomograms were constructed to predict urinary incontinence risk at each time point.

At 6 months, shorter membranous urethral length (<14 mm) (OR=3.622, P<0.001), neoadjuvant hormone therapy (OR=5.783, P<0.001), and higher Gleason score (OR=2.824, P<0.001) were risk factors, while lower BMI (OR=0.317, P<0.001), smaller prostate volume (<40 mL) (OR=0.591, P=0.044), and lower CONUT score (<4) (OR=0.372, P<0.001) were protective. The nomograms showed good predictive performance, with AUCs of 0.679 at 3 months and 0.818 at 6 months. The developed nomograms effectively stratify the risk of urinary incontinence following RP in high-risk patients, facilitating individualized perioperative management and rehabilitation strategies.",

    "abstract": "To develop and validate a machine learning-based predictive model incorporating immuno-inflammatory biomarkers and clinicopathological parameters to predict recurrence risk in early-stage tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) patients. This retrospective study included 515 early-stage TSCC patients treatment at Xinyu People's Hospital between May 2014 and May 2019. Medical records and laboratory data were reviewed. Patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n=339) and a validation cohort (n=176). Feature selection was performed using LASSO, Xgboost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to identify key features associated with recurrence. A predictive nomogram was then built based on multivariate Cox regression analysis. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Recurrence was observed in 160 cases (31.07%), with 111 (32.74%) in training cohort (n=339) and 49 (27.84%) in the validation cohort (n=176). Machine learning algorithms identified several key risk factors for recurrence, including immuno-inflammatory markers (e.g., white blood cell count [WBC], platelet count [PLT], C-reactive protein [CRP], neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [NLR], systemic inflammation response index [SIRI], C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio [CAR]) and clinicopathological characteristics (e.g., pathological classification, chemotherapy status, tumor location). The nomogram achieved areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) of 0.902 (95% CI: 0.866-0.937) in the training set and 0.819 (95% CI: 0.759-0.876) in the validation set. Calibration curves demonstrated good predictive consistency (P=0.621). DCA showed a clear net clinical benefit across a wide range of thresholds probabilities (P<0.001). This predictive model, integrating immuno-inflammatory markers and clinicopathological features, exhibits excellent predictive performance for recurrence risk in early-stage STCC and offers substantial clinical utility.",

    "abstract": "Hyperglycemia contributes to recurrence, poor survival, and drug resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. Overexpression of G9a (euchromatic histone-lysine N-methyltransferase 2, EHMT2), together with decreased autophagy activity, has been implicated in promoting CRC tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Here, we demonstrate that high glucose (25 mM) enhances proliferation, focus formation, and migration of CRC cells, while concurrently suppressing autophagy activity. Importantly, pharmacological induction of autophagy increases CRC cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents (5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin) and attenuates high glucose-induced tumorigenic behaviors. Analysis of CRC patient specimens and data from the TCGA COAD database revealed that LC3, an autophagy marker, is elevated in tumor tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, and that high LC3 mRNA expression correlates with poor overall survival. Furthermore, enhancing autophagy via the autophagy inducer rapamycin significantly suppressed high glucose-induced tumor formation in a CRC xenograft mouse model. In addition, we identified niclosamide (NC), a repurposed antihelminthic agent, and its derivative niclosamide ethanolamine (NEN), as potential G9a inhibitors and autophagy inducers. NEN dose-dependently suppressed high glucose-activated oncogenic signaling pathways, including β-catenin, c-Myc, STAT3, G9a, and cyclin D1, while restoring autophagy activity. Collectively, our in vitro and in vivo findings strongly support that enhancing autophagy represents a multifaceted strategy to alleviate hyperglycemia, inhibit G9a-mediated signaling, increase chemosensitivity, and suppress high glucose-driven CRC tumorigenesis.",

A total of 101 patients with KRAS mutant metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treated in 3 oncology centers between 2013 and 2024 were included in this retrospective, multicenter study conducted in Turkey. Molecular analysis was confirmed by next generation sequencing (NGS; QIAGEN Clinical Insight Interpretation, United States). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) times between KRAS subgroups. KRAS G12C mutation was detected in 69 (68.3%) and KRAS non-G12C mutation in 32 (31.7%) patients. In both groups, the majority of patients were male (91.3% vs. 84.4%), smokers or former smokers (92.8% vs. 90.6%) and histologically had adenocarcinoma subtype (88.4% vs. 81.3%). There was no statistically significant difference in PD-L1 expression (21.7% vs. 34.4%, P: 0.132). In the KRAS non-G12C group, the most common mutations were G12V 15 (14.8%) and G12D 6 (5.9%). The most common co-mutation accompanying KRAS G12C mutation was TP53 (23%), while the most common co-mutation accompanying KRAS non-G12C was Rictor (36.3%). While 23 (33.3%) patients with KRAS G12C mutation developed brain metastasis, this rate was 14 (43.8%) in the KRAS non-G12C mutation group (P=0.312). Median follow-up was 15.30 (0.3-112.0) months. The objective response rate (ORR) with first-line treatment was 47.5% in the KRAS G12C group and 48.3% in the KRAS non-G12C group (P: 0.657). Median PFS was 4.46 (2.85-6.08) months in the KRAS G12C group and 5.23 (3.46-6.99) months in the KRAS non-G12C group (P: 0.852). Median overall survival was 14.46 (8.34-20.58) months in the KRAS G12C group and 15.36 (5.01-25.71) months in the KRAS non-G12C group (P: 0.201).

Favorable prognostic factors included younger age, better Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, lower Tumor-Node-Metastasis stage, absence of night shift work, regular work schedules, and greater exposure to natural light. Higher dietary polyphenol intake - primarily from fruits, vegetables, and plant-based foods - was significantly associated with improved treatment response. In contrast, disrupted cortisol rhythms and poor sleep quality predicted worse outcomes. Total polyphenol intake demonstrated strong predictive power (Area Under the Curve [AUC] = 0.847), as did cortisol rhythm disruption (AUC = 0.810).

Logistic regression revealed these four parameters as independent risk factors for DVT in lung cancer patients. The combined index yielded an AUC of 0.861, outperforming individual indicators (Caprini score 0.771, D-dimer 0.789, α angle 0.747, MA 0.725) in predicting DVT. Caprini score, D-dimer levels, α angle, and MA are independently associated with DVT occurrence and severity in lung cancer patients.

Despite multiple lines of prior systemic therapy, the patient achieved significant tumor shrinkage and durable disease control with a combination of PD-1 blockade and a HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), resulting in a progression-free survival (PFS) exceeding 10 months. Based on this case, we review the current landscape of immunotherapy and ADCs in mCRC, emphasizing the emerging potential of combination strategies for patients harboring rare molecular profiles such as HER2-positive, RAS-mutant MSS tumors. In addition, we discuss the importance of HER2 testing in CRC and the available diagnostic modalities, including immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and liquid biopsy. Given the heterogeneity of HER2 expression in CRC, optimizing testing strategies and treatment selection remains a critical research priority. This review underscores the need for large prospective studies and biomarker-driven trials to refine treatment approaches and improve outcomes in this challenging patient population.",

This study aimed to explore the methylation status of Paired Box Gene 1 (PAX1) and Steroidogenic Factor 1 (SF-1) as potential biomarkers for EC diagnosis and prognosis. A total of 110 EC patients and 75 non-EC patients, enrolled between January 2020 and January 2022, were retrospective analyzed using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) to assess the clinical utility of PAX1 and SF-1 methylation in diagnosis, prognosis, and recurrence surveillance. EC patients exhibited significantly higher PAX1 and SF-1 methylation levels compared to controls, with SF-1 methylation showing superior diagnostic efficacy (AUC = 0.735). PAX1 methylation was significantly associated with key clinicopathological features, including tumor differentiation grade (P = 0.001), FIGO staging (P < 0.001), and myometrial invasion depth (P = 0.030). It also showed a strong correlation with overall survival (OS) and cumulative incidence of recurrence (CIF) (P < 0.001). These results highlight the important role of PAX1 methylation in the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of EC. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified PAX1 methylation positivity as an independent risk factor for poor prognosis, whereas SF-1 methylation had limited prognostic impact. These findings highlight PAX1 methylation as a valuable biomarker for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and refining prognostic stratification in EC. In contrast, SF-1 methylation primarily contributes to diagnosis. Together, these results offer new insights into the development of personalized diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for EC.",

Although DFSP has a relatively high local recurrence rate, distant metastasis is rare. DFSP primarily occurs on the trunk and extremities but is seldom reported in the vulva. Due to its rarity, the clinical characteristics, pathological diagnosis, prognosis, and optimal management of vulvar DFSP remain poorly characterized. We retrospectively analyzed vulvar DFSP cases from our institution (January 2010 - January 2023). Clinical data and follow-up were obtained from hospital records, and imaging studies were reviewed via the picture archiving and communication system. Seven patients were included, with a median symptom-onset age of 44.3 years (range, 27-73). Patients typically presented with firm, asymptomatic masses. The labia majora was most commonly affected (n = 6, 85.7%). Tumor size averaged 4.3 cm (range, 2.0-6.5). All patients underwent excisional biopsy followed by wide local excision; none received lymphadenectomy. Surgical margins were documented in six patients, with negative margins achieved in five after initial wide excision. Over a mean follow-up of 27.3 months (range, 12-54), one patient (14.3%) experienced local recurrence. No recurrence occurred in patients with negative margins. Vulvar DFSP predominantly affects young and middle-aged women, manifesting as vulvar masses of variable size. Wide local excision is the primary treatment. While vulvar DFSP has a propensity for local recurrence, widely negative margins appear protective. Long-term follow-up is recommended to monitor for recurrence.",

Analysis of 135 paired tumor and adjacent tissues revealed significantly elevated CCDC78 expression in tumor tissues (P<0.001), and higher expression levels were associated with markedly lower 5-year survival rates (P=0.001). Time-dependent ROC curves demonstrated robust prognostic performance at 12, 36, and 60 months (AUCs of 0.85, 0.84, and 0.82, respectively). In vitro assays showed that CCDC78 overexpression significantly enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion (P<0.05), whereas siRNA-mediated knockdown suppressed these phenotypes and increased apoptosis (P<0.01). Cox regression analyses identified CCDC78 as an independent prognostic factor (P=0.02). Notably, despite similar baseline expression across CRC cell lines, SW480 cells were more sensitive to knockdown, while HCT116 cells more strongly recapitulated the overexpression phenotype. TCGA pan-cancer analysis showed upregulated CCDC78 in various tumors, including CRC, adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), bladder cancer (BLCA), and kidney renal clear cell carcinoma (KIRC), reinforcing its broad oncogenic relevance. Correlation analyses linked high CCDC78 expression to older age, poor tumor differentiation, advanced TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis. Immune profiling revealed negative associations with 11 immune cell types but a positive correlation with NK CD56 bright cells. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) implicated CCDC78 in interferon-JAK-STAT, RIG-I/NFκB, and WNT signaling pathways. Altogether, these findings suggest that CCDC78 promotes CRC progression through enhancing tumor cell aggressiveness and modulating the immune microenvironment, underscoring its potential as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Sedentary behavior is prevalent among the elderly and has become an increasingly serious public health issue. Although extensive research has been conducted on the status and risk factors of sedentary behavior in the general elderly population, the current situation and related influencing factors of sedentary behavior in elderly patients with ovarian cancer, a disease-specific group, have not been fully explored. In this study, a total of 206 elderly ovarian cancer (EOC) patients who received treatment at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine from September 1, 2022, to February 28, 2025, were selected as the research subjects by convenience sampling. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using the General Information Questionnaire, Chinese Adult Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire, Social Support Rating Scale, Nutritional Risk Screening 2002, and Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. The influencing factors of sedentary behavior in EOC patients were analyzed by the logistic regression model and CHAID decision tree model. Among the 206 EOC patients, the average sedentary time was 7.4±3.0 h/d, and 161 patients (78.2%) had sedentary behavior (sedentary time ≥5 h/d). Logistic regression analysis and CHAID decision tree algorithm both demonstrated that social support and cancer symptom burden were the influencing factors of sedentary behavior in EOC patients (P<0.05). Moreover, the Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) algorithm further revealed an interaction between the two factors, indicating that the social support level was the most crucial determinant. Our study reveals that sedentary behavior among EOC patients is alarmingly prevalent, necessitating urgent attention from medical professionals. Given the significant impact of social support and cancer symptom burden on this sedentary behavior, healthcare providers should proactively assess and intervene to address these influential factors, thereby mitigating the adverse consequences of excessive sedentary time for EOC patients. Decision tree and logistic regression models effectively identify sedentary behavior determinants with good predictive power. A combined approach is recommended to leverage their complementary strengths, providing a robust basis for reducing sedentary behavior in EOC patients.",

This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 320 patients who underwent curative resection for Stage II-III rectal cancer between January 2020 and January 2025. Of these, 162 received NOSES and 158 underwent TLS. Perioperative outcomes, postoperative recovery, complications, disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS), recurrence and metastasis rates, and quality of life were evaluated. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify independent prognostic factors for long-term outcomes. Compared with TLS, NOSES resulted in shorter operative times and less intraoperative blood loss (both P < 0.001). Patients in the NOSES group experienced faster return of bowel function and shorter hospital stays (both P < 0.001). At five-year follow-up, NOSES was associated with significantly improved DFS (P = 0.014), OS (P = 0.009), and higher quality of life scores (P < 0.001). The NOSES group also exhibited fewer postoperative complications and a lower incidence of distant metastasis (P = 0.034). Multivariate analysis identified NOSES as an independent predictor of improved long-term survival and quality of life. NOSES offers significant advantages over TLS in the management of Stage II-III rectal cancer, including enhanced operative efficiency, accelerated recovery, reduced complications, and superior long-term oncological outcomes and quality of life. These findings support the wider clinical adoption of NOSES as a preferred minimally invasive surgical approach in eligible rectal cancer patients.",

In this retrospective cohort study, 580 ICU patients with solid tumors and AKI were enrolled and stratified into a CRRT group (n = 300) and a non-CRRT group (n = 280). CRRT was initiated within 12 hours of ICU admission in patients meeting Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes stage 3 criteria. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to balance baseline characteristics. Primary outcomes included AKI remission, metabolic stabilization, and 90-day survival. Multivariable logistic regression and XGBoost machine learning were used to identify prognostic factors and build predictive models. After PSM, baseline characteristics were well balanced. CRRT significantly improved renal and metabolic parameters within 72 hours, including reductions in serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and lactate (all P < 0.001), with a trend toward increased urine output. The CRRT group had higher AKI remission (64.54% vs. 49.65%, P < 0.001) and 90-day survival rates (47.52% vs. 39.01%, P = 0.012), albeit with greater dialysis dependence (19.15% vs. 0.00%, P < 0.001). Adverse events were comparable. XGBoost models achieved AUCs of 0.78 and 0.75 for mortality and AKI remission, respectively. CRRT improves renal recovery, metabolic status, and survival in critically ill cancer patients with AKI, with an acceptable safety profile.

Identifying reliable biomarkers for recurrence risk is essential for improving post-surgical management. This study investigated the prognostic significance of systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) in predicting recurrence after radical surgery for stage I/II endometrial cancer. This retrospective cohort study analyzed 950 patients who underwent radical surgery for stage I/II endometrial cancer between March 2015 and October 2024. Patients were classified into recurrence (n=95) and non-recurrence (n=855) groups. The predictive value of LMR and SII was assessed using logistic regression. Predictive accuracies were evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC). Additionally, an external validation cohort consisting of 495 patients, who met the same inclusion criteria, was used to further validate the predictive model. LMR and SII were significantly associated with cancer recurrence. High SII and low LMR were predominantly observed in the recurrence group, demonstrating substantial predictive power. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that LMR was the strongest independent predictor of recurrence (OR=1.795, 95% CI, 1.417-2.274). The combined model of LMR and SII achieved an AUC of 0.876, highlighting its excellent predictive performance.

    "abstract": "Epigenetic modifications, particularly RNA methylation, play a crucial role in cancer progression, and N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most prevalent mRNA modification in eukaryotes. Wilms tumor 1-associated protein (WTAP), a key component of the m6A methyltransferase complex (MTC), regulates m6A modification, influencing RNA stability, translation, and degradation. WTAP dysregulation has been implicated in various malignancies, with particularly significant roles observed across the digestive system cancers, including but not limited to esophageal, gastric, pancreatic, gallbladder, hepatocellular, and colorectal carcinomas. Overexpression of WTAP is frequently associated with poor prognosis, advanced tumor stages, and increased metastatic potential. This review highlights the multifaceted roles and regulatory network of WTAP in digestive system cancers (DSCs) progression, encompassing tumor cell proliferation, migration, invasion, drug resistance, and immune evasion. Targeting WTAP may offer novel therapeutic strategies for overcoming therapy resistance and improving clinical outcomes in digestive system malignancies. Future research should prioritize: (1) validation of these findings in larger, multicenter, and ethnically diverse patient cohorts; (2) comprehensive elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying WTAP-mediated regulation in cancer biology; and (3) systematic exploration of its functional consequences in tumor progression and therapy resistance.",

Patients were divided into two groups: the intervention group (n = 43) who received laser photocoagulation and the control group (n = 37) who underwent cryotherapy. Visual acuity, angioma characteristics, lesion reduction success, and other clinical parameters were assessed in both groups. The laser-treated group demonstrated better visual outcomes than the control group, with significantly lower LogMAR values (P < 0.001). Additionally, fewer recurrences of retinal angiomas occurred in the laser-treated group, with a significantly longer time to recurrence compared to the control group (P = 0.014). The incidence of adverse ocular events, including retinal hemorrhage (P < 0.001), macular edema (P < 0.001), and visual field defects (P < 0.001), was significantly lower in the laser-treated group. Multivariate regression analysis further confirmed that laser photocoagulation (B = 0.997, P < 0.001) was a significant factor for long-term visual outcomes in patients with VHL syndrome, with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.369 (95% CI: 0.200-0.682).

To address these challenges, we introduce AlphaPPIweb, a comprehensive web-based platform designed to leverage AlphaPulldown, an AlphaFold-Multimer-based tool, for predicting protein complex structures. Users simply input amino acid sequences, after which AlphaPPIweb generates three-dimensional structural predictions, provides confidence scores, and presents results through intuitive visualizations. The platform facilitates the prediction of interactions between a single bait protein and multiple candidate proteins, thus aiding in the identification of potential ligand-receptor interactions. Furthermore, AlphaPPIweb incorporates automated interface residue analysis immediately following structure prediction, streamlining the workflow and providing comprehensive insights into the predicted complexes. This integrated approach significantly enhances the usability of AlphaPPIweb for biomedical studies and educational applications. By democratizing access to advanced structural prediction tools and enabling a comprehensive analysis of protein interactions, AlphaPPIweb promotes extensive exploration and understanding within the biological research community.

HER2 has become a crucial target in cancer treatment, and the discovery of effective HER2-targeted therapies marked a significant milestone in treating HER2-positive cancers. This led to the approval of trastuzumab, the first HER2-targeted monoclonal antibody. Later, trastuzumab was used to develop antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) for breast cancer, which have shown promising results. ADCs are combined trastuzumab with a cytotoxic drug to improve effectiveness while reducing side effects. Two ADCs, trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), have been approved by the FDA for treating HER2-positive breast cancer. However, drug resistance has become a serious issue, reducing the long-term success of these treatments. This review explores key mechanisms of ADCs resistance including alteration in HER2 expression, antibody and payload-related resistance, altered cell signaling, impaired lysosomal and intracellular activity, and tumor microenvironment. By analyzing recent studies in ADCs resistance, this review provides an insight into ADC resistance mechanisms and potential strategies for improving therapeutic outcomes HER2 positive breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Liver fibrosis is the natural stress response of the liver to injury and a critical intermediate stage in the progression of most liver diseases. Here, we first demonstrated via a retrospective clinical study that the incidence of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was significantly higher in patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) than in those with hepatolenticular degeneration (HLD). Further analyses involving micro RNA (miRNA) and proteomics were conducted to investigate the distinct mechanisms underlying liver fibrosis induced by HBV and HLD. Results showed significant changes in metabolic pathways and molecules, especially in AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Hippo signaling pathways, which play crucial roles in cellular glucose and lipid metabolism. Characteristic of HLD is a mutation/deletion in the ATPase Copper Transporting Beta (ATP7B) gene. Subsequent studies indicated that the knockdown or overexpression of ATP7B mutants activates the AMPK and Hippo signaling pathways, resulting in the inhibition of proliferation and transformation of HCC cells. AMPK phosphorylation indicates the presence of metabolic stress. Thus, this finding might partly explain why patients with HLD-related liver fibrosis are more likely to develop liver failure rather than HCC, providing new insights into the intricate mechanisms linking metabolic orchestration and tumor development.",

    "abstract": "TROP2 overexpression was reported to predict poor prognosis and increased metastatic potential. This study evaluates TROP2 expression in brain metastases from diverse solid tumors and its consistency with primary tumors, addressing the limited research on TROP2 heterogeneity and its implications for CNS-targeted therapies. TROP2 immunohistochemical staining was performed on 61 brain metastatic tumors and 14 corresponding primary tumors. Based on TROP2 expression, cases were categorized into three groups: diffuse positive (> 95%), focal positive (0-95%), and negative (0%). Among the 61 brain metastatic tumors, TROP2 expression was diffusely positive in 62.3%, focally positive in 16.4%, and negative in 21.3%. Diffuse TROP2 positivity was most observed in tumors of lung origin, while focal positivity was predominant in colorectal metastases. In terms of pathologic diagnosis, adenocarcinoma was the most common type, with 55.6% showing diffuse positivity, 33.3% showing focal positivity, and 11.1% showing negativity. Notably, all cases of invasive breast carcinoma of no special type (IBC-NST) exhibited diffuse TROP2 positivity. No significant association was found between TROP2 expression levels and post-CNS metastasis survival. In the paired analysis of 14 cases with both primary and metastatic tumors, TROP2 expression was consistent between primary and metastatic sites in 78.6% of cases. However, 21.4% of cases, including colorectal adenocarcinoma and kidney clear cell carcinoma, showed discordant expression patterns between the primary and metastatic lesions. In conclusion, this study demonstrated variable TROP2 expression in brain metastasis samples and confirmed high consistency of TROP2 expression between primary and brain metastatic lesions.",

We studied 421 patients with breast cancer diagnosed at our hospital who had an abdominal CT scan. Abdominal fat distribution, including visceral, subcutaneous, and total fat amounts in mm2, and paraspinal muscle density (psoas, erector spinae multifidus, and total muscle density) were measured using CT scans. Analysis was performed to assess the association between participants' medical information obtained from electronic medical records (EMR), abdominal fat tissue distributions, paraspinal muscle tissue densities, and triple-negative and non-triple-negative breast cancer. Visceral obesity and the ratio of visceral to subcutaneous fat tissue were found to increase the risk of triple-negative breast cancer in women (OR = 1.89 [95% CI = 1.23-2.94]) and (OR = 9.09 [95% CI = 5.55-14.28]), respectively. Regression analysis based on body composition also revealed an association between low fat and low muscle mass and triple-negative breast cancer (OR = 10 [95% CI = 5.55-20]). Our findings demonstrate a clear association between triple-negative breast cancer and abdominal fat distribution and visceral-to-subcutaneous fat ratio, suggesting that abdominal fat distribution is a useful indicator of triple-negative breast cancer risk factors.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based combination therapies, such as dual ICI therapy or ICI plus vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, are recommended as first-line treatment for advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). ICI-based combination therapy has improved the prognosis of patients with aRCC compared with the era of VEGF inhibitor monotherapy. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the prognosis and metastasis of several cancers, and extracellular vesicle (EV)-derived lncRNAs play important roles in tumor progression and metastasis, serving as prognostic biomarkers. The lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 is highly expressed in RCC and is associated with poorer prognosis in patients with elevated expression levels. This study aimed to investigate the function of lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 in RCC and explore whether serum-derived EV lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 serves as a prognostic biomarker in patients with aRCC. Firstly, we examined lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 expression in RCC and normal kidney tissues with pathologically confirmed RCC at our institution. We also performed a functional analysis of lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 in RCC cell lines. Additionally, we analyzed the relationship between the EV lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 expression and the prognosis of 47 patients with aRCC treated with ICI-based combined therapy. We observed higher lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 expression in RCC tissues than in normal tissues. Furthermore, AGAP2-AS1 knockdown in RCC cells using small interfering RNA significantly decreased cell viability, invasion, and migration. Patients with progressive disease (PD) receiving ICI-based combination therapy exhibited significantly higher expression of the EV lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 than patients without PD. We then classified 47 patients into two groups by median lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 expression. Notably, the high-expression group exhibited significantly worse progression-free survival and overall survival than the low-expression group (log-rank P = 0.0193 and log-rank P = 0.0256, respectively). In multivariate analysis, high EV lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 expression was an independent risk factor for disease progression (hazard ratio = 3.6, P = 0.0287). Overall, high EV lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 expression was associated with poorer prognosis in patients with aRCC. Therefore, serum-derived EV lncRNA AGAP2-AS1 may be an effective non-invasive prognostic biomarker in patients with aRCC treated with ICI-based combination therapy.",

Current studies have revealed that dysregulated circRNA expression is intricately related to the onset and advancement of multiple malignancies. Here, the function and associated mechanism of hsa_circ_0002669 in gastric cancer (GC) was investigated. Results revealed a significant reduction of hsa_circ_0002669 in GC tissue samples, relative to adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, Helicobacter pylori infection was identified as a factor contributing to the decreased levels of hsa_circ_0002669 in GC. Functional experiments indicated that overexpression of hsa_circ_0002669 greatly suppressed GC cell growth, migration, and invasion, whereas its knockdown produced the opposite effects. Studies using subcutaneous tumor implantation and intravenous tail vein injection models in immunodeficient mice demonstrated that elevated hsa_circ_0002669 levels significantly attenuated tumor growth and lung metastasis. Mechanistic studies showed that hsa_circ_0002669 functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), sequestering miR-223-3p, thus upregulating ARID1A, a key target of miR-223-3p. Furthermore, the tumor-promoting effects of hsa_circ_0002669 knockdown were partially counteracted by inhibiting miR-223-3p. These findings demonstrate the potential of hsa_circ_0002669 as a novel diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for GC.",

Immunohistochemistry showed higher USP14/UCHL5 expression in chondrosarcoma than in normal cartilage controls. In vitro, bAP15 increased Annexin V/PI-positive apoptosis and cleavage of caspase-3/PARP. Under our experimental conditions (low sub-micromolar exposure, 24-48 h), bAP15 led to a predominant accumulation of cells in G1, accompanied by p21 upregulation and reduced PCNA and phospho-histone H3. bAP15 was associated with lower phosphorylation of AKT/ERK and with the induction of ER-stress markers (GRP78, CHOP, IRE1α, caspase-4). In vivo, bAP15 suppressed xenograft growth.

    "abstract": "The chronic liver injury caused by diverse etiologies provokes abnormal compensatory proliferation and contributes to hepatocarcinogenesis. Oxidative stress (OS) is an independent etiology which induces cell injury and triggers oncogenes activation and tumor suppressor genes dysfunction. Cytoglobin (CYGB) is a member of the human hexacoordinate hemoglobin (HHB) family and functions as a dynamic antioxidant enzyme. We previously reported that CYGB decreases the intracellular ROS/RNS level and inhibits HCC proliferation and stemness under normal oxidative level. In this study, we observed that CYGB is decreased in HCC tissues, particularly in tumors with p53 mutations. Its deficiency is associated with advanced stage, elevated Ki-67 proliferation index, and predicts a worse prognosis in HCC patients. Ectopic CYGB expression attenuates malondialdehyde (MDA) level and AST/ALT release, as well reduces apoptosis and subG1 percentage and simultaneously induces G1 arrest in pre-H2O2-treated HCC cells. In addition, CYGB expression inhibits HCC proliferation and inactivates AKT and ERK kinases, the regulative effect can be interfered by necrostatin-1 and Z-VAD-FMK. Furthermore, U0126, the MEK1/2 inhibitor, can block the regulation of CYGB upon AKT/ERK/CyclinD1 axis, as well interfere with CYGB-induced proliferative inhibition in pre-H2O2 treated HCC cells, whether necrostatin-1 and Z-VAD-FMK presence or not. In conclusion, CYGB controls oxidative damage-associated molecule patterns and functions as a tumor suppressor, its restoration may provide a therapeutic target against HCC with aberrant OS response.",

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients were retrospectively enrolled and categorized into two groups: a cancer-related ischemic stroke (CRIS) group (n = 41) and a non-cancer ischemic stroke group (NC-IS) (n = 213). Baseline characteristics were balanced using 1:1 propensity score matching, adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities, resulting in 41 patients per group. Serum levels of 13-(S)-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid [13-(S)-HODE] and nine routine laboratory indicators were measured. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression identified CRIS-associated indicators. Independently associated indicators were evaluated using ROC curve analysis. Additionally, cancer patients without stroke (CNSP, n = 40) and healthy controls (NC, n = 41) were matched to compare routine indicators. Respiratory (34.1%) and digestive (29.3%) cancers were the most common in CRIS patients. Stroke occurred within six months of cancer diagnosis in 36.6% of patients, and 75.6% had multifocal cortical-subcortical infarctions. Multivariate regression confirmed that decreased red blood cells (RBCs) (OR = 0.444, 95% CI: 0.205-0.961), elevated D-dimer (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.67-3.48), and decreased 13-(S)-HODE (OR = 3.20, 95% CI: 1.92-5.33) were independent risk factors for CRIS.

To date, countermeasures to prevent 5-FU cardiotoxicity are lacking. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that short-term, moderate-intensity exercise completed before 5-FU administration would prevent 5-FU-induced alterations in vascular and cardiac function. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to sedentary control (SEDCON, n = 9), sedentary 5-FU (SED5FU, n = 10), exercise control (EXCON, n = 8) or exercise 5-FU (EX5FU, n = 8) groups. Rats remained sedentary or completed 4-days of treadmill running (20-25 min, 20 m/min, 5% grade) with the final bout ending ~90-min before treatment with a clinically relevant dose of 5-FU (50 mg/kg bolus + 265 mg/kg 2-hr infusion) or volume matched saline. Echocardiographic indices of left ventricular function and Doppler measurements of aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV) were completed at baseline (BL) and after the 2-hr (2-hr) infusion. 5-FU did not induce changes in left ventricular function. PWV increased from BL to 2-hr in SED5FU (BL: 396 ± 39 cm/s; 2-hr: 452 ± 54 cm/s; P = 0.002), but not SEDCON (BL: 417 ± 55 cm/s; 2-hr: 392 ± 64 cm/s; P = 0.35), EXCON (BL: 408 ± 35 cm/s; 2-hr: 410 ± 46 cm/s; P > 0.99), or EX5FU (BL: 398 ± 13 cm/s; 2-hr: 417± 23 cm/s; P = 0.67). Additionally, PWV at the 2-hr time point was significantly higher in SED5FU compared to SEDCON (P = 0.002). These findings suggest that moderate-intensity exercise preconditioning may protect against 5-FU-induced alterations in arterial PWV-potentially mitigating early signs of cardiotoxicity. Future studies are warranted to identify the mechanisms of 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity and the feasibility and efficacy of pre-treatment exercise regimens in human patients.",

    "abstract": "Y-chromosome AZFc deficiency, which includes the DAZ gene family, is one of the most common genetic causes of severe male infertility. Epidemiological and molecular evidence suggest a developmental link between abnormalities in germ cell development and testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT), but whether and how DAZ deficiency is associated with TGCT susceptibility remains unclear. Using a specific human embryonic stem cell (hESC) model, we constructed and characterized a DAZ-deleted cell line (SKLRMe001-A) and compared its efficiency of induction into human primordial germ cell-like cells (hPGCLCs) with that of the H1 control line. We assessed intersections between embryonic-like networks and HMGA1-P53-MAPK/PI3K pathways to explore the potential connection between DAZ deficiency and TGCT susceptibility. DAZ deficiency significantly reduced hPGCLC induction efficiency and downregulated early lineage markers such as SOX17, BLIMP1, and TFAP2C, accompanied by S-phase shortening, cell cycle dysregulation, and increased apoptosis. RNA sequencing and enrichment analyses indicated sustained upregulation of HMGA1 and pointed to dysregulated homeostasis of P53 stress responses and PI3K/AKT and MAPK signaling axes. These findings are consistent with features of TGCT, including maintenance of embryonic-like programs, activation of proliferative signals, and heightened DNA damage responses. Therefore, we propose that lineage differentiation defects and mismatches between stress and survival signaling caused by DAZ deficiency may produce in vivo a population of \"undifferentiated and susceptible\" cells that increase the risk of TGCT, while also explaining the developmental basis of male infertility. Using a human in vitro model, this study links DAZ deficiency to both infertility and TGCT susceptibility and identifies HMGA1 as a central transcriptional-signaling hub. This finding provides molecular clues for risk stratification and early surveillance in populations with DAZ deficiency and suggests that interventions targeting HMGA1 and the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways may simultaneously improve germline differentiation and reduce potential tumor risk.",

    "abstract": "This study compared the clinical efficacy of ketamine and sevoflurane in anesthetic management for pediatric intracranial tumor surgery, focusing on perioperative hemodynamics, inflammatory and stress responses, endotoxin (ET), nitric oxide (NO), oxidative stress, and postoperative recovery. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 229 pediatric patients who underwent intracranial tumor resection between June 2022 and August 2024, of whom 122 received ketamine anesthesia and 107 received sevoflurane. Propensity score matching was applied, yielding 62 patients in each group with balanced baseline characteristics. Perioperative indicators, including mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), epinephrine, cortisol, ET, NO, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malondialdehyde (MAD), were assessed at five timepoints (T1-T5). Postoperative outcomes included visual analogue scale (VAS) scores, Ramsay sedation scores, Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scores, emergence time, surgical duration, and adverse events. Results showed that the ketamine was associated with significantly lower MAP at T3-T4 but higher MAP at T5, and with consistently lower HR at T3-T5 compared with the sevoflurane (all P<0.01). Levels of CRP, IL-6, TNF-α, epinephrine, and cortisol were significantly lower in the ketamine group at T3-T5, suggesting reduced inflammatory and stress responses, while ET and NO levels were higher at T2-T4. Oxidative stress markers (SOD and MAD) were also lower in the ketamine group at T3-T5, indicating stronger antioxidant properties. In contrast, the sevoflurane group demonstrated lower VAS scores at 1-24 h, higher Ramsay scores at 6-24 h, and lower PAED scores at 30 min-3 h (all P<0.05), reflecting better postoperative analgesia, sedation, and reduced agitation. Emergence time was significantly longer in the ketamine group (P<0.001), though surgical duration and incidence of adverse events showed no significant difference between groups. In conclusion, ketamine provides superior intraoperative hemodynamic stability and reduces inflammatory, stress, and oxidative responses, whereas sevoflurane offers better postoperative analgesia, sedation, and recovery. Individualized anesthetic selection is recommended based on patient and surgical characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Resistance to radiotherapy remains a significant challenge in the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). However, the mechanism underlying radioresistance in GBM cells are not fully elucidated. Autophagy has been implicated in supporting cancer cell growth and contributing to therapeutic resistance. Mammalian Ste20-like kinase 1 (MST1) exhibits variable expression patterns across a range of neoplasms, yet its role in modulating GBM radiosensitivity remains unclear. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) disclosed that the correlation between MST1 level and patient survival varied across different cancer types. Notably, MST1 expression was decreased in the majority of tumors examined, including GBM, compared with normal tissue. A radiation-resistant GBM cell line (U87-IR) was established through sequential irradiation and observed significant downregulation of MST1 in U87-IR cells. Overexpression of MST1 increased the production of radiation-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), impaired mitochondrial function, and promoted apoptosis by suppressing autophagy. Collectively, these results suggest that reduced MST1 expression enhances the survival of radiation-exposed GBM cells. Overexpression of MST1 inhibits autophagy and promotes apoptosis, thus enhancing the radio-sensitivity of GBM.",

We conducted a pilot study to investigate chemotherapy followed by the addition of nivolumab in metastatic PDAC with limited tumor burden. A single cycle of gemcitabine (850 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8) and S-1 (60-100 mg/day on days 1-12) was administered. Patients who had achieved control of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) (a decreased level of CA 19-9 or <10% increased level of CA 19-9 comparing to baseline) were provided adding-on nivolumab (3 mg/kg on days 1, 15, and 29) with the same doses of gemcitabine (on days 1, 8, 22, and 29) and S-1 (on days 1-12 and 22-33). The primary endpoint was response rate (RR). After enrolling seven patients, the study was terminated owing to slow recruitment. Five of the seven patients who completed one cycle of gemcitabine plus S-1 (GS) fulfilled the criteria for CA 19-9 and proceeded to receive nivolumab in addition to GS. One patient demonstrated a partial response, and the other four patients had stable disease (SD). The RR and disease control rate (DCR) for gemcitabine and S-1 plus nivolumab (GSN) were 20% and 100%, respectively. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0-16.4) months. The median overall survival (OS) was 20.8 (95% CI, 16.4-25.2) months. Two patients who did not receive nivolumab continued the GS regimen; one SD and one progressive disease (PD) were observed with a PFS of 3.5 and 3.0 months, respectively. The most common adverse events (AEs) during the GS phase (n = 7) were grade 1-2 neutropenia (n = 5), skin rashes (n = 4), and fever (n = 3). During the nivolumab adding-on phase (n = 5), one grade 3 and one grade 4 neutropenia were observed. Grade 1-2 mucositis (n = 3) was the most common nonhematological AE. In conclusion, adding nivolumab to chemotherapy in patients who had achieved control of CA 19-9 in metastatic PDAC was feasible. (Registration at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04377048).",

FAM49B is upregulated in ovarian cancer tissues; however, its role and mechanism in ovarian cancer progression remain unknown. Herein, we demonstrated that FAM49B knockdown significantly increases ovarian cancer cell viability, EdU incorporation, and clonogenic growth. In contrast, the forced expression of FAM49B achieved opposite effects. Furthermore, an ovo model was used to assess the in vitro effects of FAM49B depletion or overexpression on the growth of ovarian cancer. In a xenograft model, we observed that FAM49B overexpression alleviated tumor formation. Transcriptomic analysis of FAM49B-depleted and control cells revealed that FAM49B silencing upregulated the MAPK pathway. Consistent with the transcriptomic analysis results, we noted that FAM49B knockdown enhanced EGFR activation and downstream MEK-ERK signaling; in contrast, FAM49B overexpression exhibited opposite trends. In addition, FAM49B played a role in EGF-induced sphere growth of ovarian cancer cells. Notably, treatment with the MEK inhibitor trametinib considerably impaired the increased cell growth by FAM49B knockdown in cell culture and ovo models. Collectively, our results suggest that FAM49B can suppress the growth of ovarian cancer cells by regulating the MAPK signaling pathway.",

A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 174 lymphoma patients who underwent stem cell transplantation at Shanxi Province Cancer Hospital from 2010 to 2024. Patients were divided into two cohorts: G-CSF plus chemotherapy (n=129) and G-CSF plus plerixafor (n=45). Baseline demographics, CD34+ cell yield and collection efficiency, time to hematopoietic recovery, transfusion requirements, incidence of fever and infections, hematologic abnormalities, immune reconstitution, and patient-reported QoL at 6 months were collected from de-identified medical records and analyzed. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. The G-CSF plus plerixafor group demonstrated significantly higher CD34+ cell counts at the first apheresis, higher total CD34+ cell yields, and a larger proportion of patients achieving ≥ 2 × 106 and ≥ 5 × 106 CD34+ cells/kg within 4 days compared with the G-CSF plus chemotherapy group. Hematological recovery (platelet and neutrophil engraftment) was faster in the plerixafor group. The plerixafor group also had shorter hospital stays, fewer febrile episodes during neutropenia, reduced antibiotic use, and higher lymphocyte counts at day 28 post-transplantion. The incidences of leukopenia, lymphopenia, anemia, and gastrointestinal adverse effects were lower in this group. Immune reconstitution, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ T cell recovery at 30 days, was improved post-transplant, and QoL scores at 6 months post-discharge were higher across physical, emotional, and social domains. Mobilization with G-CSF plus plerixafor is associated with higher CD34+ cell yields, faster hematologic and immune recovery, lower complication rates, and better QoL outcomes compared with G-CSF plus chemotherapy in lymphoma patients undergoing ASCT.",

Leveraging a large, multi-institutional cohort from the AACR Project Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) Biopharma Collaborative (BPC) (n = 750; LCC: 363 vs. RCC: 387), we conducted a comprehensive analysis of mutational profiles, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and survival outcomes. Our findings revealed a markedly higher TMB in RCC compared to LCC (6.65 ± 11.3 vs. 3.17 ± 4.35; adjusted P = 3.12×10-32), suggesting greater genomic instability in RCC. After applying functional annotation filters (PolyPhen > 0.85, SIFT < 0.05), RCC tumors were significantly enriched for mutations in BRAF (23.1% vs. 6.7%), KMT2D (8.6% vs. 3.2%), and SMAD4 (13.1% vs. 7.3%), while TP53 mutations predominated in LCC (40.6% vs. 31.8%). Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified RCC as an independent predictor of poorer overall survival (OS) relative to LCC (HR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.02-1.66, P = 0.033). Notably, KRAS mutations were associated with significantly worse OS in LCC (HR: 1.68, 95% CI: 1.06-2.70, P = 0.027), while BRAF mutations predicted adverse outcomes in RCC (HR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.05-2.37, P = 0.028).

    "abstract": "Background Hormonal therapy using progestins, acting through the progesterone receptor (PR), is a well-established method to treat uterine endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. Recent population studies indicate that progestin exposure significantly reduces the incidence of ovarian, pancreatic and lung cancers in addition to endometrial cancer in women. This unexpected differentiating function of progestin in organs outside of the reproductive system led us to hypothesize that progestins/PR are protective against cancer development and progression in many tumor types. Methods The Cancer Genome Atlas, Oncomine and Prognostic Databases were searched to determine the relative expression of PR in tumors from multiple sites, and clinical outcomes linked to PR expression were determined. In addition, mRNA and protein expression were evaluated using real-time PCR and Western blotting. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed to understand the PR downregulation mechanisms in tumor cells and patient samples. Methylation-specific PCR was conducted to survey the PR methylation status. The Student's t-test were performed to determine significance. Flow cytometry was used to quantify apoptotic cells. Results Low PR expression levels were consistently linked to less favorable clinical outcomes in endometrial, pancreatic, ovarian and non-small cell lung cancers. Clinical specimens and cell lines from these cancers demonstrate low levels of PR, and we now report that the mechanism for loss of PR is mediated through epigenetic repression. However, PR silencing can be overcome with epigenetic modulators. Histone deacetylase inhibitor (LBH589) and hypomethylating agent (5-aza-decitabine) restored functional PR expression at both the mRNA and protein levels and promoted marked cell death through induction of apoptosis in the presence of progesterone. Conclusions Our studies support the possibility that progestin therapy in combination with epigenetic modulators, a concept we term molecularly enhanced progestin therapy, is an approach worthy of study for malignancies originating from tissues outside of the reproductive tract.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate whether miR-29b acts as a radiosensitizer for CIRT. The OSA cell lines U2OS and KHOS were treated with carbon ion beam alone, γ-ray irradiation alone, or in combination with an miR-29b mimic. OSA cell death as well as invasive and migratory abilities were analyzed through viability, colony formation, Transwell, and apoptosis assays. miR-29 expression was downregulated in OSA tissues compared to that in normal tissues and was associated with metastasis and relapse in patients with OSA. Further, miR-29b was found to directly target the transcription factor Sp1 and suppress the activation of the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-AKT pathway. Conversely, Sp1 was found to attenuate the inhibitory effects of miR-29b in OSA cells. When used in combination with miR-29b mimic, carbon ion beam markedly inhibited invasion, migration, and proliferation of OSA cells and promoted apoptosis by inhibiting AKT phosphorylation in a Sp1/PTEN-mediated manner. Taken together, miR-29b mimic improved the radiosensitivity of OSA cells via the PTEN-AKT-Sp1 signaling pathway, presenting a novel strategy for the development of carbon ion beam combination therapy.",

Furthermore, ecDNA is widely existed in cancer cells, but almost never found in normal cells. It has been found that ecDNA played important roles in tumorigenesis and tumor progression, including oncogene amplification, tumor heterogeneity, enhancer hijacking and genomic rearrangement.

Between 2000 and 2010, a total of 492 CRC patients were enrolled, including 280 with synchronous metastasis and 212 with metachronous metastasis. Clinicopathological and molecular features were compared between the two groups. Patients with synchronous metastasis were more likely to have right-sided CRC, poorly differentiated tumors, lymphovascular invasion, advanced pathological tumor (T) and node (N) categories, and liver metastases than those with metachronous metastasis. For right-sided CRC, patients with synchronous metastasis had more lymphovascular invasion and liver metastases than those with metachronous metastasis. For left-sided CRC, patients with synchronous metastasis were more likely to have poorly differentiated tumors, lymphovascular invasion, advanced pathological T and N categories, and liver metastases than those with metachronous metastasis. Regarding the genetic mutations, patients with metachronous metastasis had more mutations in TP53, NRAS, and HRAS and fewer mutations in APC than those with synchronous metastasis; for right-sided CRC, synchronous metastasis was associated with more APC mutations than metachronous metastasis, while for left-sided CRC, metachronous metastasis was associated with more TP53 and NRAS mutations than synchronous metastasis. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rates were significantly higher in metachronous metastasis patients than in synchronous metastasis patients, especially those with left-sided CRC. Multivariate analysis showed that age, sex, lymphovascular invasion, pathological N category, metachronous metastasis, and BRAF and NRAS mutations were independent prognostic factors affecting OS.

We aimed to assess the feasibility of blinatumomab in treating patients with HLA loss relapse after haplo-HSCT. Four eligible patients undergoing HLA loss relapse after haplo-HSCT were enrolled in the study. Four patients achieved a complete remission/complete remission with partial he-matologic recovery (CR/CRh) with three minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative response within the first cycle of treatment. Three of the four met a primary endpoint with CR/CRh and MRD-negative response within 2 cycles of treatment. One patient developed new extramedullary sites of skin after the first cycle. Cytokine release syndrome was observed in one patient. Cytopenias, as well as elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, were two common adverse effects during treatment.

The key glutathione metabolic enzyme, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), met the selection threshold.

We used CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 technology for genetic knockout of STK24 at the genomic DNA level in human MKN45 and mouse M12 gastric cancer cells. To assess the consequences of STK24 knockdown, western blot, cell migration, and wound healing assays were conducted in vitro. An in vivo mouse model of liver metastasis was established and tested, and bioinformatics analyses were performed. The knockdown of the STK24 gene enhanced cell migration and increased liver metastasis in the mouse model of gastric cancer. STK24-silenced tumors suppressed CD4+ T cells and enhanced the expansion of CD11b+Ly6C+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and F4/80+ macrophages in the spleen of the mice. In MKN45 cells, STK24 silencing resulted in downregulation of E-cadherin (gene CDH1, Cadherin-1, or epithelial cadherin). In 38 paired specimens of gastric adenocarcinomas and normal tissues, we examined STK24 and CDH1 expression levels via western blot; a positive correlation between the expression levels of STK24 and CDH1 was found (R2 = 0.5507, P = 9.72 × 10-8). Furthermore, in Oncomine database and Kaplan-Meier plotter analysis, the loss of CDH1, increase in CCL2, and upregulation of CD44 were correlated with poor prognosis of gastric cancer patients. Our results demonstrate that knockdown of STK24 increases cell migration through suppressing CDH1 and enhancing CD44. In experimental model of metastatic gastric cancer in syngeneic inbred mice, STK24 is important for immune suppression through expansion of CD11b+Ly6C+ MDSCs and F4/80+ macrophages. We confirmed that STK24 is an inhibitor of gastric cancer metastasis.",

    "abstract": "CSE1L is involved in the cancer progression of several types of cancer. Its expression status, potential oncogenic role and underlying mechanism in lung cancer, however, are unclear. Here, we investigated CSE1L expression in primary lung adenocarcinoma based on multiple datasets and then investigated its oncologic role in lung cancer. We also examined the potential molecular mechanisms of CSE1L in cancer progression. CSE1L levels were increased in cancer as compared to normal lung tissues. CSE1L expression was higher in poorly-differentiated late stage and lymph node positive metastatic tumors. Higher CSE1L level was correlated with worse patient outcome. Knockdown of CSE1L using siRNAs impaired cell proliferation, invasion, migration and induced cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, MET, STAT3 and PD-L1 proteins were decreased upon CSE1L silencing. These results suggest that CSE1L may affect tumor progression through MET/STAT3/PD-L1 signaling. CSE1L may have potential as a biomarker and therapeutic target for lung cancer.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one type of the most common cancers, which results in the major death worldwide. This study focuses on the understanding of the molecular mechanism of lncRNA NR2F2-AS1 and its regulation on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in the development of NSCLC. Expressions of lncRNA NR2F2-AS1, miR-545-5p, c-Met, biliverdin reductase (BVR), ATF-2 and EMT-related markers in NSCLC tissues and cells were measured by western blotting and RT-qPCR assays. The impact of lncRNA NR2F2-AS1 and miR-545-5p on the cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT were analyzed by CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing and transwell assays. The interactions among lncRNA NR2F2-AS1, miR-545-5p and c-Met predicted by bioinformatic analysis were evaluated through dual luciferase reporter assay and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). After generating tumor xenografts, immunohistochemistry was utilized to measure the expression of Ki-67 and EMT-related proteins in vivo. Our results showed that lncRNA NR2F2-AS1, c-Met, BVR and ATF-2 were overexpressed while miR-545-5p was silenced in NSCLC tissues and cells. Silencing of lncRNA NR2F2-AS1 or upregulating miR-545-5p significantly inhibited the cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT process. The EMT process could be inhibited by suppressing c-Met/BVR/ATF-2 axis. The tumor xenograft experiments demonstrated that the tumor growth and EMT process were significantly inhibited by silencing lncRNA NR2F2-AS1 or overexpression of miR-545-5p in vivo. LncRNA NR2F2-AS1 promoted the NSCLC development through suppressing miR-545-5p to activate EMT process through c-Met/BVR/ATF-2 axis. Our study indicated that lncRNA NR2F2-AS1 and miR-545-5p could be used as potential therapeutic targets to improve NSCLC treatment.",

Retrospectively, we compared data of 294 patients receiving conventional care (conventional group) with 213 patients undergoing Omaha System interventions (intervention group) from January 2019 to January 2023. Key indicators included quality of life (FACT-L), anxiety (SAS), depression (SDS), sleep quality (PSQI), hope (HHS), and dignity (PDI). Post-intervention, the intervention group showed a significant increase in FACT-L scores (P<0.001), indicating enhanced quality of life. There was a notable reduction in PSQI scores (P<0.001), suggesting improved sleep quality. Additionally, their anxiety and depression levels significantly decreased, as evidenced by lower SAS (P<0.001) and SDS scores (P<0.001). Logistic regression revealed that care nursing intervention scheme (P=0.007), age (P=0.008), marital status (P=0.002), per capita monthly household income (P=0.004), SAS after intervention (P=0.002), and PSQI after intervention (P=0.002) had a positive influence on quality of life.

    "abstract": "Autophagy, a highly regulated lysosome-dependent catabolic pathway, has garnered increasing attention because of its role in leukemia resistance. Among the S100 family of small calcium-binding proteins, S100P is differentially expressed in various tumor cell lines, thereby influencing tumor occurrence, invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. However, the relationship between S100P and autophagy in determining chemosensitivity in leukemia cells remains unexplored. Our investigation revealed a negative correlation between S100P expression and the clinical status in childhood leukemia, with its presence observed in HL-60 and Jurkat cell lines. Suppression of S100P expression resulted in increased cell proliferation and decreased chemosensitivity in leukemia cells, whereas enhancement of S100P expression inhibited cell proliferation and increased chemosensitivity. Additionally, S100P knockdown drastically promoted autophagy, which was subsequently suppressed by S100P upregulation. Moreover, the p53/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway was found to be functionally associated with S100P-mediated autophagy. Knockdown of S100P expression led to a decrease in p53 and p-mTOR levels and an increase in p-AMPK expression, ultimately promoting autophagy. This effect was reversed by administration of Tenovin-6 (a p53 activator) and Compound C (an AMPK inhibitor). The findings of our in vivo experiments provide additional evidence supporting the aforementioned data. Specifically, S100P inhibition significantly enhanced the growth of HL-60 tumor xenografts and increased the expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 and p-AMPK in nude mice. Consequently, it can be concluded that S100P plays a regulatory role in the chemosensitivity of leukemia cells by modulating the p53/AMPK/mTOR pathway, which controls autophagy in leukemia cells.",

Clinically, elderly melanoma patients tend to exhibit stronger invasion ability and poorer prognosis. Given the heterogeneity of tumors, we analyzed the prognosis and risk assessment of melanoma through aging-related genes rather than age stratification. FOXM1 and CCL4 were identified to be closely associated with melanoma prognosis. Single-cell transcriptome analysis showed that FOXM1 was significantly up-regulated in tumor cells, while CCL4 was markedly elevated in immune cells. A melanoma prognostic model was constructed based on the two independent prognostic factors. This model showed a high accuracy in predicting the mortality of melanoma patients over several years. The patients in low-risk group appeared to have more immune cell infiltration and better immune therapy efficacy. Cellular experiments showed that CCL4 could promote apoptosis of melanoma cells through immune cells, and apoptosis could regulate the expression of FOXM1. In addition, the results of the spatial transcriptome and immunohistochemistry suggested that CCL4 was highly expressed in macrophages and the expression of FOXM1 in melanoma cell was negatively correlated with immune cell infiltration, especially macrophages. Here, we established a novel prognostic model for melanoma, which showed promising predictive performance and may serve as a biomarker for the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition therapy in melanoma patients. In addition, we explored the function of two genes in the model in melanoma.",

Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) method, EdU method and flow cytometry were used to detect the cell proliferation and apoptosis of PC cell lines after transfection.A subcutaneous tumorigenesis model was constructed to validate the oncogenic role of ELF1 in vivo.PROMO database was used to predict the binding site of ELF1 on the promoter region of doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1).Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, chromatin immunoprecipitation-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR) assay and quantitative real-time PCR were performed to detect the binding of ELF1 to the promoter region of DCLK1.The effect of ELF1 on DCLK1 expression was detected by Western blot assay.It was found that ELF1 expression in PC tissues and cells was up-regulated.ELF1 overexpression promoted the proliferation and inhibited the apoptosis of PC cells, while knocking down ELF1 had the opposite effects.ELF1 could bind to the promoter region of DCLK1 and ELF1 overexpression promoted the expression of DCLK1.Bioinformatics analysis suggested that Janus kinase (JAK) -signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway was associated to DCLK1 expression, and overexpression of ELF1 promoted the expression of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).In conclusion, ELF1 promoted the malignant progression of PC via regulating DCLK1/ JAK/STAT signaling pathway.",

Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into distinct treatment groups, receiving sorafenib via gavage and NK cells via catheterization of the proper hepatic artery. Tumor growth and treatment response were monitored through weekly MRI scans, including T1w, T2w, DCE, and DWI sequences.

Our findings highlight the promise of sorafenib-augmented NK cell chemoimmunotherapy as a potential therapeutic strategy for HCC management.

    "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a common malignancy of the digestive system, and its treatment is greatly challenged by rising chemoresistance. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play critical roles in the development of drug resistance in tumors. However, the role of the lncRNA CCAT1 in erlotinib resistance in CCA remains unclear. In this investigation, we identified CCAT1 as a pivotal factor contributing to erlotinib resistance in CCA. Furthermore, we uncovered that lncRNA CCAT1 modulated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein kinase 2 (ROCK2), thereby conferring erlotinib resistance upon CCA cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that miR-181a-5p interacted with CCAT1 to modulate the expression of ROCK2. Collectively, these findings shed light on the significant role of CCAT1 in the development of erlotinib resistance in CCA. The functional suppression of CCAT1 holds promise in enhancing the sensitivity to erlotinib by reversing EMT through the miR-181a-5p/ROCK2 signaling pathway. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying erlotinib resistance in CCA and the potential strategies for its treatment.",

However, inherent and acquired chemoresistance limited the effectiveness of cisplatin in treatment of NSCLC. This study aimed to investigate the roles and underlying mechanisms of lncRNA-FEZF1-AS1 in mediating cisplatin sensitivity in NSCLC. We found that FEZF1-AS1 levels were significantly higher in lung cancer patients and cell lines. Blocking FEZF1-AS1 sensitized lung cancer cells to cisplatin. Additionally, both glutamine metabolism and FEZF1-AS1 were significantly elevated in cisplatin resistant NSCLC cell lines, A549/CDDP R and SK-MES-1 CDDP/R. Analysis using bioinformatics, RNA pull-down assay and luciferase assay demonstrated that FEZF1-AS1 sponged miR-32-5p, which acted as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC. Glutaminase (GLS), a key enzyme in the glutamine metabolism, was predicted and validated as the direct target of miR-32-5p in NSCLC cells. Inhibiting glutamine metabolism or reducing glutamine supply effectively resensitized cisplatin-resistant cells. Furthermore, restoring miR-32-5p in FEZF1-AS1-overexpressing cisplatin resistant cells successfully overcame FEZF1-AS1-mediated cisplatin resistance by targeting GLS.

Our study focuses on its function in human gastric cancer (GC). Through bioinformatics and tumor tissue analysis, we compared THBS2 expression in GC tissues and adjacent tissues, and predicted regulatory upstream and downstream molecules. The direct regulatory effect of miR-29b-3p on THBS2 was evaluated through dual-luciferase reporter assays, showing that miR-29b-3p targets the 3'-UTR of THBS2 mRNA, reducing its expression in GC cells. The influence of THBS2 on tumorigenesis and stemness was examined on protein expression levels via Western blot. In vivo, THBS2's role was investigated through xenograft and metastasis assays in nude mice, demonstrating that downregulation of THBS2 impairs GC tumorigenesis and liver metastasis. Our study identified THBS2 as a highly expressed prognostic factor in GC patients. Functionally, THBS2 promotes GC progression through the Notch signaling pathway by regulating Notch3, NEY1, and HES1 proteins, and sustains cancer stem cell-like characteristics by Notch3, including the expression of CD44, Nanog, OCT4, and SOX2. In sum, our study reveals that THBS2 promotes GC progression and stemness, modulated negatively by miR-29b-3p. This suggests potential therapeutic targets within the THBS2/Notch signaling axis for combating gastric cancer.",

    "abstract": "In early gastric cancer (EGC), the presence of lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a crucial factor for determining the treatment options. Endoscopic resection is used for treatment of EGC with minimal risk of LNM. However, owing to the lack of definitive criteria for identifying patients who require additional surgery, some patients undergo unnecessary additional surgery. Considering that histopathologic patterns are significant factor for predicting lymph node metastasis in gastric cancer, we aimed to develop a machine learning algorithm which can predict LNM status using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained images. The images were obtained from several institutions. Our pipeline comprised two sequential approaches including a feature extractor and a risk classifier. For the feature extractor, a segmentation network (DeepLabV3+) was trained on 243 WSIs across three datasets to differentiate each histological subtype. The risk classifier was trained with XGBoost using 70 morphological features inferred from the trained feature extractor. The trained segmentation network, the feature extractor, achieved high performance, with pixel accuracies of 0.9348 and 0.8939 for the internal and external datasets in patch level, respectively. The risk classifier achieved an overall AUC of 0.75 in predicting LNM status. Remarkably, one of the datasets also showed a promising result with an AUC of 0.92. This is the first multi-institution study to develop machine learning algorithm for predicting LNM status in patients with EGC using H&E-stained histopathology images. Our findings have the potential to improve the selection of patients who require surgery among those with EGC showing high-risk histological features.",

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) constitute over 50% of ATC-infiltrating cells, and their presence is associated with a poor prognosis. We have previously shown that paracrine signals released by ATC cells induced pro-tumor M2-like polarization of human monocytes. However, which soluble factors derived from ATC cells drive monocyte activation, are largely unknown. In this study we investigated the participation of transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) on the phenotype of macrophage activation induced by ATC cell-derived conditioned media (CM). THP-1 cells exposed to CM derived from ATC cells and recombinant human TGFβ1 induced M2-like macrophage polarization, showing high CD163 and Dectin1 expression. Moreover, we showed that TGFβ1 induced the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression of the transcription factors SNAIL and SLUG. Accordingly, increased TGFβ1 secretion from ATC cells was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Addition of SB431542, a TGFβ receptor inhibitor, significantly decreased the Dectin1, CD163, SNAIL and SLUG expression stimulated by ATC cell-derived CM. We validated the clinical significance of the expression of TGFβ ligands, their receptors, as well as SNAIL and SLUG in human ATC by analyzing public microarray datasets. We found that the expression of the main TGFβ ligands, TGFβ1 and TGFβ3, along with their receptors, TGFR1 and TGFR2, as well as SLUG, was significantly higher in human ATC tissue samples than in normal thyroid tissues. Our findings indicate that ATC cell-secreted TGFβ1 may play a key role in M2-like macrophage polarization of human monocytes and in the up-regulation of SNAIL and SLUG transcription factors. Thus, ours results uncovered a novel mechanism involved in the activation of TAMs by soluble factors released by ATC cells, which suggest potential therapeutic targets for ATC.",

A total of 16 cases of GAED diagnosed from August 2019 to August 2022 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University were retrospectively collected to analyze their clinical and pathological features. A control group of 360 cases of conventional gastric adenocarcinoma diagnosed during the same period was used for comparison. Among the 16 GAED patients, 11 were male and 5 were female, with ages ranging from 64 to 89 years (median age 75.5 years). Clinical manifestations of these patients included symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, hematemesis, and melena. The macroscopic classification revealed 11 cases of ulcerative lesions, 4 protruded lesions, and 1 diffusely infiltrative lesion. Tumor sizes varied from 3 to 9.5 cm in diameter, with a median diameter of 4.75 cm. Microscopically, the tumor cells exhibited tubular, papillary, and cribriform arrangements, with cuboidal or columnar morphology, relatively distinct cell boundaries, and cytoplasm that appeared clear or weakly acidophilic. Immunophenotyping analysis revealed the expression of SALL4 (15/16), Glypican-3 (12/16), CDX2 (12/16), CD10 (10/16), and p53 (12 cases exhibiting mutant expression, 4 cases exhibiting wild-type expression) within the tumor cells. There was no loss of mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, MSH6). The Ki-67 proliferation index ranged from 50% to 95%. In comparison to conventional gastric adenocarcinoma, GAED was frequently found in the gastric antrum (P<0.001) and exhibited a higher incidence of intravascular cancer emboli (P<0.001). Significant differences were noted in the Lauren classification, invasion depth, differentiation degree (P<0.01), and macroscopic type (P<0.05). However, no significant differences were found regarding age, gender, tumor diameter, neural invasion, or lymph node metastasis (P>0.05). The postoperative follow-up ranging from 5 to 29 months revealed one death and 15 cases of disease-free survival. GAED is a special subtype of gastric adenocarcinoma characterized by a combination of embryonal and intestinal differentiation immunophenotypes, as well as its increased propensity for biological invasion. Accurate identification of GAED is crucial in pathological practice, as it helps differentiate between GAED and conventional adenocarcinoma and aids in the evaluation of tumor malignancy. Furthermore, it is imperative to conduct a differential diagnosis that involves hepatoid adenocarcinoma, yolk sac tumor-like adenocarcinoma, and metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.",

This study aims to analyze the correlation of different Proactive Molecular Risk Classifier for Endometrial Cancer molecular subtypes with lymph node metastasis (LNM) and other clinical features in EC. 120 treatment-naive EC patients with surgery were enrolled in this study. The molecular subtypes of these patients were classified as follows by Proactive Molecular Risk Classifier for Endometrial Cancer (ProMisE) molecular subtyping: mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd) in 22 cases (18.33%), polymerase epsilon exonuclease domain mutation (POLE EDM) in 2 cases (1.67%), p53 wild-type (p53-wt) in 64 cases (53.33%), and p53 abnormal (p53-abn) in 32 cases (26.67%). The clinicopathological features of 120 patients were retrospectively analyzed. Statistical significance was identified among the four molecular subtypes in terms of histological classification, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging, pathological grading, and LNM. Among the enrolled cases, 26 had LNM and 94 had no lymph node involvement. According to the multivariate Logistic regression analysis, p53 wt (P=0.008, OR=0.078, 95% CI: 0.012-0.510) was a protective factor for LNM in EC patients, while poorly differentiated histology (P=0.001, OR=15.137, 95% CI: 3.013-76.044) was a risk factor. ProMisE classification system, being more objective and reproducible, can provide an important reference for preoperative decision-making. The patients with p53 wt by ProMisE had a low risk of LNM in preoperative diagnostic curettage specimens, while there was a higher risk of LNM among the patients with poorly differentiated EC.",

    "abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a unique head and neck cancer with a complex etiology involving genetic predispositions, environmental factors, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. Despite progress in radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the prognosis for advanced NPC is still unfavorable, prompting the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. Metabolic reprogramming plays a crucial role in the development and progression of NPC, marked by substantial changes in glycolysis, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. These alterations aid tumor cell proliferation, survival under stress, and immune evasion, with features such as enhanced aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) and shifts in lipid and amino acid pathways. Oncogenic drivers like MYC, RAS, EGFR, and the loss of tumor suppressors such as TP53 and PTEN, along with key signaling pathways including mTOR, AMPK, and HIF-1α, orchestrate these metabolic changes. This review discusses the molecular mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming in NPC and outlines potential therapeutic targets within these pathways. Advances in metabolic imaging and biomarker discovery are also enhancing the precision of diagnostics and treatment monitoring, fostering personalized medicine in NPC treatment. This manuscript aims to provide a detailed overview of the current research and its implications for improving NPC management and patient outcomes through targeted metabolic therapies.",

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), an enzyme catabolizing L-tryptophan into kynurenine, plays a key role in tumor immune tolerance. However, the roles of IDO1 in cellular senescence and chemoresistance remain elusive. Herein, we observed a significant elevation of IDO1 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues compared to non-neoplastic controls, based on both the GEPIA database and mouse model. Functionally, ectopic expression of IDO1 blunted 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-induced cell senescence and rendered CRC cells more refractory towards 5-FU treatment, whereas IDO1 silencing resulted in opposing effects. Further studies demonstrated that IDO1 overexpression decreased the levels of senescent-related proteins, including p16, p21, p53, and cyclin D1. Mechanistically, the kynurenine released from IDO1-expressing CRC cells inhibited the IGFBP5/p53 signaling pathway, accounting for IDO1-mediated suppression of cell senescence and induction of chemoresistance. Collectively, these data revealed an unrecognized role of IDO1 in senescence escape and chemoresistance via releasing its catabolite kynurenine, implicating that therapeutically targeting IDO1 or IGFBP5/p53 signaling pathway holds great promise for CRC treatment.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer accounts for 10-15% of cancer-related mortality among women globally. Infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types constitutes a significant etiological factor in the development of cervical carcinoma. The integration of HPV DNA into the host genome is considered a pivotal event in cervical carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, the precise mechanisms underlying HPV integration and its role in promoting cancer progression remain inadequately understood. Therefore, this study aims to identify potential common denominators at HPV DNA integration sites and to analyze the adjacent cellular sequences. We conducted whole-genome sequencing on 13 primary cervical cancer samples, employing the chromosomal coordinates of 537 breakpoints to assess the statistical overrepresentation of integration sites in relation to various chromatin features. Our analysis, which encompassed all chromosomes, identified several integration hotspots within the human genome, notably at 14q32.2, 10p15, and 2q37. Additionally, our findings indicated a preferential integration of HPV DNA into intragenic and gene-dense regions of human chromosomes. A substantial number of host cellular genes impacted by the integration sites were associated with cancer, including IKZF2, IL26, AHRR, and PDCD6. Furthermore, the cellular genes targeted by integration were enriched in tumor-related terms and pathways, as demonstrated by gene ontology and KEGG analysis. In conclusion, these findings enhance our understanding of HPV integration sites and provide deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of cervical carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to identify characteristic factors for pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) undergoing surgery and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). We retrospectively collected pathological data from 237 LABC patients treated in Affiliated Fuzhou First Hospital of Fujian Medical University from January 2010 to June 2021 and divided them into a training group (n = 166) and a validation group (n = 71) in a 7:3 ratio. A predictive model for pCR was established through logistic regression analysis and evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC). Significant differences between the pCR and non-pCR groups were observed in tumor size (P = 0.001), T stage (P = 0.003), estrogen receptor (ER) (P = 0.031), progesterone receptor (PR) (P = 0.013), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) (P = 0.001), and molecular type (P = 0.001). The pCR group also had lower levels of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (P = 0.013), cancer antigen 125 (P = 0.011), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (P = 0.001), and systemic inflammatory index (SII) (P = 0.006), but a higher prognostic nutritional index (PNI) (P = 0.001) compared to the non-pCR group. There were no statistical differences in baseline data between the training and validation groups (P>0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified tumor size (P = 0.001), HER-2 (P = 0.010), CA125 (P = 0.005), CEA (P = 0.001), SII (P = 0.010), and PNI (P = 0.001) as independent risk factors for pCR. We constructed and visualized a nomogram model that included these 6 factors and developed a dynamic prediction model using the Dynamic Nomogram (DynNom) package. In a random sample of 6 patients, the probability of non-pCR reached 98.8%. The model's AUC was 0.881 in the training group, with a clinical benefit rate of 71.68% and a concordance index (C-index) of 0.881, indicating a good fit. In the validation group, the AUC was 0.722, with a clinical benefit rate of 70.2% and a C-index of 0.722, also indicating a good fit. The Delong test showed a significant difference in AUC between the two groups (P = 0.027). In conclusion, this study constructed and validated a Nomogram model based on clinical pathological features and hematological indicators, finding that higher pCR rates were associated with smaller tumor size, HER-2 positivity, lower levels of CA125 and CEA, lower SII, and higher PNI, significantly enhancing breast cancer management and offering important clinical implications.",

    "abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor that targets the nasopharyngeal mucosal epithelium. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is a pivotal treatment modality for NPC, yet it poses a risk for osteoradionecrosis (ORN), a complication that can impede further treatment. This study sought to explore the risk factors for ORN in NPC patients post-CCRT and to construct predictive models. We performed a retrospective analysis of clinical data from 417 NPC patients treated with CCRT at the Affiliated Hospital of Jiangnan University, with 204 patients from Longyan First Hospital as a validation cohort for the models. Our findings indicated that a high radiation dose, tooth extraction after radiotherapy, inadequate oral hygiene, smoking, anemia, and advanced T staging were associated with an elevated risk of ORN in NPC patients following CCRT. We formulated risk prediction models for ORN utilizing a nomogram, gradient boosting machine (GBM), and random forest (RF) algorithms. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.813 (95% CI: 0.724-0.902) for the nomogram model in the validation cohort, 0.821 (95% CI: 0.732-0.910) for the GBM, and 0.735 (95% CI: 0.614-0.855) for the RF. Delong's test indicated no statistically significant differences in the AUC values among the three models. The nomogram has strong performance across both the training and validation cohorts, featuring a straightforward structure that is both intuitive and comprehensible. Taking into account the model's discriminative power, generalizability, and clinical practicability, the nomogram was proven to be highly applicable in the current study.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most prevalent and fatal malignancy of the female reproductive system, with the majority of patients diagnosed at an advanced stage due to the lack of early screening. Despite surgery and chemotherapy being the standard treatments, overall survival rates have not improved significantly, highlighting the need for new biomarkers for therapeutic efficacy and prognostic evaluation. This study aimed to clarify the application value of tumor markers (TMs), including carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), combined with interleukins (ILs), such as IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, in the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy and prognosis of OC, and to establish a prediction model. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 184 OC patients treated at the Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Traditional Chinese Medicine from February 2020 to February 2023. Serum levels of CA125, AFP, and CEA were quantified by chemiluminescence immunoassay, and ILs by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Significant decreases in CA125, AFP, CEA, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-10 levels were observed after treatment (all P<0.001), while IL-8 levels showed no significant change (P=0.597). The death group exhibited notably higher levels of CA125, IL-6, and IL-8 than the survival group (all P<0.001). Cox regression analysis identified CA125, IL-8, histological grading, ascites, intravascular tumor thrombus, and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging as independent prognostic factors. The Nomogram model based on these factors showed strong predictive ability in predicting patient mortality with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.756. In conclusion, the combination of TMs and ILs is valuable in evaluating therapeutic efficacy and prognosis in OC. Dynamic monitoring of CA125, IL-6, and IL-8 can guide clinical treatment adjustments, improving diagnostic accuracy and prognosis reliability.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is usually detected in the advanced stages. Existing treatments for high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) are not adequate and approximately fifty percent of patients succumb to this disease and die within five years after diagnosis. We conducted pre-clinical studies in a mouse model of ovarian cancer to evaluate disease outcome in response to treatment with the multi-kinase inhibitor cabozantinib. Cabozantinib is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor with multiple targets including vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), associated with immune suppression in ovarian cancer. Mice (C57BL/6) were injected with ID8-RFP ovarian tumor cells and treated with cabozantinib. Studies investigated ascites development, tumor burden and regulation of anti-tumor immunity with treatment. Mice treated with cabozantinib had significantly decreased solid tumor burden and decreased malignant ascites as compared to untreated controls. Improved outcome in cabozantinib treated mice was associated with a significantly higher percentage of CD69 early activated T cells, a higher percentage of granzyme B secreting CD8 T cells, the enhanced release of cytokines and chemokines known to recruit CD8 T cells and amplify T cell function, as well as reduced VEGFR-2. Findings suggest that cabozantinib is an important clinical agent capable of improving ovarian cancer in mice potentially in part by priming the autologous immune system to promote anti-tumor immunity.",

Moreover, GBO-neuron co-culture system was also investigated and interactions between GFP labeled neurons and mCherry labeled GBOs have been observed. We further used an in-situ stereotaxic instrument to implant GBO into the brains of nude mice and established intracranial orthotopic GBM models based on these GBOs.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data collected from 105 angiosarcoma patients treated at China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University from January 2004 to April 2019, with an additional 50 patients included as external validation cohort. The median survival time for the study cohort was 1395 days, with 66.7% of patients (n=70) dying during the follow-up period. Significant differences were observed between the survival and death groups in age (P=0.022), primary tumor site (P=0.013), tumor size (P=0.008), and metastasis (P=0.018). Analysis of peripheral blood indicators showed that white blood cell (WBC) (P=0.006), platelet (PLT) (P=0.019), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (P<0.001), and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) (P=0.036) were significantly lower in the survival group, while lymphocyte (LYM) (P<0.001), albumin (ALB) (P<0.001), and prognostic nutritional index (PIN) (P<0.001) were significantly higher in the survival group. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified SII (P=0.049, HR=0.551, 95% CI: 0.304-0.998), primary tumor site (P=0.001, HR=0.405, 95% CI: 0.235-0.699), metastasis (P=0.029, HR=1.864, 95% CI: 1.066-3.26), and chemotherapy (P=0.004, HR=0.434, 95% CI: 0.245-0.768) as independent prognostic factors affecting patients' 5-year survival. A nomogram model constructed based on these factors demonstrated high accuracy and stability in predicting 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.836, 0.837, and 0.803, respectively, as validated by calibration curves and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. External validation further confirmed the model's reliability. Additionally, significant interactions were found between SII and primary tumor site (P=0.005) as well as chemotherapy (P=0.045). In conclusion, SII, primary tumor site, metastasis, and chemotherapy are crucial prognostic factors for angiosarcoma, and the developed nomogram provides a reliable tool for predicting survival outcomes.",

Through the conjoint analysis of the TCGA and The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases, we confirmed that NCAPG is an upregulated gene. The prognostic value of NCAPG was elucidated through data analysis. The functional roles and mechanistic insights of NCAPG in NSCLC growth and metastasis were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. NCAPG expression was significantly increased in NSCLC. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that NCAPG was an independent prognostic factor in patients with NSCLC. The high expression of NCAPG was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis. Additionally, the high expression of NCAPG effectively promoted the growth and metastasis of NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. In terms of mechanism, the interaction between NCAPG and Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) promotes the phosphorylation of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Overall, our results reveal the key role of NCAPG in NSCLC and highlight the regulatory function of the NCAPG/CDK1/ERK axis in regulating the progression of NSCLC, providing potential prognosis and therapeutic targets for the treatment of NSCLC.",

The aim of this study is to identify the relevant risk factors for positive lymph node metastasis after radical gastrectomy for gastric cancer, and to construct corresponding predictive models. Through a retrospective analysis of clinical data of 316 gastric cancer patients who underwent radical surgery for gastric cancer, we found that age, maximum tumor diameter, degree of tumor differentiation, vascular invasion, depth of tumor infiltration, and CA199 were important factors affecting lymph node metastasis positivity in gastric cancer patients. Based on these factors, we constructed a Nomogram prediction model and found through internal validation that the model has good predictive performance. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the training and validation sets were 0.929 and 0.888, respectively. Clinical data of another 390 patients were collected for external verification. External validation results showed that the model had a predictive sensitivity of 75.76% (50/66), a specificity of 91.05% (295/324), and an accuracy of 88.46% (345/390). In addition, we also constructed a neural network prediction model and compared it with the Nomogram model. The results showed that the prediction performance of the Nomogram model was similar to that of the neural network model. The Nomogram model has been validated internally and externally, demonstrating high discrimination and accuracy, providing a convenient, intuitive, and personalized evaluation tool for clinicians, helping to optimize the postoperative management of gastric cancer patients and improve prognosis.",

Several phase I/II clinical trials explored ICI-based combinations in microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) with mixed outcomes. However, real-world data regarding ICI-based combinations in this population is lacking. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ICI in MSS mCRC patients in third-line or above setting. A total of 143 eligible patients who received third-line or above ICI monotherapy or ICI-based combinations at the Cancer Center of Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from June 2019 to April 2024 were included in this study. The primary endpoints were real-world median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and the secondary endpoints included objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), safety and prognostic analyses. Results showed that the median PFS was 4.6 months, and the median OS was 11.8 months, with an ORR of 11.2% and a DCR of 72.7%. ICI plus small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors have become the most popular combination for MSS mCRC patients at third-line or above setting with a median PFS of 4.4 months and OS of 10.1 months. The subgroup of patients with liver metastasis had worse clinical outcomes and liver metastasis was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (HR = 2.35, 95% CI, 1.54-3.59; P = 0.000) and OS (HR = 1.77, 95% CI, 1.06-2.96; P = 0.030). Forty-eight patients received cross-line ICI and obtained significantly improved OS (15.8 months vs 10.2 months; HR = 0.59, 95% CI, 0.38-0.89; P = 0.017). No new safety concerns were detected. Grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were generally controllable, with an incidence of 39.9%. To conclude, ICI-based combinations provide survival benefits for these heavily pretreated MSS mCRC patients with manageable safety, which is worthy of further study.",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most common cause of cancer death and disability in the world. Citrus species and their constituents have many biological activities including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-carcinogenic properties. This study aimed to assess the anti-carcinogenic effects and postulate the possible mechanisms of action for Citrus limon fruit peel hydroethanolic extract (CLFPHE) and limonene in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)/2-acetylaminofluorene (2AAF)-induced HCC in male Wistar rats. For analysis and characterization of CLFPHE, gas chromatography-mass spectrum (GC-MS) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods were applied. A HCC was elaborated by DEN intraperitoneal injection (150 mg/kg/week) for two weeks followed by oral delivery of 2AAF (20 mg/kg) four times a week for three weeks. The DEN/2AAF-administered rats were treated with CLFPHE (50 mg/kg) and limonene (20 mg/kg) by oral gavage every other day for 24 weeks. CLFPHE and limonene significantly attenuated the harmful effects of DEN on liver function. Histopathological analysis confirmed that both treatments inhibited DEN/2AAF-induced tumorigenesis in association with the suppression of serum tumor markers including AFP, CEA, and CA19.9 and liver proliferator indicator (Ki-67). Moreover, CLFPHE and limonene prevented the oxidative stress and enhanced the antioxidant defenses in DEN/2AAF-administered rats. These ameliorations were manifested by decreases in liver lipid peroxidation, increases in GSH, SOD and GPx levels and upregulation of Nrf2. The treatments also abated inflammation by suppressing TNF-α and IL-1β levels and IL-8 and NF-κB expression. CLFPHE and limonene substantially decreased hepatic BCL-2, IQGAP1, IQGAP3, HRAS, KRAS and Ki-67 while they elevated BAX, P53, PDCD5 and IQGAP2 expressions. Our findings suggest that CLFPHE and limonene may abate HCC development via enhancement of apoptotic, antioxidant, cell anti-proliferatory and anti-inflammatory effects.",

The search identified LINC01547 that was shown to encode a small protein of 76 amino acids, termed LINC01547-ORF. Real-time quantitative fluorescence showed that LINC01547 expression was downregulated in colorectal cancer tissues. However, cell functional assays revealed that LINC01547 inhibited the proliferation and migration of colorectal cancer cell lines. Meanwhile, western blot and immunofluorescence assays confirmed that LINC01547 encoded LINC01547-ORF. Cellular functional assays indicated that compared with LINC01547 itself, LINC01547-ORF inhibited the proliferation and migration of colorectal cancer cell lines. Gene set enrichment analysis identified enrichment in the focal adhesion pathway and association with CLDN18 protein, whereas protein molecular docking models revealed interacting domains and amino acid residue sites. Of note, co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence experiments showed that LINC01547-ORF could bind to the CLDN18 protein and that this interaction reduced CLDN18 ubiquitination, thereby promoting protein expression. Finally, western blot and immunofluorescence assays confirmed that LINC01547-ORF could target CLDN18 to inhibit the FAK/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, suppressing colorectal cancer cell development. These findings suggest that the LINC01547-ORF-encoded small protein inhibits proliferation and migration in colorectal cancer, thereby offering a promising direction for treating this disease.",

    "abstract": "The involvement of axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) is a critical prognostic factor affecting patient management and outcomes in breast cancer (BC). This study aims to comprehensively analyze the clinical data of BC patients, evaluate ultrasonic signs of ALNs, and explore the implications of a prediction model for ALN metastasis (ALNM) in early-stage BC patients based on ultrasonic features and clinical data. This study retrospectively analyzed ultrasonic features and clinical data from 216 patients diagnosed with unilateral invasive BC. The dataset was divided into a training (n = 162) and a validation set (n = 54) in a 3:1 ratio. Patients were then assigned into metastasis and non-metastasis groups depending on ALNM determined by pathological findings. Univariate analysis of various indicators followed by multivariate Logistic regression analysis was performed on the training set. A prediction model for ALNM in BC was established using binary logistic regression analysis, with its prediction performance evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC), and its reproducibility verified by the validation set. The pathological findings identified 57 (35.2%) cases of ALNM among 162 BC patients in the training set. Risk factors for ALNM included poorly differentiated type, high Ki-67 expression, lymph node (LN) aspect ratio ≥2, LN cortical thickness ≥1/2 of lymphatic hilum diameter, and mixed or peripheral LN blood flow. Protective factors included mass location in the outer upper quadrant and LN size >1 cm. A prediction model was established based on risk factors, with the equation being Logit (P) = -4.881 - 1.285 * differentiation degree + 1.485 * Ki-67 - 1.090 * lump quadrant - 0.956 * lymph node size + 1.244 * lymph aspect ratio + 1.032 * LN cortical thickness + 1.454 * LN medullary disappearance + 1.266 * LN blood flow. ROC analysis of the model yielded an AUC of 0.866, with a sensitivity of 80.7% and a specificity of 80.0%. The prediction model was validated using the validation set, producing an AUC of 0.809. These results demonstrate that color Doppler ultrasound effectively evaluates ALN status in BC patients. The prediction model for ALNM in BC shows strong accuracy and has potential clinical application.",

    "abstract": "The tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) plays a critical role in cancer development and response to immunotherapy. Immune checkpoint inhibitors aim to reverse the immunosuppressive effects of the TIME, but their success has been limited. Immunotherapy directed at PD-1/PD-L1 has been widely employed, yielding positive results. Unfortunately, the gradual emergence of resistance to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition has diminished the effectiveness of this immunotherapy in cancer patients, emphasizing the need for new compounds that will be more effective in managing immunotherapy. This study investigated the effect of the natural compound cardamonin on PD-L1 expression and its ability to modulate the TIME, which could overcome immunotherapy resistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). This investigation used two genetically distinct triple-negative breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 (MDA-231) and MDA-MB-468 (MDA-468). The results show that TNBC cell treatment with cardamonin inhibited PD-L1 expression and reduced JAK1 and STAT3 levels in MDA-231 cells, while it increased JAK1 expression in MDA-468 cells. Also, cardamonin increased the expression of Nrf2 in both cell lines. In addition, cardamonin decreased MUC1, NF-κB1, and NF-κB2 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells and selectively reduced NF-κB1 expression in MDA-468 cells. Furthermore, cardamonin very potently reduced the inflammatory cytokine CCL2 levels. The decrease in CCL2 release reduces the chemoattraction of macrophages in the tumor microenvironment, which may increase the effectiveness of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition and allow T-cell infiltration. These findings suggest that the cardamonin modulation of TIME holds promise in reversing resistance of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition when it is used along with immunotherapy in TNBC treatment.",

Those analyses identified 42 high-risk genes. A patient's survivability could be estimated by simply counting the number of high-risk genes with extremely high expression (above the 90th percentile) or estimating a transcriptomic risk score (TRS) using a machine learning algorithm with 9 of the 42 genes. On multivariate analysis, the significant predictors of mortality included high TRS (HR = 44.8), stage IV (HR = 28.1), intermediate TRS (HR = 4.75), and positive lymph node status (HR = 2.92). Approximately 18% of earlier-stage patients were identified as a poor-prognosis subgroup with high TRS.

We aimed to elucidate the sensitivity to therapeutics in gemcitabine-resistant breast cancer models. Pooled library screening combined with RNA-seq was conducted to explore the potential targets involved in gemcitabine resistance in breast cancer cells. Cytotoxicity and tumor xenograft assays were used to evaluate the effect of calcium-activated channel subfamily N member 4 (KCNN4) inhibitors on the cellular sensitivity of breast cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs both in vitro and in vivo. We found that KCNN4 is an important determinant for the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine. Elevated KCNN4 expression enhanced resistance to chemotherapeutic antimetabolites and promoted cell proliferation. Conversely, silencing KCNN4 or chemical inhibition of KCNN4 by the specific inhibitor TRAM-34 inhibited the chemoresistance and cell proliferation. Mechanistically, KCNN4 upregulated BCL2-related protein A1 (BCL2A1) to suppress apoptosis by activating RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling. Moreover, high expression levels of KCNN4 and BCL2A1 were associated with shortened disease-free survival in the cohort studies. Collectively, our findings showed that KCNN4 is a key modulator of progression and drug resistance in breast cancer, indicating that targeting KCNN4 may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome multidrug chemoresistance in this disease.",

    "abstract": "Brachytherapy (BT) delivers integrated boost doses to the central tumor while sparing the surrounding organs at risk (OARs) efficiently. It's a mandatory treatment component for locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) because it results in excellent overall survival and local control compared with other dose boosting modalities. Currently, BT is undergoing a transition from 2-dimensional (2D) to 3-dimensional (3D) treatment planning. Imaging-guided BT (IGBT) employing computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can provide exact individual delineation of target and OARs meanwhile prescribe the dose to the target volume instead of point A for X-ray-based BT. There are three main techniques for BT: intracavitary (IC), interstitial (IS), and intracavitary/interstitial (IC/IS) combination. The applicator choice depends on the specific tumor extension. The real-time transabdominal ultrasound (US)-guided applicator placement technique is strongly recommended to ensure ideal applicator positioning. MRI is the ideal standard imaging for BT owing to its superior soft tissue visualization than CT. However, CT-based BT is more often performed because of the availability. In developing countries, US-based BT can be adopted. For treatment planning, the applicator reconstruction is easier on CT than on MRI, because the applicator image is more clearly visible. Individual treatment planning should be performed for every single applicator insertion to ensure dose accuracy. In this review article, we explain the main clinical process and common techniques, including the applicator choice and placement, imaging techniques, target delineation, and treatment planning; asthose will help to improve the efficiency of 3D BT.",

Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the mechanism of the acquired resistance and overcome it for effective NSCLC therapy. In this experimental study, a stable gefitinib resistant lung adenocarcinoma cell line (PC9/GR) infected with shRNA-c-kit-homo-1386 were established; c-kit siRNA and c-kit inhibitors were used to block c-kit signaling; the acquired resistance of PC9/GR cells and the effects of c-kit siRNA and c-kit inhibitors on the growth and invasion of PC9/GR cells were investigated with CCK-8 assay, colony formation and cell invasion assays in vitro; the tumor growth inhibition effects of c-kit inhibitors on PC9/GR cell generated tumors were tested in vivo; the mechanisms involved in the acquired resistance reverse, growth and invasion inhibition effects of c-kit siRNA and c-kit inhibitors on PC9/GR cells were evaluated with qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry staining. The proliferation, colony formation, and invasion of PC9/GR cells were decreased by c-kit siRNA and inhibitors in vitro significantly; c-kit inhibitors suppressed the tumor growth of PC9/GR cell generated tumors in vivo. In the stable shRNA-c-kit transfected PC9/GR cells, the protein expressions of c-kit signaling and stemness phenotype related proteins, including ALDH1A1, Oct4, Sox2 and ABCG2 were decreased, and EMT phenotype related protein expressions including vimentin, N-cadherin, and Slug, were downregulated and with upregulation of E-cadherin; c-kit inhibitors reduced stemness phenotype related protein expressions, downregulated EMT phenotype related protein expressions including vimentin, N-cadherin, and Slug, with upregulation of E-cadherin, and the stemness related protein expressions of c-kit, ALDH1A1, ABCG2 and EMT-related proteins of vimentin and slug were decreased in the imatinib treated tumor tissues. The findings of this study indicated that c-kit signaling mediated the acquired gefitinib resistance, cell growth, invasion, stemness and EMT phenotype of PC9/GR cells. Targeting c-kit signaling with c-kit siRNA and small molecule c-kit inhibitors might overcome the acquired gefitinib resistance, and inhibit PC9/GR cell growth in vitro and in vivo.",

The DEAH-box polypeptide 36 (DHX36) has been identified as a dominant nucleic acid helicase which targets and disrupts DNA and RNA G4s in an ATP-dependent manner. However, the actual role of DHX36 in breast cancer remains unknown. In this study, we observed that the gene expression of DHX36 was positively associated with patient survival in breast cancer. The abundance of DHX36 is also linked with pathologic conditions and the stage of breast cancer. By using the xenograft mouse model, we demonstrated that the stable knockdown of DHX36 via lentivirus in breast cancer cells significantly promoted tumour growth. We also found that, after the DHX36 knockdown (KD), the invasion of triple-negative breast cancer cells was enhanced. In addition, we found a significant increase in the number of cells in the S-phase and a reduction of apoptosis with the response to cisplatin. DHX36 KD also desensitized the cytotoxic cellular response to paclitaxel and cisplatin. Transcriptomic profiling analysis by RNA sequencing indicated that DHX36 altered gene expression profile through the upstream activation of TNF, IFNγ, NFκb and TGFβ1. High throughput signalling analysis showed that one cluster of stress-associated kinase proteins including p53, ROCK1 and JNK were suppressed, while the mitotic checkpoint protein-serine kinases CDK1 and CDK2 were activated, as a consequence of the DHX36 knockdown. Our study reveals that DHX36 functions as a tumour suppressor and may be considered as a potential therapeutic target in breast cancer.",

In this study, ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2I (UBE2I), a small ubiquitin-like modifier E2 enzyme reportedly expressed in tumors, was examined for its potential effects in HCC. Bioinformatics analysis was performed based on HCCDB, TIMER, and Kaplan-Meier plotter databases to explore the clinical implications in HCC. An siRNA kit was used to downregulate UBE2I, and in vitro experiments-including migration, invasion and proliferation assays-were performed to examine UBE2I expression in HCC. Western blot (WB) was used to determine whether downregulated UBE2I expression influenced the prognosis of HCC via autophagy pathways. Finally, RNA-sequencing was performed to explore candidate molecular mechanisms underlying the effect of UBE2I. Bioinformatics analysis including stratification by alcohol ingestion and hepatitis status in HCC showed that highly expressed UBE2I was not only correlated with poor prognosis, but was also associated with immune infiltrates. In vitro experiments showed that high expression of UBE2I was associated with increased migration, invasion and proliferation of HCC cells. WB results indicated that downregulated expression of UBE2I was associated with higher levels of autophagy-related proteins including LC3A/B, Beclin-1 and ATG16L1. Moreover, RNA-sequencing results suggested that UBE2I was involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, non-alcohol fatty liver disease, steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis, inflammation, hepatoblastoma, tumor angiogenesis, type 2 mellitus diabetes, biliary tract disease and other diseases. We conclude that oncogene UBE2I is associated with poor prognosis of HCC via autophagy pathways and may be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis, tumor angiogenesis, non-alcohol fatty liver disease and inflammation.",

Furthermore, the expression levels of RNF152 were increased following in vivo and in vitro treatment with p8. We also found that p8 leads to the accumulation of cleaved PARP1 in CRC cells.

In contrast, overexpression of HP1BP3 significantly enhanced tumor growth and metastasis in Eca-109 cells.

Pre-TAE characteristics including age, gender, etiology, liver biochemistry, Child-Pugh classification, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, the presence of shock, tumor staging and post TAE liver function were compared between patients with and without post-TAE 30-day mortality. Results A total of 186 patients were enrolled. The successful hemostatic rate after embolization was 91.4% and the median overall survival was 224 days. The 30-day cumulative mortality rate is 20.4%. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, male [aOR: 0.25, P=0.034] MELD score [aOR: 13.61, P Conclusion TAE is effective for the initial hemostasis in patients with HCC rupture. MELD score ≥13 rather than only total bilirubin level >3 mg/dL be more predictive of post TAE 30-day mortality.",

    "abstract": "Background: Sintilimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the programmed cell death 1 (PD-L1). We aimed to assess the safety and activity of sintilimab monotherapy or in combination with chemotherapy in advanced solid tumors. Methods: This phase Ib study included six cohorts. Cohort A-C were sintilimab monotherapy settings, and enrolled pretreated patients (2/3 L cohorts). Cohort D-F were treatment-naive patients (1 L cohorts), and received sintilimab plus different chemotherapies. The primary endpoints were safety and objective response rate (ORR). Exploratory endpoints were potential biomarkers for the prognosis after treatment, such as tumor mutation burden scores (TMB), PD-L1 and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR). Results: The ORR was 14.6% in the 2/3 L cohorts (n=146), and 73.2% in the 1 L cohorts (n=61). The incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 55 patients (37.7%) in 2/3 L cohorts, and in 38 (62.3%) in 1 L cohorts. 157 patients had available TMB scores, and in 2/3 L cohorts, patients in the high TMB groups (TMB≥10) showed a longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than those in the low TMB groups (TMB<10). No significant differences in PFS and OS were observed across different PD-L1 groups in both 1 L and 2/3 L cohorts. A high LMR was significantly associated with an improved PFS in 1 L cohorts (P=0.022). Conclusion: Sintilimab alone or combined with chemotherapy had a tolerable safety profile in solid tumors. The combination therapy showed a favorable activity with advanced non-small cell lung cancer and gastric or esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma. LMR might be a prognostic factor for the combination regimen in these patients.

However, the clinical impact of postoperative PNI is still unclear, and there have been no reports on the significance of postoperative PNI in patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy (AC). We retrospectively analysed 227 consecutive patients who underwent AC after radical surgery for high-risk stage II or stage III CRC. PNI value was calculated before radical surgery and before the introduction of AC. In our study, patients with a low PNI value before surgery showed significantly poorer long-term outcomes than those with a high PNI value. Next, we divided the patients into four groups: patients with a high PNI value before surgery and remained after surgery (Group High-High), a high PNI value before surgery but decreased after surgery (Group High-Low), a low PNI value before surgery but recovered after surgery (Group Low-High), and a low PNI value but did not recover after surgery (Group Low-Low). Although the patients in Group Low-Low showed significantly poorer long-term outcomes than those in Group High-High, the prognosis of patients in Group Low-High was the same as that of patients in Group High-High. In addition, in patients with recurrence after AC, those with a high PNI value at the time of recurrence showed a significantly better survival after recurrence than patients with a low PNI value. Postoperative PNI value could be a prognostic biomarker for CRC patients undergoing AC. Even though the PNI value was low before the surgery, recovery of PNI value by the introduction of AC could improve the prognosis of CRC patients.",

Moreover, the prognostic value of currently used necrosis analysis is debatable. New markers of the therapeutic response or the prognostic response are urgently needed. The microenvironment plays a key role in the vascularization of highly heterogeneous tumors. Using the syngeneic MOS-J mouse model of osteosarcoma, we focused our study on the immunohistochemistry of tumor vascularization in order to identify new vessel markers, and to search for potential markers of the therapeutic response. Endomucin+, CD31+, and α-SMA+-positive elements were quantified in control (n=6) and doxorubicin-treated (n=6) mice in three different intra-tumor locations. We also used co-labeling to assess CD31+/Endomucin+ and CD31+/α-SMA+ co-expression. We identified a central tumor zone with a low vascularization profile for all of these markers. We identified two distinct types of vessels: CD31+/Endomucin+ vessels with a sprouting, neo-angiogenic, interlaced appearance, and CD31+/α-SMA+ vessel with a well-defined, mature structure. Doxorubicin appeared to reduce CD31+ expression in the tumor invasion front. In the doxorubicin-sensitive model, there were four times more CD31+/α-SMA+ elements than in the poorly responsive model. Therefore, we propose a methodology based on immunohistochemistry and multiplexed immunofluorescence to use endomucin as a promising new vascular marker in the osteosarcoma model. Moreover, our results suggest that CD31+/α-SMA+ vessels could be considered to be indicators of vasculature normalization and they may be used as specific markers of a good therapeutic response.",

    "abstract": "The Wnt/β-catenin pathway, which is associated with disease progression, is activated in many cancers. Tankyrase (TNKS) has received attention as a target molecule for Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibition. We identified K-476, a novel TNKS inhibitor, a dual pocket binder that binds to both the nicotinamide and ADP-ribose pockets. In a human colon cancer cell line, K-476 specifically and potently inhibited TNKS and led to stabilization of the Axin protein, resulting in Wnt/β-catenin pathway suppression. Aberrant Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation was recently reported as a possible mechanism of ineffectiveness in immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) treatment. Because the Wnt/β-catenin pathway activation causes dendritic cell inactivation and suppresses chemokine production, resulting in a paucity of CD8+ T cells in tumor tissue, which is an important effector of ICIs. Thus, TNKS inhibitors may enhance the efficacy of ICIs. To examine whether K-476 enhances the antitumor effect of anti-PD-L1 antibodies, K-476 was administered orally with an anti-PD-L1 antibody to melanoma-bearing C57BL/6J mice. Although K-476 was ineffective as a monotherapy, it significantly enhanced the antitumor effect in combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody. In mice, intra-tumor infiltration of CD8+ T cells was increased by combination treatment. K-476 upregulated the chemokine expression (e.g., Ccl3 and Ccl4), which attracted CD8+ T cells. This was considered to contribute to the increased CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, while the potential gastrointestinal toxicity of TNKS inhibitors has been reported, it was not observed at effective doses. Thus, K-476 could be an attractive therapeutic option to enhance the efficacy of ICIs.",

We investigated the genetically predicted C-reactive protein (CRP) phenotype in the potential causal pathway of primary CRC risk in postmenopausal women in a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework. We employed individual-level data of the Women's Health Initiative Database for Genotypes and Phenotypes Study, which consists of 5 genome-wide association (GWA) studies, including 10,142 women, 737 of whom developed primary CRC. We examined 61 GWA single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with CRP by using weighted/penalized MR weighted-medians and MR gene-environment interactions that allow some relaxation of the strict variable requirements and attenuate the heterogeneous estimates of outlying SNPs. In lifestyle-stratification analyses, genetically determined CRP exhibited its effects on the decreased CRC risk in non-viscerally obese and high-fat diet subgroups. In contrast, genetically driven CRP was associated with an increased risk for CRC in women who smoked ≥ 15 cigarettes/day, with significant interaction of the gene-smoking relationship. Further, a substantially increased risk of CRC induced by CRP was observed in relatively short-term users ( 10 years) of E plus progestin. Our findings may provide novel evidence on immune-related etiologic pathways connected to CRC risk and suggest the possible use of CRP as a CRC-predictive biomarker in women with particular behaviors and CRP marker-informed interventions to reduce CRC risk.",

Overexpression of CD146 in different types of tumors, including breast tumor, has been associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. Non-invasive detection of CD146 with a monoclonal antibody may provide a noninvasive diagnostic tool with high specificity and accountability.Herein, we have developed a CD146-specific monoclonal antibody (YY146), radiolabeled it with 52Mn and 89Zr and identified its capability in acting as a non-invasive imaging agent that specific targets CD146 in different murine breast cancer models. CD146 expression was first screened in different breast tumor cell lines through Western Blot and confirmed its binding ability to YY146 using Flow Cytometry. Serial immunoPET images were carried out after intravenous administration of 52Mn or 89Zr labeled YY146. In addition, we also performed in vivo fluorescence imaging in animals injected with YY146 conjugated with Cy5.5.Western Blot results show that MDA-MB-435 cell line had greater levels of CD146 expression when compared to the other cell lines investigated. Flow cytometry confirmed binding ability of YY146. PET images revealed well correlated uptake between tumor uptake and CD146 expression levels, confirmed by biodistribution studies and fluorescence imaging.PET imaging, for up to 7 days, of mice bearing three different breast tumors were carried out and revealed radiotracer uptake in tumors that strongly (r2 = 0.98, P < 0.01), correlated with CD146 expression levels, as confirmed by in vitro and ex vivo studies.",

However, additional research is needed to uncover the features of cancer biology, which would allow to design new and more effective treatment strategies for cancer patients. Since RabGTPases and their effectors are frequently altered in cancer, their role in a regulation of cell division leading to the acquisition of cancer cell-like phenotype has drawn a lot of attention from different research groups in recent years. Both, Rab11 and Rab35 belong to a superfamily of small monomeric GTPases that regulate a diverse array of cellular functions. Lately, Rab11 and Rab35 were declared as oncogenic, and because of their association with abundant cellular functions, a linkage to the induction of cancer, has been proposed. Although the clear connection between the improper regulation of Rab11 or Rab35 and the initiation of tumorigenicity has only beginning to emerge, in this review we will discuss the newest findings regarding the participation of RabGTPases in a control of cell division and promotion of tumorigenesis, trying to link the actual function to the cancer causality.",

Development of resistance to standard platinum and taxane based chemotherapy and recurrence of the disease necessitate development of novel drugs to halt disease progression. An established concept is to target molecular and signaling pathways that substantially contribute to development of drug resistance and disease progression. We have previously shown that, monepantel (MPL) a novel small molecule acetonitrile derivative is highly effective in suppressing growth, proliferation and colony formation of ovarian cancer cells. These effects are achieved through inhibition of the mTOR/p70S6K pathway in cancer cells. The present study was conducted to find in vivo corroboration and explore the effect of MPL om other growth stimulating putative signaling pathways. Here, female nude mice with subcutaneous OVCAR-3 xenografts were treated with 25 and 50 mg/kg doses of MPL administered (IP) three times weekly for 2 weeks. At the doses employed, MPL was modestly effective at suppressing tumor growth, but highly effective in inhibiting, mTOR, P70S6K and 4EBP1. There were also modest reductions in tumor cyclin D1 and retinoblastoma protein expression. Furthermore, it was found that MPL treatment causes down-regulation of IGF-1R, and c-MYC thus unveiling new dimensions to the growing antitumor actions of this potential anticancer drug. MPL treatment led to reduced tumor volume and weights without causing any detectable side effects. Coupled with the recent human safety data published on this molecule, expanded future trials are highly anticipated.",

    "abstract": "Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) are among the most serious complications after solid organ transplantation (SOT). Monomorphic diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common subtype of PTLD. Historically, outcomes of PTLD have been poor with high mortality rates and allograft loss, although this has improved in the last 10 years. Most of our understanding about PTLD DLBCL is extrapolated from studies in non-PTLD DLBCL, and while several clinical factors have been identified and validated for predicting non-PTLD DLBCL outcomes, the molecular profile of PTLD DLBCL has not yet been characterized. Compartment-specific metabolic reprograming has been described in non-PTLD DLBCL with a lactate uptake metabolic phenotype with high monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) expression associated with worse outcomes. The aim of our study was to compare the outcomes of PTLD in our transplant center to historic cohorts, as well as study a subgroup of our PTLD DLBCL tumors and compare metabolic profiles with non-PTLD DLBCL. We performed a retrospective single institution study of all adult patients who underwent a SOT between the years 1992-2018, who were later diagnosed with PTLD. All available clinical information was extracted from the patients' medical records. Tumor metabolic markers were studied in a subgroup of PTLD DLBCL and compared to a group of non-PTLD DLBCL. Thirty patients were diagnosed with PTLD following SOT in our center. Median time from SOT to PTLD diagnosis was 62.8 months (IQR 7.6; 134.4), with 37% of patients diagnosed with early PTLD, and 63% with late PTLD. The most common PTLD subtype was DLBCL. Most patients were treated with reduction of their immunosuppression (RIS) including a group who were switched from calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) to mTOR inhibitor based IS, in conjunction with standard anti-lymphoma chemoimmunotherapy. Progression free survival of the PTLD DLBCL cohort was calculated at 86% at 1 year, and 77% at 3 and 5-years, with overall survival of 86% at 1 and 3-years, and 75% at 5 years. Death censored allograft survival in the kidney cohort was 100% at 1 year, and 93% at 3, 5 and 10 years. MCT1 H scores were significantly higher in a subset of the non-PTLD DLBCL patients than in a PTLD DLBCL cohort. Our data is concordant with improved PTLD outcomes in the last 10 years. mTOR inhibitors could be an alternative to CNI as a RIS strategy. Finally, PTLD DLBCL may have a distinct metabolic profile with reduced MCT1 expression compared to non-PTLD DLBCL, but further studies are needed to corroborate our limited cohort findings and to determine if a specific metabolic profile is associated with outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Tenascin-C is upregulated during inflammation and tumorigenesis, and its expression level is correlated with a poor prognosis in several malignancies. Nevertheless, the substantial role of tenascin-C in cancer progression is poorly understood. Previously, we found that a peptide derived from tenascin-C, termed TNIIIA2, acts directly on tumor cells to activate β1-integrin and induce malignant progression. Here, we show that β1-integrin activation by TNIIIA2 in human fibroblasts indirectly contributes to cancer progression through the induction of cellular senescence. Prolonged treatment of fibroblasts with TNIIIA2 induced cellular senescence, as characterized by the suppression of cell growth and the induction of senescence-associated-β-galactosidase and p16INK4a expression. The production of reactive oxygen species and subsequent DNA damage were responsible for the TNIIIA2-induced senescence of fibroblasts. Interestingly, peptide FNIII14, which inactivates β1-integrin, inhibited fibroblast senescence induced not only by TNIIIA2 but also by H2O2, suggesting that β1-integrin activation plays a critical role in the induction of senescence in fibroblasts. Moreover, TNIIIA2-induced senescent fibroblasts secreted heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), which caused preneoplastic epithelial HaCaT cells to acquire malignant properties, including colony-forming and focus-forming abilities. Thus, our study demonstrates that tenascin-C-derived peptide TNIIIA2 induces cellular senescence in fibroblasts through β1-integrin activation, causing cancer progression via the secretion of humoral factors such as HB-EGF.",

A Phase 1 clinical trial featuring AdAPT-001 is ongoing (NCT04673942). AdAPT-001, a type 5 adenovirus, which carries a TGF-β trap transgene that neutralizes the immunosuppressive cytokine, TGF-β, has been shown in an immunocompetent mouse model to eradicate both locally injected and non-injected tumors. Single dose biodistribution of the TGF-β trap transgene was also evaluated in tumor bearing mice, providing an explanation for systemic activity. The biodistribution and toxicity of a single administration of mouse AdAPT-001 (mAdAPT-001) in 129S1 immunocompetent mice bearing ADS-12 tumors (mouse lung carcinoma) were assessed. mAdAPT-001 was injected intratumorally and intravenously in groups of 25 mice each at varying dose levels. Soluble TGF-β trap was detected in the serum using ELISA. A single AdAPT-001 injection resulted in non-negligible long-term TGF-β trap persistence in the serum over the 14-day study after intravenous and intratumoral administration. No TGF-β-related toxicity was observed. At clinically relevant doses, AdAPT-001 was safe and well tolerated. Systemic levels of the TGF-β trap transgene were observed from both local and intravenous dosing.",

    "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is one of the deadliest gynecological malignancies and lacks treatments that do not significantly impact patient health-related quality of life. Exercise has been associated with reduced cancer risk and improved clinical outcomes; however the underlying molecular mechanisms are unknown. In this study, we utilized a treadmill-running exercise model to investigate the effects of exercise on high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) progression and chemotherapy outcomes. We found that treadmill-running suppressed peritoneal colonization of tumors in a syngeneic mouse ovarian cancer model. Acute exercise stimulated the production of CCL2 and IL-15 in the peritoneal microenvironment while downregulating CCL22, VEGF, and CCL12. Using a co-culture model, we demonstrated the role of CCL2 in mediating the activity of peritoneal cells to inhibit cancer cell viability. We showed that the activation of M1 macrophages may contribute to the exercise-induced changes in the peritoneal microenvironment. We identified that chronic exercise modulates gene expression of intraperitoneal fat tissues related to lipid formation, thermogenesis, browning, and inflammation, which can contribute to inhibiting the colonization of metastatic ovarian cancer. Treadmill running also lowered blood urea nitrogen levels and reduced incidence of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia during chemotherapy in a mouse model, suggesting the potential beneficial effects of exercise in improving chemotherapy outcomes. Our data provided new insights into the acute and chronic effects of physical activity on ovarian cancer at the molecular and in vivo levels.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive and common malignant neoplasm. Nevertheless, a 5-year survival rate of patients with GBM has remained below 5%. Artemisia princeps PAMPANINI, used as a food and traditional medicine, have shown beneficial properties including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-cancer activities. Thus, this study aimed to investigate biological mechanism of a bioactive compound, jaceosidin (JAC), isolated from A. princeps in human GBM T98G cells. Herein, as a result of analysis in terms of cancer survival and death, we found that JAC significantly reduced cell survival against T98G cells. In addition, JAC increased apoptotic cell death via changes on morphological and molecular phenotypes in T98G cells as evidenced by cellular shapes and DNA fragmentation. The apoptotic cell death was confirmed by the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP, the downregulation of survivin and Bcl-2. Moreover, JAC decreased the expression of cyclinD1 and Cdks and increased the phosphorylation of EKR, JNK, and p38 MAPKs. Specifically, JAC suppressed the PI3K/AKT signaling and its downstream molecules including p70S6, GSK3β, and β-catenin. In addition, as a result of analysis in terms of metastasis using wound healing and Boyden chamber assays, JAC showed anti-migrative and anti-invasive activities. Finally, we analyzed in terms of autophagy and necroptosis that are modes of programmed cell survival and death different from apoptosis in T98G cells. We found that JAC inhibited autophgic regulatory proteins including Beclin-1, Atgs, and LC3A/B, thereby reducing autophagic-mediated cell survival, whereas JAC did not affect phosphorylation of key proteins in necroptosis, especially MLKL. Given these findings, our results provided novel evidences on the biological mechanisms of JAC in T98G cells, suggesting that JAC may be a therapeutic agent for patients with GBM.",

In NeuT mice, a preclinical model or Her2-positive breast cancer, we previously reported that p140Cap counteracts Her2-dependent breast cancer progression, associating with the specific Rac1 Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor, Tiam1, and limiting the activation of both Tiam1 and Rac1. Here, we show that in TUBO breast cancer cells derived from the NeuT tumors, p140Cap expression causes Tiam1 redistribution along the apicobasal junctional axis. Furthermore, p140Cap and Tiam1 interact with E-cadherin, a member of the adherence junction, with a concomitant increase of E-cadherin at the cell membrane. We characterized biochemically the interaction between p140Cap and Tiam1, showing that the amino terminal region of p140Cap (1-287 amino acids) is sufficient to associate with full length Tiam1, and with the truncated catalytic domain of Tiam1, with a concomitant decrease of the Tiam1 activity. Moreover, in a large cohort of Her2 positive breast cancer, high levels of SRCIN1 expression positively correlates with increased survival in patients with high TIAM1 expression. Overall, our findings sustain a protective role of p140Cap in Her2 positive breast cancer, where p140Cap can associate with Tiam1 and negatively regulate the Tiam1/Rac1 axis.",

However, due to the heterogeneity of tumour, how each individual cell responds to IR differently is unclear. We report here a heterogeneous cellular response to IR by single cell transcriptome sequencing. We utilized the barcoded Smart-seq2 single cell transcriptome sequencing technology in breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 both without and with IR treatment. To further understand how ATM, a major hub protein required for an optimal DNA damage response, affected the heterogeneous IR response, we also knocked down ATM gene for single cell transcriptome sequencing. Single cell t-SNE analysis showed four clusters of cells responding to IR in distinctive ways: Cluster 1 changed the least; Cluster 2 responded to IR by upregulating ribosome associated genes, while Cluster 4 upregulated both ribosome and G1/S phase associated genes; Cluster 3 was a new cluster, which appeared only in irradiated cells. In the absence of ATM kinase, cells displayed much less transcriptional changes after IR. And Cluster 4 in wild-type cells, which had the greatest change in response to IR, was not present in the ATM knock-down cells. We also selected three IR-induced genes for functional validation in both MDA-MB-231 and an additional breast cancer cell line to demonstrate their importance in radiation sensitivity. Taken together, our single cell transcriptome analysis has revealed a heterogeneous cellular response to DNA damage induced by IR and identified potential biomarkers of radiation sensitivity.",

Multiple PARP inhibitors have been developed and have shown remarkable clinical benefits. However, treatment-related toxicities, especially the hematologic toxicities, are common and restrict the clinical applications of PARP inhibitors. In this study, we designed the first glucuronide prodrug of PARP inhibitor, TSL-1502, based on a novel and highly potent PARP inhibitor TSL-1502M. TSL-1502M exhibited promising inhibitory activity on PARP1/2, significantly induced DNA double strand breaks, G2/M arrest and apoptosis in HR-deficient cells, selectively inhibited the proliferation of HR-deficient cancer cells and sensitized both HR-deficient and HR-proficient cancer cells to conventional chemotherapy. Notably, TSL-1502M was superior to olaparib, the first-in-class PARP inhibitor, in all these processes. TSL-1502 had no inhibitory effects on PARP1/2 itself, but could selectively liberate the active drug TSL-1502M in tumor after administration in nude mice. Moreover, TSL-1502 elicited significant more potent inhibitory effects than olaparib in HR-deficient tumors, and sensitized chemotherapy in both HR-deficient and HR-proficient tumors. No severe toxicities were caused by TSL-1502 in this study. Based on the encouraging preclinical antitumor activity and the selective decomposition characteristic of TSL-1502, a clinical phase I study was initiated in China, and an Investigational New Drug (IND) was granted by the US FDA.

These cases included seven patients with T-LGLL, two with mixed-phenotype LGLL, and one with CLPD-NK. Subsequently, gene mutation screening for commonly myeloid-related or lymphoid-related genes was performed in MDS-LGLL patients by using next generation sequencing (NGS).

PI3K pathway activation has been detected in tamoxifen-resistant ER- breast lesions of patients. Here, we further ratified that the PI3K pathway is significantly activated in premalignant ER- breast lesions compared with paired normal tissues of patients, which prompted our assessment of targeting PI3K on inhibition of ER- mammary tumor initiation and progression. Both genetic knockdown of PIK3CA or intervention with low-doses of a PI3K inhibitor (GDC-0941) prevented the dysplasia phenotype of semi-transformed human ER- mammary epithelial cells in 3-dimensional culture in vitro. Importantly, low-dose GDC-0941 treatment significantly delayed mammary tumor initiation in the MMTV-neu mouse model without exhibiting discernable adverse effects. Interestingly, increased CD8+/GZMB+ T-cells were detected in mammary tissue after GDC-0941 treatment, suggesting enhanced immune surveillance. Mechanistically, elevated expression of potent T-cell chemo-attractants, including CCL5 and CXCL10, were detected both in vitro and in vivo after GDC-0941 treatment. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K significantly increased T-cell recruitment in a CCL5/CXCL10-dependent manner. In human ER- breast cancer, PI3K activation is correlated with significantly reduced CCL5, CXCL10 and CD8A expression, suggesting that the decreased CD8+ T-cell recruitment and escape of immune surveillance may contribute to ER- breast cancer development. In summary, our study indicates that low-dose PI3K inhibitor treatment may intervene early stage ER- breast cancer development by enhancing immune surveillance via CCL5/CXCL10.",

    "abstract": "The morbidity and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks fourth worldwide, moreover, the tumor microenvironment (TME) of CRC is quite complex, and is one of the necessary factors affecting promotion of tumor metastasis. PTPN2 is a tumor suppressor which plays an important role in cancer-related downstream molecular pathway. FSP-1 is highly-expressed in multiple types of tumor tissues and is a biomarker of stromal fibroblasts. To examine the function of PTPN2 in the metastasis of CRC, the study evaluated the co-expression level of PTPN2 and FSP-1 in CRC tissues by double staining, and demonstrated the relationship with clinical information about each patient. The roles of PTPN2 and FSP-1 were detected in vitro by proliferation and transwell assay through knockdown of expression level of PTPN2. Lower PTPN2 with higher FSP-1 expression was correlated with poor survival outcomes in CRC. TAFs contribute to the migration function of PTPN2 in CRC in vitro through inducing changes in the level of TGF-β1. Western blot and qRT-PCR assays were used to detect the mechanism of PTPN2 regulation of migration with TAFs in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, moreover, TAFs contributed the function of PTPN2 in colorectal carcinogenesis in vivo. In summary, the study shed light on the effect of TAFs contributes the function of PTPN2 in colorectal carcinogenesis through activating JAK/STAT signaling pathway.

    "abstract": "The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling pathways are critical for normal human physiology, and any alteration in their regulation leads to several human cancers. These pathways are well interconnected and share a survival mechanism for escaping the depressant effect of antagonists. Therefore, novel small molecules capable of targeting both pathways with minimal or no toxicity are better alternatives to current drugs, which are disadvantaged by their accompanying resistance and toxicity. In this study, we demonstrate that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR/MEK is a crucial oncoimmune signature in multiple cancers. Moreover, we describe NSC777213, a novel isoflavone core and cobimetinib-inspired small molecule, which exhibit both antiproliferative activities against all panels of NCI60 human tumor cell lines (except COLO205 and HT29) and a selective cytotoxic preference for melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), brain, renal, and ovarian cancer cell lines. Notably, for NSC777213 treatment, chemoresistant ovarian cancer cell lines, including SK-OV-3, OVCAR-3, OVCAR-4, and NCI/ADR-RES, exhibited a higher antiproliferative sensitivity (total growth inhibition (TGI) = 7.62-31.50 µM) than did the parental cell lines OVCAR-8 and IGROV1 (TGI > 100 µM). NSC777213 had a mechanistic correlation with clinical inhibitors of PI3K/AKT/mTOR/MEK. NSC777213 demonstrates robust binding interactions and higher affinities for AKT and mTOR than did isoflavone, and also demonstrate a higher affinity for human MEK-1 kinase than some MEK inhibitors under clinical developments. In addition, treatment of U251 and U87MG cells with NSC777213 significantly downregulated the expression levels of the total and phosphorylated forms of PI3K/AKT/mTOR/MEK. Our study suggests that NSC777213 is a promising PI3K/AKT/mTOR/MEK inhibitor for further preclinical and clinical evaluation as a chemotherapeutic agent, particularly for the treatment of NSCLC, melanoma, and brain, renal, and ovarian cancers.",

No data are currently available on the preclinical activity of the combination of linifanib, a CSF-1R inhibitor, and irinotecan in ATC. The aim of the study was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo activity of linifanib plus irinotecan. Proliferation and apoptosis assays were performed on 8305C and 8505C human ATC cell lines exposed to SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, linifanib alone, and their concomitant combination. Synergism was evaluated by the combination index method. Quantification of pospho-CSF-1R levels was performed by ELISA. In vivo ATC orthotopic xenografts were treated with the single drugs, or their combination, to evaluate their impact on survival. Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed on ATC tissue samples. Both SN-38 and linifanib inhibited in vitro the proliferation of 8305C and 8505C cells in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas their concomitant treatment revealed a strong synergism in the ATC cells. A significant pro-apoptotic activity was found in both ATC cell lines treated with linifanib alone and in combination with SN-38. Moreover, linifanib significantly decreased the levels of phospho-CSF-1R after 24 h and 72 h in both 8505C and 8305C cells, and this was also observed with the concomitant administration of SN-38. In vivo, the combination of linifanib and irinotecan produced a greater survival result than either monotherapy, and resulted in a significant higher median survival. In some of the mice the combination produced a complete response with a macroscopic disappearance of the disease, as confirmed by histology. In conclusion, the synergistic ATC antitumor activity of linifanib/irinotecan combination significantly increased the survival of ATC affected mice and induced some complete responses, suggesting a potential role of this schedule in ATC patient's treatment.",

Although some kinase inhibitors block TGFβ-induced invasion of embryonal RMS (ERMS) cells, the mechanism differs from breast and lung cancer cells since NR4A1 is extranuclear in ERMS cells. However, CDIM8 blocks basal and TGFβ-induced invasion of RD and SMS-CTR ERMS cell lines but not Rh30 alveolar RMS (ARMS) cells. Moreover, this response in ERMS cells was independent of SMAD7 degradation or activation of SMAD2/SMAD3. β-Catenin silencing decreased ERMS cell invasion and CDIM8 induced proteasome-independent downregulation of β-catenin. The novel mechanism of CDIM8-mediated inhibition of basal and TGFβ-induced ERMS cell invasion was due to activation of the Bcl-2-NR4A1 complex, mitochondrial disruption, induction of the tumor suppressor-like cytokine interleukin-24 (IL-24) which in turn downregulates β-catenin expression. Thus, the NR4A1 antagonist inhibits TGFβ-induced invasion of ERMS cells through initial targeting of cytosolic NR4A1.",

    "abstract": "Radiation therapy is an effective non-surgical means to achieve local control for various solid tumors including colorectal cancer (CRC), but metastasis and recurrences after conventional radiotherapy remains a major obstacle in clinical practice, and the knowledge concerning the changes of metastatic potential after heavy ion radiation is still limited. This study investigated how radiation, including γ- and carbon ion radiation, would change the metastatic capacity of two CRC cell lines, HCT116 and DLD-1, and examined the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that the migration and invasion was enhanced in DLD-1 cells but impaired in HCT116 cells in vitro and in vivo after radiation of γ-rays or carbons, and radiation induced epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) in DLD-1 cells but mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET) in HCT116 cells. The expression of snail, a key inducer of EMT, was significantly enhanced by inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) in both cell lines, suggesting the modulation of snail was alike in the two CRC cell lines. However, radiation inactivated GSK3β through stimulating the phosphorylation of AKT and GSK3β at Ser473 and Ser9 in DLD-1 cells respectively, but activated GSK3β by decreasing the expression of pAKTSer473 and pGSK3βSer9 or increasing the phosphorylation of GSK3β at Tyr216 in HCT116 cells. Therefore, the above inverted motility changes was due to the opposite modulation of AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway by radiation, which was further verified in other type of cancer cell lines including MCF-7, U251 and A549 cells. Moreover, it was found that annexin A2 (ANAX2) directly bound with GSK3β and acted as a negative regulator of GSK3β upon radiation. Knocking-down ANXA2 gene reversed the enhanced migration of the irradiated DLD-1 cells and strengthened radiation-impaired migration of HCT116 cells. Collectively, this study reveals that the change of cellular motility after radiation is independent of radiation type but is correlated with the inherent of cells.",

We retrospectively analyzed 77 consecutive pStage II and III gastric cancer (GC) patients, who underwent curative gastrectomy followed by adjuvant S-1 chemotherapy from 2008 through 2014. CTSD of 20000 mg was the upper-limit of cut-off value to stratify the prognosis (5-year relapse free survival (RFS); CTSD < 20000 mg vs. CTSD ≥ 20000 mg: 51.9% vs. 85.1%, P = 0.004).

Multivariate Cox's proportional hazards model for RFS proved that CTSD less than 20000 mg was an independent prognostic factor [P = 0.031, HR 3.32 (95% CI: 1.11-11.1)] although S-1 intensity and duration were not independent prognostic factors.

We further aimed to investigate the capacity and mechanism of this combination treatment using an in vivo mouse aggressive pancreatic cancer model. To this end, mice subcutaneously injected with KPC1199 pancreatic tumor cells were treated with IRE, followed by intraperitoneal injection of OX40 agonist. Tumor growth and animal survival were observed. Flow cytometry analysis, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence were used to evaluate the immune cell populations within the tumors. The tumor-specific immunity was assessed using ELISpot assay. Besides, the cytokine patterns both in serum and tumors were identified using Luminex assay. After combination therapy with IRE and OX40 agonist, 80% of the mice completely eradicated the established subcutaneous tumors, during the 120 days observation period. Rechallenging these tumor-free mice at day 120 with KPC1199 tumor cells leads to complete resistance to tumor growth, suggesting that the combination therapy generated long-term-specific antitumor immune memory. Moreover, combination therapy significantly delayed the growth of contralateral untreated tumors, and significantly prolonged animal survival, suggesting that a potent systematic anti-tumor immunity was induced by combination therapy. Mechanically, combination therapy amplified antitumor immune response induced by IRE, as manifested by the increased quality and quantity of CD8+ T cells trigged by IRE. Together, these results provide strong evidence for the clinical assessment of the combination of IRE and OX40 agonist in patients with pancreatic cancer.",

We aimed to include TRAIL receptor expression as an inclusion parameter in a future clinical study using a TRAIL-based therapy approach for PDAC patients. Considering the emerging influence of PDAC desmoplastic stroma on the efficacy of anti-PDAC therapies, this analysis was extended to tumor stromal cells. Additionally, we performed PDAC stroma characterization. Our retrospective cohort study (N=50) included patients with histologically confirmed PDAC who underwent surgery. The expression of TRAIL receptors (DR4, DR5, DcR1, DcR2, and OPG) in tumor and stromal cells was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The amount of tumor stroma was assessed by anti-vimentin IHC and Mallory's trichrome staining. The prognostic impact was determined by the univariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. An extensive expression of functional receptors DR4 and DR5 and a variable expression of decoy receptors were detected in PDAC tumor and stromal cells. Functional receptors were detected also in metastatic tumor and stromal cells. A poor prognosis was associated with low or absent expression of decoy receptors in tumor cells of primary PDAC. After assessing that almost 80% of tumor mass was composed of stroma, we correlated a cellular-dense stroma in primary PDAC with reduced relapse-free survival. We demonstrated that TRAIL functional receptors are widely expressed in PDAC, representing a promising target for TRAIL-based therapies. Further, we demonstrated that a low expression of DcR1 and the absence of OPG in tumor cells, as well as a cellular-dense tumor stroma, could negatively impact the prognosis of PDAC patients.",

This study pilot-tested a community-based mass-media campaign aimed at improving knowledge and awareness of early-onset CRC in this population. The campaign (#CRCandMe) was deployed from June to September 2023 in Utah and Wisconsin. To evaluate its success (reach) and inform future campaigns, key performance indicators were defined (e.g., impressions, website traffic). To evaluate change in knowledge in the target population, the knowledge and awareness of participants recruited via consumer panels was assessed at baseline (n=235) and follow-up (n=161). The number of correct answers for each of seven knowledge items was calculated at baseline (pre-intervention) and follow-up (post-intervention). McNemar's test was employed to assess significant differences in the seven knowledge items between the two timepoints. The campaign delivered over 26.7 million impressions and nearly 43,000 clicks. A 15-second video ad received 221,985 plays, with 57,270 users watching to completion. Pre-survey results revealed that while 74% of participants were able to correctly identify CRC signs, only 18% could identify risk factors. Knowledge scores slightly improved from baseline to follow-up, with statistically significance for the question related to CRC signs (P=0.0004). This study demonstrated wide reach and may inform future larger-scale interventions and public health initiatives aimed at reducing CRC incidence and improving health outcomes for at-risk adults aged under 50 years.",

Cezanne expression is positively associated with IGF-1R expression. High Cezanne expression correlates with poor patient survival in NSCLC, yet the underlying mechanisms are not well defined. Methods: Co-Immunoprecipitation assay was performed to investigate the interactions between Cezanne and IGF-1R. A xenograft model was established to assess the efficacy of Cezanne on cancer progression in vivo. Cezanne overexpressing and Cezanne knockdown NSCLC cell lines were generated using lentiviral vectors. The effects of Cezanne and IGF-1R on cell proliferation of non-small-cell lung cancer were evaluated via Sulforhodamine B assay and colony formation assays. Results: Here, through co-Immunoprecipitation assay, we find Cezanne interacts with IGF-1R in tumor cells. Depletion of Cezanne promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of IGF-1R. Congruently, Cezanne regulates the protein level of IGF-1R and downstream AKT signaling pathway. Cezanne promotes proliferation of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. In line with the change of IGF-1R downstream signaling pathway, IGF-1-induced growth signals recover cell proliferation of tumor cells with Cezanne knockdown. Conclusion: Mechanistically, Cezanne directly targets IGF-1R by deubiquitination and stabilization. This leads to AKT activation, which bolsters tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. These findings reveal Cezanne as a regulator of tumor cell proliferation via IGF-1R signaling pathway and a potential target for NSCLC therapy.",

In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between vesicle genetic alterations and CRC progression. To achieve this, we analyzed molecular alterations in CRC vesicle genes at eight levels, including mRNA, protein, and epigenetic levels. Additionally, we examined CRC overall survival-related genes that were obtained from a public database. Our analysis of chromatin structural variants, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, and proteins (including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and malonylation), along with RNA-seq data from the TCGA database, revealed multiple levels of alterations in CRC vesicle genes in the collected tissue samples. We progressively examined the alterations of vesicle genes in mRNA and protein levels in CRC and discovered the hub genes. Further investigation identified the probable essential transcription factors. This study contributes to a thorough knowledge of the connection between vesicle gene alterations at multiple levels and the development of CRC and offers a theoretical framework for the identification of novel treatment targets.",

    "abstract": "The immune system plays a key role in detecting and fighting cancerous tumors. T cells are a crucial component in both natural and therapeutic cancer immunoediting responses, but it is unclear if they are the primary agents of these processes. In this study, patients with lung lesions detected by CT scan were selected, and their peripheral blood samples were analyzed for T cell population and serum cytokines/chemokines. T cell subtypes (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD27, CD28, CD45, CD45RA, CD57, CCR7, and PD1) and serum cytokines/chemokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, TGF-β, TNFα, CXCL1, CXCL9, and CXCL12) were measured by flow cytometry and analysis before surgical resection or other cancer treatments. The frequency of T cell subpopulations in patients with lung cancer (n = 111) corresponded to those seen in patients with T cell exhaustion. As lung cancer progressed, the proportion of effector memory T cells decreased, while the proportion of naive T cells, PD-1, CD57+, CD28+CD27+, CD45RA+, and CD3+CD4+CCR7 increased. Circulating CD8+PD1+ T cells were positively correlated with intra-tumoral PD-L1 expression. Concurrently, serum levels of IL-2, TGF-β, and CXCL9 decreased, while IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, and CXCL12 increased during the progression of lung cancer. In conclusion, T cell dysfunction is associated with cancer progression, particularly in advanced-stage lung cancer, and cancer immunoediting will provide early-stage cancer detection and further therapeutic strategies.",

The aim of our study was to analyze the clinicopathological features, survival outcomes and prognostic factors of SpCC of the breast among Chinese. Patients diagnosed with SpCC of the breast in Cancer Hospital of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences between 2004 to 2021 were retrospectively analyzed. Additionally, we searched Chinese databases and Pubmed websites for literature on breast SpCC in Chinese patients. The clinicalpathological characteristics, survival outcomes and prognostic factors were evaluated. A total of 160 eligible cases were enrolled, including 23 patients in our center and 137 cases from the literature search. The median age was 52 years old (range, 22-88). 84.8% (101/119) cases were in the early stage (stage I and II). 15.0% (20/133) had axillary lymph node involvement. The majority of patients were HR-HER2- (85.4%, 98/137). 77.5% (79/102) patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. 36.9% (31/84) of patients received adjuvant radiation. Of 126 patients available for a median follow-up with 38 (range, 1-211) months, 58 cases (46.0%, 58/126) recurred, including 31.0% (18/58) who had local recurrence and 69.0% (40/58) who had distant metastasis. The most common distant metastatic site was the lung (41.4%, 24/58). Most patients (91.5%) had recurrence within 3 years. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the 3-year and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) were 55.9% and 46.8%, and the 3-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) were 67.0% and 54.9%, respectively.

This study aimed to use ICD-associated differentially expressed genes (ICD-DEGs) to predict survival of glioma patients. We investigated the relationship between clinical prognosis and the date-to-clinical prognosis of 1,721 glioma patients by examining the expression, methylation, and mutation status of ICD-related genes (IRGs) in these patients. Our prediction of survival in glioma patients was based on three risk genes, and we explored the association between these genes and clinical outcomes. Additionally, IRG expression was used to stratify glioma patients. We further examined the relationship among the three subgroups in terms of immune microenvironment heterogeneity and immunotherapy response. In addition, this study also included analyses of histograms and sensitivity to antitumor drugs. The expression of these genes was externally validated by RT-qPCR, Western blot (WB), and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in glioma and normal brain tissue. Our findings reveal that most IRGs are overexpressed in glioma tumor tissues, and this high expression was confirmed through histological validation. We successfully developed predictive models for three prognostic genes associated with ICD. These models not only predict survival in glioma but also correlate with the tumor's immune microenvironment. Finally, using consensus clustering, we identified three ICD-associated subtypes. Notably, patients with the C3 subtype showed high levels of immune cell infiltration, whereas those with the C1 subtype exhibited lower levels of immune cell infiltration. We successfully developed an innovative IRG-based systematic approach for evaluating glioma patients. This stratification in experimental studies opens new avenues for prognosis and assessing immunotherapy responses in glioma patients. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in treating glioma, potentially paving the way for more promising and effective therapeutic strategies in the future.",

    "abstract": "Thyroid cancer can be classified into three different types based on the degree of differentiation: well-differentiated, poorly differentiated, and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. Well-differentiated thyroid cancer refers to cancer cells that closely resemble normal thyroid cells, while poorly differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinoma are characterized by cells that have lost their resemblance to normal thyroid cells. Advanced thyroid carcinoma, regardless of its degree of differentiation, is known to have a higher likelihood of disease progression and is generally associated with a poor prognosis. However, the process through which well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma transforms into anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, also known as \"dedifferentiation\", has been a subject of intensive research. In recent years, there have been significant breakthroughs in the treatment of refractory advanced thyroid cancer. Clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of molecular targeted drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of dedifferentiated thyroid cancer. These drugs work by targeting specific molecules or proteins in cancer cells to inhibit their growth or by enhancing the body's immune response against the cancer cells. This article aims to explore some of the possible mechanisms behind the dedifferentiation process in well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. It also discusses the clinical effects of molecular targeted drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors in thyroid cancer patients with different degrees of differentiation. Furthermore, it offers insights into the future trends in the treatment of advanced thyroid cancer, highlighting the potential for improved outcomes and better patient care.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer stands as the predominant cause of cancer-related mortality globally. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), being the most prevalent subtype, garners extensive attention due to its notable heterogeneity, which significantly influences tumor development and treatment approaches. This research leverages single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets to delve into the impact of KRAS/TP53 co-mutation status on LUAD. Moreover, utilizing the TCGA-LUAD dataset, we formulated a novel predictive risk model, comprising seven prognostic genes, through LASSO regression, and subjected it to both internal and external validation sets. The study underscores the profound impact of KRAS/TP53 co-mutational status on the tumor microenvironment (TME) of LUAD. Crucially, KRAS/TP53 co-mutation markedly influences the extent of B cell infiltration and various immune-related pathways within the TME. The newly developed predictive risk model exhibited robust performance across both internal and external validation sets, establishing itself as a viable independent prognostic factor. Additionally, in vitro experiments indicate that MELTF and PLEK2 can modulate the invasion and proliferation of human non-small cell lung cancer cells. In conclusion, we elucidated that KRAS/TP53 co-mutations may modulate TME and patient prognosis by orchestrating B cells and affiliated pathways. Furthermore, we spotlight that MELTF and PLEK2 not only function as prognostic indicators for LUAD, but also lay the foundation for the exploration of innovative therapeutic approaches.",

We showed that verteporfin can damage the mitochondria of EC cells, leading to a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in ROS (reactive oxygen species). In addition, verteporfin treatment was shown to inhibit the proliferation and migration of EC cells, promote apoptosis, and reduce the expression of mitophagy-related proteins PINK1/parkin and TOM20. The ROS inhibitor N-Acetyl Cysteine was able to rescue the expression of PINK1/parkin proteins. This suggests that verteporfin may inhibit mitophagy by elevating ROS levels, thereby inhibiting EC cell viability. The effect of verteporfin on mitophagy supports further investigation as a potential therapeutic option for EC.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a malignant tumor of the colon and rectum. It can be cured if detected in the early stage through established screening programs. CRC screening is the best way to improve cancer morbidity and mortality. Various approaches such as stool tests, virtual colonoscopy, and sigmoidoscopy are available for early detection. On average, a person after reaching the age of 45 should begin the screening process for CRC periodically for 5 years. Our study aims to measure the population's awareness and knowledge of the effect of CRC screening on CRC outcomes. A cross-sectional study questionnaire was designed and distributed among Saudi residents of the Al-Qunfudah region. A total of 385 participants replied: 55.8% of the participants were males, 78.8% of the study participants mentioned that they had heard about CRC, and 27.3% reported that CRC is common in Al-Qunfudah. In addition, 62.1% knew that CRC is more common in men but only 32.2% had a good awareness level. Moreover, 16.4% of the participants reported that they had received a colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy; 69.9% did not think of the colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy procedure as the main barrier to undergoing early screening for CRC. Good awareness regarding CRC was demonstrated in 34.4% of highly educated participants, which was directly associated with levels of education. In conclusion, much more awareness regarding CRC screening is needed in the Al-Qunfudah region. Educational seminars and programs should be made mandatory, and the healthcare system should focus on high-risk individuals.",

However, this result is only evident in past retrospective studies, and clinical trial results did not show the same trend. Thus, it remains unclear whether primary tumor resection effectively increases survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) across different study designs. We compared the OS of patients with asymptomatic unresectable mCRC who underwent PTR with that of those who did not. This retrospective cohort study was designed to be a target trial emulation of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that would have compared the effectiveness of PTR versus non-PTR in patients with asymptomatic unresectable mCRC from 2009 to 2017. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to compare the efficacy of PTR and non-PTR in patients with mCRC, and corresponding results were compared. This cohort included 1,132 patients for a per-protocol analysis. The PTR group had non-significantly longer survival (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.70, 95% confidence interval: 0.62-1.01) than the non-PTR group in our cohort. A meta-analysis including five RCTs (1,016 patients) and our cohort found that the PTR group did not have a significantly lower mortality rate than the non-PTR group. The results of this cohort study and previous RCTs suggest that PTR is not associated with improved survival compared to systemic chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy among asymptomatic unresectable mCRC patients. Therefore, routine PTR is not recommended in these patients.",

We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a salvage lenvatinib-based regimen for refractory mCRC. In total, 371 patients were categorized into lenvatinib-based and non-lenvatinib-based groups. In the lenvatinib-based group, patients who received lenvatinib at a dosage of 10 mg/day were categorized into lenvatinib/chemotherapy and lenvatinib/immunotherapy subgroups. We reported overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) using the Kaplan-Meier method. OS1 was used to measure the time from disease progression after TAS-102 and regorafenib treatment to death, while OS2 was used to measure the time from TAS-102 or regorafenib treatment to death. Propensity score matching analysis was employed to compare the characteristics between the lenvatinib-based and non-lenvatinib-based groups. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) information was analyzed using R software. The lenvatinib-based group exhibited longer OS than did the non-lenvatinib-based group (OS1, 11.4 vs. 3.7 months; OS2, 27.2 vs. 8.2 months). The disease control rate (DCR) and objective response rate (ORR) of the lenvatinib-based regimens were 69.4% and 6.1%, respectively. Lenvatinib/chemotherapy and lenvatinib/immunotherapy had similar PFS, OS, DCR, and ORR. The adverse effects were manageable. After propensity score matching, the lenvatinib-based group continued to exhibit significantly longer OS1 and OS2 than did the non-lenvatinib-based group. NGS analysis revealed that",

It was revealed that ANOS1 expression is significantly enhanced in ESCA patients and cell lines. The expression level of ANOS1 in ESCA patients can distinguish the malignancy from normal tissue with an area under curve (AUC) >0.75. Moreover, increased expression of ANOS1 is associated with advanced T stage and worse disease-free survival of ESCA patients. Therefore, a clinically applicable nomogram with ANOS1 was established with strong predictive power. Furthermore, high expression of ANOS1 in ESCA is correlated with (i) the enrichment of epithelial-mesenchymal transition by gene set enrichment analysis, (ii) the involvement in hypoxia, angiogenesis, WNT signaling pathway, and TGFβ signaling pathway by gene set variation analysis, (iii) the presence of the small insertion and deletion mutational signature ID9, associated with chromothripsis, in the single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis, (iv) the amplification of 11q13.3 in the copy number variants analysis, (v) the enrichment of cancer-associated fibroblasts and mesenchymal stromal cells in the tumor microenvironment.

    "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma, a rare and aggressive form of cancer originating from the bile ducts in the liver, poses a significant challenge for treatment. However, the emergence of precision medicine has brought newfound hope for more effective therapies. Several precision medicine approaches have demonstrated promise in the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. One such approach is targeted therapy, which involves utilizing drugs that specifically target the genetic mutations or alterations present in the tumor cells. In the case of cholangiocarcinoma, mutations in the IDH1 and IDH2 genes are frequently observed. Immunotherapy is another precision medicine approach being explored for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. Immune checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab and nivolumab can be used to bolster the body's immune response against cancer cells. While the response to immunotherapy can vary among individuals, studies have shown promising results, particularly in patients with high levels of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or microsatellite instability. Moreover, molecular profiling of cholangiocarcinoma tumors can play a crucial role in identifying potential targets for precision medicine. Through advanced next-generation sequencing techniques, specific gene alterations or dysregulations in pathways can be identified, potentially guiding treatment decisions. This personalized approach enables tailored treatment plans based on the unique genetic characteristics of each patient's tumor. In conclusion, the advent of precision medicine has opened up new avenues for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. Targeted therapy and immunotherapy have exhibited promising results, and further molecular profiling is expected to uncover additional therapeutic options. Such advancements represent a significant step forward in the quest to enhance outcomes for individuals affected by cholangiocarcinoma.",

ZUMA-1 was expanded to investigate safety management strategies aimed at reducing the incidence and severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic events (NEs). Prospective safety expansion Cohort 5 evaluated the impact of debulking therapy, including rituximab-containing immunochemotherapy regimens and radiotherapy, in axi-cel-treated patients; the CRS and NE management strategy paralleled those in Cohorts 1+2. Among the 50 patients in Cohort 5 who received axi-cel, 40% received ≥3 prior lines of chemotherapy, and 40% had disease that progressed while on the most recent chemotherapy. Forty-eight patients (96%) received debulking therapy, 14 (28%) radiotherapy only, and 34 (71%) systemic immunochemotherapy. Median decrease in tumor burden (per sum of product of diameters of target lesions) relative to screening was 17.4% with R-ICE/R-GDP, 4.3% with other debulking chemotherapies, and 6.3% with radiotherapy only. All patients were followed for ≥8 months. CRS was reported in 43 patients (86%), with 1 patient (2%) experiencing grade ≥3. NEs were reported in 28 patients (56%), with 6 (12%) experiencing grade ≥3.

Median duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival were 25.8, 3.1, and 20.6 months, respectively. These results from exploratory Cohort 5 demonstrate the feasibility of debulking prior to axi-cel, and together with current real-world evidence, suggest that debulking regimens may help minimize the frequency and severity of CRS and NEs in patients with R/R LBCL.

Firstly, the response of colorectal cancer cells (HCT116 and MC38 cells) to citraconate was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, clonogenic assay, transwell migration and invasion assay. Moreover, we utilized an intra-splenic injection model to evaluate the effect of citraconate on colorectal cancer liver metastasis",

A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including patients with firstly histologically confirmed non-metastatic stage III-IVB NPC between February 2018 and February 2020, and with continuous follow-up data available, were chosen from the medical records of the affiliated hospital of Qingdao University and Zibo Central Hospital. There were 395 patients receiving concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with adjuvant chemotherapy (adjuvant chemotherapy group) and 428 patients receiving CCRT alone (control group). The two groups were compared for treatment response, adverse events, and QOL scores. Besides, Kaplan-Meier plots, and multivariate COX analysis were conducted. The adjuvant chemotherapy group demonstrated a significantly higher overall survival and disease-free survival compared to the control group. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy was significantly correlated with improved overall survival and disease-free survival. Adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with reduced local recurrence and distant metastasis rates. However, higher rates of adverse events were observed in the adjuvant chemotherapy group. QOL scores for physical functioning, emotional functioning, and overall quality of life were higher in the adjuvant chemotherapy group. The findings of this study indicate that adjuvant chemotherapy in locally advanced NPC is associated with improved treatment response, extended overall and disease-free survivals, and better QOL, despite higher rates of adverse events.",

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 133 lung cancer patients who seek for primary treatment at Wujin Hospital Affiliated to Jiangsu University from January 2019 to August 2022. The inflammation and blood lipid-related indicators were collected 1 week before treatment and after 2 cycles of treatment. We compared the changes in these indicators among patients with different treatment methods and outcomes. The diagnostic value of the dynamic changes in each index for disease progression was calculated using the ROC curve. The risk factors influencing disease development were identified using multifactorial logistic regression analysis. After 2 cycles of treatment, the white blood cell count (WBC, P<0.001), neutrophil count (NC, P<0.001), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR, P<0.001) in the disease progression (PD) group were significantly increased, triglyceride (TG, P=0.023), apolipoprotein A1 (APO-A1, P=0.009) was significantly decreased. The results showed that ∆NC had the highest sensitivity (88.24%) in predicting disease progression, and ∆WBC had the best specificity (77.78%). Multivariate regression analysis showed that ΔWBC (P<0.001), ΔTG (P=0.041), and treatment method (P=0.010) were independent risk factors for disease progression (PD). The changes of WBC and TG before and after treatment are promising indicators for predicting the progression of lung cancer and may offer a new direction for lung cancer treatment.",

Retrospectively, data were collected from 348 PTC patients treated at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University between January 2019 and December 2022, with 241 patients included in the final analyses. Patients with lateral cervical LNM were categorized into a metastasis group, and those without were in a non-metastasis group. The patients were divided into a training set (n=169) and a validation set (n=72) in a 7:3 ratio. Logistic and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression models were used to identify key factors associated with lateral cervical LNM and prognosis, enabling the construction of a predictive model. The model's validity was assessed via the Hosmer-Lemeshow Test, calibration curves, ROC curves, and decision curve analysis. The metastasis group exhibited higher proportions of males, multiple lesions, bilateral involvement, tumor diameter ≥1 cm, and elevated levels of PLR, LMR, and NLR (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis revealed that gender, multiple lesions, affected side, and tumor diameter were associated with lateral cervical LNM (P<0.05). The predictive Nomogram model, which included factors like affected side, tumor diameter, capsular invasion, central LNM, PLR, and NLR, demonstrated strong predictive accuracy and clinical utility. Thus, this study provides a practical clinical tool through an accurate Nomogram model to assess lateral cervical LNM risk in PTC patients using logistic and LASSO regression analyses.",

In this study, we applied a multi-omics approach to explore the regulatory mechanism of LGR4 in TNBC metastasis. Our findings showed that LGR4 could regulate actin cytoskeletal through EGFR and curtail EGFR activation-induced TNBC metastasis by inhibiting MGP expression.

Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase H (PPIH), an RBP, possesses prolyl isomerase activity and functions as a protein chaperone. The relationship between PPIH and LIHC has not yet been fully elucidated. This study elucidated potential mechanisms through which PPIH affects the prognosis of LIHC. Bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experiments revealed that PPIH expression was higher in LIHC tissues than in normal tissues. PPIH was identified as an independent prognostic factor, with high PPIH expression being associated with worse prognoses. Moreover, PPIH increased the m6A RNA methylation level and promoted cell proliferation by modulating DNA replication and the expression of cell cycle-related genes in LIHC cells. Bioinformatics analysis also revealed that PPIH expression increased immune cell infiltration and the expression of immune checkpoint proteins. Collectively, these findings indicate that PPIH might promote LIHC progression by enhancing the m6A RNA methylation level, increasing cell proliferation, and altering the tumor immune microenvironment. Our study demonstrates that PPIH, as a poor prognostic factor, may lead to LIHC malignancy through multiple pathways. Further in-depth research on this topic is warranted.",

Therefore, this study investigated the impact of TTF-1 and its adverse events on PFS during pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for NS-NSCLC. Patients who received the pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy from 1/1/2018 to 12/31/2022 and whose TTF-1 expression was measured were included in the study. This was a retrospective study conducted using electronic medical records. The mean age of the 79 patients was 67.5 ± 8.4 years, with 75.95% patients being male. Among them, 59.49% were TTF-1 positive. PFS comparison between TTF-1-positive and -negative patients showed a trend toward longer PFS for TTF-1 positive patients, though the results were statistically insignificant (P = 0.190). Proportional hazards analysis indicated significant PFS extension from treatment interruption, as adverse events related to cancer therapy stopped (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.32, P = 0.005) and the number of anticancer agents used (HR = 0.01, P < 0.001). Additionally, pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for TTF-1-positive NS-NSCLC significantly extended PFS after treatment discontinuation as related adverse events stopped (827 vs. 210 days, P = 0.021). Measurement of TTF-1 may accordingly serve as a predictor of treatment response to the pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy. It may also be a predictor of patient prognosis when treatment is discontinued due to related adverse events.",

Overexpression of miR-664a-5p enhanced the sensitivity of PCa cells to PARP inhibitors by directly targeting FOXM1, a transcription factor involved in DNA damage repair, leading to the downregulation of DNA damage response genes.

There is substantial evidence linking autophagy to cancer etiology and immunotherapy efficacy. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive analysis of autophagy-related genes (ARGs) using TCGA datasets and further explore the potential function of critical ARGs in SKCM progression. We performed comprehensive bioinformatics analysis uses the TCGA dataset. RT-PCR was applied to examine the expression of CAPNS1 in SKCM cells. Lost-of-function experiments were performed to detect the expression of the related proteins. In this search, we screed 70 differentially expressed autophagy-related genes (DE-ARGs), including 33 up-DE-ARGs and 37 down-DE-ARGs. Enrichment assays revealed that these 70 DE-ARGs may exert influence on critical cellular processes such as autophagy, protein kinase activity, and signaling pathways, impacting cell growth, differentiation, survival, and tumor development. Then, we further explore the prognostic value of 70 DE-ARGs and confirmed 18 survival-related DE-ARGs in SKCM patients. Nearly all the 18 DE-ARGs' methylation was negatively correlated with their corresponding expression in SKCM. The 12 survival-related DE-ARGs were used to develop a unique predictive model that effectively classified SKCM patients into high- and low-risk groups with regard to overall survival. Furthermore, tumor environment analysis indicated that the risk score was associated with several immune cells. Among the 12 survival-related DE-ARGs, our attention focused on CAPNS1 which was highly expressed in SKCM patients and predicted a poor prognosis. In addition, we confirmed that knockdown of CAPNS1 distinctly suppressed the proliferation, metastasis and EMT of SKCM cells, and promoted autophagy via regulating Notch signaling pathway. Overall, this study enhances our understanding of the intricate molecular landscape of SKCM progression and presents promising avenues for future research and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "The prevention and treatment strategies for cervical cancer patients undergoing spinal epidural anesthesia have increasingly focused on early screening for high-risk factors associated with potential hypotension. We analyze the general conditions and preoperative examination results of 312 cervical cancer patients who received spinal epidural anesthesia, in order to identify independent risk factors for hypotension, assess their predictive efficacy, and construct a nomogram. 312 patients with cervical cancer received spinal epidural anesthesia were included in this study. Among them, 164 patients with hypotension after hysterectomy with spinal epidural anesthesia were in a hypotension group. Important risk predictors of hypotension after hysterectomy with spinal epidural anesthesia were identified using univariate and multivariate analyses, then a clinical nomogram was constructed. The predictive accuracy was assessed by unadjusted concordance index (C-index) and calibration plot. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis identified basal HR (≥95) (95% CI 0.831-0.900; P = 0.000) and basal PVI (95% CI 0.679-0.877; P = 0.000) were the independent risk factors for hypotension in cervical cancer patients with spinal epidural anesthesia. Those risk factors were used to construct a clinical predictive nomogram. The regression equation model based on the above factors was logit (P) = -6.820 + 0.216 * basal HR + basic PVI * 0.312. The calibration curves for hypotension risk revealed excellent accuracy of the predictive nomogram model. Decision curve analysis showed that the predictive model could be applied clinically when the threshold probability was 20 to 75%. We surmised that the basal HR values and PVI values are the independent risk factors for hypotension in cervical cancer patients with spinal epidural anesthesia. The construction of nomograms is beneficial in predicting the risk of hypotension in these patients.",

A retrospective review of 615 NHL patients treated at the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University from 2016 to 2021 identified 50 patients with IP post-chemotherapy as the case group. A propensity score matched control group of 55 patients without pneumonia was established. Clinical profiles, risk factors, and treatment outcomes were evaluated. The IP incidence was 8.13% (50/615) in B-cell NHL patients. Multivariate analysis revealed liposomes, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) as independent risk factors for IP. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses suggested that alterations in LDH and ESR could predict IP risk. The conclusion suggests that IP is associated with liposomal doxorubicin-induced lung injury and other cytotoxic chemotherapy, possibly due to Rituximab (RTX)-induced immune imbalance. Given the potential of IP with pulmonary infections, high-risk patients may need prophylactic antibiotics and appropriate corticosteroid therapy.",

    "abstract": "The treatment for liver cancer has transitioned from traditional surgical resection to interventional therapies, which have become increasingly popular among patients due to their minimally invasive nature and significant local efficacy. However, with advancements in treatment technologies, accurately assessing patient response and predicting long-term survival has become a crucial research topic. Over the past decade, machine algorithms have made remarkable progress in the medical field, particularly in hepatology and prognosis studies of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Machine algorithms, including deep learning and machine learning, can identify prognostic patterns and trends by analyzing vast amounts of clinical data. Despite significant advancements, several issues remain unresolved in the prognosis prediction of liver cancer using machine algorithms. Key challenges and main controversies include effectively integrating multi-source clinical data to improve prediction accuracy, addressing data privacy and ethical concerns, and enhancing the transparency and interpretability of machine algorithm decision-making processes. This paper aims to systematically review and analyze the current applications and potential of machine algorithms in predicting the prognosis of patients undergoing interventional therapy for liver cancer, providing theoretical and empirical support for future research and clinical practice.",

A retrospective study was conducted on patients with osteosarcoma undergoing NACT combined with surgery in Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from January 2017 to May 2019. The patients were grouped into a remission group (pCR group, 85 patients) and a non-remission group (non-pCR, 79 patients), according to the treatment efficacy. The pathological data as well as clinical data were collected from patients, which were subsequently employed for statistical analysis to determine the factors affecting the efficacy of the treatment. The diagnostic value of PNI and SII for predicting the efficacy were assessed through following up the patients for 5 years to observe their overall survival rate. COX regression analysis was leveraged to identify risk factors affecting the survival time. The impact of different PNI and SII levels on the survival time was observed. Multivariate regression analysis showed that factors including Enneking stage, PNI level and SII level were in association with poor efficacy after NATC combined with surgery. The mortality within 5 years was higher and the 5-year overall survival rate was lower in the non-pCR group than those in the pCR group (both P < 0.05). The COX regression analysis indicated that PNI and SII levels were risk factors for poor prognosis in patients with osteosarcoma following NACT combined with surgery. Further analysis showed that patients with low PNI and high SII levels had a lower 5-year survival rate (P < 0.05). Enneking stage, PNI, and SII levels were risk factors for poor efficacy in patients with osteosarcoma after NACT combined with surgery. Patients whose PNI level was low and SII level was high presented poor prognosis following the treatment.",

Therefore, it is crucial to identify new targetable pathways. Epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (Eps8) is one such potential target. Although this pathway is associated with the progression of various cancers, studies on the role of Eps8 in prostate cancer remain limited. This study investigated the role of Eps8 in prostate cancer. The LNCaP cell line and enzalutamide-resistant LNCaP (LNCaP Enz-R) cell lines were utilized for the investigation. Overexpression of Eps8 was observed in the LNCaP Enz-R cells. Transfecting pCMV-EPS8 also increased the levels of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), cell proliferation, and cell viability in both cell lines. Conversely, knockdown of Eps8 expression decreased the levels of EMT, cell proliferation, and cell viability in both cell lines. Furthermore, EPS8-induced EMT activation could be reversed by suppressing the Ras/JAK/PI3K signaling pathway. In vivo animal study also confirmed the crucial role of Eps8 expression in prostate cancer progression. Therefore, we suggest that targeting Eps8 by knocking down its expression is promising as a therapeutic approach for prostate cancer treatment.",

We recently reported that hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) in combination with lenvatinib and durvalumab (HLD) exhibited promising antitumor activity and manageable adverse events in patients with unresectable ICC. Here, we aimed to compare HLD with GCD in patients with advanced ICC. This retrospective study included consecutive patients with advanced ICC administered HLD or GCD between January 2020 and March 2024. Safety and patient outcomes, including overall and progression-free survival and objective response rate, were compared between the two groups. The study cohort included 31 and 28 patients in the HLD and GCD groups, respectively. Compared to the GCD group, the HLD group experienced significantly better overall survival (median, 15.8 vs. 9.6 months; P = 0.033), longer progression-free survival (median, 10.3 vs. 4.1 months; P = 0.007), and a higher objective response rate (46.2% vs. 13.1%; P = 0.009). By subgroup analysis, patients with single tumor, intrahepatic tumors >5 cm, or unilobar tumors benefited more from HLD treatment. Additionally, the rates of any grade and grade 3-4 adverse events were not significantly different between the two groups (100% vs. 92.9%, P = 0.221; 32.3% vs. 42.9%, P = 0.401; respectively). In conclusion, HLD treatment was tolerable and associated with better survival benefits compared to the standard first-line GCD treatment in patients with advanced ICC, especially in those with single tumor, intrahepatic tumors >5 cm, and unilobar tumors.",

This study utilized TCGA data analysis to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to ferroptosis in OC, revealing 2,333 up-regulated and 4,073 down-regulated genes. Venn diagrams identified 64 up-regulated and 120 down-regulated ferroptosis-related DEGs (FR-DEGs), with 15 showing a significant correlation with overall patient survival. Further analyses explored the expression, mutations, and copy number variations of these 15 FR-DEGs across various cancer types, constructing interaction networks. Molecular subtypes in OC were classified using these 15 FR-DEGs, revealing two subtypes (C1 and C2). Survival analysis identified a risk model for the C1 group based on these genes. Experimental validation highlighted TRIM46 as a key gene, with knockdown inhibiting OC cell proliferation and migration. TRIM46 was also associated with changes in ferroptosis-related markers and demonstrated a close connection with the Wnt signaling pathway, validated through Western blot experiments. Overall, the study provided a comprehensive understanding of the role of DEGs related to ferroptosis in OC, offering valuable insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets.",

PRKAA1 was closely associated with various immune profiles, suggesting that PRKAA1 can be used for direct immunotherapy. We investigated the role of PRKAA1 in PC cells. We found that the downregulation of PRKAA1 expression reduced the proliferation, migration, and invasion of PC cells. In addition, we found that PRKAA1 regulated PC progression, possibly through the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Treatment of cells with the AKT inhibitors MK2206 and GSK2110183 revealed that the PRKAA1 overexpression group was less sensitive to AKT inhibitors than the negative control group. Taken together, PRKAA1 can be used as a potential prognostic marker and new target for tumor immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most widespread tumor types, and it stands as the second leading cause of disease-related mortality globally. Due to its adverse effects, which lead to low patient adherence, new alternatives to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments are being studied. Since, in most cases, platelets are positively involved in the persistence and progression of CRC, several elements of the platelet signaling pathway have been considered possible therapeutic targets. The present study assembles the main treatments for CRC and investigates the cellular mechanisms involved in the interaction between blood platelets and cancer cells. Additionally, this review cites other articles that propose possible therapeutic targets in the platelet activation pathways to be explored. Despite the reported benefits of antithrombotic therapy on CRC progression, some studies have warned about an increased bleeding risk and CRC incidence and highlight the importance of controlling this therapy through diagnostic tests. However, their high cost is still a significant obstacle to the population's access from low Human Development Index (HDI) countries. Many research groups have studied platelet signaling pathways in depth to develop a safer, more effective, and affordable therapy for the population.",

    "abstract": "Collagen, a primary protein component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), undergoes a notable series of alterations concomitant with the growth of the tumor. Procollagen-lysine,2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 3 (PLOD3) is involved in the synthesis of collagen and has been associated with a variety of cancers. However, it is unclear how PLOD3 functions in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Differentially expressed genes between ESCC and adjacent normal tissues were identified using proteomic and transcriptomic analyses. These genes were then subjected to survival analysis to identify prognostic markers. Immune cell infiltration in the two subgroups was evaluated. Spearman's correlation analysis was performed to examine the correlation between PLOD3 and RBM15 expression in TCGA-ESCC database. shRNA-mediated approach was used to knockdown RBM15 in ESCC cells. The effects of RBM15 knockdown on PLOD3 expression were assessed by real-time PCR and Western blot. Moreover, COX algorithm was employed to construct a prognostic signature. PLOD3 was found to be highly expressed in ESCC patients and correlated with a favorable prognosis. Immune cell infiltration estimation indicated tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T cell was increased in PLOD3-high group. Correlation analysis revealed that PLOD3 was associated with RBM15 and was closely related to CD4+ T cell infiltration. Moreover, loss-of-function approaches showed that depletion of RBM15 attenuated PLOD3 expression in ESCC cells. Following univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses, PLOD3 and RBM15 were identified as a two-gene prognostic signature for ESCC. RBM15 enhances tumor-infiltrating CD4+ T Cell abundance in ESCC by regulating PLOD3. Two new independent prognostic factors, PLOD3 and RBM15, may be useful in predicting the prognosis of ESCC.",

    "abstract": "Microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) is a critical biomarker for immunotherapy, yet primary resistance remains a significant challenge. Current MSI-H detection methods evaluate the proportion of MSI-H loci, termed molecular MSI-H score, which can be affected by intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH). To address this limitation, we propose evaluating MSI-H at the cellular level to improve the prediction of immunotherapy outcomes. Using bulk tissue (TCGA-CRC) and cell line (CCLE-CRC) datasets, we identified genes highly expressed in MSI-H and MSS samples. These signatures were applied to a single-cell RNA sequencing (scCRC) dataset for enrichment analysis, enabling classification of tumor cells into MSI-H, MSS, and microsatellite dual (MSD) clusters using a Gaussian finite mixture model. Validation showed that MSI-H and MSS enrichment scores were higher in mismatch repair-deficient (MMRd) and mismatch repair-proficient (MMRp) patients, respectively. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that MSI-H cells were associated with pathways such as carboxylic acid catabolism, inflammatory responses, and IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 signaling. We developed a cellular MSI-H signature using genes specifically expressed in the MSI-H cell cluster and transformed the scCRC dataset into a cell-type-specific pseudobulk expression matrix. Using this matrix as a reference, we performed reference-based deconvolution on TCGA-CRC data. We defined the deconvolution score of MSI-H cell as cellular MSI-H score. This score strongly correlated with the molecular MSI-H score (R = 0.55, P < 0.001) and showed modest correlations with macrophage (MoMac, R = 0.14) and CD8+ T-cell (R = 0.11). To investigate its potential for clinical application, we applied the cellular MSI-H signature to the BJ-cohort, comprising 97 immunotherapy-treated gastrointestinal patients sequenced with a 395-gene panel. The cellular MSI-H score was significantly higher in responders (P = 0.002), positively correlated with tumor reduction percentage (R = 0.29, P = 0.006), and associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) (HR: 0.00, 95% CI: 0.00-0.31, P = 0.021). In summary, the cellular MSI-H score reflects the MSI-H cell level within a tumor and demonstrates superior accuracy compared to molecular MSI-H status in predicting immunotherapy response and PFS. This underscores its potential as a more robust biomarker for guiding immunotherapy decisions.",

A total of 89 Patients aged 18-72 years with T-LBL, confirmed via histopathological examination of lymph nodes, extranodal tissues, or bone marrow, were retrospectively included. Clinical data, treatment details, and mutational profiles were collected. Prognostic factors were assessed based on clinical and molecular characteristics, and the efficacy and safety of two chemotherapy regimens were compared. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the disease spectrum. Most patients (84.00%) presented with advanced disease (stages III-IV). Mediastinal invasion was observed in 63 patients (70.80%), and 59 patients (66.30%) exhibited B symptoms. Bone marrow involvement occurred in 19 patients (21.20%), and bulky mediastinum (>10 cm) was present in 50 patients (56.18%). Mutations were detected in 29 patients, with NOTCH1 being the most frequently mutated gene, followed by PHF-6, JAK-1, JAK-3, IL-7R, and TP53. The complete response (CR) rate was 51.69%. The 3-year overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 74.9% and 58.80%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified female sex, lack of CR, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (>2× normal) as independent predictors of poor OS (58.25%). Chemotherapy regimens, LDH levels, and sex were independent prognostic factors for PFS (21.24%). T-LBL is characterized by high-frequency gene mutations across multiple signaling pathways. Mediastinal invasion (70.80%) and extranodal involvement (39.33%) were prevalent in Chinese patients and were associated with poor prognosis. Combined assessment of clinical and molecular features allows for improved prognostic stratification and facilitates the development of targeted therapies for high-risk patients.",

This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of adjuvant RT for elderly EBC patients using deep learning (DL) to personalize treatment plans. Five distinct DL models were developed to generate personalized treatment recommendations. Patients whose actual treatments aligned with the DL model suggestions were classified into the Consistent group, while those with divergent treatments were placed in the Inconsistent group. The efficacy of these models was assessed by comparing outcomes between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression and Poisson regression analyses were used to visualize and quantify the influence of various features on adjuvant RT selection. In a cohort of 8,047 elderly EBC patients, treatment following the Deep Survival Regression with Mixture Effects (DSME) model's recommendations significantly improved survival, with inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-adjusted benefits, including a hazard ratio of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.58-0.86), a risk difference of 4.63% (95% CI, 1.59-7.66), and an extended mean survival time of 8.96 months (95% CI, 6.85-10.97), outperforming other models and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. The DSME model identified elderly patients with larger tumors and more advanced disease stages as ideal candidates for adjuvant RT, though no benefit was seen in patients not recommended for it. This study introduces a novel DL-guided approach for selecting adjuvant RT in elderly EBC patients, enhancing treatment precision and potentially improving survival outcomes while minimizing unnecessary interventions.",

    "abstract": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the most predominant subtype of esophageal cancer, is notorious for its high lymph node metastatic potential and poor prognosis. Growing evidence has demonstrated crucial function of circRNAs in human malignancies. However, the knowledge of circRNAs in lymph node metastasis of ESCC is still inadequate. In this study, a series of bioinformatic analyses and experimental validation were performed. By performing differential expression analysis and selection for GEO dataset GSE150476, a total of 8 circRNAs associated with lymph node metastasis of ESCC were identified. Expression analysis confirmed their low expression in ESCC tissues (relative to normal tissues) or metastatic sites (relative to primary sites). By combination of binding miRNAs from CSCD and starBase databases, six potential miRNAs (miR-532-5p, miR-2681-5p, miR-670-5p, miR-1252-5p, miR-382-3p and miR-542-3p) were predicted and a circRNA-miRNA regulatory network was constructed. Next, 695 target genes were predicted to bind to the 6 miRNAs. After conducting protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, hub gene identification and expression analysis, a hub gene PIK3R1 was identified as the most potential downstream target gene of hsa_circ_0087104/miR-542-3p in ESCC. Hsa_circ_0087104 and PIK3R1 were decreased while miR-542-3p was increased in ESCC cells compared with normal esophageal epithelial cell line. Luciferase reporter and MS2-RIP assays confirmed the direct bind of miR-542-3p to hsa_circ_0087104 or PIK3R1. Hsa_circ_0087104 increased PIK3R1 expression but ectopic expression of miR-542-3p reversed hsa_circ_0087104-mediated PIK3R1 overexpression in ESCC. Overexpression of hsa_circ_0087104 suppressed",

    "abstract": "Cancer cell overexpresses numerus proteins, however, how these up-regulated proteins, especially those enzymatically opposite kinases and phosphatases, act together to promote oncogenesis is unknown. Here, we reported that protein tyrosine phosphatase H1 (PTPH1) is a scaffold protein for receptor tyrosine kinase (HER2) to potentiate breast tumorigenesis. PTPH1 utilizes its PDZ domain to bind HER2, p38γ, PBK, and YAP1 and to increase HER2 nuclear translocation, stemness, and oncogenesis. PTPH1 de-phosphorylates HER2 and reciprocally increases HER2 protein expression dependent on cellular content. PTPH1 itself can be phosphorylated at S459 by redundant kinases p38γ and/or PBK, thereby distinctively regulating expression and/or turnover of scaffold proteins. Moreover, PTPH1 and HER2 cooperate to increase PBK and Yap1 transcription thus acting as an additional mechanism to activate the scaffold. PTPH1 protein levels are higher in HER2+ breast cancer in which their phosphorylated forms are inversely correlated, indicating an integrated oncogenic activity through coordinated PTPH1 phosphorylation and HER2 de-phosphorylation. Combinational, but not individual, application of scaffold-kinases' inhibitors suppresses xenograft growth in mice. Thus, a PDZ-coupled and phosphorylation-driven scaffold can integrate proliferative signaling of enzymatically distinct proteins as a super-oncogene and as a target for combination therapy.",

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 393 cancer patients with sepsis admitted to South China Hospital of Shenzhen University from January 2019 to January 2024. Collected data included clinical demographics, laboratory indicators such as white blood cell count, neutrophil count (NEUT), platelet count (PLT), lymphocyte count (LYC), C-reactive protein, procalcitonin (PCT), alanine aminotransferase, and the ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to inspired oxygen fraction, as well as functional scores like Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment. Multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves assessed the predictive ability of these factors for 28-day survival. Results showed significantly higher NEUT (P<0.001) and lower PLT and LYC (P<0.001) in the death group, while APACHE II score (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.776) and PCT 24h (AUC = 0.723) demonstrated strong predictive value for mortality risk. The joint projection model's AUC reached 0.966, significantly outperforming individual indicators, indicating that combining multiple indicators offers a more accurate prediction of survival versus mortality risk. Additionally, 24h LCR and 24h PCTc were notably lower in the death group compared to the survival group, reinforcing the advantage of combined indicators for prognosis. Overall, using both peripheral blood indicators and PCTc significantly improves the accuracy of mortality risk assessment in cancer patients with sepsis, enhancing prognostic evaluation and supporting optimized clinical decision-making.",

The proportions of patients requiring initiation of antifungal therapy were 34.4%, 48.8%, and 43.4%, respectively (P<0.05). Among the 169 elderly AML patients, three (1.8%) developed infection-induced multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (i-MODSE), all in the standard chemotherapy group. Venetoclax combined with hypomethylating agents shows a favorable safety profile and reduced infection risk in the treatment of AML in the elderly patients. Meanwhile, nontargeted therapies, a prolonged duration of neutropenia, and a prolonged duration of fever were found to be independent risk factors for fungal infections and the need for antifungal intervention.",

The overexpression of Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is associated with increased metastatic potential and poor clinical outcome in gastric cancer. Despite the proven clinical response rates of approved HER2-targeted therapies, including Trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy, their limited long-term clinical benefits and inevitable disease progression still pose significant challenges to the clinical treatment of gastric cancer. Hence, exploring novel strategies to enhance therapeutic outcomes for HER2-positive patients is extremely crucial and urgent. Here, we reported that DX126-262, a novel HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate, generated by conjugating a potent Tubulysin B analogue (Tub-114) to humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, exhibited a significant synergistic inhibitory effect with both Cisplatin and 5-FU in HER2-positive gastric cancer NCI-N87 cells. Moreover, the triple-drug combination strategy of DX126-262 combined with Cisplatin and 5-FU showed much better",

    "abstract": "Androgen receptor (AR) signaling is a target in prostate cancer therapy and can be treated with non-steroidal anti-androgens (NSAA) including enzalutamide, and apalutamide for patients with advanced disease. Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCPRC) develop resistance becomes refractory to therapy limiting patient overall survival. Darolutamide is a novel next-generation androgen receptor-signaling inhibitor that is FDA approved for non-metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). Imipridone ONC201/TIC10 is first-in-class small molecule imipridone that activates the integrated stress response (ISR), upregulates TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and has activity against CRPC alone or in combination with enzalutamide in preclinical models. We hypothesized that combination of imipridones with androgen receptor signaling blockers such as darolutamide may synergize in anti-tumor efficacy against mCRPC cells. mCRPC cell lines 22RV1, LNCaP, DU145 and PC3 were treated with imipridones ONC201, ONC206, apalutamide, darolutamide, or enzalutamide as single agents or in combinations. Combinations of ONC201 or ONC206 and androgen receptor signaling blockers demonstrated synergistic effects in mCRPC cells. Combinations of ONC201 and darolutamide or enzalutamide reduced PSA levels in LNCaP cells and induced of ATF4 in both LNCaP and 22RV1 cell lines. Darolutamide synergized with ONC201 regardless of AR status or castration sensitivity in vitro. Flow cytometric analysis showed increased intra-tumoral NK cells in mice treated with ONC201 and combination of ONC201 and darolutamide. Trends of increased TRAIL activation within NK cells were also observed in treatment groups. ONC201 and darolutamide demonstrated anti-tumor effects in vivo in the 22RV1 CRPC model.

We performed a retrospective study enrolling 5547 patients in T1 GC from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were produced to recognize independent risk factors of LNM and DM. Cox regression analyses were performed to identify important prognostic factors of overall survival (OS). Cancer-specific cumulative incidence was plotted by cumulative incidence function.

There is no specific or effective manner of intervention currently available. Asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP) plays a pivotal role in the maintenance of cellular functions through regulating proteolytic cleavage as peptidase enzyme. We aimed to investigate the role of unique cardiac AEP in cardiac function by modulating key signaling elements in the myocardium. The murine heart was exposed to a single dose of 14 Gy radiation. Cellular signaling and apoptosis was analyzed in human and rat cardiomyocytes treated with various doses of radiation, we observed expression of AEP was increased by immunohistochemical staining in murine heart exposed to radiation. The AEP production along with its increased level of mRNA expression was associated with increased doses of radiation (0, 2, 5, 10 Gy) in cardiomyocytes. The myocardial cells transfected with AEP overexpression showed overall cellular viability enhancement, DNA damage inhibition, the foci formation of γ-H2AX suppressed and DNA repair enhancement significantly after radiation exposure. Small interfering RNA-mediated AEP knockdown was with reduced cardiomyocyte viability, elevated apoptotic rate, increased γ-H2AX foci formation and inhibited DNA repair as well after irradiation. After radiation exposure of 10 Gy, the expression of AEP increased in P53 overexpressing cardiomyocytes and decreased in the P53 knockdown cells, indicates that radiation-induced expression of AEP might be regulated by P53. Moreover, treatments with either AEP overexpression or knockdown showed enhanced NRF2 activity in the nuclear or suppressed NRF2 expression in the cytoplasm of myocardial cells after irradiation, respectively, defined a possible regulatory effect of AEP associated with diminished NRF2 translocation and activation by radiation exposure, including impair myocardium and myocardial apoptosis. These findings suggest that increased levels of AEP in failing myocardium after irradiation is mediated by P53 and regulate a novel pathway that involves NRF2 activation. AEP is essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis of cardiac function.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is regarded as the third most common cancer worldwide. Although Regorafenib as a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI) disrupts tumor growth and angiogenesis in metastatic CRC (mCRC) patients, drug resistance leads to poor prognosis and survival. Integrin-β1 overexpression has been proposed to be the major player in this regard. Herein, the Regorafenib-resistant human colon cancer cell line (SW-48) was induced, and the Integrin-β1 gene expression, as well as apoptosis, was assessed through the combination of small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting Integrin-β1 and Regorafenib/Dimethyldioctadecylammonium bromide (DDAB)-methoxy poly (ethylene glycol) (mPEG)-poly-e-caprolactone (PCL) hybrid nanoparticles (HNPs). In the current study, Regorafenib-resistant SW-48 cell line was generated in which the Regorafenib half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for non-resistant and resistant cells was 13.5±1.5 µM and 55.1±0.8 µM, respectively. The results of DLS also demonstrated that the size and the charge of the HNPs were equal to 66.56±0.5 nm and +29.5±1.2 mv, respectively. In addition, the Integrin-β1 gene expression was significantly higher in resistant cells than in non-resistant ones (P<0.05). The siRNA/HNP complexes in combination with Regorafenib/HNPs were accordingly identified as the most effective treatment to decrease the Integrin-β1 gene expression and to enhance the apoptosis rate in resistant cells (P<0.001). Overall, the study indicated that combination therapy using siRNA/HNP and Regorafenib/HNPs complex could down-regulate the Integrin-β1 gene expression and consequently trigger apoptosis, and this may potentially induce drug sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Hepatoblastoma (HB) is the most frequent pediatric liver malignancy. However, the treatment outcome for patients with advanced-stage HB remains unsatisfactory. Accumulating evidence indicates that βKlotho (KLB) acts as an oncogene or a tumor-suppressor gene in a context-dependent manner. Despite this, the expression profile and effects of KLB on the growth of HB are still elusive. This study aimed to explore the effect of miR-206/KLB axis on HB growth. The expression of KLB was explored in HB cells (HepG2 and HuH6) and tissues using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Besides, miR-206 expression was determined in HB cells and tissues using qPCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The prognostic value of KLB or miR-206 in our patients with HB was investigated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The biological effects of KLB or miR-206 on HB cells were identified in vitro. The proliferative effects of KLB on HuH6 cells were also investigated in vivo. Moreover, the mechanical signaling of KLB in HB was determined through bioinformatics analysis followed by experimental validation. The results showed a significant upregulation of KLB in HB tissues and cells. Elevated level of KLB was found to be significantly correlated with the aggressive phenotype and poor overall survival for children with HB. The in vitro function assay demonstrated that KLB knockdown promoted apoptosis and suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HB cells. Besides, KLB knockdown inhibited the proliferation of HuH6 cells in vivo, while KLB overexpression had the opposite effect. Furthermore, KLB was proved to be the direct target of miR-206. Low level of miR-206 served as an independent risk factor for poor prognosis in children with HB. The overexpression of miR-206 negatively regulated the aggressive biological behaviors of HB cells, which was partially rescued by KLB overexpression. Mechanically, the miR-206/KLB axis played a vital role in HB growth through augmenting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling. In conclusion, the data demonstrated that the miR-206/KLB axis might serve as an important biomarker/therapeutic target for HB.",

Tumor cells treated with Triptolide failed to grow in 3-D cultures in a concentration-dependent manner. Triptolide markedly reduced E6 and E7 transcript levels. Further studies revealed that exposure to Triptolide increased the levels of p53 and pRb. As a consequence, Caspase-3/7 activation and apoptosis was induced in cervical cancer cells by Triptolide. Subsequently, we evaluated the efficacy of Minnelide in xenotransplantation models of cervical cancer. Minnelide at very low doses effectively inhibited the growth of established cervical cancers in all the three animal models tested. Furthermore, Minnelide treatment was more effective when combined with platinum-based chemotherapy. These studies show that Minnelide can be used to inhibit the growth of cervical cancer.",

Proteogenomic analyses of mitochondria of CRC tumor cells would likely enhance our understanding of CRC pathogenesis and reveal new independent prognostic factors and treatment targets. However, comprehensive investigations focused on mitochondria of CRC patients are lacking. Here, we investigated global profiles of structural variants, DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility, transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome on human CRC. Proteomic investigations uncovered greatly diminished mitochondrial proteome size in CRC relative to that found in adjacent healthy tissues. Integrated with analysis of RNA-Seq datasets obtained from the public database containing mRNA data of 538 CRC patients, the proteomic analysis indicated that proteins encoded by 45.5% of identified prognostic CRC genes were located within mitochondria, highlighting the association between altered mitochondrial function and CRC. Subsequently, we compared structural variants, DNA methylation, and chromatin accessibility of differentially expressed genes and found that chromatin accessibility was an important factor underlying mitochondrial gene expression. Furthermore, phosphoproteomic profiling demonstrated decreased phosphorylation of most mitochondria-related kinases within CRC versus adjacent healthy tissues, while also highlighting MKK3/p38 as an essential mitochondrial regulatory pathway. Meanwhile, systems-based analyses revealed identities of key kinases, transcriptional factors, and their interconnections. This research uncovered a close relationship between mitochondrial dysfunction and poor CRC prognosis, improve our understanding of molecular mechanism underlying mitochondrial linked to human CRC, and facilitate identifies of clinically relevant CRC prognostic factors and drug targets.",

However, early-stage clinical trials indicate that drug tolerance may limit their anti-tumor efficacy. Here, we show that JQ1-refractory EOC cells acquire reversible resistance to BET inhibition and remain dependent on BRD4 function. The insensitivity is driven by a unique non-genetic mechanism that involves clonal selection for a pre-existing cell subpopulation with ample acetylated histones and sufficient nuclear phase-separated BRD4 droplets to counteract BETi antagonism. A vertical combination approach by co-blocking BET proteins and downstream Aurora kinases proves to achieve more complete responses than single inhibitors. Collectively, our study implicates epigenetic heterogeneity in therapeutic resistance to chromatin-targeted agents and proposes a rational strategy to address this anticipated clinical dilemma.",

In this study, we revealed that AF1Q was overexpressed in multiple osteosarcoma cell lines, and its expression level increased with the severity of tumor malignancy in osteosarcoma biopsies. AF1Q was coupled with the transcription factor T cell factor 4 (TCF4) to assemble a complex to bind to the promoter of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and activate its expression. The individual knockdown of AF1Q, TCF4, or COX2 in osteosarcoma cell lines significantly decreased cell proliferation and invasion in vitro. The tumor xenograft model also indicated that the individual knockdown of AF1Q, TCF4, or COX2 could inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. On the basis of these promising results, we established an in vitro AlphaScreen method to identify the compounds that disrupted the AF1Q-TCF4 interaction in a naturally derived small molecule pool. We discovered a compound called PSM0537, which showed a strong ability to inhibit the AF1Q-TCF4 interaction at a low dose of half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) (210.3 ± 15.6 nM). The administration of PSM0537 in vitro and in vivo could dramatically inhibit cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. Collectively, our findings reveal that the AF1Q-TCF4 transcriptional complex controls the expression of COX2 and that targeting the AF1Q-TCF4 interaction with PSM0537 could inhibit tumor cell growth and metastasis. Our results provide a new path for chemotherapy of osteosarcoma.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the first common cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide. Since the malignancy and aggressiveness of breast cancer have been correlated with the presence of breast cancer stem cells, the establishment of a disease model with cancer stem cells is required for the development of a novel therapeutic strategy. Here, we aimed to evaluate the availability of cancer stem cell models developed from mouse induced pluripotent stem cells with the conditioned medium of different subtypes of breast cancer cell lines, the hormonal-responsive T47D cell line and the triple-negative breast cancer BT549 cell line, to generate in vivo tumor models. When transplanted into the mammary fat pads of BALB/c nude mice, these two model cells formed malignant tumors exhibiting pronounced histopathological characteristics similar to breast cancers. Serial transplantation of the primary cultured cells into mammary fat pads evoked the same features of breast cancer, while this result was perturbed following subcutaneous transplantation. The tumors formed in the mammary fat pads exhibited immune reactivities to prolactin receptor, progesterone receptor, green florescent protein, Ki67, CD44, estrogen receptor α/β and cytokeratin 8, while all of the tumors and their derived primary cells exhibited immunoreactivity to estrogen receptor α/β and cytokeratin 8. Cancer stem cells can be developed from pluripotent stem cells via the secretory factors of cancer-derived cells with the capacity to inherit tissue specificity. However, cancer stem cells should be plastic enough to be affected by the microenvironment of specific tissues. In summary, we successfully established a breast cancer tumor model using mouse induced pluripotent stem cells developed from normal fibroblasts without genetic manipulation.",

However, the phenotypical feature of this patient population is largely undefined. The current study aimed to categorize metastatic NPC patients into novel subgroups based on their EBV DNA trajectories. In this retrospective study, 446 eligible patients with metastatic NPC treated at Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Center between 2012 and 2016 were analyzed. Using a mixture model analysis, we identified distinct trajectories based on longitudinal EBV DNA measurements. We evaluated their associations with metastatic NPC mortality using Cox regression analysis. The two-class trajectory model provided the best fit, in which 272 patients were classified as non-sustained EBV DNA class and 174 patients as sustained EBV DNA class. After a median follow-up of 60.8 months, the median OS was 61.7 months in the sustained EBV DNA clearance class versus 20.0 months in the non-sustained EBV DNA clearance class (P<0.001). Compared with patients in the non-sustained EBV DNA clearance class, patients in the sustained EBV DNA clearance class demonstrated superior PFS (HR, 3.238; 95% CI, 2.601-4.032; P<0.001). Forty-three patients experienced disease-free for longer than 36 months, defined as long-term survivors (LTS). Notably, 41 patients were presented in the sustained EBV DNA clearance class (95.3%), along with only 2 patients in the non-sustained EBV DNA clearance class. Collectively, we identified two EBV DNA trajectory sub-phenotypes of patients with metastatic NPC, providing more reliable survival information for physicians and patients during their informed decision-making process.",

In this study, a total of 225 pancreatic cancer patients were enrolled, mainly pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC, 97.33%). 140 patients (62.22%) provided sufficient tumor tissues for genomic analysis, and the rest (37.78%) were provided serum instead. Utilizing target next-generation sequencing (NGS), we analyzed genomic alterations of 618 selected genes. Corresponding data in the TCGA database were also analyzed here. In total, 26 (11.61%) patients had pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline variants, mainly (84.62%) involved genes in the DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway. The mean and median counts of somatic alterations per sample were 6.28 and 5, respectively. The most frequently mutated genes in our cohort were KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A, SMAD4, FBXW7 and ARID1A, revealing a significantly different prevalence of genes including KRAS, CDKN2A, ARID1A, NOTCH1, ARID1B than the corresponding data in the TCGA database. 39.11% of patients were identified with actionable alteration and the ratio was not significantly different between tissue and serum samples. 22.67% of patients harbored DDR gene alterations, which were associated with a higher tumor mutation burden. We also found that all the DDR alterations were not correlated with the overall survival and immune and stroma score, but the changes in NK cells and follicular T cells were identified in samples with DDR changes according to TCGA database. In summary, we identified a distinct genomic feature of Chinese pancreatic cancer patients by comparing with the data in TCGA database, and suggested the role for genetic testing using tissue or ctDNA samples in decision-making process. DDR alterations were associated with a higher tumor mutation burden and the significantly higher counts of NK cells in DDR altered samples may raise the attention in future related drugs development.",

    "abstract": "Despite the impressive results obtained in the preclinical setting, all the inhibitors targeting two central cascades in cancer, the PI3K/akt/mTOR and the KRAS/MEK/ERK pathways, have shown, apart from very few exceptions, disappointing efficacy when translated to the clinic. One of the main reasons of their clinical failure seems to be the lack of a clear molecular determinant of response to these drugs. In this study, we tried to address this point by evaluating the cytotoxic activity of different inhibitors targeting the two pathways at different levels in a panel of ten NSCLC cell lines harboring alterations in PI3K, KRAS or both. We were not able to highlight a correlation between the presence of KRAS and PI3K mutations and a specific sensitivity to the different drugs used. Molecular analyses performed after equimolar treatments showed that, independently from the entity of the response, the drugs are able to modulate the activation of their targets. Interestingly, we found that p53 mutational status separates the cell lines according to their sensitivity to PI3K pathway inhibitors treatments. The alterations considered in the PI3K/akt/mTOR and in the KRAS/MEK/ERK pathways in the different NSCLC cell lines are not sufficient to drive treatment choice but rather p53 status is a potential biomarker for the activity of this class of drugs.",

    "abstract": "Prostate and breast cancers are hormone-related malignancies and are characterized by a complex interplay of hundreds of susceptibility loci throughout the genome. Prostate cancer could be inhibited by eliminating androgens through castration or estrogen administration, thus facilitating long-term treatment of prostate cancer; however, the role of estrogen in prostate cancer remains unclear. This study aimed to determine whether polygenic risk scores (PRSs) comprising combinations of genome-wide susceptibility variants influence the clinical outcomes of prostate cancer patients. The study subjects were recruited from four medical centers in Taiwan, and genome-wide genotyping data were obtained from 643 prostate cancer patients. We derived the PRS for prostate cancer (PRS-PC) and for breast cancer (PRS-BC) for each patient. The association between the PRS-PC/PRS-BC at the age of prostate cancer onset and recurrence within seven years was evaluated using a regression model adjusted for population stratification components. A higher PRS-PC was associated with an earlier onset age for prostate cancer (beta in per SD increase in PRS = -0.89, P = 0.0008). In contrast, a higher PRS-BC was associated with an older onset age for prostate cancer (beta = 0.59, P = 0.02). PRS-PC was not associated with the risk of recurrence (hazard ratio = 1.03, P = 0.67), whereas a higher PRS-BC was associated with a low recurrence risk (hazard ratio = 0.86, P = 0.03). These results indicate that the genetic predisposition to breast cancer is associated with a low risk of prostate cancer recurrence. Further studies are warranted to explore the role of breast cancer susceptibility variants and estrogen signaling in prostate cancer progression.",

This study investigated the role of Kruppel-like factor 16 (KLF16) in GC. Real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry were used to examine the expression of KLF16 in gastric cells and tissues. Gene overexpression and silencing were applied to study the involvement of KLF16 in GC cell growth and metastasis along with its underlying mechanism. The results indicate that KLF16 overexpression is significantly associated with nodal status, distant metastasis, staging, degree of differentiation, vascular invasion, and patient survival. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model analysis revealed that the overexpression of KLF16 is an independent prognostic biomarker of GC. The in vitro study revealed that up-regulated KLF16 accelerates cell growth and metastasis, whereas the inhibition of KLF16 suppresses these cellular activities. The results of an animal study also indicated that the overexpression and silencing of KLF16 accelerate and repress xenograft proliferation and metastasis. Further studies of affected cell growth and metastasis revealed that KLF16 modulates the cell cycle and epithelial-mesenchymal transition through transcriptional regulation of microfibrillar-associated protein 5. Collectively, these results reveal that KLF16 overexpression is a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for the treatment of GC.",

Traditional chemotherapeutic drugs have low selectivity, which can kill cancer cells and cause damage to normal cells at the same time. Therefore, it is particularly important to study therapies that target cancer cells and to find low-toxicity, high-efficiency anticancer drugs. Cyy260 is a novel small molecule inhibitor that we synthesized for the first time. Here, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities of Cyy260 and explored the underlying mechanisms in NSCLC. Cyy260 had a concentration- and time-dependent inhibitory effect on NSCLC cells, but it was less toxic to normal cells. Cyy260 regulated apoptosis through intracellular and extracellular apoptotic pathways. In addition, Cyy260 could also induce cell cycle arrest, thereby inhibiting cell proliferation. Further analysis of molecular mechanisms showed that the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway was involved in the antitumor effect mediated by Cyy260. Analysis of subcutaneously transplanted tumors in mice showed that Cyy260 suppressed tumor growth in vivo. Our results proved that Cyy260 is a novel inhibitor of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway thus may have potential in therapy of NSCLC and other cancers.",

Following POS treatment, XTT viability assay was used to determine the cell proliferation of ERMS cell lines. Protein changes related to Hedgehog signaling, cell cycle and autophagy were detected by Western blot. The cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry. Moreover, a subcutaneous tumor mouse model of ERMS was established to assess the anti-tumor effect of POS. POS was found to inhibit tumor progression by inducing G0/G1 arrest and autophagy of RD, RMS-YM, and KYM-1 cells dose-dependently. Western blot demonstrated that POS downregulated the expressions of SMO, Gli1, c-Myc, CDK4, and CDK6, while upregulated the expressions of autophagy-related proteins. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a significant increase of LC3B puncta in POS-treated ERMS cells. Furthermore, POS treatment led to a significant inhibition of tumor growth in mice bearing ERMS. Our findings could provide a theoretical basis and have important clinical implications in developing POS as a promising agent against ERMS by targeting Hedgehog pathway.",

It continues to give rise to massive challenges to clinicians and cancer researchers. One of the main goals of our present study is to determine if there exists any statistically significant difference in the survival probabilities of male and female pancreatic cancer patients in different cancer stages and irrespective of stages. Another goal is to investigate if there exists any parametric probability distribution function that best fits the male and female patient survival times in different stages of cancer, irrespective of stages, and compare the survival probabilities with the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. We employed both parametric and non-parametric statistical approaches to examine the survival probabilities of 10,000 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and showed that there is no significant difference in male and female survival times at any stage except stage IV. We also found no evidence of a statistically significant difference in overall mean survival durations between male and female pancreatic cancer patients, regardless of stage. We used parametric survival analysis and identified the Generalized Pareto (GP) probability distribution as the best fit to the overall survival data for pancreatic cancer patients. Also, we identified the appropriate probability distributions for patients in different cancer stages. We then estimated the overall survival probabilities and compared them with the frequently used non-parametric Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival method, which is not as powerful as our parametric analysis. An assessment of the survival probability estimates generated by the two procedures found that the parametric method produced a better survival probability estimate than the Kaplan-Meier approach. We further compared the median survival times of patients using descriptive, parametric, and non-parametric techniques of analysis and found that the results were relatively consistent. We found that parametric survival analysis is more reliable and efficient than non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimates since it is based on a well-defined parametric probability distribution.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents one of the most common cancers with dismal prognosis. Definitive diagnosis of PDAC remains challenging due to the lack of specific biomarkers. A transcription factor essential for pancreatic development named HNF-1B can be a potential biomarker for PDAC. However, HNF-1B was not entirely specific for PDAC and can be expressed in cancers of Mullerian tract, kidney, lung, bladder and prostate. To solve this issue, we investigated the expression of a panel of well-established lineage-specific biomarkers for non-pancreatic origins, including TTF1 and Napsin A for lung, RCC for kidney, ER and PR for breast, NKX3.1 for prostate, PAX8 for Mullerian tract, GATA3 for breast and bladder, and keratin CK7 and CK20 in 149 PDACs, using immunohistochemistry and tissue microarray. A two-tier scoring system for HNF-1B expression in tumor cells was used. Chi-square and Fisher's exact tests were performed using SAS software version 9.4 to test the association between HNF-1B expression and tumor morphology and differentiation. The results showed that PAX8 was focally positive in 6 cases (4.0%). GATA3 was focally positive in 5 cases (3.4%). Napsin A was all negative except for 1 case with focal staining. All other lineage-specific markers such as TTF1, RCC, ER, PR and NKX3.1 were completely negative in all PDACs. Consistent with our previous result, the majority of PDACs (88.6%) was positive for HNF-1B, including 78 cases (59.1%) with strong and 54 cases (40.9%) with weak staining pattern. There was no significant association between HNF-1B expression and cytoplasmic clearing morphology. Addition of keratins may further aid the diagnosis of PDAC since the majority of PDACs (84.6%) was CK7+/CK20-, only a minority of PDACs (11.4%) was CK7+/CK20+, 2.7% were CK-/CK20-, and 1.3% were CK7-/CK20+. In conclusion, HNF-1B can serve as a useful biomarker to aid the diagnosis of PDAC when combined with other lineage-specific biomarkers to exclude the other origins.",

In this research, a tissue microarray (TMA) with 151 paired tissues showed the aberrant overexpression of BRMS2 in CRC tissues which was associated with the worse prognosis. To clarify the function of BRMS2 in CRC cells, an inducible knockdown system was introduced in vitro and in vivo and the cell growth was drastically suppressed. Mechanistically, we found depletion of BRMS2 markedly decreased the protein translation rates which can limit cell growth. Furthermore, to confirm whether the IRBC played a role, multiple approaches including detection of the p53 pathway, depletion of BRMS2 in p53-mutated SW620 cells, and co-depletion of RPL11 were taken. To our surprise, IRBC was not activated. That indicated BRMS2 may play a unique role in ribosome biosynthesis and IRBC.

To investigated the prognosis of solid tumor MLL t-AML, 157 patients were divided into 3 groups: non-MLL t-AML (n=41), MLL t-AML (n=18) and MLL de novo AML (n=98). Of the 150 patients underwent anti-leukemia therapy, the complete remission (CR) was similar in MLL t-AML, non-MLL t-AML and MLL de novo AML (P=0.251). 3-years overall survival (OS) was 37.5%, 21.5% and 20.4% (P=0.046), and leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 28.0%, 32.2% and 22.7% (P=0.031), and the incidence of relapse was 30.0%, 50.4% and 53.5% (P=0.382), respectively, in the three groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that MLL t-AML was a risk factor while allo-HSCT was a protective factor for OS, LFS, and relapse (P<0.001, P<0.001 and P=0.005) (P=0.002, P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). The 3-years OS was 0%, 17.9% and 2.3% (P=0.038), and LFS was 0%, 23.1% and 3.3% (P=0.017), and relapse was 100%, 53.1% and 74.4% (P=0.001), respectively, among three groups in patients undergoing chemotherapy alone, while OS was 64.3%, 52.7% and 40.7% (P=0.713), LFS was 60.0%, 48.8% and 37.0% (P=0.934), and relapse was 25.0%, 47.4% and 47.5% (P=0.872), respectively, among these groups in patients undergoing allo-HSCT. Intriguingly, MLL t-AML was no longer risk factor for relapse and LFS (P=0.882 and P=0.484, respectively), and it became a favorable factor for OS (P=0.011) in patients undergoing allo-HSCT. In conclusion, MLL t-AML had poor prognosis compared with non-MLL t-AML and MLL de novo AML, but allo-HSCT might overcome the poor prognosis of MLL t-AML.",

This question has not been answered in the literature; thus, the present study was carried out to evaluate the feasibility and effect of ISIB on GC in animal and clinical studies. An animal model of Tu-212 cell laryngeal carcinoma xenografts (n = 20 animals) underwent ISIB treatments [experimental group (EG) using 0.8-mCi/seed, control group (CG) using 0-mCi/seed]; at 4 weeks, haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining was performed, and the mRNA and protein expression of Bax, Bcl-2 and PCNA was analysed. Moreover, thirty healthy beagle dogs underwent ISIB under CT guidance (EG, 0.8 mCi/seed, CG, 0 mCi/seed), and injuries to the normal tissue were analysed by HE and Masson staining at 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Finally, twenty-one GC patients (T2-3N0M0) underwent percutaneous ISIB at a mean prescription dose of 116.8 Gy; the technical success, complications, local tumour response, voice quality, local progression and overall survival were analysed. The results showed that the xenograft tumours were significantly inhibited in the EG. The Bax protein levels were significantly increased in this group (P 0.05). The clinical study found that the rate of technical success was 100% with no procedure-related complications; furthermore, complete response was achieved in all patients, and no local progression occurred. All patients survived and showed improvements in their voice quality (P<0.05) during the follow-up period (median 23.5 months). The results show that ISIB is a safe and effective treatment for GC; randomized controlled trials are needed to further evaluate its clinical efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Genitourinary tumors are groups of tumors with high complexity and heterogeneity. For long-term monitoring, biomarkers that can be used in detection, grading and treatment response assessment are needed. With rapid development in imaging technology and cancer radiogenomics, the combination of radiology and genomics, has emerged as a powerful tool in oncology practice in recent years because imaging can provide some information that genomic test cannot as gene expression and mutation status are usually evaluated on a small portion of the tumor and are usually not powerful enough to reflect tumor heterogeneity. Radiogenomics investigates the correlations between imaging features and gene expression of a disease, especially in oncologic diseases. It aims to detect the disease's mutation status and supplement genomic analysis based on imaging analysis, providing additional findings for diagnosis, treatment decisions, evaluation of treatment response and prognosis prediction of the disease. Recent years have seen an increase in the number of studies investigating the application of radiogenomics in genitourinary tumors. Many studies have shown promising results. However, there still exist limitations and challenges. In this review, we will summarize recent applications of radiogenomics in genitourinary tumors and discuss limitiations, challenges and future directions of radiogenomics.",

    "abstract": "Targeting mitosis by taxanes is one of the most common chemotherapeutic approaches in various malignant solid tumors, but cancer cells may survive antimitotic treatment with attainable in vivo concentrations due to mitotic slippage with a residual activity of the ubiquitin ligase anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) and a continuous slow ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent cyclin B-degradation leading to mitotic exit. Therefore, blocking cyclin B-proteolysis via additional proteasome (PI) or APC/C-inhibition may have the potential to enhance tumor cell eradication by inducing a more robust mitotic block and mitotic cell death. Here, we analyzed this approach in different cell lines and more physiological patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from lung and breast cancer. The sequential combination of paclitaxel with the PI bortezomib enhanced cell death, but in contrast to the hypothesis during interphase and not in mitosis in both lung and breast cancer. APC/C-inhibition alone or in sequential combination with paclitaxel led to strong mitotic cell death in lung cancer. But in breast cancer, with high expression of the anti-apoptotic regulator Mcl-1, cell death in interphase was induced. Here, combined APC/C- and Mcl-1-inhibition with or without paclitaxel was highly lethal but still resulted in interphase cell death. Taken together, the combination of antimitotic agents with a clinically approved PI or inhibitors of the APC/C and Mcl-1 is a promising approach to improve treatment response in different solid tumors, even though they act entity-dependent at different cell cycle phases.",

    "abstract": "Gemcitabine is often recommended as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. However, gemcitabine resistance is a major challenge in the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Our group serendipitously identified the role of doxycycline as a potentiator of gemcitabine efficacy in pancreatic cancer cells. Doxycycline and gemcitabine co-treatment was significantly more cytotoxic to pancreatic cancer cells compared to gemcitabine alone. Interestingly, doxycycline only exerted synergistic effects when coupled with gemcitabine as opposed to other conventional chemotherapeutics including nucleoside analogs. The anti-clonogenic effects of gemcitabine on pancreatic cancer cells were also enhanced by doxycycline. According to cell cycle analyses, doxycycline prolonged gemcitabine-mediated S phase cell cycle arrest. Further, gene expression profiling analyses indicated that a small set of genes involved in cell cycle regulation were uniquely modulated by gemcitabine and doxycycline co-treatment compared to gemcitabine alone. Western blot analyses indicated that several cell cycle-related proteins, including cyclin D1, p21, and DNA damage inducible transcript 4 (DDIT4), were further modulated by doxycycline and gemcitabine co-treatment. Taken together, our findings indicate that doxycycline enhances the effects of gemcitabine on cell cycle progression, thus rendering pancreatic cancer cells more sensitive to gemcitabine. However, additional studies are required to assess the mechanisms of doxycycline and gemcitabine synergism, which might lead to novel treatment options for pancreatic cancer.",

The present study aimed to demonstrate anti-cancer functions of HedC against human osteosarcoma cells.

HedC increased p53, Bax, and p21, whereas HedC reduced Bcl-2. HedC-mediated apoptosis was accompanied by decreases in the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and STAT3 phosphorylation. Wound healing and Boyden chamber assays also showed the anti-metastatic effects of HedC by suppressing migration and invasion. In addition, the anti-cancer effects of HedC were observed in in vivo xenograft mice model, and HedC treatment induced the decreased PCNA and p-STAT3 as well as the increased p53 and cleaved caspase-3. Taken together, our results provide evidence that HedC might be an attractive therapeutic strategy against osteosarcoma.",

    "abstract": "Herceptin-resistant tumor relapse remains a major clinical issue responsible for the poor prognosis of HER2+ breast cancer. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and finding a therapeutic solution are of paramount urgency to improve the patient management. Here we report that anticancer redox active cerium oxide nanoparticles (CONPs) can potently sensitize the cancer cells to the cytotoxicity of Herceptin. By comparing between Herceptin-sensitive and Herceptin-resistant human breast cancer cell lines under normoxic as well as hypoxic culture conditions, we found that in the presence of CONPs, Herceptin can kill the Herceptin-resistant cells equally effectively as it kills the Herceptin-sensitive cells under the hypoxic, but not normoxic, culture conditions by inhibiting the cell viability, survival and proliferation. Signaling analysis reveals that under the normoxic conditions, the levels of hypoxia induced factor 1α as well as vascular endothelial growth factor are higher in the Herceptin-resistant cells than that in the Herceptin-sensitive cells and are strongly induced once the culture is switched to the hypoxic conditions, which can be potently suppressed by CONPs. Treatment with CONPs plus Herceptin significantly slows down the primary tumor growth and lung metastasis of the Herceptin-resistant cells in a xenograft mouse model of orthotopic breast cancer through inhibiting the cell proliferation and survival as well as tumor angiogenesis. These results shed new lights on the mechanisms underlying the Herceptin resistance of the HER2+ breast cancer and provide insights into introducing CONPs-like agents to Herceptin-based therapy to improve treatment outcomes.",

Among the six alternative-splicing isoforms of PIPKIγ, PIPKIγ_i2 specifically targets to focal adhesions and regulates focal adhesion turnover, thus was proposed responsible for tumor metastasis. In the present study, we specifically depleted PIPKIγ_i2 from mouse triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) 4T1 cells and analyzed their behaviors. As expected, PIPKIγ_i2-depleted 4T1 cells exhibited reduced proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro at a comparable level as pan-PIPKIγ depleted cells. However, PIPKIγ_i2 depletion had no effect on metastasis and progression of 4T1 tumors in vivo. PIPKIγ_i2-depleted tumors showed similar levels of growth, hypoxia state, macrophage infiltration, and angiogenesis as parental tumors, although the pan-PIPKIγ depletion led to substantial inhibition on these aspects. Further investigation revealed that depleting PIPKIγ_i2 alone, unlike depleting all PIPKIγ isoforms, had no effect on PD-L1 expression, the status of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and the anchorage-independent growth of 4T1 cells. In human TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells, we obtained similar results. Thus, while PIPKIγ_i2 indeed is required for cell migration and invasion, these characteristics are not decisive for metastasis. Other PIPKIγ isoform(s) that regulate the expression of key factors to support cell survival under stresses is more critical for the malignant progression of TNBCs.",

Herein we conducted a drug synergy screening that combined a marketed PI3Kδi, idelalisib, with 14 well-characterized epigenetic drugs across several types of aggressive NHL cell lines. We identified BRD4 inhibitors (BRD4i) as potent partners that, in combination with idelalisib, were capable of synergistically exerting anti-proliferative activity and inducing cell apoptosis in a panel of aggressive NHL cell lines through continuous suppression of PI3K pathways. More importantly, the combination of BRD4i and PI3Kδi simultaneously inhibited transcription and translation of the oncogenic transcription factor c-MYC, downregulating the expression of c-MYC and continuously suppressing the proliferation of cancer cells in vitro, as well as the growth of tumors in vivo even after drug withdrawal. This study, thus, reveals the potential of simultaneously targeting PI3Kδ and BRD4 as a new therapeutic strategy for aggressive forms of NHL.",

    "abstract": "In spite of radio- and chemotherapy, glioblastoma (GBM) develops therapeutic resistance leading to recurrence and poor prognosis. Therefore, understanding the underlying mechanisms of resistance is important to improve the treatment of GBM. To this end, we developed a radiation-resistant cell model by exposure to consecutive periods of irradiation. Simultaneously, single high-dose irradiation was introduced to determine when GBM developed consecutive irradiation-induced resistance (CIIR). We found that CIIR promoted TGF-β secretion, activated pro-survival Akt, and downregulated p21 in a p53-independent manner. Furthermore, CIIR upregulated multidrug-resistant proteins, resulting in temozolomide resistance. CIIR GBM also enhanced cell mobility and accelerated cell proliferation. The big-conductance calcium-activated potassium channel (BK channel) is highly expressed and activated in GBM. However, CIIR diminishes BK channel activity in an expression-independent manner. Cilostazol is a phosphodiesterase-3 inhibitor for the treatment of intermittent claudication and was able to reverse CIIR-induced BK channel inactivation. Paxilline, a BK channel blocker, promoted cell migration and proliferation in parental GBM cells. In contrast, Cilostazol inhibited CIIR-induced cell motility, proliferation, and the ability to form tumor spheres. Moreover, we established a radiation-resistant GBM in vivo model by intracranially injecting CIIR GBM cells into the brains of NOD/SCID mice. We found that Cilostazol delayed tumor in vivo growth and prolonged survival. As such, inactivation of the BK channel assists GBM in developing radiation resistance. Accordingly, restoring BK channel activity may be an effective strategy to improve therapeutic efficacy, and cilostazol could be repurposed to treat GBM.",

A total of 95 paired tumor and peripheral blood samples from metastatic CRC patients were included. The tumor DNA and cfDNA were analyzed with a 10-gene NGS panel (Illumina HiSeq2500 system). The median number of mutations in tumor samples was 3 (range 0-7). The most commonly mutated gene was TP53 (63.2%), followed by APC (49.5%), KRAS (35.8%) and FAT4 (15.8%). The concordance of mutation patterns in these 10 genes was as high as 91% between cfDNA and tumor samples in these metastatic CRC patients. A sensitivity of 88.2% and specificity of 100% was found when using KRAS mutation status of cfDNA to predict KRAS mutation in tumor tissue. For tumor DNA with TP53, KRAS, or APC mutations, right-sided CRCs were more likely to develop peritoneal metastases, while for tumor DNA with TP53 mutations, left-sided tumors were more likely to have lung metastases. For cfDNA with TP53 or KRAS mutations, right-sided CRCs were more likely to have peritoneal metastases. Due to the high concordance of mutation patterns between cfDNA and tumor samples, monitoring the mutation pattern of cfDNA may be applicable in the treatment of metastatic CRC.",

Both early and late DEX intervention suppressed tumor growth in mouse colorectum, and downregulated the expression of PCNA and cyclin D1. Moreover, DEX treatment significantly inhibited TNFα production, mucosal infiltration of inflammatory cells, and the activity of MAPK/JNK pathway, particularly early DEX intervention. However, we also found that DEX treatment deteriorated the general state of mouse manifested by greater loss of body weight and rectal bleeding. In summary, both early and late DEX interventions significantly ameliorate colonic inflammation and inhibit the progression of AOM/DSS-induced colorectal cancer, at least partly due to the inhibition of MAPK/JNK pathway.

Interestingly, we found that endogenous JAB1 interacted with endogenous SOX9, a potent oncogene and a master regulator of skeletogenesis, in chondrosarcoma cells, but not in primary chondrocytes. JAB1 also binds to the same SOX9-mediated chondrocyte-specific enhancer elements in CS cells. Furthermore, we found that a recently developed, novel, potent, and JAB1-specific small molecule inhibitor, CSN5i-3, can significantly increase apoptosis, drastically alter the activities of several signaling pathways, and modulates the expression of specific Cullin-ring-ligases (CRLs) in CS cells. Finally, our RNA-sequencing analysis in JAB1-KD CS cells identified a total of 2945 differentially expressed genes. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that JAB1 regulates several essential pathways such as DNA damage response and cell cycle regulation. In conclusion, our study showed that JAB1 might regulate a distinct pro-tumorigenic regulatory network to promote chondrosarcoma pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The presence of bone metastases (BM) in patients with lung cancer is indicative of a worse prognosis. The present study aims to investigate the risk factors associated with BM in patients with lung cancer. Patients with lung cancer admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University between June 2019 and September 2021 were enrolled in this study. A nomogram was constructed based on the outcomes derived from univariate and multivariate analyses. Concordance index, calibration plots, receiver operating characteristic curves, and decision curve analysis were used to evaluate the nomogram. To substantiate the influence of monocytes on lung cancer BM, various assays, including cell co-culture, Transwell, wound-healing assays, and immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining, were conducted. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 22.0 software and GraphPad Prism 7.0. A total of 462 eligible patients were enrolled, comprising 220 with BM and 242 without. Multivariate analysis revealed that histological type, medical history, monocyte percentage, and LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) and ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase) levels were independent risk factors for BM in lung cancer. Transwell and wound-healing assays indicated that co-culture with monocytes significantly enhanced the migration and invasion capabilities of A549 cells in vitro. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated a noteworthy increase in monocyte infiltration in the primary lesions of patients with lung cancer with BM. In conclusion, this study successfully constructed and validated a precise, straightforward, and cost-effective prognostic nomogram for patients with lung cancer with BM.",

A total of 60 lung cancer patients were included, of which 53% were diagnosed at an early stage while 47% were diagnosed at an advanced stage. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the proportion of T and B cells in all blood samples, and the levels of human serum cytokines were also assessed. Compared to the control group, cancer patients showed lower frequencies of IgD+CD27+ marginal B cells and CD32+ B cells, and higher frequencies of T cells with lower CD8+ T cells and higher central memory and naïve CD4+ T cells. Additionally, advanced-stage cancer patients exhibited higher levels of cytokines, a higher proportion of effector memory CD8+ T cells, and a lower frequency of CD27+CD28+CD4+/CD8+ T cells. Linear regression analysis revealed significant correlations between cancer stage and the frequency of B and T cell subsets, leukocyte count, and cytokine levels. Survival analysis demonstrated that patients with higher frequency of class-switched B cells had a worse prognosis, while patients with higher frequency of CD8+ effector T cells and lower frequency of CD4+57+ T cells appeared to have a better survival rate. These findings provide valuable insight into the immunological changes that occur during lung cancer progression and have the potential to inform the development of new immunotherapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a significant cause of mortality, while the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Our studies have revealed that KIF2C plays a crucial role in tumor proliferation and metastasis in HNSCC. The results demonstrate that KIF2C is highly expressed at both the mRNA and protein levels and is closely associated with lymph node metastasis. The gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses indicate that the differentially expressed genes are enriched in processes or pathways related to cell adhesion and cell mitosis in HNSCC. Moreover, the established protein-protein interaction network identifies KIF2C as a potential hub gene in HNSCC. Knockdown of KIF2C has been demonstrated to significantly reduce cell migration and invasion ability, leading to cell cycle arrest, a high proportion of abnormal cell apoptosis, and cell chromosome division mismatches in the HNSCC cell line. Downstream genes such as PDGFA, EGFR, TP63, SNAI2, KRT5, and KRT14 were found to be down-regulated, and multiple critical pathways, including mTOR, ERK, and PI3K-AKT pathways, were inactivated as a result of KIF2C knockdown. These findings provide strong evidence for the crucial role of KIF2C in HNSCC and suggest that targeting KIF2C may be a promising therapeutic strategy for this disease. Knockdown of KIF2C has been shown to significantly inhibit tumor proliferation in nude mice, demonstrating the potential therapeutic role of KIF2C in HNSCC treatment.",

    "abstract": "Double expressor lymphoma (DEL), characterized by high expressions of both MYC and BCL-2, displays poor prognosis after current therapies. The HDAC inhibitor chidamide has been approved for treatment of T cell lymphoma, but its efficacy on B cell lymphoma is unclear. Here, by combining inhibition screening and transcriptomic analyses, we found that the sensitivity of B lymphoma cells to chidamide was positively correlated with the expression levels of MYC. Chidamide treatment reduced MYC protein levels and repressed MYC pathway in B lymphoma cells with high MYC expressions. Ectopic expression of MYC in chidamide-insensitive B lymphoma cells increased their response to chidamide. Thus, we proposed that adding chidamide into R-CHOP (CR-CHOP) might be effective for DEL, and retrospectively analyzed 185 DEL patients treated in West China Hospital. 80% of patients showed response to CR-CHOP treatment. In the median follow-up of 42 months, CR-CHOP significantly improve the survival for DEL patients with R-IPI ≤2. Totally 35 patients underwent autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in remission and demonstrated a trend for better survival. Combining CR-CHOP with ASCT resulted in the most superior PFS and OS above all. For response patients, CR-CHOP reduced relapse with better PFS than R-CHOP-like regimens with or without ASCT. Taken together, our data indicated that chidamide repressed the MYC pathway in B lymphoma and is potentially efficacious to treat DEL.",

Normal fibroblasts (NFs) and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) were isolated and characterized from normal control and prostate cancer specimens, respectively. PC3 and DU145 cells, and the corresponding enzalutamide resistant counterparts, PC3-EnzR and DU145-EnzR, were co-cultured with NFs or CAFs to evaluate the effects of TME in driving enzalutamide resistance. Cell viability of prostate cancer cells was examined by MTT assay. The study also utilized recombinant human neuregulin-1 (NRG1) protein and siRNA to modulate NRG1 expression in CAFs. RT-qPCR, Western blot, and ELISA were employed to assess gene and protein expressions related to the NRG1-HER3 signaling pathway and its association with enzalutamide resistance. CAFs significantly promoted cell growth and enzalutamide resistance of PC3-EnzR and DU145-EnzR cells through substantial increased secretion of NRG1 by CAFs. Co-culturing enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer cells (PC3-EnzR and DU145-EnzR) with CAFs further enhanced enzalutamide resistance, as evidenced by elevated IC50 values. Inhibition of NRG1 in CAFs attenuated their impact on enzalutamide resistance, providing insight into the role of NRG1 in mediating the crosstalk between CAFs and prostate cancer in the context of enzalutamide resistance. This study elucidates the pivotal role of CAF-secreted NRG1 in promoting enzalutamide resistance in prostate cancer, providing valuable insights for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance in advanced prostate cancer.",

Logistic regression, calibration curve, clinical impact curve (CIC) analysis, decision curve analysis (DCA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were used to assess the risk factors and construct a joint risk model. There were significant differences between the two groups in pathologic fracture, Tomita classification, posterior wall destruction, injected laterality, injected bone cement volume, radicular pain, pulmonary embolism, and medullary compression. Pathologic fracture, radicular pain, pulmonary embolism, and medullary compression were positively correlated with the occurrence of LCK, while Tomita classification, posterior wall destruction, injection laterality, and injected bone cement volume were negatively correlated with the occurrence of LCK. Pathological fracture, Tomita classification, posterior wall destruction, injected laterality, injected bone cement volume, and specific postoperative complications were identified as significant risk factors associated with LCK. The constructed joint risk model, incorporating these risk factors, demonstrated substantial predictive value, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.885. Clinical validation in an independent patient cohort further confirmed the predictive power of the joint risk model, with an AUC of 0.846. This study underscores the multifactorial nature of LCK in surgical management of spinal metastases, providing valuable insights for risk assessment and management.",

    "abstract": "Microscopic vascular invasion (MVI) has been demonstrated as a strong risk factor associated with tumor recurrence and poor overall survival among hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after resection, but the preoperative prediction of MVI is still challenging. We aimed to build and validate a novel model to predict MVI in the preoperative setting. We retrospectively collected 857 patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0 or A HCC who underwent primary resection at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Hospital between January 2001 and June 2016. The patients were randomized into derivation (n = 648) and validation groups (n = 209). Logistic regression analysis was used to screen out independent risk factors for MVI and further constructed a predictive model for MVI. Prediction performance was compared by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The multivariable logistic regression analysis of the training cohort found that alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) ≥ 20 ng/mL (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.41-2.73, P < 0.001), albumin < 3.5 g/dL (OR = 1.48, 95% CI: 1.06-2.05, P = 0.019) and tumor burden score (TBS) ≥ 8.6 (OR = 2.54, 95% CI: 1.49-4.35, P = 0.001) to be independent risk factors for MVI. The three factors were chosen to build a model for prediction of MVI. The AUC for the training and validation group was 0.619 (95% CI: 0.575-0.663) and 0.642 (95% CI: 0.562-0.722), respectively, and the calibration plot showed good performance of the prediction model, with a low mean absolute error at 0.01. In conclusion, the new model comprised AFP, albumin, and TBS that can predict risk of MVI for early-stage HCC.",

However, the long-term survival results are suboptimal. Optimization of the conditioning regimen aims to eradicate leukemia blasts and reduce early relapse. Here we reported of the preliminary result of the prospective multicenter single arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a modified dual alkylator-conditioning regimen, MCBC (regimen including Melphalan, Cladribine, Busulfan and Cyclophosphamide) (ChiCTR Registration ID: ChiCTR2000029936). This trial enrolled 56 patients from July 2020 to January 2022. With a median follow-up of 854 days (range 48 to 1343), the 2-year overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were 60.7 ± 6.5% (95% CI 47.5-73.9) and 57.1 ± 6.6% (95% CI 43.8-70.5), respectively, the estimated 3-year OS and RFS rates were 58.9 ± 6.6% (95% CI 45.6-72.2) and 55.4 ± 6.6% (95% CI 41.9-68.8), respectively. A total of 19 patients experienced relapse, the 2-year cumulative incidence relapse (CIR) rate was 34.2 ± 6.6% (95% CI 19.5-44.8), the estimated 3-year CIR rate was 36.3 ± 6.7% (95% CI 21.1-46.7). Six patients died of severe infection or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The non-relapse mortality (NRM) rate was 11.8 ± 4.5% (95% CI 2.4-19.1). Mucositis was the main reported regimen-related toxicity, and it was well controlled. Subgroup analyses illustrated that blasts count ≥ 20% before HSCT and the absence of maintenance treatment after HSCT were poor predictors. Our study confirmed the excellent anti-leukemia activity and acceptable toxicity of the MCBC conditioning regimen in R/R AML. Opportune maintenance treatment after HSCT led to significantly improved OS and RFS.",

A retrospective analysis was conducted on the medical records of 212 patients with early GLC treated with TEPR between February 2015 and September 2018 at Dongying People's Hospital. Clinical characteristics, objective voice function changes, and clinical outcomes of the patients were analyzed. Meanwhile, Kaplan-Meier curve was plotted to assess the impact of TERP on 3- and 5-year survival in GLC patients. Additionally, univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess prognostic factors for GLC recurrence, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to assess their predictive value for patients' prognosis. After surgery, Patients' Jitter (%), Shimmer (%) showed significant improvement from pre-surgery, in contrast to Harmonic noise ratio and maximum phonation time, which underwent a significant decrease. The study assessed success and recurrence rates over 3- and 5-year follow-up periods, revealing a disease control rate of 86.79%, with 3- and 5-year recurrence rates of 14.62% and 20.28%, respectively. Patients were categorized into favorable and unfavorable prognosis groups based on the 3-year recurrence. Univariate analysis identified significant risk factors for recurrence, including age, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, clinical stage, and cumulative anterior commissure involvement (P < 0.05). Further multivariate logistic regression confirmed the above indexes as independent risk factors impacting patient prognosis. In conclusion, TEPR effectively treats early GLC, though recurrence risk persists, with age, TNM stage, clinical stage, and anterior commissure involvement identified as prognostic risk factors, suggesting the need for targeted preventive measures in clinical practice.",

In this study, we determined the IC50 of QUE for inhibiting cell viability in multiple TNBC, non-TNBC, and normal breast cell lines. We compared the expression of ORM2 in TNBC clinical samples and normal tissues. Additionally, we measured ORM2 expression in TNBC and normal breast cell lines. We determined the IC50 of QUE for inhibiting cell viability after ORM2 knockdown. An orthotopic implantation mice model was used to evaluate the treatment effect of QUE. We also conducted molecular docking and amino acid exchange validation to model the binding of QUE to ORM2. Furthermore, we performed a protein-protein interaction network analysis and GO enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes associated with ORM2 in TNBC. QUE inhibited the viability of both TNBC and non-TNBC cell lines, but it was specifically associated with worse survival in TNBC patients. We observed higher expression of ORM2 in breast cancer cells compared to normal breast cells. Knockdown of ORM2 reduced the viability of TNBC cells. Treatment with QUE inhibited ORM2 expression and decreased viability in TNBC cells. In the animal model, QUE improved survival and downregulated ORM2 expression in tumors. Enrichment analysis provided insights into the potential functions of ORM2. Conclusion: Our findings indicate that QUE directly inhibits TNBC cell viability through its interaction with ORM2. These results contribute to our understanding of the anti-cancer mechanisms of QUE in TNBC and highlight ORM2 as a potential therapeutic target.",

Thus, the objective of this study was to determine the effect of each status of hyperglycemia on the risk of PC. In a Korean National Health Insurance Service database cohort, a total of 560,413 individuals who were followed until 2018 were analyzed. The risk of PC in patients with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and new onset DM as well as all DM was determined. Associations of metabolic syndrome (MetS) components with the risk of PC according to glycemic status were evaluated. The association of anti-diabetic drugs with the incidence of PC was also analyzed. The presence of new-onset and all DM showed a significant reduction of the risk of PC in adjusted models. There was a trend that the presence of DM reduced the risk of PC regardless of the presence of MetS components. Regarding associations of anti-diabetic drugs with the incidence of PC, DM patients who were taking less than three drugs of oral hypoglycemic agents including metformin showed a reduced risk of PC compared to patients without using metformin. This study supports an inverse relationship between DM and the risk of PC. However, the risk of PC can be different depending on glycemic status and sorts of anti-diabetic drugs.",

We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for overall survival and HNC-specific survival, and we stratified the results according to cancer site. The study included 10,177 patients from 10 studies worldwide. Underweight patients had lower overall survival (HR=1.69, 95% CI: 1.31-2.19) respect to those having normal weight with consistent results across the HNC sites. Overweight and obese patients had a favourable HNC-specific survival (HR=0.77 (95% CI: 0.70-0.84) and HR=0.80 (95% CI: 0.76-0.84), respectively), with heterogenous results according to HNC site. Our findings show that high BMI values at cancer diagnosis improved the survival rates in patients with HNC, especially among smokers. This association may be explained by residual confounding, reverse causation, and collider stratification bias, but may also suggest that a nutritional reserve may help patients survive HNC cancer.",

The prevailing hypothesis suggested that stem cell changes may be the key underlying mechanisms, but epidemiological evidence has been notably scarce. Herein we examined the relationship between reproductive risk factors and the expression of well-established stem cell markers CD44, CD24, and ALDH1A1 in benign breast biopsy non-cancerous samples. Our study included 735 participants from the Nurses' Health Study II who were diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed incident benign breast disease (BBD). Reproductive history and other BBD/breast cancer risk factors were measured from self-reported biennial questionnaires. Immunohistochemistry was performed on breast tissue microarrays from normal terminal ductal-lobular units (TDLU) cores. Marker expression in epithelium and stroma was quantified using semi-automated image analysis. The generalized linear regression was used to examine the associations of reproductive factors with the positive expression of CD44, CD24, and ALDH1A1, adjusted for known breast cancer risk factors. Age at first birth ≥30 years old (vs. <25 years) was associated with lower ALDH1A1 expression in the epithelium (β for ≥30 vs. <25 years = -0.30, 95% CI -0.57; -0.03, p-trend = 0.03). Parity, breastfeeding, age at menarche, and the time interval between menarche and age at first birth were not associated with the expression of any of the three markers in epithelium or stroma. These findings suggest age at first birth may influence the ALDH1A1 expression in breast tissue.

Until now, there has been a lack of accurate and efficient prognostic models for patients with lung cancer brain metastases (LCBM), and the factors influencing the effectiveness of the surgery on primary lesion for these patients remain unclear. We used 7 machine learning algorithms to create prognostic models to predict the overall survival (OS) of LCBM based on the data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results. Then, a series of validation methods, including area under the curve values, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, calibration curves, decision curve analysis and external data validation were used to confirm the high discrimination, accuracy, and clinical applicability of the XGBoost models. Propensity score matching adjusted analysis was conducted for further stratified analysis to find factors influencing the benefit of surgery on primary lesion for LCBM. Models using XGBoost algorithm performed best. Surgery on primary lesion was a favorable independent prognostic factor for LCBM. Age > 70 years old, blacks, grade IV, stage T4, N3, other distant organ metastases, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma and no radiation were all unfavorable factors of primary lung tumor surgery for the prognosis of LCBM. Our study is the first one to create highly accurate AI models to predict the OS of LCBM. Our in-depth stratified analysis found some influence factors of surgery on primary lesion for the prognosis of LCBM.",

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at increased risk for UC, and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are frequently used to manage anemia in ESRD. However, ESA use in cancer patients raises concerns about tumor progression and survival outcomes. This study aimed to assess the impact of ESA use on tumor recurrence, cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) in patients with ESRD and early-stage UC. We analyzed data from the Chang-Gung Research Database (CGRD) in Taiwan, including 850 patients with ESRD and non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and 492 patients with ESRD and localized UTUC. The ESA group was compared to a non-ESA cohort, and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied to minimize selection bias. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests were used to evaluate bladder recurrence-free survival, CSS, and OS. In NMIBC patients, ESA use did not significantly affect bladder recurrence-free survival, CSS, or OS. Similarly, ESA use in localized UTUC patients did not increase the risk of bladder recurrence or negatively impact CSS and OS. However, UTUC patients treated with ESA demonstrated a significantly increased risk of contralateral recurrence (P < 0.001). The use of ESA in patients with ESRD and early-stage UC appears safe regarding bladder recurrence, CSS, and OS, but clinicians should remain vigilant for contralateral recurrence in localized UTUC. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex management of anemia in patients with concurrent ESRD and UC, emphasizing the need for tailored clinical monitoring in this high-risk population.",

In this study, we analyzed the effect of miR-503-5p targeting type IA bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR1A) on CH to inform future diagnosis and treatment of CH. First, miR-503-5p and BMPR1A abnormal expression sequences (vectors) were transfected into human hemangioma-derived endothelial cells (HemECs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to observe alterations in cell biological behavior, adhesion, and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). We found enhanced proliferative, invasive and migrating abilities of HemECs and HUVECs after silencing miR-503-5p or increasing BMPR1A, accompanied by reduced apoptosis, elevated intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and accelerated EMT; after increasing miR-503-5p or silencing BMPR1A, the cells exhibited reduced apoptosis, elevated ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and accelerated EMT (P<0.05). Subsequently, a dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to analyze the targeting relationship between miR-503-5p and BMPR1A. The results showed that miR-503-5p inhibited BMPR1A-wild type (WT) fluorescence activity (P<0.05). Through the rescue experiment, it was observed that the biological behavior of the cells with simultaneous elevation or simultaneous silencing of miR-503-5p and BMPR1A was not different from that of cells transfected with BMPR1A empty vector (P>0.05), indicating that the effect of BMPR1A on cells was reversed by miR-503-5p. Finally, in the analysis of clinical records, we found that CH cases exhibited lower miR-503-5p and higher BMPR1A levels than healthy controls (P<0.05). The expression of the two genes was negatively correlated (P<0.05). These results suggest that miR-503-5p participates in CH growth by targeted sponging of BMPR1A.",

The radiomic features from each imaging sequence were utilized for initial modeling. A combined model, which included features retained from all 3 sequences, was then established. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) determined the efficacy of each model. For 5 specific histopathologic features, the combined model achieved AUCs of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.85-0.90), 0.90 (95% CI, 0.88-0.92), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.87-0.90), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.86-0.92), and 0.87 (95% CI, 0.86-0.90). This model incorporated 38 radiomic features: 12 from T2WI, 17 from CE-T1WI, and 9 from DWI. In conclusion, an MRI radiomics-based model can differentiate between early- and advanced-stage endometrial cancer and between low- and high-risk histologic markers, giving it the potential to predict high risk and stratify preoperative risk in those with endometrial cancer. The findings may aid personalized preoperative assessments to guide clinical decision-making in endometrial cancer.",

    "abstract": "Primary analysis of the open-label, single-arm, phase II RENMIN-215 trial (primary data cutoff date: July 10, 2023) showed promising efficacy and tolerable safety with tislelizumab plus fruquintinib and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in patients with refractory microsatellite stable (MSS) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Here, we reported updated survival and safety results with a median follow-up of 34.0 months (data cut-off May 20, 2024), as well as patient-reported outcomes and laboratory analysis. Twenty patients with MSS mCRC resistant or refractory to at least second-line therapy were enrolled and received tislelizumab plus fruquintinib and FMT. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate, safety, health-related quality of life questionnaire and exploratory laboratory tests. In addition, 94 mCRC patients who received third-line or above immunotherapy in real world were screened for propensity score matching (PSM) analysis to compare efficacy. Our results showed that the median OS was 13.7 months (95% CI, 9.3-17.7), and the ORR was 20.0% (95% CI, 5.7-43.7). After PSM, the median OS benefit of the study regimen remained statistically significant (HR = 0.26; 95% CI, 0.07-0.95; P = 0.042). Patients with primary tumor surgery had better clinical outcomes. No new safety concerns were detected. Seven (35.0%) patients had one or more grade 3 treatment-related adverse events. The majority of patients had improved or stable global health status (GHS). Median time to deterioration for GHS was 7.7 months. Peripheral blood lymphocyte analysis showed that increased gamma-delta 2 T cells were positively associated with improved response and survival. To conclude, the updated results provide further evidence of sustained antitumor activity of tislelizumab plus fruquintinib and FMT in heavily pretreated MSS mCRC patients with a consistent safety profile.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of immune resistance and a lack of effective therapeutic targets have become significant challenges in immunotherapy, highlighting the urgent need for new molecular markers and treatment targets. Moreover, the significance and mechanisms of PGRN (Progranulin) in gastric cancer remain ambiguous. To identify differentially expressed proteins in gastric cancer and elucidate the function and mechanism of PGRN. The data-independent acquisition proteomics was used to identify the differentially expressed proteins in gastric adenocarcinoma and the corresponding paraneoplastic tissues, providing a comprehensive dataset of gastric cancer-related proteins. The function and mechanism of PGRN in gastric cancer were further explored using a series of experiments, including RT-qPCR (Real Time-Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction), cell transfection, cell viability assays, cell scratch, immunohistochemistry and Transwell assays, Western blot, and a mouse tumor-bearing model. These investigations were combined with bioinformatics analyses to examine the relationship between PGRN expression and clinical-pathological characteristics, confirming its high expression of PGRN in gastric cancer tissues. We identified a large number of differentially expressed proteins between gastric cancer and adjacent tissues and conducted an initial functional analysis. Further studies on PGRN showed that it was associated with gastric cancer prognosis and lymph node metastasis. The inhibition of PGRN expression led to reduced cell viability, migration, and invasion, with corresponding changes in related genes and proteins. In a mouse tumor-bearing model, the tumor growth of the subcutaneously transplanted tumors in nude mice was reduced after the inhibition of PGRN expression. An in-depth functional analysis of PGRN was performed using bioinformatics to predict protein interactions, miRNA regulation, and relationships with multiple immune cell types. Enrichment analysis indicated that PGRN is involved in multiple signaling pathways, with the MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) pathway selected for validation. In AGS and HGC27 cells, PGRN inhibition led to increased expression of phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) in the MAPK pathway, suggesting that PGRN may promote gastric cancer development by regulating p-p38. This study identified significant differences in protein expression between gastric adenocarcinoma and adjacent tissues, with PGRN emerging as a key protein influencing gastric cancer proliferation, migration, and invasion. These findings suggest that PGRN could serve as a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer.",

Globally, HCC ranks among the most common cancers and is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths. Obesity, a growing health issue worldwide, is increasingly recognized as a critical risk factor for HCC, influenced by both epidemiological and clinical factors. Adipokines, secreted by adipocytes, have been shown to play pivotal roles in the tumor microenvironment, affecting cancer progression, metastasis, and resistance to therapies through various signaling mechanisms. Despite inconsistencies in certain findings, a substantial body of research supports the significant role of adipokines in HCC development.

Data on demographics, blood tests, SF-12, and Skindex-16 scores were analyzed. Patients were categorized into satisfactory and unsatisfactory outcome groups based on post-operative assessments. The training set of patients was sourced from the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, while the testing set of patients was sourced from the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University. Of 209 patients, 116 were in the satisfactory group, 93 in the unsatisfactory. Factors enhancing positive outcomes included reconstruction methods (P < 0.001) and smaller tumor diameters (P = 0.006). Higher pre-op 12-item Short Form Survey (SF-12) scores correlated with better outcomes (P = 0.005). Lower Skindex-16 scores were noted in the satisfactory group (P < 0.001).

We hypothesized that infiltration of tumor-involved lymph nodes with activated effector T cells would impact subsequent outcome. A total of 54 lymph nodes (27 N+ and 15 N- collected from 12 patients with Stage IIB (T2N1M0) and 12 N- lymph nodes collected from 10 patients with Stage IIA (T2N0M0) who underwent lymphadenectomy during surgical management of their NSCLC) were analyzed for effector T cells expressing activation markers PD-1 and TIM-3 using the Opal-multiple immunofluorescence assay. The frequency of CD3+CD8+ (P=0.0001), CD3+CD8+TIM-3+ (P<0.0001), and CD3+CD8+TIM-3+Ki-67+ (P<0.0001) T cells was greater in lymph nodes of IIA patients compared with IIB patients; however the frequency of CD3+CD8+PD-1+ (P=0.0086), CD3+CD8+TIM-3+ (P=0.0129), CD3+CD8+PD-1+Ki-67+ (P<0.0001) and CD3+CD8+TIM-3+Ki-67+ (P=0.0001) T cells was greater among the tumor involved (N+) nodes of N1 patients compared with the tumor-uninvolved (N-) nodes.

Annual incidence rates for CRC in individuals aged 15+ years during 2000-2020 in the five regions of Georgia were included. Temporal trends were examined within the five regions and stratified by age group. Joinpoint regression was employed to calculate the annual percent change and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

Overactivation of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway is the primary cause of the development and progression of Shh subtype MB, although the detailed mechanisms underlying this process remain largely elusive. In this study, we discovered that Shh can promote proliferation in MB cells through non-canonical Hedgehog signaling. This involves Shh binding to Patched 1, disrupting its interaction with Cyclin B1, allowing for nuclear translocation of Cyclin B1, and inducing the activation of genes involved in cell division. Furthermore, we observed that deregulation of Cdc14B leads to the stabilization of the Cyclin B1/CDK1 complex in MB cells through activating Cdc25C, a phosphatase known to help maintain Cyclin B1 stability. Our findings highlight the role of Cdc14B/Cdc25C/CDK1/Cyclin B1 in mediating Hedgehog signaling-driven pathogenesis in MB and have implications for identifying potential therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "As numerous countries around the world have entered an aging society currently, understanding the impact of aging on human health becomes critically important. Notably, aging is associated with increased prevalence of age-related diseases, with the lungs being particularly susceptible. Aging contributes to a decline in lung function, including respiratory disorders, inflammation, and oxidative stress. Therefore, it is a very important to identify and develop active substances that can mitigate lung cell aging. In current study, we evaluated the impact of Taraxasterol on lung cell senescence, showing that Taraxasterol can alleviate lung cell senescence, as evidenced by reductions in senescence-related marker molecules, including p16 and p21. Additionally, Taraxasterol was found to ameliorate inflammation and oxidative stress in lung cells. Further mechanistic studies indicated that Taraxasterol exerts anti-aging effects through the PGC1α/NRF1 signaling pathway in lung cell models. Since aging is also closely related to lung cancer, we also explored the potential anti-tumor effect of taraxasterol. Utilizing non-small cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC) as a model, we systematically study the anti-tumor effect of Taraxasterol both in vivo and in vitro. Our findings suggest that Taraxasterol exhibited anti-cancer effect through EGFR-mediated signaling. Taken together, Taraxasterol shows dual biological activities, offering promising anti-aging and anti-lung cancer benefits.",

The clinical characteristics, including lymph node metastasis and staging, based on CXCL8 expression levels, were analyzed. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves was drawn to assess its predictive value for lymph node metastasis and staging in NSCLC patients. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier curve was plotted to assess the impact of CXCL8 on 5-year survival in NSCLC Patients. NSCLC patients exhibited significantly higher serum CXCL8 levels than those with benign tumors (P<0.001), with the high CXCL8 expression group showing a higher incidence of lymph node metastasis or stage III NSCLC (P<0.01). CXCL8 was identified as an independent predictor of lymph node metastasis (AUC=0.730) and higher TNM stage (AUC=0.708), as well as a validated biomarker for predicting five-year survival in NSCLC patients. This study highlights the strong association between CXCL8 expression in NSCLC and patient prognosis, particularly regarding lymph node metastasis and clinical staging, suggesting the need for further research to explore CXCL8's specific role in the tumor microenvironment and its impact on different NSCLC subtypes.",

Empowered by the knowledge of oncogenic drivers and biomarkers, oncologists chart an optimal treatment path toward increasing the mathematical probability of a positive outcome. In this entire chain of events, an experimental proof of logical interrogation has never been incorporated before. Here, we provide the first evidence that the result of ex vivo testing of a drug matched to the genomic profiling of an N-of-1 tumor can deliver meaningful insight connecting scientific interrogation and a clinical event. Using resected tissues from endometrial (EC) and ovarian (OC) cancer patients, we designed a personalized ex vivo platform to test combinations of drugs in the default histological architecture of the individual tumors. Following the CART-T cells' principle, we co-cultured with autologous T-cells to test targeted drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors. The study was designed with a limited clinical information window from patient registration/consent to obtaining the tumor tissues, and adjuvant treatment/post-surgery event (PSE) data were accessed retrospectively. Using a checkerboard analysis, we found that PSE-free survival time was longer in patients whose therapy \"matched\" the effective drug combination in ex vivo culture/co-cultures compared to those with no effect. Specifically, out of 32 EC patients in the \"test & treatment-matched\" category whose tumor cells failed to respond to ex vivo drug testing, none achieved > 4 and > 3 years of PSE-free survival. In contrast, out of 38 EC patients in the \"test & treatment-matched\" category, 4 and 6 patients, whose tumor cells responded to drugs in ex vivo culture, achieved > 4 and > 3 years of PSE-free survival, respectively. Cases with genomically-guided ex vivo testing showed that a \"match\" between an effective ex vivo drug combination and therapy resulted in late PSE, whereas a \"match\" between prescribed treatment and an ineffective drug combination in ex vivo testing led to early PSE.

We analyzed data from the Taiwan Cancer Registry and National Health Insurance Research Databases spanning 2012 to 2018. Employing propensity score matching, patients were categorized into three groups: those receiving local treatments (180 patients), hepatectomy (179 patients), and combined treatments (180 patients). The primary outcomes were overall mortality and HCC-specific death, assessed using time-varying Cox regression models and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. During a median follow-up period of 3.92 years, all-cause mortality rates were observed as 74.44% for local treatments, 42.46% for hepatectomy, and 65.00% for combined treatments. HCC-specific mortality rates followed a similar pattern at 65.00%, 39.11%, and 59.44%, respectively. Adjusted hazard ratios demonstrated significantly elevated mortality risks associated with local and combined treatments compared to hepatectomy. Notably, the 2-year overall and HCC-specific survival rates were highest in the hepatectomy group, surpassing those observed in both the combined treatment and local treatment groups. The findings of our study highlight that for patients with BCLC Stage A HCC, undergoing hepatectomy prior to LTx is associated with superior survival outcomes compared to solely local treatments. This underscores the importance of considering hepatectomy as a vital component of the treatment strategy in this patient population.",

Among them, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is particularly prominent due to its high recurrence rate and extremely low five-year postoperative survival rate. In addition to surgical treatment, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy are the main methods for treating HCC. Due to the natural drug resistance of chemoradiotherapy and targeted drugs, satisfactory results have not been achieved in terms of therapeutic efficacy and cost. AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine protein kinase. It mainly coordinates the metabolism and transformation of energy between cells, which maintaining a balance between energy supply and demand. The processes of cell growth, proliferation, autophagy, and survival all involve various reaction of cells to energy changes. The regulatory role of AMPK in cellular energy metabolism plays an important role in the occurrence, development, treatment, and prognosis of HCC. Here, we reviewed the latest progress on the regulatory role of AMPK in the occurrence and development of HCC. Firstly, the molecular structure and activation mechanism of AMPK were introduced. Secondly, the emerging regulator related to AMPK and tumors were elaborated. Next, the multitasking roles of AMPK in the occurrence and development mechanism of HCC were discussed separately. Finally, the translational implications and the challenges of AMPK-targeted therapies for HCC treatment were elaborated. In summary, these pieces of information suggest that AMPK can serve as a promising specific therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC.",

Our previous bioinformatics study revealed that significant CDC6 overexpression in gliomas was closely correlated with poor patient prognosis. Through qPCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry, we will further validate CDC6 expression in clinical glioma specimens, while the effects of silencing and overexpressing CDC6 in the U87 and LN229 glioma cell lines on malignancy will be assessed through MTS, EdU, transwell, and migration assays. Luciferase reporter assays, ChIP, qPCR, and western blotting were used to explore the upstream and downstream molecular mechanisms of CDC6. Our study confirmed the abnormal overexpression of CDC6 in gliomas, particularly in glioblastomas. CDC6 promotes glioma cell activity, proliferation, invasion, and migration by activating the IL6-mediated JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. The transcription Factor E2F8 directly regulates CDC6 transcription, playing a crucial role in its abnormal overexpression in gliomas. This research provides vital evidence supporting CDC6 as a molecular target for glioma therapy.",

    "abstract": "The drug resistance is a major obstacle in acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) treatment. Our previous study has indicated that increased levels of Cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61) in the bone marrow can mitigate the chemosensitivity of B-ALL cells, though the specific source of Cyr61 in the bone marrow remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether hypoxia can induce Cyr61 production in B-ALL cells, delineates the underlying mechanisms, and evaluates the effect of Cyr61 on the chemosensitivity of B-ALL cells under hypoxia conditions. The results indicate that hypoxia promotes Cyr61 production in B-ALL cells by activating the NF-κB pathway. Increased Cyr61 expression appears to reduce the chemosensitivity of B-ALL cell to vincristine (VCR) and daunorubicin (DNR) through autophagy under hypoxia. Notably, inhibition of Cyr61 restores the chemosensitivity of B-ALL cells to both chemotherapeutic agents. This study is the first time to report that hypoxia decreases the chemosensitivity of B-ALL cells by inducing Cyr61 production, suggesting that targeting Cyr61 or its associated pathways could potentially improve the clinical response of B-ALL patients.",

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that play an active role in gene expression regulation, influencing cell growth, migration, and apoptosis. Here, we aimed to investigate the function of circSNYJ1 in NSCLC. In the present study, we found that circSNYJ1 expression level was increased in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of circSNYJ1 suppressed NSCLC cell proliferation, colony formation and migration while promoting apoptosis.

The Cancer Genome Atlas, Human Protein Atlas website, and the Genotype-Tissue Expression were utilized in analysis of PCMT1 expression. We examined the association between PCMT1 expression and various factors, including gene modifications, DNA methylation, immune cell infiltration, immunological checkpoints, drug susceptibility, tumor mutation burden (TMB), and microsatellite instability (MSI). Enrichment analyses determined the potential biological roles and pathways involving PCMT1. Our focus then shifted to the role of PCMT1 in breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA). We found that PCMT1 expression was aberrant in many tumors and significantly influenced the prognosis across several cancer types. Gene alterations in PCMT1 predominantly involved deep deletions and amplifications. A negative correlation was observed between DNA methylation and PCMT1 expression across all studied cancer types except thyroid carcinoma PCMT1 exhibited positive correlations with common lymphoid progenitor and CD4(+) T helper 2 cells, whereas it was inversely correlated with central and effector memory T cells, memory CD8(+) T cells, and CD4(+) T helper 1 cells. In many cancer types, PCMT1 expression closely correlated with immunological checkpoint inhibitors, TMB, and MSI. It was also significantly linked to pathways involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), highlighting its role in cancer metastasis. PCMT1 emerged as a significant predictor of breast cancer progression. In vitro experiments demonstrated that reducing PCMT1 expression decreased BRCA cell migration and invasiveness.

To achieve this, we retrospectively included 485 patients with high-grade glioma from the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, of which 312 patients were randomly divided into a training set (n=218) and a test set (n=94) in a 7:3 ratio. Twenty-five VASARI MRI features were selected from an initial set of 30, and three machine learning models - Multilayer Perceptron (MP), Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BNB), and Logistic Regression (LR) - were trained using the training set. The most informative features were identified using recursive feature elimination. Model performance was assessed using the test set and an independent validation set of 173 patients from Beijing Tiantan Hospital. The results indicated that the MP model exhibited the highest predictive accuracy on the training set, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) close to 1, indicating perfect discrimination. However, its performance decreased in the test and validation sets; particularly for predicting the 1p19q co-deletion status, the AUC was only 0.703, suggesting potential overfitting. On the other hand, the BNB model demonstrated robust generalization on the test and validation sets, with AUC values of 0.8292 and 0.8106, respectively, for predicting IDH mutation status and 1p19q co-deletion status, indicating high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The LR model also showed good performance with AUCs of 0.7845 and 0.8674 on the test and validation sets, respectively, for predicting IDH mutation status, although it was slightly inferior to the BNB model for the 1p19q co-deletion status. In conclusion, integrating VASARI MRI features with machine learning techniques shows promise for the non-invasive prediction of glioma molecular markers, which could guide treatment strategies and improve prognosis in glioma patients. Nonetheless, further model optimization and validation are necessary to enhance its clinical utility.",

Recent research has identified δ-catenin, a member of the catenin family, as playing a crucial role in the progression of prostate cancer. Nonetheless, the extent to which δ-catenin influences transcription factors associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has not been thoroughly explored. This study aims to investigate the hypothesis that δ-catenin enhances the stability of Twist1, thereby promoting the migratory and invasive capabilities of prostate cancer cells. Clinical data indicate a strong correlation between δ-catenin and Twist1 expression levels. Western blot analysis confirmed that δ-catenin stabilizes Twist1 and induces ectopic expression. Additionally, δ-catenin was found to reduce Twist1 phosphorylation by inhibiting GSK-3β activity. Immunoprecipitation analysis suggested that δ-catenin exerts its effect by competing with Twist1 for binding to ubiquitin (Ub). These results highlight the role of δ-catenin in the ubiquitination modification of Twist1, suggesting that the combined presence of δ-catenin and Twist1 could serve as a biomarker for tumor progression in prostate cancer.",

    "abstract": "In tongue cancer, many patients already have metastasis at the time of diagnosis, and such cases are usually unresponsive to treatment, resulting in a poor prognosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop more effective diagnostic and therapeutic methods to cure tongue cancer at the earliest possible stage in clinical practice. Follistatin-like 1 (FSTL1) is known as a negative effector molecule that induces and enhances the refractoriness of cancer cells directly and indirectly via suppressing anti-tumor immunity in various types of cancer. However, the molecular expression, functions, and clinical significance of FSTL1 and its receptor DIP2A in tongue cancer remains to be elucidated. In this study, we revealed that FSTL1, which is highly expressed in tongue cancer cells, plays a key role in its malignancy and is a significant risk factor for recurrence of early-stage tongue cancer. Basic study shows that FSTL1 is abundantly produced from human tongue cancer cell lines, and blocking FSTL1 with specific siRNAs or mAb significantly suppresses cellular functions. Clinical study shows that both FSTL1 and its receptor DIP2A are highly and correlatively expressed in tumor tissues of tongue cancer patients, and high expression levels of both in stage I tumors are significantly associated with shorter relapse-free survival. These suggest that targeting the FSTL1-DIP2A axis may be useful as a biomarker for early prediction of prognosis in tongue cancer patients, and as a therapeutic target for developing new drugs to treat tongue cancer more effectively. This strategy will contribute to improving clinical outcomes in tongue cancer.",

    "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) represents the most prevalent malignant bone tumor clinically, significantly impacting the health and safety of patients. The exploration of molecular pathogenic mechanisms is deemed a breakthrough for OS diagnosis and treatment. Within the GSE16088 dataset, a total of 1,948 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, comprising 1,697 down-regulated and 251 up-regulated genes. Notably, only two DEGs were associated with the response to trichostatin A: ARP2 actin-related protein 2 homolog (ACTR2) and MEF2C; ACTR2 garnered particular interest. Subsequently, 57 OS patients (research group) and 50 healthy controls from the same period (control group) were selected for analysis. The expression of ACTR2 in peripheral blood in both groups, as well as its levels in cancerous tissues and adjacent counterparts of OS patients, were evaluated, ascertaining the correlation between ACTR2 and OS. OS cases exhibited lower levels of ACTR2 compared to controls (P<0.05), with ACTR2 expression demonstrating a robust diagnostic capability for OS. Similarly, ACTR2 expression was diminished in cancer tissues (P<0.05). A three-year prognostic follow-up was conducted to assess the prognostic value of ACTR2 in OS patients. The follow-up findings revealed a significantly lower survival rate among patients with low ACTR2 expression in contrast to those with high expression (P<0.05). In vitro studies involved the construction of abnormal expression vectors for ACTR2 and miR-374a-5p, which were transfected into human OS cells (U2OS, SAOS). The outcomes indicated that elevating ACTR2 or suppressing miR-374a-5p attenuated the proliferative, invasive, and migratory capacities as well as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of OS cells while enhancing their apoptosis. Conversely, upregulation of miR-374a-5p yielded opposing effects (P<0.05). The dual-luciferase reporter (DLR) assay demonstrated that the fluorescence activity of ACTR2-WT was significantly inhibited by the miR-374a-5p mimic sequence (P<0.05), confirming the presence of a targeted regulatory relationship between ACTR2 and miR-374a-5p. These findings offer novel insights for future research directions in the diagnosis and treatment of OS.",

However, the specific molecular mechanisms responsible for irradiation-resistance have yet to be completely understood. In this research, the DNA methylation and gene expression patterns resulting from irradiation treatment were produced using the DNA methylation BeadChip and RNA-Seq. An integrated analysis was carried out to identify the genes that are differentially expressed and regulated by DNA methylation. As results, the upregulation of gene expression and downregulation of DNA methylation of hexokinase 1 (HK1), a protein associated with glycolysis, were observed in irradiation-resistant NSCLC cells. Additionally, treatment with the DNA demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) resulted in increased expression of HK1. Furthermore, it was found that overexpression of HK1 could enhance irradiation-resistance by impacting glycolysis. Collectively, our study indicate that irradiation-induced alterations in DNA methylation lead to the upregulation of HK1, which in turn promotes glycolysis and contributes to radiotherapy resistance in NSCLC. Therefore, targeting HK1 presents a potential novel strategy for addressing the issue of radiotherapy failure in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KHE) is a rare neoplasm of the newborn, but has a very high mortality rate. In this study, we explore the application value of ultrasound radiomics in the differential diagnosis of KHE so as to provide reference for early diagnosis of KHE. We selected 194 cases of children with suspected KHE admitted to Henan Provincial People's Hospital from March 2016 to April 2024 for this retrospective analysis. All children completed ultrasound examinations in our hospital. After pathological biopsy, 132 cases were diagnosed with KHE. Taking pathological biopsy as the gold standard, the diagnostic rate of ultrasound examination was determined. Our results showed that ultrasound examination diagnosed 124 cases with KHE. Compared with pathological biopsy, the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ultrasound were 81.82, 77.42, and 80.41%, respectively (Kappa = 0.725). Most of the children had a single lesion, often involving the skin. The tumor was hard in texture and red or purple in color and did not fade when pressed. The two-dimensional sonogram showed a solid heterogeneous echo mass in the soft tissue. The lesion was generally large, irregular in shape, and unclear in boundaries, extending to the adipose layer and forming a \"tree root-like\" change. Microscopically, crossed spindle-shaped cell bundles could be seen, showing diffuse multinodular infiltrative growth. Children with the Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP) generally had larger lesions. Subsequently, the children with KHE were assigned to a training set and a validation set in a ratio of 7:3. High-throughput data acquisition of the regions of interest (ROIs) on the ultrasound images was carried out to construct a KEH prediction model based on ultrasound radiomics, and validation analysis was conducted. We found the diagnostic accuracy rate of ultrasound radiomics was 91.41%, the sensitivity was 77.44%, and the specificity was 97.21%, which were better than those of the conventional ultrasound. In conclusion, ultrasound radiomics analysis is highly effective in the diagnosis of KHE, which can contribute to the early diagnosis rate of KHE.",

However, compared to younger patients, elderly patients often had multiple commodities and may refuse surgery due to being medically unfit or the high risk of operative mortality. This study aims to explore the effects of surgery on short- and long-term mortality in elderly LARC patients using a nationwide cancer registry. The cohort included 6211 patients aged over 65, with 2556 matched through propensity scoring for comparison between surgery (N = 1704) and non-surgery (N = 852) groups. The Cox proportional hazard model compared mortality between these groups. Our results showed that the elderly LARC patients who underwent surgery were more likely to be younger (65-75 years), have clinically-positive lymph nodes, and no comorbidities. Surgery was associated with significantly lower 3-month, 6-month, and 5-year mortality rates, with a greater absolute survival benefit (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 4.78; 95% CI, 2.71-8.43; aHR, 4.50; 95% CI, 3.07-6.58 and aHR, 3.81; 95% CI, 3.21-4.51). In stratified analysis, surgery remains provide significantly survival benefit according different age, gender and clinical classification. Furthermore, among non-surgical patients, those receiving chemoradiation had better survival outcomes compared to those receiving radiation, chemotherapy, or no treatment (all P < 0.001). This study highlights the survival advantage of surgery in elderly LARC patients and offers valuable guidance for clinical decision-making.",

Although zinc finger proteins (ZNFs) are known to play a role in LIHC, the specific function of ZNF248 remains poorly understood. In this study, we analyzed genomic and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to elucidate the role of ZNF248 through differential expression analysis, bioenrichment, immune response correlation, and drug sensitivity evaluation. Machine learning was employed to identify prognostic signatures derived from ZNF248, which were further validated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Functional assays, including Western blot and rescue experiments, were performed to assess the impact of ZNF248 on the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Our results demonstrate that ZNF248 is significantly overexpressed in LIHC patients and is associated with poor prognosis. Bioenrichment analysis revealed activation of oncogenic pathways, and elevated ZNF248 expression correlated with increased immune cell infiltration and enhanced immune scores, thereby influencing both immunotherapy response and drug sensitivity. Functional assays further confirmed that ZNF248 promotes LIHC progression and invasion, while silencing ZNF248 inhibited the PI3K/AKT pathway - a phenomenon reversible by the AKT activator SC79. These findings suggest that ZNF248 contributes to LIHC progression through the PI3K/AKT pathway and may represent a novel immunotherapeutic target and prognostic biomarker for LIHC.",

Notwithstanding the plethora of therapeutic modalities, a significant cohort of patients fail to respond to treatment and experience relapse. Anoikis, a distinct modality of programmed cell death, has been linked to cancer progression. However, the prognostic significance of anoikis in AML remains unclear. In this study, a non-negative matrix factorization algorithm was utilized to efficiently reduce the dimensions of merged datasets. We used differential analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), univariate Cox regression, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression to identify genes associated with prognosis and develop a risk scoring model. Immunohistochemistry was conducted to assess the expression levels of key genes in clinical samples. The association between risk score and the tumor microenvironment (TME), stemness, clinical characteristics, and immunotherapy was evaluated. We identified 41 AML anoikis-related genes (ANRGs) related to survival, and seven genes were chosen to develop prognostic models. The prognostic risk score combined with the clinical and pathological features of AML was used to develop a nomogram, and decision curve analysis demonstrated the net clinical benefit of the model. Furthermore, analysis of ANRGs revealed that PDGFRB inhibition significantly reduced the proliferation of AML cells, promoted apoptosis, and inhibited AML progression both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that PDGFRB plays a crucial role in AML development.",

Therefore, it is crucial to identify risk factors affecting their overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). This study aimed to construct practical machine learning models to predict survival time and help clinicians choose appropriate treatments. We reviewed the clinical and survival data of GCLM patients from 2010 to 2017 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) databases and divided the patients into training and testing groups. The risk factors affecting OS and CSS were determined by least absolute shrinkage and selector operator (LASSO), univariate cox regression, best subset regression (BSR) and the stepwise backward regression. Then, five machine learning models, including random survival forest (RSF), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), the Cox proportional hazard (CPH), Survival Support Vector Machine (survivalSVM), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were built using the identified risk factors. The model with the best predictive ability was determined using concordance index (c-index), area under the curve (AUC), brier score, and decision curve analysis (DCA), and externally verified with data from 233 cases diagnosed with liver metastasis of cancer from The Shijiazhuang People's Hospital, Jinan City People's Hospital, and The Sixth People's Hospital of Huizhou from 2017 to 2018. The study involved a total of 1300 GCLM patients. The prognostic risk factors affecting OS and CSS were the same, including grade, histology, T stage, N stage, surgery, and chemotherapy. The XGBoost model was found to have the best predictive ability for OS, with AUC of 0.891 [95% CI 0.841-0.941], brier score of 0.061 [95% CI 0.046-0.076], and c-index of 0.752 [95% CI 0.742-0.761], as well as for CSS, with AUC of 0.895 [95% CI 0.848-0.942], brier score of 0.064 [95% CI 0.050-0.079], and c-index of 0.746 [95% CI 0.736-0.756]. The AUC score, brier score and c-index all illustrated the accuracy of the model, and the validation using the external datasets further confirmed the reliability of the model.

These mechanisms provide the context for understanding the diversity and complexity of FL. Second, we discuss the challenges faced when treating FL, particularly treatment resistance. Therapeutic resistance is a common problem in treatment, but by delving into the mechanisms of resistance, scientists have looked for strategies to combat it, including developing new drugs, improving treatments, and exploring combination therapy strategies. We also emphasize the breakthroughs in molecular biology, especially the study of targeting the BCL2 gene, which provides a new direction for targeted therapy in FL. Immunotherapy, small molecule targeted drugs, and individualized treatment strategies are also promising for the future treatment of FL. Finally, we look to the future, including research on therapeutic resistance, in-depth studies of genetics and gene expression, applications of gene editing and precision medicine, and clinical trials of new treatments. These lines of research offer additional opportunities for treating FL, and despite the challenges, the future is promising. This literature review provides comprehensive and integrated information for the in-depth understanding of FL and relevant treatment approaches.",

Betel nut chewers aged 18 and older were included, with aspirin use defined as at least 28 cumulative defined daily doses (cDDDs). Propensity score matching and Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for time-varying covariates, were used to assess cancer risk. The study included 46,302 betel nut chewers, equally divided between aspirin users and non-users. Aspirin use was associated with a 31% reduction in overall cancer risk (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.73; P<0.0001). A dose-response relationship was observed, with higher cDDDs of aspirin corresponding to greater reductions in cancer risk. The highest quartile of aspirin use (Quartile 4) showed a 62% reduction in cancer risk (aHR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.41; P<0.0001). Daily aspirin intensity was also associated with a significant reduction in cancer risk, with doses greater than 1 DDD showing an aHR of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.47 to 0.61; P<0.0001) compared to 1 DDD or less. Aspirin use significantly reduces cancer risk among betel nut chewers in a dose-dependent manner.

In this retrospective study, we evaluated the outcomes of upfront PTR in 582 patients with synchronous RAS wild-type mCRC who received cetuximab plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment between November 2016 and August 2020. Of these patients, 364 (62.5%) underwent upfront PTR (PTR group) and 218 (37.5%) did not (non-PTR group). Relevant data were collected from 14 medical institutions in Taiwan. No significant differences were discovered between the PTR and non-PTR groups in median overall survival (37.9 vs. 31.7 months; P = 0.079) or progression-free survival (13.70 vs. 13.29 months; P = 0.62).

Our findings suggest that upfront PTR may not improve oncological outcomes in patients with synchronous RAS wild-type mCRC. Cetuximab-based targeted therapy plus chemotherapy appears to be suitable as first-line treatment for these patients.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is an important diagnostic tool that allows for the dynamic observation of blood flow characteristics of breast tumors, including small lesions within the affected tissue. Currently, it is widely used in clinical practice and has been shown promising prospects. This study included a total of 1,987 patients who underwent breast surgery at Huangpu Branch, Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019. Comprehensive patient information was collected, including ultrasound, mammography findings, physical examination details, age, family history, and pathological diagnoses. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was employed to assign values to the x variables, facilitating the construction and validation of the LASSO model group. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated using support vector machines to determine the area under the curve (AUC), as well as to assess sensitivity and specificity. There were no statistically significant differences (P>0.05) in average age, body mass index, tumor location, or tumor benignity/malignancy between the training and test sets. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of mammography for predicting the benignity or malignancy of breast tumors were 0.83, 86.96%, and 76%, respectively. In comparison, the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity of DCE-MRI for the same predictions were 0.91, 91.3%, and 88%, respectively. The predictive performance of DCE-MRI was significantly higher than that of mammography (P<0.05). In conclusion, both mammography and DCE-MRI demonstrated high AUC, sensitivity, and specificity in predicting the benignity or malignancy of breast tumors. However, DCE-MRI showed superior predictive performance, making it a valuable tool for the early detection of clinical breast cancer with potential for broader clinical application.",

This retrospective analysis included 541 cases of EC treated at The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University between January 2017 and January 2022. Various clinical and pathological variables were incorporated, including age, body mass index (BMI), pathological grading, myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) levels, and tumor size. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for LNM. Subsequently, the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), RandomForest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), all machine-learning algorithms, were adopted to select features and build models. The XGBoost model gave the best performance among all models, with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.876 and 0.832 for training and validation sets, respectively, suggesting its high discriminatory ability and prediction accuracy. Moreover, the calibration curve analysis further verified the consistency of the model-predicted values with the actual results, indicating the model's good applicability at various risk levels. According to the decision curve analysis, the XGBoost model showed high net benefits within most risk-threshold ranges, indicating its substantial practical value in clinical applications. Conclusively, this study successfully builds machine-learning models based on multiple clinical and pathological features, which can effectively predict the LNM risk in EC patients. The model is expected to provide important references for clinicians in surgical decision-making and the formulation of individualized treatment plans, thereby enhancing patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a lethal endocrine malignancy. It has been shown that tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute to the aggressiveness of ATC. However, stimulatory factors that could facilitate the induction and infiltration of TAMs in the ATC tumor microenvironment (TME) are not fully elucidated. In this study, we used a human leukemia monocytic cell line (THP-1) to study the differentiation of THP-1 into M2-like macrophages (M2) by conditioned media (CM) derived from each of the three human ATC cells: 8505C, THJ-11T (11T), and THJ-16T (16T). The capacity of CM to induce M2 was in the order of 16T>8505C>11T cells as determined by the expression of M2 markers (CD163, CD204, and CCL13). Cytokine arrays and ELISA assays revealed five commonly enriched cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, TIMP-1, and TGF-β1) in the CM derived from each of the three ATC cells. These cytokines, individually, had weak activity, but together, they mimicked full CM activity in the induction of M2. Further, they collaboratively activated STAT3, ERK, and PI3K-AKT signaling to facilitate the induction of M2 as found in CM. Importantly, we found that the CM-induced M2 could secrete soluble growth factors to promote ATC cell proliferation as evidenced by the increased Ki-67, cMYC, and cyclin D1 protein levels. Our studies identified the major stimulatory cytokines which acted collaboratively to induce M2 in the TME. Importantly, the present studies indicate that when using inhibitors to target TAMs, combination therapies would be required for effective treatment of ATC.",

The enzyme encoded by suicide gene is not toxic but is able to kill cancer cells by converting a non-toxic prodrug into a toxic compound. This approach is a promising cancer gene therapy that could reduce non-specific toxicity to normal tissue. However, there is no quantitative method to evaluate efficacy of suicide gene therapy in preclinical study. The aim of this study is to develop a new method to quantitatively evaluate and compare prodrug-activating suicide gene therapies. This study was carried out on an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell line CAL-27. Suicide genes were integrated into ROSA26 locus of CAL-27 by CRISPR-Cas9. CAL-27 cell lines stably expressing herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (TK) or yeast cytosine deaminase (CD) were used to evaluate and compare PA suicide gene therapies. The efficacies of PA suicide gene therapies were quantitatively evaluated from three aspects: effective prodrug concentration, prodrug treatment time, and bystander effect. This method also could be used for different types of suicide gene therapies and different types of cancer. When the prodrug concentration, treatment time, and rate of suicide gene-positive cells (related to bystander effect) are fixed, anti-cancer effects could be quantitatively measured. This information is important for suicide gene therapy preclinical development.",

By retrospectively reviewing medical records of 85 patients with a verified diagnosis of EWS in the period from 2001 to 2015 at Pediatric and Medical Oncology Departments at South Egypt Cancer Institute; We gathered data relevant to the patient, disease, and treatment variables of the study. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan Meier method and differences between various groups were determined by log rank test. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed using Cox regression. With a median follow-up period of 62.7 months (95% CI 52.2-73.2, SE=5.4) for the study patients, the estimates of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) at 3 and 5 years were 42.1% and 50.6%, and 40.8% and 48.5%, respectively. Metastatic disease at initial presentation (HR=8.91, 95% CI, 4.00-19.9; P<0.0001) stood as the most powerful predictor of OS in the multivariable analysis, followed by surgery used as a local modality (HR=0.16, 95% CI, 0.06-0.44; P=0.0004). Response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (HR=2.61, 95% CI, 1.11-6.13; P=0.028), primary tumor size (HR=2.49, 95% CI, 1.03-6.03; P=0.044) were also shown to be significantly associated with OS.

With 5-year OS of 48.5%, our survival results were comparable to those previously published from Egypt; however, differences still exist between centers due to varied representative study samples. However, outcomes in Egypt in general are still inferior to internationally published studies.",

    "abstract": "The role of estrogens and estrogen receptors (ER) in cervical cancer (CC) is not well established. However, epidemiological studies and abundant evidence from genetically engineered mouse models support such hypothesis. In this study, we have addressed estrogen responsiveness in a human CC cell line xenograft mouse model. We assessed the sensitivity of Ethynyl Estradiol (EE), SERMs (fulvestrant, MPP) and a non-SERM (EGCG) to competitively modulate the growth of ERα+ve MS751 CC xenografts. We also checked the agonistic-antagonistic propensity of the above treatments to alter the histology of ovariectomised mouse uterine cervix. Chronic EE treatment encouraged the growth of ERα+ve MS751 CC xenografts, while SERMs and EGCG significantly decreased tumor formation. SERMs were found to inhibit ERα expression, localized within cytoplasmic and membrane compartments. Conversely, ERα was not inducible and EE administration suppressed the growth of ERα-ve HeLa CC xenografts. SERMs competitively induced atrophic features to uterine cervix, with MPP giving rise to mucinous metaplasia in the ectocervix. We have demonstrated that, estrogen sensitivity mediated through ERα has promoted CC tumorigenesis. This in turn was modulated by SERMs, predominantly through inhibition of extra-nuclear ERα expression. Though, induction of hyper-estrogenic status in the ectocervix, might underrate the utility of SERMs in ERα+ve CC.",

    "abstract": "Insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) plays important roles in carcinogenesis. Previous studies have linked circulating IGF-1 and its main binding protein, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), to cancer risks. However, no study has been conducted in soft tissue sarcoma (STS). In this study, we investigated the relationship of genetically predicted circulating IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 with STS risks. Recent large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 413 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with IGF-1 and 4 SNPs associated with IGFBP-3. We genotyped these SNPs in 821 patients and 851 healthy controls. We constructed weighted genetic risk scores (GRS) to predict circulating IGF-1 and IGFBP-3. We determined the associations of individual SNPs and GRS with the risks of STS using multivariate logistic regression analysis. We found high genetically predicted circulating IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were both associated with increased STS risks. Dichotomized at the median values of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 in controls, individuals with high level of IGF-1 exhibited a 27% increased risk of STS (odds ratio [OR]=1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.04-1.54, P=0.017), whereas the OR for high IGFBP-3 was 1.45 (95% CI=1.20-1.77, P<0.001). Interestingly, the significant association between IGFBP-3 and STS risk was only evident in women (OR=1.88, 95% CI=1.42-2.49, P<0.001), but not in men (OR=1.00, 95% CI=0.75-1.33, P=0.992). In stratified analyses by major STS subtypes, the strongest associations were observed in angiosarcoma for IGF-1, leiomyosarcoma for IGFBP-3, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors for IGFBP-3 in women. In conclusion, high circulating IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels were both associated with increased STS risks.",
