    "abstract": "The main goal of the present study is to generate the GIS-based landslide susceptibility map (LSM) of Meghalaya, India. For this purpose, two bivariate statistical (FR and SE) and multi-criteria decision analysis (AHP and Fuzzy-AHP) methods are utilised. The study area is situated over the Shillong Plateau in the North Eastern Region of India and is subjected to numerous landslides due to heavy rainfall and seismic activities. To obtain the LSMs, a landslide inventory of 1330 events and 15 conditioning factors are prepared. The inventory dataset is randomly split into a 70/30 ratio to make training and testing datasets for the study. The results show that the southern escarpment, the southeast region and the hillslopes along the roadsides are highly susceptible to a landslide. The LSMs are validated using the area under the curve (AUC) values and F1-scores, in which AHP (AUCAHP = 0.913; F1-score = 0.884) shows the highest prediction accuracy for Meghalaya. The generated LSMs can help in landslide risk mitigation strategies and sustainable infrastructure development.",

The objective of our research is to investigate the influence of economic policy uncertainty (determined by the world uncertainty index) and financial development on carbon emissions, followed by green technological innovation, institutional quality, economic growth, foreign direct investment, energy consumption, and trade in Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development, for the period 2003–2019, to analyse the data, the second-generation econometric techniques are used. We applied the two-stage sequential techniques of the linear panel data model and generalised method of moments approach to tackle the endogeneity problem and report robust findings. The findings of the study revealed that economic policy uncertainty, financial development, economic growth, energy consumption, and trade decrease environmental quality by increasing CO2 emissions, while green technological innovation and institutional quality increase environmental degradation by reducing CO2 emissions. Our evidence-based study provides significant outcomes for green technological innovation and institutional quality conditioning's role in reducing carbon emissions in OECD economies.",

However, the weather stations are dominantly located in the eastern plateau. The widespread and dense distribution of lakes over the Tibetan Plateau with negligible direct human influence can act as sentinels of climate change. The warmer climate can be sensed from higher lake surface water temperature, thinner lake ice, and shorter periods of lake ice duration. The wetter climate is clearly revealed by increasing land surface runoff, rising lake levels, and expanding lake areas. Qinghai Lake, the largest lake in the region with the longest record of gauge measurements, is used as a case study to reveal these changes. Remote sensing observations combined with field surveys and model simulations will further improve our understanding of the lakes' state, fate, and effect.",

    "abstract": "Soil erosion and sediment yield driven by land use and land cover changes; pose severe threats to ecological sustainability, agricultural productivity, and watershed health. This study evaluates soil erosion and sediment yield in the Dumuga Watershed, Ethiopia, from 1993 to 2023, with a focus on the impact of land use and land cover changes. Utilising a time series of Landsat data (TM, ETM+, OLI/TIRS), the study analyzes key factors influencing erosion, including rainfall erosivity, soil erodibility, slope steepness, cover management, and conservation practice. The findings highlight a dramatic shift in land use, with cultivated land increasing from 62.3% (915.3 km2) to 77.0% (1,132.0 km2) and forest cover declining sharply from 13.3% (196.0 km2) to 3.8% (56.2 km2). This transformation has exacerbated erosion, with maximum soil loss rising from 726.7 tons/ha/year in 1993 to 937.8 tons/ha/year in 2023. The area classified under very severe erosion has increased from 41.0% to 54.1%, directly correlating with a rise in sediment yield. These findings underscore the urgent need for targeted soil conservation strategies to mitigate erosion, enhance sediment retention, and restore ecological balance. Therefore, implementing integrated land management approaches is essential to safeguarding the watershed's long-term productivity and resilience.",

    "abstract": "Groundwater exploration and quality assessment are vital for cultural and agricultural development. In this paper, we provide integrated geophysical techniques, including geoelectric and magnetotelluric methods, along with hydrochemical analysis, which are employed to identify zones of low-salinity groundwater suitable for irrigation along the South Alamein-Wadi El Natrun Road in Egypt. The investigated area is located west of the Nile Delta, where most surrounding areas contain groundwater of different qualities. The study aims to delineate the low-salinity ones important to most crops. The interpretation of resistivity data reveals that the study area includes an aquifer with varying water salinity at depths between 68 and 78 metres. Water quality changes according to clay intercalation within the aquifer. Six Vertical Electrical Soundings (VES) and six Audio Magnetotelluric (AMT) stations were conducted to further characterise the region's deep aquifer. The MT data indicate that a high-resistivity zone corresponds to high-quality water at depths between 120 and 200 metres. The combined analysis identifies a low-salinity groundwater zone at depths of 68 to 78 metres, with total dissolved solids (TDS) ranging from 1,728 to 3,840 ppm, which is suitable for irrigation. This aquifer's distinctiveness lies in its brackish water, which can support various types of cultivation.",

    "abstract": "The rapid expansion of agriculture and human settlements has simplified natural ecosystems and harmed the earth’s biodiversity. The current study was conducted in south-central Ethiopia to identify LULC change dynamics, and analysis of their driving force using geospatial technology. A supervised maximum likelihood image classification method was employed in combination with the visual interpretation of satellite images to categorise and map LULC classes of the study landscape. Semi-structured interviews, field observations, key informants, and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were employed to identify major driving forces, periodic LULC changes and impacts. The classification result showed a considerable decline in forestland from (43.1%) in 1973 to (13.1%) in 2000. Similarly, grasslands declined from (45.5%) in 1973 to (6.3%) in 2018. On the other hand, cropland has increased from (9.24%) in 1973 to (32.04%) in 1986 likewise between 2000 and 2018 its coverage was augmented from 45.4% to 51.1%, respectively. . Local communities perceived population growth, settlement, urbanisation, expansion of farmlands, and fuel wood collection as dominant drivers of LULC changes in the study area in thewatershed. The respondents also observed that the decline in forest LULC triggered the loss of biodiversity, soil fertility, and water availability. Hence, local and national regimes must take adequate measures to minimise the rapid shift in land use and to balance the protection of the human livelihood with the environment.",

This study aims to review the existing literature on the impacts of climate, and LULC changes on the sustainability of irrigation water in West Africa. The future of irrigation in West Africa will be driven by strong external factors, such as rapid population growth, climate change, and LULC change. The annual average temperature is between 25.9 and 34°C. Rising temperatures have affected all sectors, including water resources, increased irrigation demand, and the sustainability of agricultural production. Reduction in precipitation will reduce river flows and increase evaporation due to a drier atmosphere, thereby reducing the amount of water available in reservoirs for irrigation. The current demand for freshwater in West Africa for irrigation purposes is expected to triple by 2050. From 1997 to 2018, forest area decreased by 24.6%, while residential and agricultural land areas increased by 140% and 11.7%, respectively, in West Africa. Effective mitigation and adaptation measures are the policy issue for the observed adverse impacts of future climate and LULC changes on the sustainability of irrigation water availability in West Africa.",

Based on DEM data and GIS techniques, morphometry parameters along with geomorphic indices are obtained which allows the analysis of geomorphic processes responsible for the region's landscape evolution, and indices of relative active tectonics (IRAT) are calculated by combining them. High drainage density, larger ruggedness number, intermediate to high hypsometric integral values with S/convex-type hypsometric curve, lower valley floor width-to-height ratio and stream sinuosity index values suggesting the region is tectonically active and according to IRAT, the Khasi and Jaintia Hills region (the central and eastern part) of the Meghalaya possesses relatively higher tectonic levels. The variation of tectonic activity is not uniform in the same structural feature and is found to be lower in the western portion and higher towards the east along the same Dauki Fault.",

    "abstract": "This essay addresses climate change and its main causes over the last three decades. Between 1992–2021, global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) have risen continually. Specifically, the major socioeconomic sectors – including (1) energy, (2) industry, (3) land-use/land-use change/agriculture, (4) transportation, (5) building/construction, and (6) waste treatment/disposal – have emitted enormous amounts of GHGs. Between 1992–2019, the combined annual GHG emissions have risen by 53% – from 32.6 to 49.8 Gt CO2 equivalent (CO2e). The combined GHG concentration has increased by 33% – from 382 ppm CO2e in 1992 to 508 ppm CO2e in 2021. The combined radiative forcing has surged by 45% – from 2.226 W m−2 in 1992 to 3.222 W m−2 in 2021. At the current emission rate, the entire GHG credit for limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2.0°C – according to the Shared Socio-Economic Pathway (SSP) 1–1.9 or SSP1–2.6, respectively – in 2100 compared to preindustrial levels may be fully exploited by~2030. Limiting global warming to 1.5°C or 2.0°C will require total GHG emissions to peak before 2025 at the latest, and be reduced by 43% or 25%, respectively, in 2030 relative to 2019, followed by zero net emissions in the early 2050s or 2070s, respectively.",

To better coordinate the relationship between urbanisation development and ecological environment construction, this paper conducts an analysis and assessment of the ecological resilience and urbanisation coupling coordination in Dali Prefecture based on socio-geographical spatial data. Initially, an assessment model for ecological resilience is established using resilience theory. Subsequently, the urbanisation development level is evaluated based on panel data. Finally, a coupling coordination model is employed to calculate the coupling coordination between the two aspects. The results indicate: (1) a rapid increase in basin urbanisation from 2010 to 2019, particularly between 2010 and 2015; (2) a continuous expansion of low-value ecological resilience areas across the entire basin, with a predominance of townships experiencing fluctuating decreases or stagnation, leading to an overall negative trend in ecological resilience indices; (3) evident spatial and temporal disparities in coupling coordination between the two systems in the basin's villages and towns, primarily reflected in differences in coupling coordination types, with a few towns consistently exhibiting environmental lag. This study introduces a customised ecological resilience model for the Erhai Basin, enhancing comprehension of urbanisation-ecological resilience dynamics in plateau lake basins.",

    "abstract": "Using GIS-based multi-criteria decision-making techniques, i.e. mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM), specific spatial problems can be solved by combining information from different sources. Orogenic gold mineralisation shows weak exploration signals on the surface that can challenge exploration geologists. This study investigates the ability of a MPM method called evidential belief functions (EBFs) to identify a local orogenic gold mineralisation in the Godaesorkh gold deposit, north of Sanandaj-Sirjan Zone (Central Iran). Several evidential layers such as geological, structural, geophysical, remote sensing, and geochemical layers were generated by applying various processing methods. These layers are integrated to attain a MPM by applying the EBFs based on Dempster-Shafer's rules. Precise selection of evidential layers and higher number of known mineral occurrences may lead to a higher degree of belief in the mineral prospectivity map. Accordingly, high probability values were correlated with the gold mineralisation in the study area, and three separate areas were identified as promising with N40E and N15W trends. It is concluded that the orogenic gold mineralisation occurred in shear zones, which is mainly controlled by tectonic structures. Consequently, analysing these structures can be considered as a key feature for identifying potential orogenic gold mineralisation zones in the study area.",

In this study, the hybrid physically-statistically based air2water model was modified for the forecasting of SST. The hybrid model combines empiricism and theory, and balances the complexity and accuracy between the process-based physical models and statistical models. Daily observed SST data (2009–2019) from six stations in the Baltic Sea were used for the evaluation of model performance. Two metrics including the root mean squared error (RMSE) and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) were used for model assessment. With the increase of air temperature, SST presents a clear warming trend (0.133°C/year–0.166°C/year), and air temperature warms faster than SST in the studied stations. The modelling results indicated that the model performs well for SST forecasting (in the validation period, mean value of RMSE is 1.245°C, and mean value of NSE is 0.961). Cross-validation results showed that the model is transferable in unknown stations. However, the model works a little bit worse in the warm period due to the impact of the upwelling phenomenon. Overall, the model is a promising tool for the prediction of SST.",

Due to the climate data scarcity challenge in Ghana, there is a need to rely on high-resolution satellite-based climate products for climate change studies. Accordingly, temperature and precipitation data of six stations were obtained from Ghana meteorological stations; in addition, precipitation data of five satellite stations were obtained from CHIRPS data with 0.05’ (5 km) resolution to complement the in-situ datasets; and the temperature data for the satellite station obtained from the NASA power project were extracted. Modelled climate data were obtained from five GCMs in the CMIP data portal on the WCRP website. R software was used to extract NetCDF-format GCM data to Excel format and CMhyd was used for downscaling GCM data. The variance scaling method and local intensity scaling methods were used for temperature and precipitation bias correction, respectively. The Mann-Kendall (MK) method was used to determine the statistical significance of a change and identify trends in temperature and precipitation. The results of historical temperatures were significantly increased, while historical precipitation was significantly decreased. The projected mean annual temperature will increase significantly, peaking at 1.80°C by 2065, precipitation will, conversely, show significant spatial variability and seasonal dependency. For instance, by 2065, precipitation is projected to decrease between 10.05% and 12.66%. The results concluded by recommending policymakers develop climate change adaptation strategies guided by future climate scenarios.",

We selected two stratigraphic sections (Mojen and Kalateh) ascribed to the Ziarat Formation as suitable representatives for the current analysis, emphasising on their constituent microfacies and paleoenvironmental implications. The biotic communities are characterised by larger benthic foraminifera (LBF), coralline algae, corals, and bivalves as the major carbonate facies components. The microfacies gradients and paleoenvironmental analysis suggest deposition in a shallow-marine oligotrophic ramp environment within two platform stages. Both these stages indicate an increase in water depth from the inner to the middle ramp settings with spatial distribution of the LBF and other benthic components. Our data support the previous view that the early Eocene witnessed an increase in LBF taxa with near obliteration of the coral reefs in the sedimentary platforms across the Tethys. The corals reinitiated building reefal structures in the Middle Eocene, marking an important phase in the Tethyan paleoenvironmental evolution.",

This paper uses the coupled coordination distance model, modified gravity model and social network analysis to attempt to construct a nationwide tourism carbon neutral spatial network to clarify the role of each province in the process of achieving China’s tourism carbon neutrality. The results show that: (1) only seven provinces will achieve tourism carbon neutrality in the target year of carbon neutrality in China (2060). (2) From 2001 to 2060, most provinces are at the stage of coordinated development of tourism carbon emissions and tourism carbon sinks, but the degree of coordinated development is low. (3) The structure of China’s tourism carbon-neutral spatial network tends to be looser from 2001 to 2060. As the time series progresses, the role of each province in the spatial network will be gradually clarified. (4) In the process of achieving the goal of China’s tourism carbon neutrality, the number of tourism carbon sink input areas is much larger than that of tourism carbon sink output areas. Accordingly, this paper proposes countermeasures from three aspects: government-led, market system and voluntary mechanisms, in order to promote the achievement of China’s tourism carbon neutrality goal.",

The current research on subsidence in urban areas of Luoyang is relatively few and early, and cannot reflect the current status of land subsidence in Luoyang. To grasp the current status of land subsidence in Luoyang and prevent the harm caused by subsidence. We used 57 Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images covering Luoyang to obtain the land subsidence from April 2017 to December 2021 by using the small baseline subset interferometric SAR technique. The results show that there are several areas of land subsidence in Luoyang City, and the most serious area of subsidence is located near the highway in Jianxi District, with a cumulative subsidence of 130 mm. Land subsidence exists to varying degrees near transportation facilities (Expressway roads, railway, metro), key urban facilities (airports, high-speed railway stations) and ancient sites in Luoyang. A number of small-scale local subsidence in Luoyang is mainly related to high-intensity urban construction, and urban highway and building construction are the main causes of local land subsidence. Industrial activities are also an important factor in land subsidence in Luoyang. Groundwater and rainfall can impact land subsidence, and large amounts of rainfall during the flood season can replenish groundwater resources and slow down the rate of land subsidence. Loess foundations and large amounts of artificial fill in the city may also induce land subsidence.",

Spatial analysis of the vulnerability of coastal areas to the tsunami disaster employs the overlay method of coastal area vulnerability parameters using Geographic Information System software. The parameters used in analyzing the level of tsunami vulnerability are (1) land elevation, (2) land slope, (3) land use, (4) distance from the coast, and (5) distance from the river. The level of vulnerability is divided into five categories: very high, high, medium, low, and very low.

However, from the perspective of vertical air temperature profiles, there is little difference in air temperatures between a shaded pedestrian walkway and one under unshaded sunlight. This paper adopts a human-centred approach to investigate the three-dimensional spatial distribution of air temperatures in a pedestrian walkway in Taipei City under tree shade. It analyzes the air temperature reduction caused by attenuation of ground reflected long-wave radiation due to shade, and the effect of shade on environmental ventilation. It was found that air temperatures varied along pedestrian walkway height and direction. The measured data shows that the main difference in air temperature between shaded areas and areas exposed to sunlight is in the 0–0.5 m height range, and there is little difference in air temperature between the 0.5 m-2 m height range.Higher shades led to poorer ventilation and were more likely to cause local overheating. This suggests the need to assess urban pedestrian thermal comfort from a three-dimensional perspective, considering not just planar shades but also vertical shading and ventilation.",

The results indicate that the nitrate content in the cave water presented insignificant seasonal variations but significant spatial variations. Compared with the variation of δ15N-NO3−, the seasonal variation of δ18O-NO3− was positive (2.68‰) in the dry season and negative (−0.52‰) in the wet season. The variation of NO3− and Cl− and the isotopes of NO3− (δ15N, δ18O) suggest multiple sources of NO3− in the water.

This area faces several geotechnical issues, such as cavities, which pose substantial risks to construction, foundation instability, and ground subsidence. Thirty of 2D profiles were conducted to generate S-wave velocity models up to 30 m depth.

Understanding how changes in land use and cover influence carbon sinks is challenging. Here, we simulated net carbon balance across China with full consideration of land use and land cover between 1981 and 2020 using the dynamic global vegetation model. The results indicated that carbon sink of terrestrial ecosystem in China have grown steadily particularly since 2001, the average values of the net primary productivity, net ecosystem productivity and net biome productivity were 3317 TgC • yr−1, 325 TgC • yr−1 and 70 TgC • yr−1. However, during the period, changes in land use and cover cumulatively reduced net primary productivity by 1,353.00 TgC, net ecosystem productivity by 1,290.71 TgC and net biome productivity by 226.93 TgC. Land use and cover changes have created a carbon source effect which abated terrestrial ecosystem carbon sink in China since 1981. Our findings may help guide policies to regulate land use in order to help China achieve carbon neutrality in the future.",

This work is based on published data and first-hand observations of fossils and casts. Comparative descriptions of each skull bone, and details of the dentition of the type were written. Several retained 'juvenile' characters are not homologous with the juvenile condition. The difference in size between the second and third dentary teeth are taxonomically uninformative. Inferences were made regarding the complementary joint surfaces of the skull bones that were attached to those found in CM 9380. Both dental characters suggested to differentiate species in the hypodigm of T. rex were seen in the left and right dentaries of the type; therefore, the characters are taxonomically uninformative. The subocular process seen in the lacrimal in T. rex and other large theropods was hypothesised to mark the limit of the eyeball-containing region of the orbital fenestra.",

Based on multi-source remote sensing data from 2001 to 2020, a Comprehensive Ecological Quality Index (CEQI) was constructed to analyse the spatio-temporal variation of NDVI, FVC, NPP, and EQI. Kernel density estimation was employed to identify biodiversity hotspots, while the geographical detector model was used to quantify the explanatory power and interactive effects of natural and anthropogenic factors on the spatial differentiation of ecological quality. The results showed that: (1) the overall ecological quality in Deqing County exhibited an increasing trend over the past two decades, with hills and wetlands showing good ecological conditions, whereas urban fringe areas had relatively low ecological quality; (2) the spatial distribution of species richness highly overlapped with areas of high ecological quality, indicating a significant coupling relationship between the two; (3) natural factors such as temperature, slope, and elevation played dominant roles in shaping ecological quality, and the interaction between natural and anthropogenic factors significantly enhanced its spatial explanatory power. These findings provide a scientific basis for habitat conservation and the spatial optimisation of ecological compensation strategies for the Crested Ibis.",

This study used Huzhou City in Zhejiang Province as the research area and built a habitat model for the crested ibis using observation data and 21 environmental factors with the MaxEnt model. It further assessed the spatiotemporal trends of suitable habitat changes under current and future climate scenarios (SSP126, SSP245, SSP585). The results show that under the current climate, some parts of Huzhou are moderately to highly suitable for crested ibis, mainly in wetlands, farmlands, and forest edges. The main climate factors affecting habitat are the coldest month's minimum temperature, the coldest quarter's average temperature, and yearly rainfall. Future climate change is likely to make more areas suitable for the crested ibis, moving towards the north and higher places. Under the SSP126 scenario, the habitat grows the most, showing that low emissions help crested ibis habitats grow. This study provides scientific evidence and reference for conservation planning and habitat management of the crested ibis in Huzhou and similar regions under the background of global warming.",

The first abrupt change that occurred during 1830 delineated the starting epoch of the pre-industrial era, which is marked by a linear increase in concentrations (0.24 ± 0.01 ppm/yr.) as described by the IPCC being driven by economic and population growth. Another notable change occurred during 1943 with the start of a uniform acceleration (0.028 ± 0.000 ppm/yr2) since then. These findings bring not only clarity and precision into the IPCC's vague statement on the topic but also alleviates the bias introduced in estimating the trend (constant velocity) of the atmospheric concentrations, which is three times larger in magnitude (0.78 ± 0.01 ppm/yr.) for the period 1830–2021 if the uniform acceleration since 1943 is not accounted for. If the increased concentrations of CO2 before 1943 are predominantly caused by the climate system, i.e. of non-anthropogenic origin, then the concentrations will continue to increase with the constant velocity estimated in this study despite the efforts to limit the anthropogenic contributions that are the source of the uniform acceleration since 1943.",

Here, we analysed the discrepancy of six global fine resolution urban extent products across spaces and times. First, we measured the area variations of urban extent among these urban products in each 0.25° grid used in the Land-Use Harmonisation (LUH2), a commonly used product with future projections in Earth system modelling. Then, we analysed the potential urban growth within each 0.25° grid using the LUH2 data under eight scenarios shaped by shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and representative concentration pathways (RCPs). Finally, we identified those regions with a large discrepancy and noticeable growth of urban extent under historic and SSP-RCPs scenarios. We found the discrepancy among six products occurs in either highly developed (e.g. the United States-US and Europe) or rapidly developing (e.g. China) regions. Moreover, Eastern US, Europe, and West Africa deserve more attention in the future due to their distinct urban growth and relatively large discrepancy of urban areas. The derived results are crucial to future global urban sprawl modeling .",

Previous research has been contradictory, and varietal differences in rice CH4 emissions in Latin America have not been examined. A field experiment in Colombia tested whether irrigated rice emissions might be reduced using a breeding line, an inbred variety, and two rice hybrids. Data was collected on CH4 emissions, phenotypic, root, and grain yield parameters. Variations observed in CH4 emissions, grain yield, root length, and root surface area were in the order Hybrid 2 > Hybrid 1 > breeding line > inbred variety. CH4 emissions per unit area were between 29% and 62% greater for the hybrids than the inbred variety and breeding line, and CH4 emissions per unit grain yield were comparable across genotypes. Our findings suggest that differences in root characteristics and aboveground biomass explain genetic influences on CH4 emissions. The transition to low-emission rice production systems can be accelerated by using differences in productivity and root qualities among cultivars.",

The study compares the application of remote sensing data against rain gauge (RG) data for two main stations, Nadi and Nausori (1991 to 2020). The accuracy of SPPs is evaluated through statistical analysis, employing continuous and categorical evaluation indices. The results indicate that TRMM3B42 tends to overestimate light precipitation and underestimate heavy rainfall in low elevations when compared to rain gauge data. Rainfall intensities derived from satellite data exhibit relative changes within ± 10%. This study also performs future projections. Two greenhouse emission scenarios, Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) 2–4.5 and 5–8.5, are employed for IDF curve projection. The analysis reveals that changes in IDF curves are more pronounced for short-duration rainfall as compared to high-duration rainfall. Additionally, higher emission scenarios demonstrate greater changes compared to lower scenarios. These findings emphasise the importance of accounting for climate change and future projections in designing urban infrastructure, particularly considering potential urban expansion and human settlements. This study helps in solving design problems associated with urban runoff control and disposal where knowing the rainfall intensities of different return periods with different durations is vital.",

The activity concentrations of 40K, 238U, 232Th, as well as the outdoor dose rate of contaminated coastlines were measured using a calibrated RS-125 Gamma-Spec and a NaI(Tl) gamma-detector. The laboratory examination of sediments, water, and fish from the same coastal region – Clarias gariepinus Pseudotropheus elongated Oreochromis niloticus and Stromateus fiatola – was combined with the in-situ observations of gamma dose rates. With a value of 100nGy/h, the hotspot at site 4 is shown by the geographic distribution of gamma dose rates. The findings showed that the activities of the primordial radionuclides varied, with average values for the sediments and water exceeding suggested limits. Similarly, the corresponding mean hazard indices mostly exceeds the allowable limits. The species specificity of the fish species accounts for the variation in the mean concentrations of 40K, 238U and 232Th. C. gariepinus, having accumulated higher concentrations of 40K and 238U, may be the first to elicit health hazards in the future if pollution continues unmonitored. Hence, continuous monitoring of the aquatic environment alongside is highly recommended.",

The analysis of these different datasets showed good results on the probable new gold mineralisation location. Furthermore, the Landsat 8 OLI data processing highlighted mainly structural trends oriented NW-SE, NE-SW and E-W, which were recognised in the field as fractures, shear zones and faults. Recent AGRS has shown that the lithologies of the area exhibit high enrichment in potassium (K) and medium to low in thorium (Th) and uranium (U). The hydrothermal alteration areas defined from the K/eTh, F-parameter and ternary K-K/eTh-K/eU maps, can be correlated with both strongly or weakly magnetic bodies and known gold occurrences in the Doropo region. These alteration zones straddle deeply rooted structures such as faults, shear zones and fractures. All these planar structures are oriented NW-SE, NE-SW and E-W. The correlation between these geological structures and delineated alterations suggests that gold mineralisation in the northeast Côte d'Ivoire are structurally controlled and provided new targets for gold potential that might be thoroughly explored in future exploration activities.",

These two factors accounted for 20% and 80% of the increase in dust emissions in inland Asia, respectively. Both events enhanced the surface dust emissions and airborne dust loading by changing the local circulation and suppressing soil moisture and near-surface water vapour. The thermal effect of the uplift of the NTP suppressed soil moisture by 20% and near-surface water vapour by 50% in inland Asia, and its dynamic effect enhanced the westerly winds at 600 hPa and provided power for dust transport at high altitudes. The formation of deserts directly suppressed soil moisture by 50% and near-surface water vapour by 30%, and the radiative effects of the emitted dust aerosols enhanced the surface westerly winds and provided power for dust emissions and transport near the surface.",

    "abstract": "The July – September 2023 monsoon season in Himachal Pradesh, India, triggered a cascade of hydro-meteorological hazards – primarily floods and landslides – resulting in 428 fatalities (over 40% due to slope failures), displacement of more than 50,000 people, and economic losses exceeding INR 5,000 crore. Kangra, Kullu, and Chamba districts recorded rainfall over 1,800 mm – more than 150% above long-term averages. This study adopts a mixed-methods design, integrating high-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2, Landsat-8), geospatial modelling (Kriging, Inverse Distance Weighting, Kernel Density Estimation, Getis-Ord Gi*), and terrain analysis with advanced statistical techniques, including Mann-Kendall trend tests, Pearson's correlation, multiple and geographically weighted regressions, and spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I). A flood severity model explained 85% of observed variance, identifying vegetation loss ( > 40%), steep slopes, and extreme precipitation as primary disaster predictors. Stratified household surveys (n = 240) revealed systemic deficiencies in early warning dissemination, evacuation logistics, and post-disaster recovery – particularly in remote, high-altitude, and rain-fed communities. These findings inform a spatially targeted, evidence-based disaster risk reduction framework. The study recommends district-specific strategies – such as lope stabilisation, floodplain zoning, and green infrastructure – that align with key Sustainable Development Goals and offer a scalable model for climate resilience in mountainous regions.",

The results of zircon U-Pb dating indicate that the monzogranite and porphyritic biotite-monzogranite were emplaced at approximately 130 Ma, while the granite was emplaced slightly earlier at around 133.8 Ma. Geochemical analyses reveal that the Liucun pluton is rich in silica and potassium, with peraluminous and high potassium calc-alkaline characteristics. It shows enrichment in light rare earth elements (LREE) and depletion in heavy rare earth elements (HREE), along with a remarkable negative Eu anomaly. The Sr-Nd-Hf isotope compositions indicate that the Liucun pluton has a crustal origin, with evidence of mixing with mantle-derived material during its formation. The pluton was formed in response to the transition from a compressional to an extensional regime during the Yanshan tectonic stage, following the subduction of the Paleo-Pacific Plate.",

However, traditional GNSS-MR techniques have certain limitations in terms of accuracy and stability due to restrictions in satellite elevation angles and antenna heights. This study proposes a new GNSS-MR sea surface height retrieval method that combines Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) optimised Support Vector Machine (SVM) with improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN). The method utilises the GNSS multipath interfering signal frequencies (signal-to-noise oscillation term) extracted by ICEEMDAN as input features to the PSO-SVM model to retrieve the sea level height. Using one year of signal-to-noise ratio data from GNSS stations SC02 and TPW2, the stability and accuracy of the proposed method are evaluated under conditions of high satellite elevation angles and without precise GNSS antenna height information. Experimental results demonstrate that the PSO-SVM-ICEEMDAN method is superior to other existing methods in aspects of retrieval stabilities, root mean square errors, consistent tidal patterns, and so on.",

Consequently, surface disasters are especially prevalent in the Loess region of China. The study area is situated in the middle part of Lüliang Mountain in the middle part of the Loess Plateau, which is characterised by a typical loess landform with a complex system of gullies and hill ridges. According to current theory, the cracking boundary of the goaf profile is a straight line. However, these surface disasters are actually caused by the shear action of the deep rock layer and the original vertical joint structure of the loess. By analysing the cracking process of the 'Goaf-Overburden-Loess' section in the study area, it can be found that the boundary of the movement basin section presents a broken line shape, which has important implications for the accurate estimation of the area affected by loess-type surface subsidence.",

Fine-resolution land cover products have provided unprecedented spatial detail of the land surface. The performance of land cover classification can be affected by various causes, propagating uncertainty through modelling. In this study, six openly accessible fine-resolution land cover data products for 2020, namely GlobeLand30, CLCD, GLC_FCS30, Esri land cover, WorldCover, and DynamicWorld, were cross-compared for consistency and accuracy in the Changbai Mountain Range. The study particularly highlighted the consistency and accuracy across various geomorphic types. The findings reveal that all the six data products exhibit an overall similarity in spatial patterns dominated by cropland and forest. Validation using a ground reference dataset revealed that WorldCover and GlobeLand30 provide the highest and lowest accuracy, respectively. Cropland and forest present considerable spatial consistencies among the data products and advanced accuracies. The middle-mountain regions with low landscape diversity and fragmentation showed the highest consistency and accuracy. Data products, however, are difficult to represent the distribution of grassland, wetland, and bare ground categories reliably due to limited consistency and accuracy. This study provides quantitative analysis for selecting appropriate land cover data products towards application implementations.",

In this study, triaxial and uniaxial impact compression experiments were conducted on paste phyllite using a Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) device under various confining pressures and strain rates. The effects of confining pressure and strain rate on the dynamic mechanical properties of paste phyllite, including stress-strain behaviour, dynamic compressive strength, and energy evolution characteristics, were investigated. The results reveal that the stress-strain curve in the triaxial state exhibits more prominent plasticity characteristics compared to the uniaxial state. The dynamic compressive strength and energy vary to different extents with increasing confining pressure and strain rate. As the confining pressure increases, the microscopic damage characteristics of the rock gradually transition from mixed tensile-shear cracks to predominantly shear cracks. Furthermore, the influence factor of confining pressure and the plasticity element were incorporated into the Zhu-Wang-Tang (ZWT) constitutive model. A dynamic damage constitutive model considering the effects of confining pressure and plasticity was established and validated using experimental data. The model demonstrated good agreement with the experimental results and could predict the stress-strain behaviour.",

Secondly, the synergistic relationship among 'new three' industries, and the synergistic relationship CR-Express and China-Europe trade are demonstrated form the spatiotemporal correlations perspective based on correlation and regression analysis. Thirdly, the synergistic development of China's 'new three' industries and the CR-Express trade is evaluated based on qualitative and quantitative analysis method. Our findings show: 1) China's 'new three' industries show an upward export trend to Europe, aligning with the development of the CR-Express; 2) The correlation between the industries exports shows strong interconnections, particularly between electric vehicles and lithium batteries (0.988). Besides, the CR-Express's export correlation with China-Europe exports is 0.952, demonstrating its role in enhancing trade; 3) A sensitivity analysis of electric vehicle exports via CR-Express suggests the importance of timing for optimising access to European markets. The results underscore how transportation infrastructure and industrial growth can reinforce each other, reshaping trade patterns and offering valuable guidance for policymakers and stakeholders.",

Utilising statistical data on lightning along with socio-economic indicators, we establish a multi-dimensional index system for risk assessment, which incorporates causative hazard factors, exposure levels, and vulnerability characteristics. Combined with analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to quantify risk in different regions, revealing that extremely high-risk, high-risk, and moderate-risk areas comprise 21.83%, 44.41% and 33.76% of the province, respectively. This risk distribution underscores the need for region-specific lightning protection strategies: enhancing protective infrastructure and technical inspections in economically advanced areas, and improving awareness and education on lightning risks in less developed regions. The findings provide critical, data-driven support for targeted lightning prevention and management on the Qinghai Plateau.",

The region has periodically jolted by a number of large earthquakes. The temporal and spatial frequency-magnitude distribution (FMD) of earthquakes in three major selected regions of North-East India, namely Shillong–Mikir Hills, Arunachal Himalaya, and Assam Foredeep region, are examined in this study. Temporal variation of ‘b’ shows a significant declination prior to a large earthquake, which strongly advocates for a medium-term (months-year) earthquake precursor. Similarly, spatial distribution map is prepared by estimating b-value at every 0.01o×0.01o grid using the nearest 150 events, which is vital in understanding the stress regime of a specific region. The present study critically demonstrates the higher b-value regions associated with minimum seismicity and vice-versa, especially focusing on large earthquake scenario. High anomalies of ‘b’ were found in the regions of Shillong–Mikir hills and Arunachal Himalaya, whereas the Assam-Foredeep region, free from seismic activity for a long period, shows a low. It may be due to the accumulation of stress energy within the region for a long time and could be an alarming sign for future large events.",

Furthermore, we applied random forests to explore the potential factors influencing recovery patterns. The selected factors fell into three categories: 1) disaster factors, 2) environmental factors, and 3) socioeconomic factors. The framework’s utility was demonstrated in a retrospective study of the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, which uncovered the differences in the long-term recovery trajectory of earthquake-affected areas and their influencing factors. The county-level analyses indicated a substantial spatial and temporal variation in the recovery patterns. Earthquake disaster resilience was related to socioeconomic factors and had an association with environmental and disaster factors. Our study not only helped to enrich the understanding of earthquake disaster resilience but also provided a basis for disaster mitigation strategies.",

    "abstract": "On the 25th of February 2018, an earthquake of magnitude Mw7.5 struck the region of Porgera in Papua New Guinea (PNG), triggering numerous landslides. Planetscope images are used to derive a partial inventory of 2941 landslides in a cloud-free area of 2686 km2. The average area of landslides in the study area is 18,500 m2. We use the Environmental Seismic Intensity (ESI) scale to assess the damage due to the triggered landslides. Local intensity values are assigned to individual landslides by calculating their volume using various area-volume relations. We observe that different empirical relations yield similar volume values for individual landslides (local ESI intensity ≥ X). The spatial variation of landslide density and areal coverage within the study area in cells of 1 km2 is investigated and compared to the probability predicted by the USGS model. We observe that high probability corresponds to a significant number of landslides. An ESI epicentral intensity of XI is estimated based on primary and secondary effects. This study represents the first application of the ESI scale to an earthquake in PNG. The Porgera earthquake fits well with past case studies worldwide in terms of ESI scale epicentral intensity and triggered landslide number as a function of earthquake magnitude.",

Although, research on C stock in forests, oceans, soil, and desert has received increasing attention, relatively few studies have focused on urban C stock. Moreover, the current mainstream methods for C stock assessment, including field surveys and satellite mapping, are characterized by notable limitations, including being labor-intensive and having limited real-time data acquisition capabilities. Therefore, this paper aims to assess urban C stock and proposes a novel two-stage estimation model based on deep learning and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing. The first stage is that tree areas recognition via YOLOv5, and achieved 0.792 precision, 0.814 recall, and 0.805 mAP scores, respectively. In the second stage, a grid generation strategy and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) regression model were developed to estimate C stock based on recognized tree areas (R2 = 0.711, RMSE = 26.08 kg). Three regions with a minimum of 300 trees in each area were selected as the validation sets. The experimental results, in terms of R2 and RMSE in kg, were (0.717, 0.711, 0.686) and (27.263, 27.857, 28.945), respectively.",

For this purpose, remote sensing (IMPACT toolbox), GIS and quantitative analysis (PontiusMatrix42) approaches were used and applied on Landsat ETM+, OLI TIRS and Sentinel 2B images (2001, 2011, 2021). The result shows that land uses land covers (LULCs) are changing with a high level of dynamism in both ecological zones, with particular mention over the last decade (2011-2021) in terms of degradation in the Guinean savannah zone. Losses in both zones are more considerable than gains and stability. Each zone is marked more by changes in quantity than exchanges and shifts in LULCs, thus giving us information on the rate of loss of forest resources. It is therefore essential to put in place adequate measures to fight this irreversible loss if no action is taken.",

This research focuses on the future prediction of regional-scale glacial lake size in the entire Himalayan mountain range to avoid future glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). Here, we used Landsat TM and OLI images, Google Earth imageries, Cartosat DEM, and SRTM DEM, and used some techniques: average lake size change rate, Markov model and glacial surface topography to extract glacial lake size change and future prediction of lake size. A total of 9675 individual glacial lakes were noticed during the study period (1990–2020), out of which the lakes present constantly throughout the study period (with size > 0.01 km2) were added in this study.1This study used two methods (i.e., Markov model and Glacier surface topography) to predict future lake size and identified 191 and 94 critical lakes that are most at risk of enlargement in Markov and glacial surface topography, respectively. Moreover, 443 critical lakes in Himalaya is distributed as 227 in the eastern Himalayas, 195 in the central Himalayas, and 21 in the western Himalayas. The findings suggest that the number and size of glacial lakes will continue to increase, posing an even greater risk of GLOFs in the future.",

Data fusion provides a solution to depict the characteristics of Tm in detail. However, multi-source heterogeneity, unequal accuracies, and even serious system deviation may lead to unreliable and inconsistent accuracies in the fusion results. We utilize generalized regression neural network (GRNN) to establish an optimized model for the Tm from the stratified numerical weather forecasting products of the mesoscale version of the Global/Regional Assimilation and PrEdiction System (GRAPES_MESO) of China and the Tm from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5) data around China from 2016 to 2017. Then an example fusion using the radiosonde (RS) Tm and the optimized Tm is carried out. The results confirm the systematic deviations between GRAPES/ERA5 Tm and RS Tm. After optimization, the bias of GRAPES and ERA5 Tm is almost eliminated, and the root mean squared error (RMSE) decreased by 21.1% and 18.7%, respectively. Compared to RS Tm, the fusion results based on the optimized Tm have good consistencies and unbiased accuracies, and can merge more detailed spatial features than that of a single data source.",

To address these issues, this paper integrates multiple data sources and proposes a Multi-channel and Multi-scale Residual Network (MMRNet) for automatic extraction of gully features. Firstly, MMRNet employs a multi-scale feature fusion module to capture both local and global features of gullies, enhancing the model’s feature representation capabilities. It then uses an improved residual structure to fuse shallow features, compress features, and improve assessment efficiency. Additionally, channel rearrangement techniques are used to enhance feature flow. Finally, susceptibility prediction is made based on the similarity between the gully under evaluation and gullies where debris flows have occurred. The natural breakpoint method is used to classify susceptibility results into five levels. Experimental results show that the very high susceptibility zones for debris flows are mainly concentrated in areas with abundant river systems along the Nujiang River, covering 61.68% of the entire study area, with a debris flow proportion of 98.78%. The MMRNet model achieves an accuracy (ACC) of 81.6% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8320, indicating that this model is a high-performance method for debris flow susceptibility assessment.",

This study assessed the petroleum system in Kuwait using two methods; the first one is simulating the basins' construction history along with the changes in the physical properties of the different formations in Burgan and Dibdibba basins, using a Python 1D-Airy isostasy backstripping technique. The second method using the PetoMode® software to calculate the burial history and track the changes in petrophysical parameters through the deposition history. Integrating results with the previous studies gave us an understanding view of the petroleum system forming, hydrocarbon type, charging, and timing of oil generation. Also, the properties like compressibility, subsidence rate, and sedimentation rate. It found that the basins lost from 40 to 45% from the original thickness, while the porosity represents a percent (56–67%) from its original porosity because of the high subsidence rate which averaged by 0.05 mm/yr and kicked many up to 0.2 mm/yr.",

Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to separate the common-mode components (CMC) in the YRB's continuous GPS network, and it was found several of these periodic oscillation signals are connected to hydrology. In addition, it was discovered that changes in hydrological mass in the YRB are influenced by precipitation and temperature and TWS anomalies may be associated with El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events.

The land subsidence in Wuhan, China, was inferred from 47 Sentinel-1A images acquired between June 2015 to October 2020 based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometric Point Target Analysis (IPTA) technology. Results show that significant subsidence mainly occurred in Houhu, Qinshan, Baishazhou, and Zhuankou areas, and the most significant subsidence occurred in Baishazhou, reaching an annual subsidence rate of 41.0 mm/a with accumulated subsidence of 219.4 mm., The subsidence was more significant in the carbonate solution zone with the overlying Holocene strata compared to the rest carbonate karst belts. Analysis shows thatland building construction is a major reason for land subsidence in Wuhan. The construction of subway underground stations is another factor causing land subsidence. The effect of water level fluctuations of the Yangtze River on long-term trends is negligible. Our study provides further insight into the temporal-spatial pattern of Wuhan's displacements and suggests that the land subsidence should be continuously monitored for alleviation of potential destructive hazards, especially during the period of construction of a land building, such as residential, public facilities, and subway.",

Although the timescales needed for detecting mean sea level trends at tide gauges were well investigated in the past, very few studies addressed the same issue for the sea level accelerations in depth. In this study, we demonstrate that the ability to discern a uniform sea level acceleration at a tide gauge station depends on its magnitude, systematic and random sea level variations, the degree of autocorrelation of the random variations, the length of its historical record and the desired statistical significance level of its estimate. We offer a formulary to estimate the required minimum record lengths needed to detect a statistically significant prospective uniform acceleration at a coastal or Island tide gauge station based on the retrospective analyses of its sea level record. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the minimum record lengths required to detect statistically significant prospective uniform accelerations were calculated at 19 globally distributed tide gauge stations with long records.",

However, separating GRACE(-FO) signals into its individual Terrestrial Water Storage Changes (TWSC) and surface deformation contributors, i.e. Post-Glacial Rebound (PGR), is desirable for many hydro-climatic and geophysical applications. In this study, a hierarchical constrained Bayesian (ConBay) approach is formulated to apply GRACE(-FO) fields and the uplift rate measurements from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations to simultaneously estimate the contribution of TWSC and PGR. The proposed approach is formulated based on a hierarchical Markov Chain Monte Carlo optimisation algorithm within a dynamic multivariate state-space model, while accounting for the uncertainties of a priori information and observations. The numerical implementation is demonstrated over the Great Lakes area, covering 2003–2017, where the W3RA water balance and the ICE-5G(VM2) and ICE-6G-D(VM5a) GIA models are merged with GRACE and GNSS data. Validations are performed against independent measurements, which indicate that the average root-mean-squares-of-differences between the PGR estimates and independent measurements reduced by (Formula presented.) after merging observations with models through ConBay. The ConBay updates, introduced to the long-term trends, as well as the seasonal and inter-annual components, are found to be realistic.",

Soil samples (0–15 cm) were also collected from nested quadrats for physiochemical analysis. Additionally, ethnobotanical survey of 210 key informants was carried out using Snowball sampling method to identify plant parts used and ailments treated. The result identified 107 species of medicinal plants, and the roots (34.4%) and bark (33.3%) were mostly used. PA had higher (P < 0.05) abundance (81.75 ± 6.74) and richness (19.80 ± 0.96) while FA had the least.

A total of 144 models were considered and were evaluated using mean-absolute-error (MAE) and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) values. The results indicate that, by using E and θ alone, the RMSE value in estimating the length values for flow-like landslides in Wayanad was reduced from 472.74 m to 204.64 m. Out of the 48 combinations considered, MAE values have increased in seven cases and RMSE values in eight cases only. The pre-trained models are saved and used to develop an easy-to-use tool, which can bypass the complications associated with the existing statistical approaches. The tool can be used by untrained personnel for preliminary hazard assessment.",

The second layer is clay/silty clay with resistivity values between 12.6 Ωm and 59.6 Ωm and a depth of 1.1 m to 2.8 m. The third geoelectric layer is weathered basement with resistivity values between 5.9 Ωm and 38.4 Ωm and a depth of 1.3 m to 6.2 m, and the fourth layer is fresh basement layer. Four pits were dug to a depth of 1.5 m, and undisturbed soils were collected for geotechnical test. Maximum dry density of the soils falls between 1.73 and 1.84 with an average of 1.90 Mg/m. Dynamic cone penetration test (DCPT) was conducted, and the quantity of blows to achieve 1000 mm (1 m) penetration depth (n) was recorded.

The Halewah oil field is considered one of the most promising areas for petroleum production and is greatly favoured by exploration activities. The study's data set consists of digitised wireline logs for four wells and ten lines of 2D seismic profiles. Several faults affected the upper and lower salt members of the Sab'atayn Formation, which caused the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden tectonic activity. Results show that sandstone, shaly sandstone, calcite, and anhydrite comprise most of the Alif reservoir. Halewah well No. 02 has a high porosity of 21% and permeability of 1073 mD, with the highest net thickness of about 71.17 m. In contrast, Halewah well No. 06 has the lowest percentage in net thickness of 21.8 m with porosity of 15% and permeability of 511.2 mD. Alif reservoir exhibits promising characteristics, particularly in the upper reservoir unit. Intensifying exploration and prospecting operations in this unit is recommended.",

As a novelty, the tourism carbon capacity model for a developing country, Turkiye, is developed by considering eight tourism subsectors, and the carbon footprint (CF) is calculated separately for each subsector. The findings obtained from the Kaya carbon emission identity method show that the CF per tourist has increased by ~ 25 % from 2012 to 2022. Türkiye's carbon emissions absorption capacity seems insufficient to overcome the risk of carbon deficit (CD) due to international tourism activity. CF in the sector mainly comes from two subsectors: food and beverage and shopping. CD in the tourism industry per capita has increased by ~ 30 % over the years. In light of these findings, expanding forest areas and vegetation with the cooperation of the government, local community, NGOs, and tourism enterprises should be a priority to reduce tourism CD. In addition, government and tourism authorities immediately enact policies and regulations that encourage international tourism suppliers to invest in reducing carbon emissions throughout the life cycle of products.",

Genetic algorithms were employed to optimise the parameters of each base model. The study resulted in a prediction method for the Inclination angle suitable for this oilfield. Field test results show that the optimised Stacking-based learning model has the best prediction effect, with a 95.3% hit rate in predicting well inclination angle ± 0.01°, higher prediction accuracy than both single-base learners and traditional Stacking ensemble learning models.

The government of Ethiopia has implemented extensive soil and water conservation (SWC) programs in severely degraded and food-insecure areas of the country, in some cases integrated with subsequent or parallel irrigation development. However, the effectiveness of these interventions has not been extensively evaluated. This study, therefore, evaluates the performance and impacts of SWC practices in terms of improving vegetation greenness and reducing soil erosion in Feresmay watershed in Ethiopia. Long-term Landsat based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), and Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) were used for change-detection analysis before and after the implementation of various SWC intervention. The results revealed the positive impacts of SWC interventions interms of improving the vegetation greenness, and soil erosion reduction although the outcome varied by intervention. For example, increased vegetation greenness was observed largely in areas where area closure with catchment treatment (ACCT) and impacts of irrigation (IRR) interventions are dominant, while relatively less impact was observed at the watershed level analysis. Although the interventions helped to reduce soil loss, the results highlighted the need for more SWC interventions to minimize further soil loss.",

The ability to perform online mapping and accurate segmentation on a large scale by taking into account the multifariousness inherent in aerial images has important implications. In this paper we propose a new method for building footprint identification using multiresolution analysis based self-attention technique. The scheme is promising to be robust in the face of variability inherent in remotely sensed images by virtue of the capability to extract features at multiple scales and focusing on areas containing meaningful information. We demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method by comparing it against several state-of-the-art techniques using aerial imagery with varying spatial resolution and building clutter and it achieves better accuracy around 95% even under widely disparate image characteristics. We also evaluate the ability for online mapping on an embedded graphic processing unit (GPU) and compare it against different compute engines and it is found that the proposed method on GPU outperforms the other methods in terms of accuracy and processing time.",

Darıderesi is a structurally controlled hydrothermal and associated replacement mineralisation hosted in the shale-mudstone and carbonaceous horizons within the Karakaya Complex. The mineralisation was formed in three main stages as pre-ore calc-silicate alteration, main ore, and supergene alteration. The substages of the sulphide-sulphosalt mineralisation can be summarised as; pyrite-arsenopyrite galena, sphalerite, ferrokesterite, chalcopyrite, fahlore group and geocronite-jordanite solid solution series members, xanthoconite, pyrargyrite, and goldfieldite. Fluid inclusion studies indicate that both boiling and fluid mixing were the most effective processes causing the precipitation of sulphides and sulphosalts. Along its pathway, fluid-rock interaction coupled with decreasing temperature evolved the fluid to a lower sulphur and oxygen fugacity and nearly neutral to weakly alkali state which promoted the precipitation of base metal and the following silver-bearing sulphides and sulphosalts. The lead isotope composition of sulphides implies that lead was essentially derived from Oligo-Miocene magmatic rocks in the region with some interaction with basement rocks. The similarity of the lead and sulphur isotopic compositions between Darıderesi and Balya deposits suggests that they may relate to the same magmatic source.",

Then, the two most commonly used insulation layers are applied to the support structure to study the thermal insulation effect and seismic isolation effect of the layers. Besides, the effect of factors including the thickness, elastic modulus, surrounding rock, and boundary temperature on the application of the layer are investigated in detail. The result shows that the application of the thermal insulation layer has isolated the geothermal and seismic motion propagating from the rock to linings, thus improving the structural safety of the high-temperature tunnel when encountering strong earthquakes. The thermal insulation effect of the layer in the high-temperature tunnel enhances with the increasing thickness of the layer, and its seismic isolation behaviour enhances with the increasing of the layer thickness and elastic modulus.",

Forecasting ENSO and its impacts are mainly based on Central Pacific Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies which satisfactorily correlate with timing and, to a lesser extent, the intensity of drought conditions in the Philippines and the Western Pacific during the El Niño phase. Changes in sea surface height (SSH) are also brought upon by ENSO through seawater density changes with temperature and oceanographic processes. Here, we report that the associative nature of SSH and drought, as measured by surface runoff, has a better correlation (r > 0.693, p < 0.05) in terms of the expected timing (1 to 3 month lag) and intensity compared to using SST indices. Furthermore, since SSH is co-located with its corresponding forecasted decrease in runoff, a localised prediction can be made which further increases the accuracy of this predictive tool and can be used in tandem with SST-based ENSO indices. In the wake of a changing climate, the ability to forecast the timing and volume of rainfall and surface water availability is of utmost importance, especially within the context of food and water security.",

The shape of the sexaxial ellipsoid is defined by its six orthogonal axes. To construct the new geometric figure, eight triaxial ellipsoids were fitted to the Cartesian coordinates of control points in each octant of the geoid using the least squares method. Its geometric origin is constrained to coincide with the centre of mass of the geoid, and the ellipsoid has no net rotation with respect to the WGS84 coordinate system. This study demonstrates that the new geometric figure provides a customised fit to the control points in each octant.",

    "abstract": "Mastering the changes in the planting area of crops are critical for formulating sustainable agricultural development strategies. The Landsat 9 satellite provides continuous observational data for crop mapping. It is necessary to evaluate the potential of Landsat 9 images for canola mapping. According to literatures, some canola indices have been proposed in relation to the spectral features of the yellow canola flower, such as the canola ratio index (CRI), normalised difference yellowness index (NDYI), canola index (CI), canola flower index (CFI), normalised difference rapeseed flower index (NRFI) and winter rapeseed index (WRI). However, it is unclear which index has more potential to extract canola based on the Landsat 9 images. Therefore, the potentials of these indices for canola mapping were quantitatively compared by using different classification methods including supervised and unsupervised classification methods. For supervised classification methods and the CFI, the overall accuracy of canola mapping was above 90% and the kappa coefficient was above 0.8. For unsupervised classification methods, CFI also performs best. It was demonstrated that the CFI outperformed the other five indices for canola mapping. It was also confirmed that Landsat 9 images and the CFI exhibit promising potential for canola mapping via quantitative comparison.",

    "abstract": "The Shicheng Au-Cu deposit is hosted in the late Early Cretaceous Sanfoshan pluton within the Muping-Rushan (Mu-Ru) metallogenic belt, southeast Jiaodong. The deposit is characterised by Au-Cu bearing quartz-carbonate-sulphide veins that illustrate overprinting sheeted-like and breccia styles. Paragenetically-later veins contain Pb-Zn-(Cu) metal association, suggesting metal zonation at the deposit scale. Quartz from Shicheng shows the cathodoluminescence (CL) textures characteristic of hydrothermal systems with a magmatic influence and exhibits a similar quartz generations sequence. Moreover, this study presents a later overprinting mineralising event, characterised by quartz veins that contain As-rich pyrite, at the Jinqingding deposit in the middle part of the Mu-Ru belt. Jinqingding has a young mineralisation age that overlaps the emplacement age of the Sanfoshan pluton. Quartz from these veins at Jinqingding shows CL textures like those of the Shicheng deposit. The Sanfoshan pluton evolved from highly oxidised, high-K calc-alkaline, I-type magmatism. The early phases of the Sanfoshan pluton have K/Rb, Rb/Sr, and Fe2O3/FeO ratios that indicate moderately evolved, less fractionated, and highly oxidised magma, respectively, favouring Au-chalcophile metal association. Therefore, the Shicheng deposit and the overprinting mineralising event at Jinqingding may reasonably represent the products of an oxidised magmatic-hydrothermal system associated with the Sanfoshan-forming magmatism.",

The widely distributed shear systems in the Sanjiang area especially Ailaoshan-Red River shear system contribute a window to understand the tectonic evolution. Here we compile comprehensive geochronological data of the high-grade metamorphic rocks from the Ailaoshan-Red River shear system. The data reveal that the Ailaoshan metamorphic belt should be metamorphic complex with Middle-Late Triassic magmatic rocks and Cenozoic granites besides the Precambrian basement. The Cenozoic U-Pb age results of granitic rocks by accessory mineral within the Ailaoshan-Red River shear system range from ~41 Ma to ~20 Ma. The results of Ar-Ar dating of various minerals are in the range of ~40–5 Ma, concentrated in ~35–20 Ma. The U-Pb age results coincide basically with Ar-Ar data, indicating a rapid cooling process and reflecting a possible tectonic transition at ~20 Ma. The metamorphism and magmatism since the Cenozoic were not only unique to the Ailaoshan metamorphic belt, but also existed in the Chongshan and Gaoligongshan metamorphic belts. We infer that the Sanjiang area has a similar lateral extrusion deformation background and corresponds to the response of the India-Eurasia convergence process.",

Wellsite testing measurements followed by iodometric titration showed concentrations of H2S below 0.2 mole%. Statistical analyses and cross plots of H2S vs. depth, reservoir temperature, porosity, anhydrite content, well tests and water saturation did not reveal linear correlations. Uniform gas condensate compositions and constant souring levels through time rule out secondary bacterial or/and technogenic processes, while temperatures bellow 90–110°С are against thermochemical sources. Low H2S values could result from mineral-fluid interactions within the host rock. However, low abundance of H2S and carbon dioxide (CO2) (<0.2 and <1 mole%) is also typical for thermogenic gases. Sour gas could be sourced from the deeply subsided up to 8–10 km axes of the Afghan-Tajik petroleum system. H2S concentrations here are generally around 1–2%. Diminished H2S concentrations in the fields are explainable by long distance migration losses from the source area 50 km apart. TSR is unlikely to be important contributor from the downdip part due to replacement of lagoonal anhydrites by distal carbonates. Interpreted logs, calibrated against XRD in the fields reveal anhydrite drop basinward from 30–100% to 0%.",

Biogenic sulphur occurrences associated with Neogene formations are found around the Western Mediterranean, in Southern Europe (e.g. Hellin, Lorca, and Teruel, Spain, and Sicily, Italy). In northern Morocco, similar geological settings are present where several sediment-hosted sulphur occurrences were reported by unpublished studies. In this study, we provide the first description of such occurrences selected from two Neogene basins in the Eastern Rif (Taza-Guercif and Boudinar) and studied using sedimentological facies analysis and mineralogical data. The studied facies occur as yellowish sub-spherical concretions, nodules, and laminated structures associated with gypsiferous marls or organic-matter-rich marly clays and gypsum lenses. Mineralogical analysis revealed a mineralogical assemblage composed mainly jarosite, gypsum, and native sulphur. These geo-markers are indicative of bacterially mediated sulphate reduction and favourable conditions for the formation of sulphur, especially at the level of the Guercif basin. In contrast, Ras Tarf volcanism probably contributed to the observed facies in the Boudinar basin through different processes.",

An integrated analysis was conducted, including facies mapping, core data, sedimentological and petrographic assessments, pressure measurements and fluid contacts correlated with the structure map that was subjected to cross-fault juxtaposition analysis to test fault sealing capability. It's found that the main reservoir units Z10 and Z23 are trapped on the upper down-dip side of the Bahrah Anticline by a set of NW-SE trending faults exhibiting effective sealing. Vertically, the reservoirs are sealed by internal Zubair shales. The Z10 unit is highly compartmentalised by strong lateral sealing from the Ratawi shale, while the Z23 unit experiences some hydrocarbon leakage through fault planes. Core data indicate reservoirs have an average porosity of 14.2% (7.6–20%), shale volume of 12.8% (7.2–20.3%), water saturation of 42.2% (19.5–100%) and permeability of 1080 mD (.01–6180 mD). Pressure measurements, fluid contacts and sedimentological analysis support lateral heterogeneity. The traps are a combination of structural and stratigraphic mechanisms related to the fluvio-deltaic depositional environment and subsequent deformation.",

In this study, the 210Pb chronologies and sedimentation rate of the sediment core in Honghu Lake were calculated by the Constant Rate of Supply model. The characteristics of the sedimentary environment were analysed by using physical and chemical indicators. Four stages were divided as follows: Stage A (before 1900): The relatively low sedimentation rate and nutrient content indicated an extremely stable sedimentary environment. Stage B (1900–1949): With the growth of population, the intensity of land use began to increase, with an averaged sedimentation rate of 0.252 g·cm−2·a−1. Stage C (1949–1980): The sedimentation rate and nutrient content increased markedly. The intense human activity has damaged the surrounding vegetation leading to soil erosion and accelerated sedimentation rate. With the deterioration of the lake water environment, the organic matter source was mainly the internal source represented by algae and bacteria. Stage D (1980–2011): Influenced by the difference in land use types along the coast, the sedimentation rate of HH-A (0.570 g·cm−2·a−1) is higher than that of HH-B (0.445 g·cm−2·a−1).

A major challenge is the aggregation of data from different categories at the county level, which is crucial for sustainable development. We collected data for Huanggang City, China, for the years 2020–2022, converted them into plane data, and applied multi-criteria decision analysis to examine the natural resource characteristics of Huanggang, which has 10 county-level administrative regions. An evaluation system comprising 56 indices for land, water, forest, wetlands, and minerals was constructed. The analytic hierarchy process and ordered weighted averaging were used for single-resource categories, while the entropy weight method and technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution were used to aggregate multi-resource categories. The southern alluvial plain of Huanggang is a favourable location for mineral and land development, whereas northern mountainous and hilly areas are well suited for the growth of green ecological industries focused on water, forest, and wetland ecological functions. The results of this study provide guidance for resource development policies at the county-level, offer a reference for enhancing resource development and protection, and support the Sustainable Development Goals.",

Flat sediment plates are an alternative method that minimise the problems of cylindrical traps but do not measure the exact same processes. Plate traps were used in conjunction with cylindrical traps to measure sediment deposition in a seagrass bed and nearby barren site in Estero Bay, Florida, U.S.A. Sediment plates and cylindrical plates were deployed every 2–3 months in a Thalassia testudinum dominant seagrass bed and nearby barren site to examine seasonal differences in sediment deposition and differences between the vegetated site and the barren site. The data from the plate traps corroborate the reduction of resuspension in the seagrass bed compared to the barren site found in other studies. This result was supported by measurements of reduced near-bed velocity and shear stress in the seagrass meadow. Plate traps had more consistent results than cylindrical traps.

The findings are as follows: 1) Steeply inclined coal seam extraction causes significant displacement of the goaf's roof and floor, forming a '厂' shaped feature that intensifies with mining progress; 2) In multi-coal seam mining, both lateral and vertical roof displacements increase stepwise with mining depth, eventually stabilising with maximum displacement shifting downstream; 3) Tangential stress in the upper rock mass exceeds compressive stress in the goaf, causing sliding, while compressive stress exceeding tangential stress leads to bending deformation in the lower rock mass, compressing unmined coal seams and protective pillars; 4) Disrupted overburden stress balance forms an asymmetric stress arch around the goaf; 5) Repeated mining processes result in significant asymmetry in surface vertical and horizontal displacements. These findings offer a theoretical basis for understanding instability mechanisms in steeply inclined coal seam mining, aiding safe mining practices.",

One of them is Yuntdağ volcano, and its products have formed a thick volcanic succession covering large areas. In this study, an area where the volcanic sequence is seen well in the south-eastern part of the volcano was selected. Geochemistry and geochronology analyses were carried out along a line between Kalpakkaya and Çamlık Hills in order to better understand the petrological evolution of melting, assimilation, storage and homogenisation processes in the magma chamber (and/or chambers) feeding the volcano within a limited time period (~4 Ma). Samples acquired from the bottom, middle and upper portions of these sections display Early-Middle Miocene ages of 17.64 ± 0.20, 17.22 ± 0.15, 16.16 ± 0.17 and 16.36 ± 0.13, 15.79 ± 0.71 and 13.61 ± 0.20 Ma, respectively. Although, felsic crystal melts, magma mixing and multiple mafic inputs were the dominant processes, fractional crystallisation was less efficient. Also, geochemistry data also indicate that the studied volcanic rocks generated by the melting of the lithospheric mantle, by slab retreat and roll-back of the Hellenic – Cyprus slab, and evolved in shallow magma chambers during the Early – Middle Miocene.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies reported an ambiguous global sea level acceleration during the satellite altimetry (SA) era (1993–2017). New SA data created an opportunity to resolve this issue. In this study, two competing kinematic models to represent global mean sea level anomalies are compared. The first model consists of an initial velocity and uniform acceleration. The second model replaces the initial velocity and acceleration with a trend and a representation of a long periodic lunar subharmonic of period 55.8 y, which is determined to be statistically significant at globally distributed tide gauge records. The models also include parameters for the periodic effects of lunisolar origin with periods 18.6 y and 11.1 y annual, and biannual variations in 10-day average of globally SA measurements during 1993–2022. Generalized least squares solutions yielded updated statistically significant estimates for all the model parameters and their statistics for both models. However, the outcome failed to resolve the ambiguity of uniform acceleration in global mean sea level confounded with the long periodic lunar subharmonic of period 55.8 y during this period. This epistemic uncertainty will have a dire impact on climate change risk assessments as demonstrated through the prospective comparison of both kinematic models.",

    "abstract": "The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) precise point positioning (PPP) from carrier-phase data is influenced by complex elements. The error sources are divided into two categories according to their relation to the signal propagation path. A new GNSS PPP algorithm based on spherical harmonic expansion (PPP-SH) is proposed, which expresses the error adjustments related to the signal propagation path through the spherical harmonic expansion, such as high-order ionosphere delay, zenith wet delay, phase wind-up delay, multipath delay and so on. Carrier-phase data of multiple continuous epochs are used to achieve the sequential sliding PPP solution, and the truncated singular value decomposition and iteration method by correcting characteristic values are used to solve the ill-conditioned equations in the PPP-SH algorithm. The reliable results can be obtained by using dual-frequency ionospheric-free carrier phase data when spherical harmonic expanding to degree 5. The standard deviations of E, N and U are 0.48, 0.43 and 0.27 cm, respectively. The addition of velocity parameters has positive influence on accuracy of positioning. The best positioning results are obtained by using the precise ephemeris and precise clock bias provided by ESA and the standard deviations of E, N and U are 0.41, 0.43 and 0.26 cm, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Topographic influences of the ground motions in 3D geological configurations have been addressed using Spectral Element Method as implemented in SPECFEM3D code developed to simulate seismic wave propagation. Hexahedral mesh model was constructed to which the 1987 Jinka earthquake source characteristics were applied. The simulation results have shown that topography has significant effects on ground motion and changes PGA values by ± 55% compared to the flat topography. PGA amplification variation between valley and hill/ridge top is observed to be in the order of 1.6. The study indicates that there is PGA amplification on top of hills and de-amplifications occur at the base. Valleys and flat areas generally show low and negative amplification factors. It is observed that topographic features play significant roles in concentrating or diffusing seismic energy. This was confirmed by observing the behaviour of PGA values along selected profiles and by comparing PGA maps with and without topography. The study shows that topography has serious consequences and must be taken into account to minimise damage to infrastructures and safeguard human lives and suggests the importance of incorporating the effects of topographic features in any seismic hazard analysis schemes in densely populated mountainous regions.",

    "abstract": "Predicting coastal sea level rise during the 21st century is essential for risk assessments. It is, therefore, a central theme for numerous studies in predicting sea level rise at coastal regions using historical tide gauge measurements. However, these investigations rarely investigated if such an extrapolation of sea level rise at a coastal region is viable without evidence. This study proposes a broadly framed three-tier statistical validation approach for kinematic models that use tide gauge measurements in sea level predictions. It consists of a concurrent (contemporaneous) validation, retrospective (hindcast) validation and prospective (forecast) validation. The modus operandi for each stage is exemplified using sea level measurements at Brest tide gauge station since 1800. The proposed three-tiered validation process provide statistical information about the predictions to be made at this station.",

The model uses the trends of its observed budget components, including the temporal variations in mass of glaciers, Greenland, Antarctic ice sheets, terrestrial water storage, steric effect, and astronomical forcings of luni-solar origin, as independent variables in representing global mean sea level anomalies, namely, the dependent variable. The model parameters are estimated using monthly globally averaged satellite altimetry measurements and the yearly rates of the budget components during 1993–2018 as a priori information. Prospective monthly global mean sea level anomalies are then quantified and tabulated together with their root mean square error of prediction at 5% significance level for the period 2018–2050.",

    "abstract": "Fe-Mn-oxide (oxyhydroxide) deposits are common within the late Cretaceous mélange units of the İzmir-Ankara-Erzincan Suture Zone, which marks the closure of part of the northern branch of the Neotethys Ocean in Turkey. In the Cihanpaşa region (Yozgat, central Turkey), Fe-Mn mineralisation occurs as interlayers within a sequence of mudstone and siliceous pelagic units that overlies altered pillow lavas belonging to the Artova ophiolitic complex. T-Fe-Mn mineralisations are characterised by moderate amounts of Ba (560 ppm), and low contents of Sr (243 ppm), Co (51 ppm), Zn (183 ppm), and Ni (221 ppm). Mn/Fe (0.69) and low Co/Ni (<0.40), Co/Zn (<0.50) and Y/Ho (25.7) ratios and ΣREE (233) values suggest that mineralisation formed in a submarine environment hydrothermal system. The low Ceanom. values (−0.60) are consistent with a mostly oxic depositional environment. Further, low LaSN/NdSN (<1), negative Ce anomaly (0.29), and low Al/(Al+Fe) (0.14), whereas high LaSN/CeSN (4.01) and Fe/Ti ratio (208) with moderately positive Eu anomaly (1.22), and Ti/V (1.99), LuSN/LaSN (0.89), ΣREE/Fe ratio (22.36 × 10–4) indicate that the Cihanpaşa Fe-Mn mineralisation formed in an oxygenised marine sedimentary environment with influence of a ridge-proximal (near spreading ridge) submarine hydrothermal vent system in the İzmir-Ankara-Erzincan Neotethyan Ocean. These results indicate that detailed geological and geochemical evidences determined in silicilastic rocks and submarine volcanics within mélange associations well-exposed along the suture belt could be applied to exploration studies for the discovery of ancient submarine deposits, including significant and precious metals such as polymetallic Fe-Mn deposits (Fe-Mn crust and nodules) and seafloor sulphide mineralisation.",
