Here we provide an overview of the subject for both elastic and viscoelastic materials in order to understand the behavior of these materials. We begin with a brief introduction of some basic terminology and relationships in continuum mechanics, and a review of equations of motion in a continuum in both Lagrangian and Eulerian forms. To complete the set of equations, we then proceed to present and discuss a number of specific forms for the constitutive relationships between stress and strain proposed in the literature for both elastic and viscoelastic materials. In addition, we discuss some applications for these constitutive equations. Finally, we give a computational example describing the motion of soil experiencing dynamic loading by incorporating a specific form of constitutive equation into the equation of motion.",

The new solver is based on Chapman-Enskog expansion analysis, which is the bridge to link Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations and lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE). The macroscopic differential equations are discretized by the finite volume method, where the flux at the cell interface is evaluated by local reconstruction of lattice Boltzmann solution from macroscopic flow variables at cell centers. The new solver removes the drawbacks of conventional lattice Boltzmann method such as limitation to uniform mesh, tie-up of mesh spacing and time interval, limitation to viscous flows. LBFS is validated by its application to simulate the viscous decaying vortex flow, the driven cavity flow, the viscous flow past a circular cylinder, and the inviscid flow past a circular cylinder. The obtained numerical results compare very well with available data in the literature, which show that LBFS has the second order of accuracy in space, and can be well applied to viscous and inviscid flow problems with non-uniform mesh and curved boundary.",

The effectiveness of the local and nonlocal Timoshenko beam models in the vibration analysis is assessed using the vibration frequencies of MD simulations as the benchmark. It is shown herein that the Timoshenko beam models with properly chosen parameters are applicable for the vibration analysis of SWCNTs. The simulation results show that the fundamental frequencies are independent of the chiral angles, but the chirality has an appreciable effect on higher vibration frequencies. The SWCNTs is very sensitive to the initial strain even if the strain is extremely small.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, a simplified lattice Boltzmann method (SLBM) without evolution of the distribution function is developed for simulating incompressible viscous flows. This method is developed from the application of fractional step technique to the macroscopic Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations recovered from lattice Boltzmann equation by using Chapman-Enskog expansion analysis. In SLBM, the equilibrium distribution function is calculated from the macroscopic variables, while the non-equilibrium distribution function is simply evaluated from the difference of two equilibrium distribution functions. Therefore, SLBM tracks the evolution of the macroscopic variables rather than the distribution function. As a result, lower virtual memories are required and physical boundary conditions could be directly implemented. Through numerical test at high Reynolds number, the method shows very nice performance in numerical stability. An accuracy test for the 2D Taylor-Green flow shows that SLBM has the second-order of accuracy in space. More benchmark tests, including the Couette flow, the Poiseuille flow as well as the 2D lid-driven cavity flow, are conducted to further validate the present method; and the simulation results are in good agreement with available data in literatures.",

This paper presents a new approach to derive the analytical solution of the origin intensity factor based on the proposed subtracting and adding-back techniques.

The governing set of partial differential equations of the problem is reduced into the coupled nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by means of similarity transformations. Finite element solution of the resulting system of nonlinear differential equations is obtained using continuous Galerkin-Petrov discretization together with the well-known shooting technique. The obtained results are validated using MATLAB “bvp4c” function and with the existing results in the literature. Numerical results for the dimensionless velocity, temperature and concentration profiles are obtained and the impact of various physical parameters such as the magnetic parameter M , solid volume fraction of nanoparticles 𝜙 and type of nanofluid on the flow is discussed.

    "abstract": "The Ellipsoidal Statistical model (ES-model) and the Shakhov model (S-model) are constructed for the correction of Prandtl number of the original BGK model through the modification of stress and heat flux. Even though in the continuum flow regime, both models can give the same Navier-Stokes equations with correct Prandtl number, their modification of the collision term may have different dynamic effect in the non-equilibrium transition flow regimes. With the introduction of one free parameter, a generalized kinetic model with the combination of the ES-model and S-model can be developed, and this new model can get the correct Navier-Stokes equations in the continuum flow regime as well, but with abundant dynamic effect through the adjustment of the new degree of freedom. In order to validate the generalized model, a numerical method based on the unified gas kinetic scheme (UGKS) has been developed for the new model. The physical performance of the new model with the variation of the free parameter has been tested, where the ES-model and S-model become the limiting cases. In transition flow regime, many physical problems, i.e., the shock structure and micro-flows, have been studied using the generalized model. With a careful choice of the free parameter, good results can be achieved for most test cases. The overall conclusion is that the S-model predicts more accurate numerical solutions in most tough test cases presented in this paper than the ES-model, while ES-model performs better in the cases when the flow is mostly driven by heat, such as a channel flow with large boundary temperature variations at high Knudsen number. The numerical study demonstrates the necessity of developing such a generalized model. With the inclusion of one more freedom, in the transition regime the new kinetic model may provide more accurate solution than the ES and Shakhov models.",

In the solver, the finite volume method is applied to solve the Navier-Stokes equations. Different from conventional Navier-Stokes solvers, in this work, the inviscid flux across the cell interface is evaluated by local reconstruction of solution using one-dimensional lattice Boltzmann model, while the viscous flux is still approximated by conventional smooth function approximation. The present work overcomes the two major drawbacks of existing LBFS [28–31], which is used for simulation of inviscid flows. The first one is its ability to simulate viscous flows by including evaluation of viscous flux. The second one is its ability to effectively capture both strong shock waves and thin boundary layers through introduction of a switch function for evaluation of inviscid flux, which takes a value close to zero in the boundary layer and one around the strong shock wave. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the present solver can accurately and effectively simulate hypersonic viscous flows.",

The synchronous grouting process of shield tunnel was simplified as the cylindrical expansion problem, which was based on the mechanism between the slurry and stratum of the synchronous grouting. The stress harmonic function on the horizontal and vertical ground surfaces is improved. Based on the virtual image technique, stress function solutions and Boussinesq's solution, elastic solution under the vertical non-axisymmetric displacement boundary condition on the vertical surface was proposed for synchronous grouting problems of shield tunnel. In addition, the maximum grouting pressure was also obtained to control the vertical displacement of horizontal ground surface. The validity of the proposed approach was proved by the numerical method. It can be known from the parameter analysis that larger vertical displacement of the horizontal ground surface was induced by smaller tunnel depth, smaller tunnel excavation radius, shorter limb distance, larger expansion pressure and smaller elastic modulus of soils.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) can gain a great amount of performance benefit by taking advantage of graphics processing unit (GPU) computing, and thus, the GPU, or multi-GPU based LBM can be considered as a promising and competent candidate in the study of large-scale fluid flows. However, the multi-GPU based lattice Boltzmann algorithm has not been studied extensively, especially for simulations of flow in complex geometries. In this paper, through coupling with the message passing interface (MPI) technique, we present an implementation of multi-GPU based LBM for fluid flow through porous media as well as some optimization strategies based on the data structure and layout, which can apparently reduce memory access and completely hide the communication time consumption. Then the performance of the algorithm is tested on a one-node cluster equipped with four Tesla C1060 GPU cards where up to 1732 MFLUPS is achieved for the Poiseuille flow and a nearly linear speedup with the number of GPUs is also observed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The energy gradient method has been proposed with the aim of better understanding the mechanism of flow transition from laminar flow to turbulent flow. In this method, it is demonstrated that the transition to turbulence depends on the relative magnitudes of the transverse gradient of the total mechanical energy which amplifies the disturbance and the energy loss from viscous friction which damps the disturbance, for given imposed disturbance. For a given flow geometry and fluid properties, when the maximum of the function K (a function standing for the ratio of the gradient of total mechanical energy in the transverse direction to the rate of energy loss due to viscous friction in the streamwise direction) in the flow field is larger than a certain critical value, it is expected that instability would occur for some initial disturbances. In this paper, using the energy gradient analysis, the equation for calculating the energy gradient function K for plane Couette flow is derived. The result indicates that K reaches the maximum at the moving walls. Thus, the fluid layer near the moving wall is the most dangerous position to generate initial oscillation at sufficient high Re for given same level of normalized perturbation in the domain. The critical value of K at turbulent transition, which is observed from experiments, is about 370 for plane Couette flow when two walls move in opposite directions (anti-symmetry). This value is about the same as that for plane Poiseuille flow and pipe Poiseuille flow (385-389). Therefore, it is concluded that the critical value of K at turbulent transition is about 370-389 for wall-bounded parallel shear flows which include both pressure (symmetrical case) and shear driven flows (anti-symmetrical case).",

The turbulent flow equations are described by the low-Re number к – ε model with Launder and Sharma and Abe et al. closure coefficients. The involved temperature, velocity, pressure, turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation fields are represented on overlapping 5-noded sub-domains through the collocation by using multiquadrics Radial Basis Functions (RBF). The involved first and second order partial derivatives of the fields are calculated from the respective derivatives of the RBF’s. The involved equations are solved through the explicit time stepping. The pressure-velocity coupling is based on Chorin’s fractional step method. The adaptive upwinding technique, proposed by Lin and Atluri , is used because of the convection dominated situation. The solution procedure is represented for a 2D upward channel flow with differentially heated walls. The results have been assessed by achieving a reasonable agreement with the direct numerical simulation of Kasagi and Nishimura for Reynolds number 4494, based on the channel width, and Grash of number 9.6×10 5 .

In the FV-LBM, the normal convective flux at the interface of a cell is evaluated by using one-dimensional compressible lattice Boltzmann model, while the tangential flux is calculated using the same way as used in the conventional Euler solvers. The paper then presents a platform to construct one-dimensional compressible lattice Boltzmann model for its use in FV-LBM. The platform is formed from the conservation forms of moments. Under the platform, both the equilibrium distribution functions and lattice velocities can be determined, and therefore, non-free parameter model can be developed. The paper particularly presents three typical non-free parameter models, D1Q3, D1Q4 and D1Q5. The performances of these three models for simulation of compressible flows are investigated by a brief analysis and their application to solve some one-dimensional and two-dimensional test problems. Numerical results showed that D1Q3 model costs the least computation time and D1Q4 and D1Q5 models have the wider application range of Mach number. From the results, it seems that D1Q4 model could be the best choice for the FV-LBM simulation of hypersonic flows.",

The mechanical properties of the plate are assumed to vary continuously in the thickness direction by a simple power-law distribution in terms of the volume fractions of the constituents. Numerical illustrations concerned flexural behavior of FG plates with Metal-Ceramic composition. Parametric studies are performed for varying ceramic volume fraction, volume fraction profiles, aspect ratios and length to thickness ratios. The validity of the present theory is investigated by comparing some of the present results with those of the classical, the first-order and the other higher-order theories.

    "abstract": "Abstract. This paper is devoted to time domain numerical solutions of two-dimensional (2D) material interface problems governed by the transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) Maxwell's equations with discontinuous electromagnetic solutions. Due to the discontinuity in wave solutions across the interface, the usual numerical methods will converge slowly or even fail to converge. This calls for the development of advanced interface treatments for popular Maxwell solvers. We will investigate such interface treatments by considering two typical Maxwell solvers – one based on collocation formulation and another based on Galerkin formulation. To restore the accuracy reduction of the collocation finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm near an interface, the physical jump conditions relating discontinuous wave solutions on both sides of the interface must be rigorously enforced. For this purpose, a novel matched interface and boundary (MIB) scheme is proposed in this work, in which new jump conditions are derived so that the discontinuous and staggered features of electric and magnetic field components can be accommodated. The resulting MIB time-domain (MIBTD) scheme satisfies the jump conditions locally and suppresses the staircase approximation errors completely over the Yee lattices. In the discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) algorithm – a popular GalerkinMaxwell solver, a proper numerical flux can be designed to accurately capture the jumps in the electromagnetic waves across the interface and automatically preserves the discontinuity in the explicit time integration. The DGTD solution to Maxwell interface problems is explored in this work, by considering a nodal based high order discontinuous Galerkin method. In benchmark TM and TE tests with analytical solutions, both MIBTD and DGTD schemes achieve the second order of accuracy in solving circular interfaces. In comparison, the numerical convergence of the MIBTD method is slightly more uniform, while the DGTD method is more flexible and robust.",

The Reynolds number and the mass density of the jellyfish are found to have significant effects on the locomotion of the oblate jellyfish. Increasing Reynolds number, the motion frequency of the jellyfish becomes slow due to the reduced work done for the pulsations, and decreases and increases before and after the mass density ratio of the jellyfish to the carried fluid is 0.1. The total work increases rapidly at small mass density ratios and slowly increases to a constant value at large mass density ratio. Moreover, as mass density ratio increases, the maximum forward velocity significantly reduces in the contraction stage, while the minimum forward velocity increases in the relaxation stage.",

The paper gives analytical formulas of the MQ-FD method and carries out a performance study for its derivative approximation and solution of Poisson equation and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In addition, the effect of the shape parameter c in MQ on the formulas of the MQ- FD method is analyzed. Derivative approximation in one-dimensional space and Poisson equation in two-dimensional space are taken as model problems to study the accuracy of the MQ-FD method. Furthermore, a lid-driven flow problem in a square cavity is simulated by the MQ-FD method.

The effect of prebuckling deformation is taken into consideration on the basis of the Kirchhoff-Clebsch theory. It is shown that the application of Eringen's model produces small-length scale terms in the nonlocal elastic lateraltorsional buckling moment of a hinged-hinged strip beam. Clearly, the non-local parameter has the effect of reducing the critical lateral-torsional buckling moment. This tendency is consistent with the one observed for the in-plane stability analysis, for the lateral buckling of a hinged-hinged axially loaded column. The lateral buckling solution can be derived from a physically motivated variational principle.",

When the object is moving, the multi-block structured grid would be changed. The fast mesh deformation is critical for numerical simulation. In this work, the dynamic mesh deformation is completed in two steps. At first, we select all block vertexes with known deformation as center points, and apply RBFs interpolation to get the grid deformation on block edges. Then, an arc-length-based TFI is employed to efficiently calculate the grid deformation on block faces and inside each block. The present approach can be well applied to both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) problems. Numerical results show that the dynamic meshes for all test cases can be generated in an accurate and efficient manner.",

Models compared include a Kelvin (standard linear) model and an extended 2-term exponential linear viscoelastic model. Models were vali- dated against in-vitro data from the ovine thoracic descending aorta and the carotid artery. Measurements of blood pressure data were used as an input to predict ves- sel cross-sectional area. Material properties were predicted by estimating a set of model parameters that minimize the difference between computed and measured values of the cross-sectional area. The model comparison was carried out using generalized analysis of variance type statistical tests. For the thoracic descending aorta, results suggest that the extended 2-term exponential model does not improve the ability to predict the observed cross-sectional area data, while for the carotid artery the extended model does statistically provide an improved fit to the data. This is in agreement with the fact that the aorta displays more complex nonlinear viscoelastic dynamics, while the stiffer carotid artery mainly displays simpler linear viscoelastic dynamics.",

Hence, the situation becomes comparable with the Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, but it is simpler to implement than DG and has guaranteed L∞ bounds.

GMG utilizes a hierarchy of grids or discretizations and reduces the error at a number of frequencies simultaneously.

A central challenge in implementing GMG on GPUs, though, is that computational work on coarse levels cannot fully utilize the capacity of a GPU. In this work, we perform numerical studies of GMG on CPU-GPU heterogeneous computers. Furthermore, we compare our implementation with an efficient CPU implementation of GMG and with the most popular fast Poisson solver, Fast Fourier Transform, in the cuFFT library developed by NVIDIA.",

The formulation is based on fundamental thermodynamics theories incorporated into an efficient preconditioning scheme in a unified manner. Local one-dimensional inviscid (LODI) relations compatible to the preconditioning system are proposed to obtain information carried by incoming characteristic waves at boundaries accurately. The approach has been validated against a variety of sample problems at a broad range of fluid states and flow speeds. Both acoustic waves and hydrodynamic flow features can pass through the boundaries of computational domain transparently without any un-physical reflection or spurious distortion. The approach can be reliably applied to fluid flows at extensive thermodynamic states and flow speeds in numerical simulations. Moreover, the use of the boundary condition shows to improve the computational efficiency.",

In this paper, two modifications are introduced to overcome the difficulty encountered in solving differential equations with Dirac-delta functions by using the DQM. The moving point load is work-equivalent to loads applied at all grid points and the governing equation is numerically integrated before it is discretized in terms of the differential quadrature. With these modifications, static behavior and forced vibration of beams under a stationary or a moving point load are successfully analyzed by directly using the DQM. It is demonstrated that the modified DQM can yield very accurate solutions. The compactness and computational efficiency of the DQM are retained in solving the partial differential equations with a time dependent Dirac-delta function.",

In order to effectively apply the FEM and the FDM to the FADE on a rectangular domain, a backward-distance algorithm is presented to extend the triangular elements to generic polygon elements in the finite element analysis, and a variable-step vector Grünwald formula is proposed to improve the solution accuracy of the conventional finite difference scheme. Numerical investigation shows that the FEM compares favorably with the FDM in terms of accuracy and convergence rate whereas the latter enjoys less computational effort.",

The singular source term is represented by the d-function. For the approximation of the d-function, the direct projection method is used that was proposed in (6). The d-function is constructed in a consistent way to the derivative operator. Non- linear sine-Gordon equation with a stationary singular source was solved with the Chebyshev collocation method. The d-function with the spectral method is highly oscillatory but yields good results with small number of collocation points. The results are compared with those computed by the second order finite difference method. In modeling general hyperbolic equations with a non-stationary singu- lar source, however, the solution of the linear scalar wave equation with the non- stationary singular source using the direct projection method yields non-physical oscillations for both the spectral method and the WENO scheme. The numerical artifacts arising when the non-stationary singular source term is considered on the discrete grids are explained.",

    "abstract": "The paper introduces the gas-kinetic scheme for three-dimensional (3D) flow simulation. First, under a unified coordinate transformation, the 3D gas- kinetic BGK equation is transformed into a computational space with arbitrary mesh moving velocity. Second, based on the Chapman-Enskog expansion of the kinetic equation, a local solution of gas distribution function is constructed and used in a finite volume scheme. As a result, a Navier-Stokes flow solver is devel- oped for the low speed flow computation with dynamical mesh movement. Several test cases are used to validate the 3D gas-kinetic method. The first example is a 3D cavity flow with up-moving boundary at Reynolds number 3200, where the peri- odic solutions are compared with the experimental measurements. Then, the flow evolution inside a rotating 3D cavity is simulated with the moving mesh method, where the solution differences between 2D and 3D simulation are explicitly pre- sented. Finally, the scheme is applied to the falling plate study, where the unsteady plate tumbling motion inside water tank has been studied and compared with the experimental measurements.

The governing equations consist of two components, namely a hydraulic part described by the shallow water equations and a sediment part described by the Exner equation. Based on different formulations of the morphodynamic equations, we propose a family of three finite volume methods. The numerical fluxes are reconstructed using a modified Roe’s scheme that incorporates, in its reconstruction, the sign of the Jacobian matrix in the morphodynamic system. A well-balanced discretization is used for the treatment of the source terms. The method is well-balanced, non-oscillatory and suitable for both slow and rapid interactions between hydraulic flow and sediment transport. The obtained results for several morphodynamic problems are considered to be representative, and might be helpful for a fair rating of finite volume solution schemes, particularly in long time computations.",

In the FV-LBM, the normal convective flux at the interface of a cell is evaluated by using one-dimensional compressible lattice Boltzmann model, while the tangential flux is calculated using the same way as used in the conventional Euler solvers. The paper then presents a platform to construct one-dimensional compressible lattice Boltzmann model for its use in FV-LBM. The platform is formed from the conser- vation forms of moments. Under the platform, both the equilibrium distribution functions and lattice velocities can be determined, and therefore, non-free parame- ter model can be developed. The paper particularly presents three typical non-free parameter models, D1Q3, D1Q4 and D1Q5. The performances of these three mod- els for simulation of compressible flows are investigated by a brief analysis and their application to solve some one-dimensional and two-dimensional test prob- lems. Numerical results showed that D1Q3 model costs the least computation time and D1Q4 and D1Q5 models have the wider application range of Mach number. From the results, it seems that D1Q4 model could be the best choice for the FV- LBM simulation of hypersonic flows. AMS subject classifications: 76T10",

The method can be used to predict the values of the concentrated stress, and to analyze the change rate of rock stress and back to calculate the mechanical boundary condition in the applicable zone. The results of the stress change rate indicate that the horizontal stress is negatively related to the vertical boundary load and positively related to the horizontal boundary load. The vertical stress is negatively related to the horizontal boundary load and positively related to the vertical boundary load. These findings can be used to explain the evolution of the vertical increment in stress obtained with field-based borehole stress monitoring.",

The governing equation of motion of the objective system is developed by virtue of Lagrangian’s method. A complicated term is broached in the governing equation of the motion of the system owing to existence of multiplication of a quadratic function of velocity with a sinusoidal function of displacement in the kinetic energy of the system. The obtained equation is an example of a well-known category of nonlinear oscillators, namely, non-natural systems. Due to the complex terms in the governing equation, perturbation methods cannot directly extract any closed form expressions for the natural frequency. Unavoidably, different non-perturbative approaches are employed to solve the problem and to elicit a closed-form expression for the natural frequency. Energy balance method, modified energy balance method and variational approach are utilized for frequency analyzing of the system. Frequency-amplitude relationships are analytically obtained for nonlinear vibration of the elevator’s drum. In order to examine accuracy of the obtained results, exact solutions are numerically obtained and then compared with those obtained from approximate closed-form solutions for several cases. In a parametric study for different nonlinear parameters, variation of the natural frequencies against the initial amplitude is investigated. Accuracy of the three different approaches is then discussed for both small and large amplitudes of the oscillations.",

The diagonal plane strongly attracts the particle in square tubes with 1.2≤ R / a &lt;3.0. To explore the mechanism, some constrained cases are simulated. It is found that the tumbling mode in the diagonal plane is stable because the fluid force acting on the particle tends to diminish the small displacement and will bring it back to the plane. Inside rectangular tubes the particle will migrate to a middle plane between short walls instead of the diagonal plane.

However, its effectiveness was only verified in the single-relaxation-time model of the LBM (SRT-LBM). This paper aims to propose the viscosity counteracting approach for the multiple-relaxation-time model (MRT-LBM) and analyze its numerical characteristics. The verification is conducted by simulating some benchmark cases: the two-dimensional (2D) lid-driven cavity flow, Poiseuille flow, Taylor-Green vortex flow and Couette flow, and three-dimensional (3D) rectangular jet. Qualitative and Quantitative comparisons show that the viscosity counteracting approach for the MRT-LBM has better accuracy and stability than that for the SRT-LBM.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The elastic-plastic response of the functionally graded thick-walled tube subjected to internal pressure is investigated by using the relation of the volume average stresses of constituents and the macroscopic stress of composite material in micromechanics. The tube consists of two idealized isotropic elastic-plastic materials whose volume fractions are power functions of the radius. As the internal pressure increases, the deformations of one phase and two phases from elastic to plastic are analyzed. In order to simplify the calculations we assume both materials with the same Poisson's ratio. By using the assumption of a uniform strain field within the representative volume element and the Tresca yield criterion, the theoretical solutions are obtained for the case of two elastic phases and the case of two plastic phases, and the function of the radial displacement is presented for the case with both elastic and plastic phases. The yield criterion of functionally graded material is given in terms of the yield stresses and volume fractions of constituents rather than Young's modulus and yield stress with different unknown parameters of the whole material in the existing papers. Finally we also discuss the position where the plastic deformation first occurs and the conditions for which material first yields in the tube.",

    "abstract": "The generic structure of solutions of initial value problems of hyperbolic-elliptic systems, also called mixed systems, of conservation laws is not yet fully understood. One reason for the absence of a core well-posedness theory for these equations is the sensitivity of their solutions to the structure of a parabolic regularization when attempting to single out an admissible solution by the vanishing viscosity approach. There is, however, theoretical and numerical evidence for the appearance of solutions that exhibit persistent oscillations, so-called oscillatory waves, which are (in general, measure-valued) solutions that emerge fromRiemann data or slightly perturbed constant data chosen from the interior of the elliptic region. To capture these solutions, usually a fine computational grid is required. In this work, a version of the multiresolution method applied to a WENO scheme for systems of conservation laws is proposed as a simulation tool for the efficient computation of solutions of oscillatory wave type. The hyperbolic-elliptic 2× 2 systems of conservation laws considered are a prototype system for three-phase flow in porous media and a system modeling the separation of a heavy-buoyant bidisperse suspension. In the latter case, varying one scalar parameter produces elliptic regions of different shapes and numbers of points of tangency with the borders of the phase space, giving rise to different kinds of oscillation waves.

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, there have been enormous advances in lat- tice Boltzmann (LB) numerical simulation and modelling. The lattice Boltzmann method has become a practical and promising tool for many fluid problems. A majority of recent studies have relied on numerical computations of isothermal flows. However, much less efforts have been devoted to complex thermal flows, such as flows in porous media subjected to external magnetic force, flows with temperature-dependent properties. In this paper, an overview is made based on some accomplishments in these numerical endeavours. Along with the paper's sections, the state-of-the-art trend and the LBM advances in modelling and in com- putational aspects for specific classes of problems of major interest will be fully touched on. Concluding remarks are given and the axis of our future studies will be traced. AMS subject classifications: 76M28, 70K50, 76S05, 82D10",

Later, finite difference method with primitive variable formulation is employed in the physical domain to compute the numerical solutions of the flow field. Graphical results for the velocity, temperature and transverse component of magnetic field as well as surface friction, rate of heat transfer and current density are presented and discussed.

The fluid in the cavity is a water-based nanofluid containing Cu nanoparticles and the investigations are carried out for different governing parameters including Hartmann number (0.0≤ Ha ≤20.0), Rayleigh number (10 4 ≤ Ra ≤10 6 ), power-law index (0.5≤ n ≤1.0), nanopartical volume fraction (0.0≤ ϕ ≤0.1) and aspect ratio (0.125≤ AR ≤8.0). The results reveal that the flow oscillations can be suppressed effectively by imposing an external magnetic field and the augmentation of Hartmann number and power-law index generally decreases the heat transfer rate. Additionally, it is observed that the average Nusselt number is increased with the increase of Rayleigh number and nanoparticle volume fraction. Moreover, the present results also indicate that there is a critical value for aspect ratio at which the impact on heat transfer is the most pronounced.",

The algorithm for imaging the interior of the medium also makes use of radial spherical parametrization of the unknown star-shaped void and its centre in three dimensions. We also include the contraction and dilation factors in selecting the fictitious surfaces where the MFS sources are to be positioned in the set of unknowns in the resulting regularized nonlinear least-squares minimization. The feasibility of this new method is illustrated in several numerical examples.",

The error estimates derived show that if we choose h = O (|log h | 1 / 2 H 3 ), then the two-level method we provide has the same H 1 and L 2 convergence orders of the velocity and the pressure as the one-level stabilized method. However, the L 2 convergence order of the velocity is not consistent with that of one-level stabilized method. Finally, we give the numerical results to support the theoretical analysis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) is considered as a promising approach for simulating flows of liquid and gas. Most of LBE studies have been devoted to regular square LBE and few works have focused on the rectangular LBE in the simulation of gaseous microscale flows. In fact, the rectangular LBE, as an alternative and efficient method, has some advantages over the square LBE in simulating flows with certain computational domains of large aspect ratio (e.g., long micro channels). Therefore, in this paper we expand the application scopes of the rectangular LBE to gaseous microscale flow. The kinetic boundary conditions for the rectangular LBE with a multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) collision operator, i.e., the combined bounce-back/specular-reflection (CBBSR) boundary condition and the discrete Maxwell's diffuse-reflection (DMDR) boundary condition, are studied in detail. We observe some discrete effects in both the CBBSR and DMDR boundary conditions for the rectangular LBE and present a reasonable approach to overcome these discrete effects in the two boundary conditions. It is found that the DMDR boundary condition for the square MRT-LBE can not realize the real fully diffusive boundary condition, while the DMDR boundary condition for the rectangular MRT-LBE with the grid aspect ratio a ≠1 can do it well. Some numerical tests are implemented to validate the presented theoretical analysis. In addition, the computational efficiency and relative difference between the rectangular LBE and the square LBE are analyzed in detail. The rectangular LBE is found to be an efficient method for simulating the gaseous microscale flows in domains with large aspect ratios.",

Since the 2000s, the experiments of NREL phase VI blades for blind comparison have been a de-facto standard for numerical software on the prediction of full scale horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) performance. However, the characteristics of vortex structures in the wake, whether for modeling the wake or for understanding the aerodynamic mechanisms inside, are still not thoroughly investigated. In the present study, the flow around N-REL phase VI blades was numerically simulated, and the results of the wake field were compared with the experimental ones of a one-to-eight scaled model in a low-speed wind tunnel. A good agreement between simulation and experimental results was achieved for the evaluation of overall performances. The simulation captured the complete formation procedure of tip vortex structure from the blade. Quantitative analysis showed the streamwise translation movement of vortex cores. Both the initial formation and the damping of vorticity in near wake field were predicted. These numerical results showed good agreements with the measurements. Moreover, wind tunnel wall effects were also investigated on these vortex structures, and it revealed further radial expansion of the helical vortical structures in comparison with the free-stream case.",

Our main goal is to extend this approach to 2D unstructured formalism while preserving the physical and mathematical properties of the system, including the C-property. First, we present our extension by preserving the advantages of the finite volume discretization such as conservation property and the method of characteristics such as elimination of Riemann solvers. Afterward, an approach was applied to the topography source term that leads to a well-balanced scheme satisfying the steady-state condition of still water. A semi-implicit treatment will also be presented in this study to avoid stability problems for the other source terms. Finally, the proposed finite volume method is verified on several benchmark tests and shows good agreement with analytical solutions and experimental results; moreover, it gives a noticeable accuracy and rapidity improvement compared to the original approaches.",

    "abstract": "During chronic viral infection, sustained antigen stimulation leads to exhaustion of virus-specific ${\\rm CD}8^+$ ${\\rm T}$ cells, characterized by elevated expression of inhibitory receptors and progressive functional impairment, including loss of cytokine production, reduced cytotoxicity, and diminished proliferative capacity. In this paper, to investigate how ${\\rm T}$ cell exhaustion influences viral persistence, we developed a within-host mathematical model integrating viral infection dynamics with adaptive immune responses. The model demonstrates three non-trivial equilibria: infection-free equilibrium ($S_1$), uncontrolled-infection state ($S_2$), and immune-controlled equilibrium ($S_3$). Through dynamical systems analysis, we established the local stability of all states ($S_1$-$S_3$) and prove global stability for both $S_1$ (complete viral clearance) and $S_2$ (chronic infection). Notably, the system exhibits Hopf bifurcations at $S_2$ and $S_3$, with distinct critical thresholds governing oscillatory dynamics. Numerical simulations reveal that successful immune-mediated control of viral load and infected cell levels requires maintenance of low ${\\rm CD}8^+$ ${\\rm T}$ cell exhaustion rates.",

The right inclined wall is maintained at a constant cold temperature T c and the left inclined wall has a constant heat flux q with length S , while the remainder of the left wall is adiabatic. The horizontal walls are assumed to be adiabatic. The governing equations are obtained by applying the Darcy model and Boussinesq approximations. COMSOL's finite element method is used to solve the non-dimensional governing equations together with specified boundary conditions. The governing parameters of this study are Rayleigh number ( Ra =10,100,200,250,500 and 1000), Hartmann number (0≤ Ha ≤20), inclination angle of the magnetic field (0° ≤ ω ≤ π /2), Radiation (0≤ R ≤15), the heater flux length (0.1≤ H ≤1) and inclination angle of the sloping wall (– π /3≤ ϕ ≤ π /3). The results are considered for various values of the governing parameters in terms of streamlines, isotherms and averageNusselt number. It is found that the intensity of the streamlines and the isotherm patterns decrease with an increment in Hartmann number. The overall heat transfer is significantly increased with the increment of the viscous dissipation and the radiation parameters.",

The SBM is a strong-form boundary discretization collocation technique and is mathematically simple, easy-to-program, and free of mesh. The crucial step in the implementation of the SBM is to determine the OIFs which isolate the singularities of the fundamental solutions. Traditionally, the inverse interpolation technique (IIT) is adopted to calculate the OIFs on Dirichlet boundary, which is time consuming for large-scale simulation. In recent years, the new methodology has been developed to efficiently calculate the OIFs on Neumann boundary, but the Dirichlet problem remains an open issue. This study employs the subtracting and adding-back technique based on the integration of the fundamental solution over the whole boundary to develop a new formulation of the OIFs on 3D Dirichlet boundary. Several problems with varied domain shapes and boundary conditions are carried out to validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheme in comparison with the SBM based on inverse interpolation technique, the method of fundamental solutions, and the boundary element method.",

For Asian options, additional similar problems arise when the “spatial” variable, the stock price, is close to zero. Here we focus on three methods: the exponentially fitted scheme, a modification of Wang’s finite volume method specially designed for the Black-Scholes equation, and the Kurganov-Tadmor scheme for a general convection-diffusion equation, that is applied for the first time to option pricing problems. Special emphasis is put in the Kurganov-Tadmor because its flexibility allows the simulation of a great variety of types of options and it exhibits quadratic convergence. For the reduction technique proposed by Wilmott, a put-call parity is presented based on the similarity reduction and the put-call parity expression for Asian options. Finally, we present experiments and comparisons with different (non)linear Black-Scholes PDEs.",

This paper focuses on MCs’ intracellular calcium dynamics and LTC 4 release responding to mechanical stimuli, explores signaling pathways in MCs and the effect of interstitial fluid flow on the transport of biological messengers and feedback in the MCs network. We use a mathematical model to show that (i) mechanical stimuli including shear stress induced by interstitial fluid flow can activate mechano-sensitive (MS) ion channels on MCs’ membrane and allow Ca 2+ entry, which increases intracellular Ca 2+ concentration and leads to LTC 4 release; (ii) LTC 4 in the extracellular space (ECS) acts on surface cysteinyl leukotriene receptors (LTC 4 R) on adjacent cells, leading to Ca 2+ influx through Ca 2+ release-activated Ca 2+ (CRAC) channels. An elevated intracellular Ca 2+ concentration further stimulates LTC 4 release and creates a positive feedback in the MCs network. The findings of this study may facilitate our understanding of the mechanotransduction process in MCs induced by mechanical stimuli, contribute to understanding of interstitial flow-related mechanobiology in MCs network, and provide a methodology for quantitatively analyzing physical treatment methods including acupuncture and massage in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).",

However, this methodology for one specific class of FSI problems, where the structure is plate, remains to be developed. This work is devoted to extending the MGFM to treat compressible fluid coupled with a thin elastic plate. In order to take into account the influence of simultaneous interaction at the interface, a fluid-plate coupling system is constructed at each time step and solved approximately to predict the interfacial states. Then, ghost fluid states and plate load can be defined by utilizing the obtained interfacial states. A type of acceleration strategy in the coupling process is presented to pursue higher efficiency. Several one-dimensional examples are used to highlight the utility of thismethod over looselycoupled method and validate the acceleration techniques. Especially, this method is applied to compute the underwater explosions (UNDEX) near thin elastic plates. Evolution of strong shock impacting on the thin elastic plate and dynamic response of the plate are investigated. Numerical results disclose that this methodology for treatment of the fluid-plate coupling indeed works conveniently and accurately for different structural flexibilities and is capable of efficiently simulating the processes of UNDEX with the employment of the acceleration strategy.",

The performances of PSJ actuator fluctuate in the first three incentive cycles and become stable after that.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this paper is to analyze some features of contaminant flow passing through cracked porous medium, such as the influence of fracture network on the advection and diffusion of contaminant species, the impact of adsorption on the overall transport of contaminant wastes. In order to precisely describe the whole process, we firstly build the mathematical model to simulate this problem numerically. Taking into consideration of the characteristics of contaminant flow, we employ two partial differential equations to formulate the whole problem. One is flow equation; the other is reactive transport equation. The first equation is used to describe the total flow of contaminant wastes, which is based on Darcy law. The second one will characterize the adsorption, diffusion and convection behavior of contaminant species, which describes most features of contaminant flow we are interested in. After the construction of numerical model, we apply locally conservative and compatible algorithms to solve this mathematical model. Specifically, we apply Mixed Finite Element (MFE) method to the flow equation and Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the transport equation. MFE has a good convergence rate and numerical accuracy for Darcy velocity. DG is more flexible and can be used to deal with irregular meshes, as well as little numerical diffusion. With these two numerical means, we investigate the sensitivity analysis of different features of contaminant flow in our model, such as diffusion, permeability and fracture density. In particular, we study K d values which represent the distribution of contaminant wastes between the solid and liquid phases. We also make omparisons of two different schemes and discuss the advantages of both methods.",

The governing partial differential equations for the fluid flow and temperature are reduced to a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations which are solved analytically using the homotopy analysis method (HAM). Graphical and numerical demonstrations of the convergence of the HAM solutions are provided, and the effects of various parameters on the skin friction coefficient and wall heat transfer are tabulated. In addition it is demonstrated that previously reported solutions of the thermal energy equation given in [1] do not converge at the boundary, and therefore, the boundary derivatives reported are not correct.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The finite difference (FD) method is popular in the computational fluid dynamics and widely used in various flow simulations. Most of the FD schemes are developed on the uniform Cartesian grids; however, the use of nonuniform or curvilinear grids is inevitable for adapting to the complex configurations and the coordinate transformation is usually adopted. Therefore the question that whether the characteristics of the numerical schemes evaluated on the uniform grids can be preserved on the nonuniform grids arises, which is seldom discussed. Based on the one-dimensional wave equation, this paper systematically studies the characteristics of the high-order FD schemes on nonuniform grids, including the order of accuracy, resolution characteristics and the numerical stability. Especially, the Fourier analysis involving the metrics is presented for the first time and the relation between the resolution of numerical schemes and the stretching ratio of grids is discussed. Analysis shows that for smooth varying grids, these characteristics can be generally preserved after the coordinate transformation. Numerical tests also validate our conclusions.",

In this paper, we specifically construct solutions having 2pi-periodic angular parts. These particular solutions can be directly applied to a fundamental set of linear elastic boundary value problems in cylindrical coordinates and are especially suited to problems involving one or more physical parameters. As an illustrative example, we consider the problem of determining the response of a solid elastic cylinder subjected to a time-harmonic surface pressure that varies sinusoidally along its axis, and we demonstrate how the obtained parametric solutions can be used to efficiently construct an exact solution to this problem.

    "abstract": "Abstract A fully implicit numerical method, based upon a combination of adaptively refined hierarchical meshes and geometric multigrid, is presented for the simulation of binary alloy solidification in three space dimensions. The computational techniques are presented for a particular mathematical model, based upon the phase-field approach, however their applicability is of greater generality than for the specific phase-field model used here. In particular, an implicit second order time discretization is combined with the use of second order spatial differences to yield a large nonlinear system of algebraic equations as each time step. It is demonstrated that these equations may be solved reliably and efficiently through the use of a nonlinear multigrid scheme for locally refined grids. In effect this paper presents an extension of earlier research in two space dimensions (J. Comput. Phys., 225 (2007), pp. 1271-1287) to fully three-dimensional problems. This extension is validated against earlier two-dimensional results and against some of the limited results available in three dimensions, obtained using an explicit scheme. The efficiency of the implicit approach and the multigrid solver are then demonstrated and some sample computational results for the simulation of the growth of dendrite structures are presented.",

The models under consideration are governed by the coupling between the shallow-water and the Exner equations. Since the PDE system turns out to be an hyperbolic system in non conservative form, ambiguities may occur as soon as the solution contains shock waves. To enforce a unique definition of the discontinuous solutions, we adopt the path-theory introduced by Dal Maso, LeFLoch and Murat [18]. According to the path choices, we exhibit several shock definitions and we prove that a shock with a constant propagation speed and a given left state may connect an arbitrary right state. As a consequence, additional assumptions (coming from physical considerations or other arguments) must be chosen to enforce a unique definition. Moreover, we show that numerical ambiguities may still exist even when a path is chosen to select the system's solution.",

For each viscosity and magnetic diffusivity pair, the algorithm picks the largest possible parameter $\\theta\\in[0,1]$ to avoid the instability that arises due to the presence of some explicit viscous terms. At each time step, the algorithm shares the same system matrix with all $J$ realizations but with different right-hand-side vectors. That saves assembling time and computer memory, allows the reuse of the same preconditioner, and can take the advantage of block linear solvers. For the proposed algorithm, we prove stability and convergence rigorously. To illustrate the predicted convergence rates of our analysis, numerical experiments with manufactured solutions are given on a unit square domain. Finally, we test the scheme on a benchmark channel flow over a step problem and it performs well.",

In this paper, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations to study the interaction between hemagglutinin fusion-peptides and phospholipid bi- layer membranes. With CGMD, we are able to simulate the interaction of fusion peptides with a relatively large piece of membrane for a sufficiently long time pe- riod, which is necessary for a detailed understanding of the fusion process. A con- formation of the peptide with a kink at the level of phosphate group is obtained, consistent with NMR and EPR studies. Our results show that the N-terminal seg- ment of the peptide inserts more deeply into the membrane bilayer compared to the C-terminal segment, as observed in previous experiments. Our simulations also show that the presence of fusion peptides inside the membrane may cause bi- layer thinning and lipid molecule disorder. Finally, our results reveal that peptides tend to aggregate, indicating cluster formation as seen in many experiments. AMS subject classifications: 52B10, 65D18, 68U05, 68U07",

The Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin (RKDG) methods are efficient methods for solving nonlinear conservation laws, which are high-order accurate and highly parallelizable, and can be easily used to handle complicated geometries and boundary conditions. An important component of RKDG methods for solving nonlinear conservation laws with strong discontinuities in the solution is a nonlinear limiter, which is applied to detect discontinuities and control spurious oscillations near such discontinuities. Many such limiters have been used in the literature on RKDG methods. A limiter contains two parts, first to identify the “troubled cells”, namely, those cells which might need the limiting procedure, then to replace the solution polynomials in those troubled cells by reconstructed polynomials which maintain the original cell averages (conservation). [SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 26 (2005), pp. 995–1013.] focused on discussing the first part of limiters. In this paper, focused on the second part, we will systematically investigate and compare a few different reconstruction strategies with an objective of obtaining the most efficient and reliable reconstruction strategy. This work can help with the choosing of right limiters so one can resolve sharper discontinuities, get better numerical solutions and save the computational cost.",

This network model shows that the propagation of a CSD wave occurs naturally after it is instigated electrically or chemically. Although the model is simple, the speed of the CSD wave predicted by our model is consistent with experimentally observed values. Finally, our model allows us to investigate the effects of specific ion channels on the spread of a CSD wave.",

The procedure is extended to also include the effects consequent the Cyclic Variability. Heat transfer is modelled by means of a Finite Elements model. Combustion simulation is based on a fractal description of the flame front area. Cyclic Variability (CV) is characterized through the introduction of a random variation on a number of parameters controlling the rate of heat release (air/fuel ratio, initial flame kernel duration and radius, laminar flame speed, turbulence intensity). The intensity of the random variation is specified in order to realize a Coefficient Of Variation (COV) of the Indicated Mean Effective Pressure (IMEP) similar to the one measured during an experimental campaign. Moreover, the relative importance of the various concurring effects is established on the overall COV. A kinetic scheme is then solved within the unburned gas zone, characterized by different thermodynamic conditions occurring cycle-by-cycle. In this way, an optimal choice of the “knock-limited” spark advance is effected and compared with experimental data. Finally, the CV effects on the occurrence of individual knocking cycles are assessed and discussed.",

Since the interface is allowed to cut through the element, we modify the standard Crouzeix-Raviart basis functions so that along the interface, the normal stress is continuous and the jump of the displacement vector is proportional to the normal stress. We construct the broken piecewise linear basis functions which are uniquely determined by these conditions. The unknowns are only associated with the edges of element, except the intersection points. Thus our scheme has fewer degrees of freedom than most of the XFEM type of methods in the existing literature [1,8,13].

Several typical examples are adopted. An unsteady flow solver is developed by solving the Boltzmann model equations, including the Shakhov model and the Rykov model etc. The Rykov kinetic equation involving the effect of rotational energy can be transformed into two kinetic governing equations with inelastic and elastic collisions by integrating the molecular velocity distribution function with the weight factor on the energy of rotational motion. Then, the reduced velocity distribution functions are devised to further simplify the governing equation for one- and two-dimensional flows. The simultaneous equations are numerically solved by the discrete velocity ordinate (DVO) method in velocity space and the finite-difference schemes in physical space. The time-explicit operator-splitting scheme is constructed, and numerical stability conditions to ascertain the time step are discussed. As the application of the newly developed GKUA, several unsteady varying processes of one- and two-dimensional flows with different Knudsen number are simulated, and the unsteady transport phenomena and rarefied effects are revealed and analyzed. It is validated that the GKUA solver is competent for simulations of unsteady gas dynamics covering various flow regimes.",

The viscous flux is obtained by the conventional smooth function approximation. Unlike the traditional gas-kinetic scheme in the calculation of inviscid flux such as Kinetic Flux Vector Splitting (KFVS), the numerical dissipation is controlled with a switch function in the present scheme. That is, the numerical dissipation is only introduced in the region around strong shock waves. As a consequence, the present SF-GKS can well capture strong shock waves and thin boundary layers simultaneously. The present SF-GKS is firstly validated by its application to the inviscid flow problems, including 1-D Euler shock tube, regular shock reflection and double Mach reflection. Then, SF-GKS is extended to solve viscous transonic and hypersonic flow problems. Good agreement between the present results and those in the literature verifies the accuracy and robustness of SF-GKS.",

The choice of these shape parameters has been and stays a problematic theme in RBF approximation and interpolation theory. The object of this study is to contribute to the analysis of how these shape parameters affect the accuracy of the radial PIM. The RPIM is studied based on the global Galerkin weak form performed using two integration technics: classical Gaussian integration and the strain smoothing integration scheme. The numerical performance of this method is tested on their behavior on curve fitting, and on three elastic mechanical problems with regular or irregular nodes distributions. A range of recommended shape parameters is obtained from the analysis of different error indexes and also the condition number of the matrix system. All resulting RPIM methods perform very well in term of numerical computation. The Smoothed Radial Point Interpolation Method (SRPIM) shows a higher accuracy, especially in a situation of distorted node scheme.",

The present approach is an improvement to the conventional IB-LBM. In the conventional IB-LBM, the no-slip boundary condition is only approximately satisfied. As a result, there is flow penetration to the solid boundary. Another drawback of conventional IB-LBM is the use of Dirac delta function interpolation, which only has the first order of accuracy. In this work, the no-slip boundary condition is directly implemented, and used to correct the velocity at two adjacent mesh points from both sides of the boundary point. The velocity correction is made through the second-order polynomial interpolation rather than the first-order delta function interpolation. Obviously, the two drawbacks of conventional IB-LBM are removed in the present study. Another important contribution of this paper is to present a simple way to compute the hydrodynamic forces on the boundary from Newton’s second law. To validate the proposed method, the two-dimensional vortex decaying problem and incompressible flow over a circular cylinder are simulated. As shown in the present results, the flow penetration problem is eliminated, and the obtained results compare very well with available data in the literature.",

The annulus occupies the space between two horizontal concentric tubes of elliptic cross-section. The resulting velocity and thermal fields are predicted at different annulus orientations assuming isothermal surfaces. The full governing equations of mass, momentum and energy are solved numerically using the Fourier Spectral method. The heat convection process between the two tubes depends on Rayleigh number, Prandtl number, angle of inclination of tube axes and the geometry and dimensions of both tubes. The Prandtl number and inner tube axis ratio are fixed at 0.7 and 0.5, respectively. The problem is solved for the two Rayleigh numbers of 104 and 105 considering a ratio between the two major axes up to 3 while the angle of orientation of the minor axes varies from 0 to 90◦. The results for local and average Nusselt numbers are obtained and discussed together with the details of both flow and thermal fields. For isothermal heating conditions, the study has shown an optimum value for major axes ratio that minimizes the rate of heat transfer between the two tubes. Another important aspect of this paper is to prove the successful use of the Fourier Spectral Method in solving confined flow and heat convection problems. AMS subject classifications: 80A20, 35Q80",

The computational techniques are presented for a particular mathematical model, based upon the phase-field approach, however their applicability is of greater generality than for the specific phase-field model used here. In particular, an implicit second order time discretization is combined with the use of second order spatial differences to yield a large nonlinear system of algebraic equations as each time step. It is demonstrated that these equations may be solved reliably and efficiently through the use of a nonlinear multigrid scheme for locally refined grids. In effect this paper presents an extension of earlier research in two space dimensions (J. Comput. Phys., 225 (2007), pp. 1271-1287) to fully three-dimensional problems. This extension is validated against earlier two-dimensional results and against some of the limited results available in three dimensions, obtained using an explicit scheme. The efficiency of the implicit approach and the multigrid solver are then demonstrated and some sample computational results for the simulation of the growth of dendrite structures are presented.",

The particles are divided into a hierarchy of clusters, and well-separated particle-cluster interactions are computed by a far-field Cartesian Taylor approximation.

Two kinds of instabilities were studied due to inverse dissipation, especially those that occur at lower wave numbers. Criteria for the occurrence were presented and the relationship of the two instabilities was discussed.

For inviscid hypersonic flow past a circular cylinder, we observe different problems for different schemes: A first-order Osher-O scheme on quadrangular grids yields a carbuncle shock, while a first-order Osher-P scheme results in a dislocation shock for high Mach number cases. In addition, a second-order Osher scheme can also yield a carbuncle shock or be unstable. To improve the robustness of these schemes we propose an entropy fix technique, and then present numerical results to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the influence of grid aspects ratio, relative shock position to the grid and Mach number on shock stability are tested. Viscous heating problem and double Mach reflection problem are simulated to test the influence of the entropy fix on contact resolution and boundary layer resolution.",

The stretching velocity and the temperature at the surface are assumed to vary linearly with the distance from the origin. Using a similarity transformation, the governing nonlinear partial differential equations of the model problem are transformed into coupled non-linear ordinary differential equations and the equations are solved numerically by a second order finite difference implicit method known as the Keller-box method. Comparisons with the available results in the literature are presented as a special case. The effects of the physical parameters on the fluid velocity, the velocity of the dust particle, the density of the dust particle, the fluid temperature, the dust-phase temperature, the skin friction, and the wall-temperature gradient are presented through tables and graphs. It is observed that, Maxwell fluid reduces the wall-shear stress. Also, the fluid particle interaction reduces the fluid temperature in the boundary layer. Furthermore, the results obtained for the flow and heat transfer characteristics reveal many interesting behaviors that warrant further study on the non-Newtonian fluid flow phenomena, especially the dusty UCM fluid flow phenomena.",

A detailed analysis shows that the spatial discretization implemented with the boundary scheme proposed by Pirozzoli [J. Comput. Phys., 178 (2001), pp. 81–117] is approximately fourth-order.

In order to precisely describe the whole process, we firstly build the mathematical model to simulate this problem numerically. Taking into consideration of the characteristics of contaminant flow, we employ two partial differential equations to formulate the whole problem. One is flow equation; the other is reactive transport equation. The first equation is used to describe the total flow of contaminant wastes, which is based on Darcy law. The second one will characterize the adsorption, diffusion and convection behavior of contaminant species, which describes most features of contaminant flow we are interested in. After the construction of numerical model, we apply locally conservative and compatible algorithms to solve this mathematical model. Specifically, we apply Mixed Finite Element (MFE) method to the flow equation and Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the transport equation. MFE has a good convergence rate and numerical accuracy for Darcy velocity. DG is more flexible and can be used to deal with irregular meshes, as well as little numerical diffusion. With these two numerical means, we investigate the sensitivity analysis of different features of contaminant flow in our model, such as diffusion, permeability and fracture density. In particular, we study Kd values which represent the distribution of contaminant wastes between the solid and liquid phases. We also make omparisons of two different schemes and discuss the advantages of both methods.",

The model comprising of basic governing differential equations and boundary conditions has been solved by employing Laplace transform technique. Noting that the second sound effects are short lived, the small time approximations of solution for various physical quantities have been obtained and the results are discussed on the possible wave fronts. In case of continuous and periodic loads acting at the boundary, the displacement is found to be continuous at each wave front while it is discontinuous in case of impulsive load. The temperature and concentration fields are found to be discontinuous at all the wave fronts. The displacement, temperature change and concentration deviation due to impulsive, continuous and periodic mechanical loads have also been evaluated in the physical domain at all times by employing numerical inversion technique of integral transform. The computer simulated numerical results have been presented graphically in respect of displacement, temperature change and concentration deviation for brass.

When the boundary condition and source term are axisymmetric, the problem reduces to solving Poisson's equation in cylindrical coordinates in the two-dimensional ( r , z ) region of the original three-dimensional domain S . Hence, the original boundary value problem is reduced to a two-dimensional one. To make use of the Mechanical quadrature method (MQM), it is necessary to calculate a particular solution, which can be subtracted off, so that MQM can be used to solve the resulting Laplace problem, which possesses high accuracy order and low computing complexities. Moreover, the multivariate asymptotic error expansion of MQM accompanied with for all mesh widths h i is got. Hence, once discrete equations with coarse meshes are solved in parallel, the higher accuracy order of numerical approximations can be at least by the splitting extrapolation algorithm (SEA). Meanwhile, a posteriori asymptotic error estimate is derived, which can be used to construct self-adaptive algorithms. The numerical examples support our theoretical analysis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this paper, a double-passage shape correction (DPSC) method is presented for simulation of unsteady flows around vibrating blades and aeroelastic prediction. Based on the idea of phase-lagged boundary conditions, the shape correction method was proposed aimed at efficiently dealing with unsteady flow problems in turbomachinery. However, the original single-passage shape correction (SPSC) may show the disadvantage of slow convergence of unsteady solutions and even produce nonphysical oscillation. The reason is found to be related with the disturbances on the circumferential boundaries that can not be damped by numerical schemes. To overcome these difficulties, the DPSC method is adopted here, in which the Fourier coefficients are computed from flow variables at implicit boundaries instead of circumferential boundaries in the SPSC method. This treatment actually reduces the interaction between the calculation of Fourier coefficients and the update of flow variables. Therefore a faster convergence speed could be achieved and also the solution stability is improved. The present method is developed to be suitable for viscous and turbulent flows. And for real three-dimensional (3D) problems, the rotating effects are also considered. For validation, a 2D oscillating turbine cascade, a 3D oscillating flat plate cascade and a 3D practical transonic fan rotor are investigated. Comparisons with experimental data or other solutions and relevant discussions are presented in detail. Numerical results show that the solution accuracy of DPSC method is favorable and at least comparable to the SPSC method. However, fewer iteration cycles are needed to get a converged and stable unsteady solution, which greatly improves the computational efficiency.",

We also consider a nonlinear partial differential equation for unsteady flows in an open channel called Saint-Venant.

The Boussinesq potentials are used to obtain an analytical solution in series form, which satisfies the equilibrium equations of elastostatics, traction-free boundary conditions on the infinite plane surface and decaying conditions at infinity. The boundary conditions on the free surface of the pit are then imposed numerically, by minimising a quadratic functional of surface elastic energy. The minimisation yields a symmetric and positive definite linear system of equations for the coefficients of the series, whose particular block structure allows its solution in an efficient and robust way. The convergence of the series is verified and the obtained semi-analytical solution is then evaluated, providing numerical results. The method is validated by comparing the semi-analytical solution with the numerical results obtained using a commercial finite element software.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Vortex rings have been a subject of interest in vortex dynamics due to a plethora of physical phenomena revealed by their motions and interactions within a boundary. The present paper is devoted to physics of a head-on collision of two vortex rings in three dimensional space, simulated with a second order finite volume scheme and compressible. The scheme combines non-iterative approximate Riemann-solver and piecewise-parabolic reconstruction used in inviscid flux evaluation procedure. The computational results of vortex ring collisions capture several distinctive phenomena. In the early stages of the simulation, the rings propagate under their own self-induced motion. As the rings approach each other, their radii increase, followed by stretching and merging during the collision. Later, the two rings have merged into a single doughnut-shaped structure. This structure continues to extend in the radial direction, leaving a web of particles around the centers. At a later time, the formation of ringlets propagate radially away from the center of collision, and then the effects of instability involved leads to a reconnection in which small-scale ringlets are generated. In addition, it is shown that the scheme captures several experimentally observed features of the ring collisions, including a turbulent breakdown into small-scale structures and the generation of small-scale radially propagating vortex rings, due to the modification of the vorticity distribution, as a result of the entrainment of background vorticity and helicity by the vortex core, and their subsequent interaction.",

The capability of HILES is tested by solving several benchmark cases. In the case of flow past a circular cylinder, the solutions of HILES fulfilling the SCL have good agreement with the corresponding experiment data, however, the flowfield is gradually contaminated when the SCL error is enlarged. With the help of fulling the SCL, ability of HILES for handling complex geometry has been enhanced.

The scheme makes use of a levelset to depict the phase interface numerically. The overall scheme is basically a finite volume scheme. By approximately solving a two-phase Riemann problem on the phase interface, the normal phase interface velocity and the pressure are obtained, which is used to update the phase interface and calculate the numerical flux between the flows of two different phases. We adopt an aggregation algorithm to build cell patches around the phase interface to remove the numerical instability due to the breakdown of the CFL constraint by the cell fragments given by the phase interface depicted using the levelset function. The proposed scheme can handle problems with tangential sliping on the phase interface, topological change of the phase interface and extreme contrast in material parameters in a natural way. Though the perfect conservation of the mass, momentum and energy in global is not achieved, it can be quantitatively identified in what extent the global conservation is spoiled. Some numerical examples are presented to validate the numerical method developed.",

The Navier-Stokes solver is the augmented immersed interface method for Navier-Stokes equations on irregular domains. One of the most important contribution of this paper is that our analysis can predict the critical Reynolds number at which the vortex shading begins to develop in the wake of the obstacle. Some interesting experiments are shown to illustrate how the critical Reynolds number varies with different geometric settings.",

Secondly, we use a coarse space to solve the original saddle-point system. Then, we use a fine space again to solve a discrete H ( curl )-elliptic variational problems, denoted by auxiliary system 2. Furthermore, we develop a regularization diagonal block preconditioner for auxiliary system 1 and use H-X preconditioner for auxiliary system 2. Hence we essentially transform the original problem in a fine space to a corresponding (but much smaller) problem on a coarse space, due to the fact that the above two preconditioners are efficient and stable. Compared with some existing iterative methods for solving saddle-point systems, such as PMinres, numerical experiments show the competitive performance of our iterative two-grid method.",

The material properties of simply supported functionally graded carbon nanotube-reinforced (FGCNTR) plates are assumed to be graded in the thickness direction. The effective material properties at a point are estimated by either the Eshelby-Mori-Tanaka approach or the extended rule of mixture. Two types of symmetric carbon nanotubes (CNTs) volume fraction profiles are presented in this paper. The equations of motion and related boundary conditions are derived using the Hamilton’s principle. A semi-analytical solution composed of generalized differential quadrature (GDQ) method, as an efficient and accurate numerical method, and series solution is adopted to solve the equations of motions. The primary contribution of the present work is to provide a comparative study of the natural frequencies obtained by extended rule of mixture and Eshelby-Mori-Tanaka method. The detailed parametric studies are carried out to study the influences various types of the CNTs volume fraction profiles, geometrical parameters and CNTs volume fraction on the free vibration characteristics of FGCNTR plates. The results reveal that the prediction methods of effective material properties have an insignificant influence of the variation of the frequency parameters with the plate aspect ratio and the CNTs volume fraction.",

The array consists of a row and columnwise regular arrangement of identical square shaped isoflux discrete heaters and is flush mounted on a vertical wall of the cavity. A symmetrical isothermal sink condition is maintained by cooling the cavity uniformly from either the opposite wall or the side walls or the top and bottom walls. The other walls of the cavity are maintained adiabatic. A finite volume method based on the SIMPLE algorithm and the power law scheme is used to solve the conservation equations. The parametric study covers the influence of pertinent parameters such as the Rayleigh number, the Prandtl number, side aspect ratio of the cavity and cavity heater ratio. A detailed fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics for the three cases are reported in terms of isothermal and velocity vector plots and Nusselt numbers. In general it is found that the overall heat transfer rate within the cavity for Ra =10 7 is maximum when the side aspect ratio of the cavity lies between 1.5 and 2. A more complex and peculiar flow pattern is observed in the presence of top and bottom cold walls which in turn introduces hot spots on the adiabatic walls. Their location and size are highly sensitive to the side aspect ratio of the cavity and hence offers more effective ways for passive heat removal.",

In this study, the multi-objective optimization is presented for a 5MW wind turbine design and the effects of high tip speed on power output, cost and noise are analysed. In order to improve the convergence and efficiency of optimization, a novel type of gradient-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is proposed based on uniform decomposition and differential evolution. Optimization examples of the wind turbines indicate that the new algorithm can obtain uniformly distributed optimal solutions and this algorithm outperforms the conventional evolutionary algorithms in convergence and optimization efficiency. For the 5MW wind turbines designed, increasing the tip speed can greatly reduce the cost of energy (COE). When the tip speed increases from 80m/s to 100m/s, under the same annual energy production, the COE decreases by 3.2% in a class I wind farm and by 5.1% in a class III one, respectively, while the sound pressure level increases by a maximum of 4.4dB with the class III wind farm case.",

Moreover, it is further shown that the algorithms admit the conformal charge conservation law, and exactly preserve the dissipation rate of charge under appropriate boundary conditions. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the conformal properties and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms during long-time numerical simulations and validate the analysis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Kernel-based methods are popular in computer graphics, machine learning, and statistics, among other fields; because they do not require meshing of the domain under consideration, higher dimensions and complicated domains can be managed with reasonable effort. Traditionally, the high order of accuracy associated with these methods has been tempered by ill-conditioning, which arises when highly smooth kernels are used to conduct the approximation. Recent advances in representing Gaussians using eigenfunctions have proven successful at avoiding this destabilization in scattered data approximation problems. This paper will extend these techniques to the solution of boundary value problems using collocation. The method of particular solutions will also be considered for elliptic problems, using Gaussian eigenfunctions to stably produce an approximate particular solution.",

Presented in this study are the vector expression of Maxwell’s equations, three kinds of boundary conditions, stability weak formulation of Maxwell’s equations, and automatic hp -adaptivity strategy. The new hp -FEM can select optimal refinement and calculation strategies based on the practical formation model and error estimation. Numerical experiments show that the new hp -FEM has an exponential convergence rate in terms of relative error in a user-prescribed quantity of interest against the degrees of freedom, which provides more accurate results than those obtained using the adaptive h -FEM. The numerical results illustrate the high efficiency and accuracy of the method at a given LWD tool structure and parameters in different physical models, which further confirm the accuracy of the results using the Hermes library ( http://hpfem.org/hermes ) with a multi-frequency resistivity LWD tool response in a borehole environment.",

An improved multi-zone roughness model is proposed. According to the flow state of liquid water and film flow, rivulets flow governing equations are established to calculate film mass distribution, film velocity, rivulet wetness factor and rivulet mass distribution. Force equilibrium equations of droplet are used to establish the critical conditions of water film broken into rivulets and rivulets broken into beads. The temperature conduction inside the water layer and ice layer is considered. Using the proposed model ice accretion on a NACA0012 airfoil profile with a 4° angle of attack under different icing conditions is simulated. Different ice shapes like glaze ice, mixed ice and rime ice are obtained, and the results agree well with icing wind tunnel experiment data. It can be seen that, water films are formed on the surface, and heights of the films vary with icing time and locations. This results in spatially-temporally varying surface roughness and heat transfer process, ultimately affects the ice prediction. Model simulations indicate that the process of water film formation and evolution cannot be ignored, especially under glaze ice condition.",

The number of grid points required for resolving the oscillations may become very large even for simple model problems, making solution on a grid intractable. Asymptotic methods like Gaussian beams can resolve the oscillations with little effort and yield good approximations when the atomic nuclei are heavy and the potential is smooth. However, when the potential has variations on a small length-scale, quantum phenomena become important. Then asymptotic methods are less accurate. The two classes of methods perform well in different parameter regimes. This opens for hybrid methods, using Gaussian beams where we can and finite differences where we have to. We propose a new method for treating the coupling between the finite difference method and Gaussian beams. The new method reduces the needed amount of overlap regions considerably compared to previous methods, which improves the efficiency.",

In the conventional IB-LBM, the no-slip boundary condition is only approximately satisfied. As a result, there is flow penetration to the solid boundary. Another drawback of conventional IB-LBM is the use of Dirac delta function interpolation, which only has the first order of accuracy. In this work, the no-slip boundary condition is directly implemented, and used to correct the velocity at two adjacent mesh points from both sides of the boundary point. The velocity correction is made through the second-order polynomial interpolation rather than the first-order delta function interpolation. Obviously, the two drawbacks of conventional IB-LBM are removed in the present study. Another important contribution of this paper is to present a simple way to compute the hydrodynamic forces on the boundary from Newton’s second law. To validate the proposed method, the two-dimensional vortex decaying problem and incompressible flow over a circular cylinder are simulated. As shown in the present results, the flow penetration problem is eliminated, and the obtained results compare very well with available data in the literature.",

Based on the analysis of the evolution of vortical structures, two typical kinds of vortical structures, i.e., the wrapping vortices and the hair-pin vortices, are identified and play an important role in the flow state evolution. The boundary vorticity flux is analyzed to reveal the mechanism of the vorticity generation on the bump surface. The circulation of the primary vortex ring reasonably elucidates some typical phases of flow evolution. Further, the analysis of turbulent kinetic energy reveals the transition from laminar to turbulent state. The results obtained in this study provide physical insight into the understanding of the mechanisms relevant to the flow evolution and the flow transition to turbulent state.",

The proposed approach could be performed similarly for any optimization problem with the corresponding cost function and design variables vector. Moreover, this approach was not limited to flow fields and could be employed for steady as well as unsteady flows. Initially, the continuous and discrete adjoint LB equations and the cost function gradient vector were derived mathematically in detail using the continuous and discrete LB equations in space and time, respectively. Meanwhile, new adjoint concepts in lattice space were introduced. Finally, the analytical evaluation of the adjoint distribution functions and the cost function gradients was carried out.",

In these cases, a new mesh is constructed such that a given monitor function is equidistributed in some sense. Typical choices of the monitor function involve the solution or one of its many derivatives. This straightforward concept has proven to be extremely effective and practical. However, selections of core monitoring functions are often challenging and crucial to the computational success. This paper concerns six different designs of the monitoring function that targets a highly nonlinear partial differential equation that exhibits both quenching-type and degeneracy singularities. While the first four monitoring strategies are within the so-called primitive regime, the rest belong to a later category of the modified type, which requires the priori knowledge of certain important quenching solution characteristics.

We also find that the effect of viscous coupling on the displacement can be neglected when the tolerance quantifying the degree of coupling equals the reciprocal of viscosity ratio.In addition, the effect of viscous coupling on the displacement is very sensitive to the change of viscosity ratio, which decreases monotonously with the decrease of viscosity ratio under the same coupling degree.",

Numerical results on a number of models show that the proposed algorithm can be used to computationally explore the possible dynamical scenarios while identifying the important mechanisms via the use of sparsity-promoting regularization.",

To obtain this goal, all plain waves are divided into positive-negative going wave vectors along with the shell axis. Based on the Flügge thin shell theory, the shell continuity as well as boundary conditions are well satisfied by introducing the propagation and reflection matrices. Furthermore, all elements of the reflection matrix are derived for certain classical supports. As an example, for demonstrating the feasibility of VWM in the shell vibration analysis, a circular cylindrical shell with two ended flexible support is adopted. The natural frequencies of the systemaswell asmode shapes are obtained using VWM. The aquired results are compared with those of the previous works and found in excellent agreement. It is also found that VWM could mathematically provide a reduced dimensional matrix (dominant matrix) to calculate the natural frequencies of the system. Accordingly, the proposed method can provide high computational efficiency and remarkable accuracy, simultaneously.",

It shows that the semi-explicit scheme is conditionallystable, ﬁrst order accurate in time and 2 l th order accuracy in space.

Fluids Eng., 133 (2011), 041302), the present study numerically investigate the flow-structure interactions (FSI) of three rigid circular particles aligned moving in an inclined channel flow at intermediate Reynolds numbers by using a momentum-exchanged immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method. A ”frog-leap” phenomenon observed in the experiment is successfully captured by the present simulation and flow characteristics and underlying FSI mechanisms of it are explored by examining the effects of the channel inclined angles and Reynolds numbers. It is found that the asymmetric difference of the vorticity distributions on the particle surface is the main cause of the “frog-leap” when particle moves in the boundary layer near the lower channel boundary.",

Based on the computational mesh, a set of very coarse grid named as background grid is generated firstly, and then the computational mesh can be located at the background grid by Delaunay graph mapping technique. After that, the RBFs method is applied to deform the background grid by choosing partial mesh points on the boundary as the control points. Finally, Delaunay graph mapping method is used to relocate the computational mesh by employing area or volume weight coefficients. By applying different dynamic mesh methods to a moving NACA0012 airfoil, it can be found that the RBFs-Delaunay graph mapping hybrid method is as accurate as RBFs and is as efficient as Delaunay graph mapping technique. Numerical results show that the dynamic meshes for all test cases including one two-dimensional (2D) and two three-dimensional (3D) problems with different complexities, can be generated in an accurate and efficient manner by using the present hybrid method.",

The multiscale basis functions have abilities to capture originally perturbed information in the local problem, as a result our method is capable of reducing the boundary layer errors remarkably on graded meshes, where the layer-adapted meshes are generated by a given parameter. Through numerical experiments we demonstrate that the multiscale method can acquire second order convergence in the L 2 norm and first order convergence in the energy norm on graded meshes, which is independent of ɛ.

Many current algorithms for TV-based image restoration, such as Chambolle’s projection algorithm, the split Bregman algorithm, the Bermúdez-Moreno algorithm, the Jia-Zhao denoising algorithm, and the fixed point algorithm, can be viewed as special cases of the new first-order schemes.

The reconstruction formulation is applied at fluid nodes in the immediate vicinity of the immersed boundary, which combines weightly the local DFD solution with the specific values obtained via an approximation of quadratic polynomial in the normal direction to the wall. The quadratic approximation is associated with the no-slip boundary condition and the local simplified momentum equation. The weighted factor suitable for unstructured triangular and tetrahedral meshes is constructed, which is related to the local mesh intervals near the immersed boundary and the distances from exterior dependent nodes to the boundary. Therefore, the reconstructed solution can account for the smooth movement of the immersed boundary. Several numerical experiments have been conducted for two- and three-dimensional moving-boundary flows. It is shown that the hybrid reconstruction approach can work well in the finite-element context and effectively reduce the numerical oscillations with little additional computational cost, and the spatial accuracy of the original local DFD method can also be preserved.",

The side walls of the cavity are maintained at constant temperatures and concentrations, whereas bottom wall is a function of non-uniform (sinusoidal) temperature and concentration. The non-Darcy Brinkmann model is considered. The governing equations are solved numerically by spectral element method using the vorticity-stream-function approach. The controlling parameters for present study are Darcy number ( Da ), heat source intensity i.e., thermal Rayleigh number ( Ra ), permeability ratio ( K* ), orientation angle ( ϕ ). The main attention is given to understand the impact of anisotropy parameters on average rates of heat transfer (bottom, Nu b , side Nu s ) and mass transfer (bottom, Sh b , side, Sh s ) as well as on streamlines, isotherms and iso-concentration. Numerical results show that, for irrespective value of K* , the heat and mass transfer rates are negligible for 10 −7 ≤ Da ≤ 10 −5 , Ra = 2 × 10 5 and ϕ = 45°. However a significant impact appears on Nusselt and Sherwood numbers when Da lies between 10 −5 to 10 −4 . The maximum bottom heat and mass transfer rates ( Nu b , Su b ) is attained at ϕ = 45°, when K* =0.5 and 2.0. Furthermore, both heat and mass transfer rates increase on increasing Rayleigh number ( Ra ) for all the values of K *. Overall, It is concluded from the above study that due to anisotropic permeability the flow dynamics becomes complex.",

The model proposed is based on a posterior optimal truncated weighted residue (POT-WR) method, by which an infinite dimensional PDE is optimally truncated and analytically solved in required condition of accuracy. To end that, a POT-WR condition for PDE under consideration is used as a dynamically optimal control criterion with the solving process. A set of bases needs to be constructed without any reference database in order to establish a space to describe low-dimensional dynamical system that is required. The Lagrangian multiplier is introduced to release the constraints due to the Galerkin projection, and a penalty function is also employed to remove the orthogonal constraints. According to the extreme principle, a set of ordinary differential equations is thus obtained by taking the variational operation of the generalized optimal function. A conjugate gradient algorithm by FORTRAN code is developed to solve the ordinary differential equations. The two examples of one-dimensional heat transfer equation and nonlinear Burgers’ equation show that the analytical results on the method proposed are good agreement with the numerical simulations and analytical solutions in references, and the dominant characteristics of the dynamics are well captured in case of few bases used only.",

Three channel heights measuring 0.3 mm, 0.6mmand 1mmare considered and the Reynolds number varies from 300 to 2360, based on the hydraulic diameter. Simulation starts with the validation study on the Nusselt number and the Poiseuille number variations along the channel streamwise direction. It is found that the predicted Nusselt number has shown very good agreement with the theoretical estimation, but some discrepancies are noted in the Poiseuille number comparison. This observation however is in consistent with conclusions made by other researchers for the same flow problem. Simulation continues on the evaluation of heat transfer characteristics, namely the friction factor and the thermal resistance. It is found that noticeable scaling effect happens at small channel height of 0.3 mm and the predicted friction factor agrees fairly well with an experimental based correlation. Present simulation further reveals that the thermal resistance is low at small channel height, indicating that the heat transfer performance can be enhanced with the decrease of the channel height.",

For this wide class of problems, we here present a new, simple, flexible, and robust solution method, based on piecewise exact integration of local approximation polynomials as well as on averaging local integrals. The method is designed for modern mathematical software providing efficient environments for numerical matrix-vector operation-based calculus. Based on cubic approximation polynomials, the presented method can be expected to perform (i) similar to the Runge-Kutta method, when applied to stiff initial value problems, and (ii) significantly better than the finite difference method, when applied to boundary value problems. Therefore, we use the presented method for the analysis of engineering problems including the oscillation of a modulated torsional spring pendulum, steady-state heat transfer through a cooling web, and the structural analysis of a slender tower based on second-order beam theory. Related convergence studies provide insight into the satisfying characteristics of the proposed solution scheme.",

In addition, the solution of the system discretized by Galerkin method with modified multiple knot B-spline wavelets is discussed. We also consider a nonlinear partial differential equation for unsteady flows in an open channel called Saint-Venant. Since the solving of this problem by some methods such as finite difference and finite element produce unsuitable approximations spe- cially in the ends of channel, it is solved by multiple knot B-spline wavelet method that yields a very well approximation.

Typical choices of the monitor function involve the solution or one of its many derivatives. This straightforward concept has proven to be extremely effective and practical. However, selections of core monitoring functions are often challenging and crucial to the computational success. This paper concerns six different designs of the monitoring function that targets a highly nonlinear partial differential equation that exhibits both quenching-type and degeneracy singularities. While the first four monitoring strategies are within the so-called primitive regime, the rest belong to a later category of the modified type, which requires the priori knowledge of certain important quenching solution characteristics.

With some criteria, the domain is dynamically decomposed into three parts: kinetic regions where fluids are far from equilibrium, hydrodynamic regions where fluids are near thermody-namical equilibrium and buffer regions which are used as a smooth transition. The Boltzmann-BGK equation is solved in kinetic regions, while Euler equations in hydrodynamic regions and both equations in buffer regions. By a well defined monitor function, our moving mesh method smoothly concentrate the mesh grids to the regions containing rapid variation of the solutions. In each moving mesh step, the solutions are conservatively updated to the new mesh and the cut-off function is rebuilt first to consist with the region decomposition after the mesh motion. In such a framework, the evolution of the hybrid model and the moving mesh procedure can be implemented independently, therefore keep the advantages of both approaches. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the method.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) methods for the Boltzmann equation employ a point measure approximation to the distribution function, as simulated particles may possess only a single velocity. This representation limits the method to converge only weakly to the solution of the Boltzmann equation. Utilizing kernel density estimation we have developed a stochastic Boltzmann solver which possesses strong convergence for bounded and L ∞ solutions of the Boltzmann equation. This is facilitated by distributing the velocity of each simulated particle instead of using the point measure approximation inherent to DSMC. We propose that the development of a distributional method which incorporates distributed velocities in collision selection and modeling should improve convergence and potentially result in a substantial reduction of the variance in comparison to DSMC methods. Toward this end, we also report initial findings of modeling collisions distributionally using the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook collision operator.",

Depending on the scenario, radiative heat transfer can play a very important role in enclosure combustion events such as tunnel fires. In this work, the importance of radiation and the effect of the use of different approaches to account for it were assessed. Firstly, small-scale tunnel fire simulations were performed and the results compared with experimental data, then realistic full-scale scenarios were simulated. The results show up the capability of CFD modelling to reproduce with good approximation tunnel fires. Radiation proved to be noteworthy mainly when the scale of the fire is relatively large. Among the various approaches employed to simulate radiation, the use of the Discrete Transfer model gave the most accurate results, mainly when the absorption-emission characteristics of the combustion products were taken into account. Finally, the suitability of the use of CFD in quantitative Fire Hazard Analysis is discussed.",

(Phys. Rev. E., 64 (2001), 011208) is adopted and forcing term is added into the resulting microdynamic evolution equation. The determination of the forcing terms is dic- tated by yielding the emergent macroscopic equations toward a particular target form. The correct macroscopic equations of the incompressible axisymmetric vis- cous flows are recovered through the Chapman-Enskog expansion. Computations of uniform flow over a sphere to verify the method are included. The results also indicate distinct characteristics of the effects of quantum statistics.

Based on the von Karman's large deformation theory, the equations of motion of each-span composite laminated plate are formulated using Hamilton's principle, and the partial differential equations are discretized into nonlinear ordinary ones through the Galerkin's method. The primary resonance and 1/3 sub-harmonic resonance are investigated by using the method of multiple scales. The amplitude-frequency relations of the steady-state responses and their stability analyses in each kind of resonance are carried out. The effects of the disorder ratio and ply angle on the two different resonances are analyzed. From the numerical results, it can be concluded that disorder in the length of the two-span 2D composite laminated plate will cause the nonlinear vibration localization phenomenon, and with the increase of the disorder ratio, the vibration localization phenomenon will become more obvious. Moreover, the amplitude-frequency curves for both primary resonance and 1/3 sub-harmonic resonance obtained by the present analytical method are compared with those by the numerical integration, and satisfactory precision can be obtained for engineering applications and the results certify the correctness of the present approximately analytical solutions.",

    "abstract": "Data center plays an increasingly important role in everyday life.As data center is becoming more and more powerful, energy consumption is also increasing dramatically.The air conditioning system occupies at least 50 percent of the total energy consumption.Therefore, delicate analysis on the air conditioning system could help to reduce energy consumption in data center.An advanced Finite Volume Method with RNG k-ε model and convective heat exchange model is used in this paper to study the airflow and the temperature distribution of modular data center under different arrangements.Specifically, the calculation formula of convective heat transfer coefficient for plate flow is adopted to simplify analysis; and fans on the back of racks are simplified to be walls with a certain pressure jump.Simulations reveal that, in the case where air conditioners are arranged face-to-face, the temperature distribution on the back of racks is not uniform, and local high temperature points emerge near the side wall of air conditioners.By analyzing the distribution of air flow and temperature, geometric model is optimized by using a diagonal rack arrangement and drilling holes on the side wall.In the same energy consumption situation, the overall maximum temperature of the optimized model is reduced by 2.3 • C compared with that of the original one, and the maximum temperature on the server surface is reduced by 1 • C. Based on the optimized model, the effect of the hot aisle distance on the temperature distribution is studied.By simulating four different cases with various distances of hot aisle of 100cm, 120cm, 130cm and 150cm, it is found that the temperature is generally lower and distributed more evenly in the case with 120cm hot aisle distance.This demonstrates that the distance of hot aisle has an effect on temperature.",

The numerical method used includes a high resolution fifth-order weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme for spatial discretization, coupled with a third order total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta time stepping method. In particular, effect of energy release on the DDT process is studied. The model parameters used are the heat release at q = 50,30,25,20,15,10 and 5, the specific heat ratio at 1.2, and the activation temperature at Ti = 15, respectively. For all the cases, the initial energy in the spark is about the same compared to the detonation energy at the Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) state. It is found from the simulation that the DDT occurrence strongly depends on the magnitude of the energy release. The run-up distance of DDT occurrence decreases with the increase of the energy release for q = 50 ~ 20, and increases with the increase of the energy release for q = 20 ~ 5. This phenomenon is found to be in agreement with the analysis of mathematical stability theory. It is suggested that the factors to strengthen the DDT would make the detonation more stable, and vice versa. Finally, it is concluded from the simulations that the interaction of the shock wave and the flame front is the main reason for leading to DDT.",

A common way to cool a tip is to use serpentine passages with 180-deg turn under the blade tip-cap taking advantage of the three-dimensional turning effect and impingement like flow. Improved internal convective cooling is therefore required to increase the blade tip lifetime. In the present study, augmented heat transfer of an internal blade tip with pin-fin arrays has been investigated numerically using a conjugate heat transfer method. The computational domain includes the fluid region and the solid pins as well as the tip regions. Turbulent convective heat transfer between the fluid and pins, and heat conduction within pins and tip are simultaneously computed. The main objective of the present study is to observe the effect of the pin material on heat transfer enhancement of the pin-finned tips. It is found that due to the combination of turning, impingement and pin-fin crossflow, the heat transfer coefficient of a pin-finned tip is a factor of 2.9 higher than that of a smooth tip at the cost of an increased pressure drop by less than 10%. The usage of metal pins can reduce the tip temperature effectively and thereby remove the heat load from the tip. Also, it is found that the tip heat transfer is enhanced even by using insulating pins having low thermal conductivity at low Reynolds numbers. The comparisons of overall performances are also included.",

In this study, a multiple-relaxation time (MRT) lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is used to investigate the flow of a vortex ring impacting spheroidal particles. The MRT-LBM is validated through the cases of vortex ring impacting a flat wall. The vortex evolution due to particle size, the aspect ratio of a prolate particle, as well as Reynolds ( Re ) number are discussed in detail. When the vortex ring impacting a stationary sphere, the primary and secondary vortex rings wrap around each other, which is different from the situation of the vortex ring impacting a plate. For the vortex ring impacting with a prolate spheroid, the secondary vortex ring stretches mainly along the long axis of the ellipsoid particle. However, it is found that after the vortex wrapping stage, the primary vortex recovers along the short axis of the particle faster than that in the long axis, i.e., the primary vortex ring stretches mainly along the short axis of the particle. That has never been address in the literature.",

In [2], we used a Crank Nicolson ADI OSC method for solving general nonlinear parabolic problems with Robin’s boundary conditions on rectangular polygons and demonstrated numerically the accuracy in various norms. A natural question that arises is: Does this method have an extension to non-rectangular regions? In this paper, we present a simple idea of how the ADI OSC technique can be extended to some such regions. Our approach depends on the transfer of Dirichlet boundary conditions in the solution of a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP).

Parametric studies with different wall roughness extents and with different mass loading ratios of particles are performed in fully developed channel flows with the Eulerian-Lagrangian approach. A low-Reynolds-number k – ε turbulence model is applied for the solution of the carrier-flow field, while the deterministic Lagrangian method together with binary-collision hard-sphere model is applied for the solution of particle motion. It is shown that the mechanism of inter-particle collisions should be taken into account in the modeling except for the flows laden with sufficiently low mass loading ratios of particles. Influences of wall roughness on particle dispersion due to particle-wall collisions are found to be considerable in the bounded particle–laden flow. Since the investigated particles are associated with large Stokes numbers, i.e., larger than O (1), in the test problem, the effects of turbulence on particle dispersion are much less considerable, as expected, in comparison with another two physical mechanisms investigated in the study.",

Standard second-order S-L method is used for evolving the level-set convection equation. The implementation is simple, including on the block-structured adaptive mesh. The efficiency of the S-L method is demonstrated by extensive numerical examples including passive convection of interfaces with corners/kinks/large deformation under given velocity fields, a geometrical flow with topological changes, simulations of bubble/ droplet dynamics in incompressible two-phase flows. In terms of accuracy it is comparable to the other existing methods.",

The quantitative results for flapping jet are found to be in good agreement with available experimental data in terms of mean velocity, flapping-induced velocity and turbulence intensity.

In [2], we used a Crank Nicolson ADI OSC method for solving general nonlinear parabolic problems with Robin’s boundary conditions on rectangular polygons and demonstrated numerically the accuracy in various norms. A natural question that arises is: Does this method have an extension to non-rectangular regions? In this paper, we present a simple idea of how the ADI OSC technique can be extended to some such regions. Our approach depends on the transfer of Dirichlet boundary conditions in the solution of a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP). We illustrate our idea for the solution of the heat equation on the unit disc using piecewise Hermite cubics.",

The focus of the paper is to un- derstand membrane deformation and budding due to experimentally observed linear HA-protein clusters, which have not been mathematically studied before. The viral membrane is modeled as a two dimensional incompressible lipid bilayer with bending rigidity. For tensionless membranes, we derive an analytical solution while for membrane under tension we solve the problem numerically. Our solu- tion for tensionless membranes shows that the height of membrane deformation increases monotonically with the bending moment exerted by HA-proteins and at- tains its maximum when the size of the protein cluster reaches a critical value. Our results also show that the hypothesis of dimple formation proposed in the litera- ture is valid in the two dimensional setting. Our comparative study of axisymmet- ric HA-clusters and linear HA-clusters reveals that the linear HA-clusters are not favorable to provide a sufficient energy required to overcome an energy barrier for a successful fusion, despite their capability to cause membrane deformation and budding.

Costa and W. S. Don, J. Comput. Appl. Math., 204(2) (2007)] is extended to three-dimensions and for parallel computation. The Hybrid scheme switches dynamically from a WENO- Z scheme to a central scheme at any grid location and time instance if the flow is sufficiently smooth and vice versa if the flow is exhibiting sharp shock-type phenomena. The smoothness of the flow is determined by a high order multi-resolution analysis. The method is tested on a benchmark sonic flow injection in supersonic cross flow. Increase of the order of the method reduces the numerical dissipation of the underlying schemes, which is shown to improve the resolution of small dynamic vortical scales. Shocks are captured sharply in an essentially non-oscillatory manner via the high order shock-capturing WENO- Z scheme. Computations of the injector flow with a WENO- Z scheme only and with the Hybrid scheme are in very close agreement. Thirty percent of grid points require a computationally expensive WENO- Z scheme for high-resolution capturing of shocks, whereas the remainder of grid points may be solved with the computationally more affordable central scheme. The computational cost of the Hybrid scheme can be up to a factor of one and a half lower as compared to computations with a WENO- Z scheme only for the sonic injector benchmark.",

We focus on the derivation of the partial integro-differential equation (PIDE) which will be applied to swing contracts and construct a novel pay-off function from a tree-based pay-off matrix that can be used as initial condition in the PIDE formulation. For valuing swing type derivatives we develop a theta implicit-explicit finite difference scheme to discretize the PIDE using a Gaussian quadrature method for the integral part. Based on known results for the classical theta-method the existence and uniqueness of solution to the new implicit-explicit finite difference method is proven. Various numerical examples illustrate the usability of the proposed method and allow us to analyse the sensitivity of swing options with respect to model parameters. In particular the effects of number of exercise rights, jump intensities and dividend yields will be investigated in depth.",

An important feature of the methods is that the pressure gradient un- knowns can be eliminated locally thus leading to a decoupled system of equations. Although the stability of the method has been established, for the homogeneous Stokes equations, the proof given here is based on the existence of a special inter- polant with additional orthogonal property with respect to the projection space. This makes it much simpler and more attractive. The resulting stabilized method is shown to lead to optimal rates of convergence for both velocity and pressure approximations.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on the development and application of a threedimensional gas-kinetic Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) method for the viscous flows in rotating machinery.For such flows, a rotating frame of reference is usually used in formulating the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations, and there are two major concerns in constructing the corresponding BGK model.One is the change of the convective velocities in the N-S equations, which can be reflected through modification of the gas streaming velocity.The other one is the necessity to account for the effect of the additional Coriolis and centrifugal forces.Here, a specifically-designed acceleration term is added into the modified Boltzmann equation so that the source effects can be naturally included into the gas evolution process and the resulted fluxes.Under the finitevolume framework, the constructed BGK model is locally solved at each cell interface and then the numerical fluxes can be evaluated.When employing the BGK scheme, it is sometimes found that the calculated spatial derivatives of the initial and equilibrium distribution functions are sensitive to the mesh quality especially in complex rotating flow applications, which may significantly influence flux evaluation.Therefore, an improved approach for computing these slopes is adopted, through which the modeling capability for viscous flows is enhanced.For validation, several numerical examples are presented.The computed results show that the present method can be well applied to a wide range of flows in rotating machinery with favorable accuracy.",

In this paper, we extend the analysis and obtain the complementary set of separable solutions whose circumferential parts are elementary $2\\pi$-aperiodic functions. Collectively, we construct eighteen distinct families of separable solutions; in each case, the circumferential part of the solution is one of three elementary $2\\pi$-aperiodic functions. These solutions are useful for solving a wide variety of dynamical problems that involve cylindrical geometries and for which $2\\pi$-periodicity in the angular coordinate is incompatible with the given boundary conditions. As illustrative examples, we show how the obtained solutions can be used to solve certain forced-vibration problems involving open cylindrical shells and open solid cylinders where (by virtue of the boundary conditions) $2\\pi$-periodicity in the angular coordinate is inappropriate. As an addendum to our prior work, we also include an illustrative example of a certain type of asymmetric problem that can be solved using the particular $2\\pi$-periodic subsolutions that ensue when there is no explicit dependence on the circumferential coordinate.",

The extended Hamilton’s principle is employed to obtain the elastic stiffness and mass matrices, the Rayleigh damping and elastic foundation matrices, the geometric stiffness matrix due to distributed axial force, and the load correction stiffness matrix accounting for the uniformly distributed nonconservative forces. The evaluation procedures for the critical values of divergence and flutter loads with/without internal and external damping effects are briefly presented.

As the malaria parasite grows in the malaria-infected red blood cells (IRBCs), the properties of the cells change. In the present work, the oxygen uptake by RBCs and IRBCs at the pulmonary capillaries is simulated using a numerical technique based on the two-dimensional immersed interface method. The results for the oxygen uptake by a stationary single RBC have fair agreements with the previously reported results. The numerical results show that the malaria infection could significantly cause deterioration on the oxygen uptake by red blood cells. The results also suggest that the oxygen uptake by individual stationary RBC/IRBC would not be significantly affected by the neighboring cells provided the separation distance is about the dimension of the cell. Furthermore, it appears that the oxygen uptake by both RBCs and IRBCs is dominated by mass diffusion over the convection although the Peclet number is of the order of unity.",

A transport equation for the non-turbulent viscosity is proposed to predict the development of the laminar kinetic energy in the pre-transitional boundary layer flow which has been observed in experiments. The turbulence breakdown process is then captured with an intermittency transport equation in the transitional region. The performance of this new transition model is validated through the experimental cases of T3AM, T3A and T3B. Results in this paper show that the new transition model can reach good agreement in predicting bypass transition, and is compatible with modern CFD software by using local variables.",

However, on warming beyond the glass transition temperature Tg glass transforms into one of the most plastic known materials. Bulk metallic glasses exhibit similar phenomenology, indicating that it rests on the disordered structure instead on the nature of the chemical bonds. The micromechanics of a solid with bulk amorphous structure is examined in order to determine the most basic conditions the system must satisfy to be able of plastic flow. The equations for the macroscopic flow, consistent with the constrictions imposed at the atomic scale, prove that a randomly structured bulk material must be either a brittle solid or a liquid, but not a ductile solid. The theory permits to identify a single parameter determining the difference between the brittle solid and the liquid. However, the system is able of perfect ductility if the plastic flow proceeds in two dimensional plane layers that concentrate the strain. Insight is gained on the nature of the glass transition, and the phase occurring between glass transition and melting.",

The FCI scheme shows excellent stability except the case of the flows involving strong recombination reactions, and can weaken or even eliminate the instability resulting from the stiffness problem, which occurs in the subsonic high-temperature region of the hypersonic flow field. In addition, when the full Jacobian of chemical source term is diagonalized, the stability of the FCI scheme relies heavily on the flow conditions. Especially in the case of high temperature and subsonic state, the CFL number satisfying the stability is very small. Moreover, we also consider the effect of the space step, and demonstrate that the stability of the FCI scheme with the diagonalized Jacobian can be improved by reducing the space step. Therefore, we propose an improved method on the grid distribution according to the flow conditions. Numerical tests validate sufficiently the foregoing analyses. Based on the improved grid, the CFL number can be quickly ramped up to large values for convergence acceleration.",

All expressions of bounded traveling wave solutions are presented, including exact expressions of bell and kink profile solitary wave solutions, as well as approximate expressions of damped oscillatory solutions. For approximate damped oscillatory solution, using homogenization principle, we give its error estimate by establishing the integral equation which reflects the relations between the exact and approximate solutions.

An analytical solution of a soft inclusion problem is derived and used to evaluate iterative numerical solutions of the associated linear algebraic system based on discretization via the finite element method, and use of an iterative conjugate gradient method with algebraic multigrid preconditioning (AMG-PCG). Accuracy and efficiency of the AMG-PCG algorithm is compared to two other conjugate gradient algorithms with diagonal preconditioning (DS-PCG) or a modified incomplete LU decomposition (Euclid-PCG) based on comparison to the analytical solution. While all three algorithms are shown to be accurate, the AMG-PCG algorithm is demonstrated to provide significant savings in CPU time as the number of nodal unknowns is increased. In contrast to the other two algorithms, the AMG-PCG algorithm also exhibits little sensitivity of CPU time and number of iterations to variations in material properties that are known to significantly affect model variables. Results demonstrate the benefits of algebraic multigrid preconditioners for the iterative solution of assembled linear systems based on finite element modeling of soft elastic inclusion problems and may be particularly advantageous for large scale problems with many nodal unknowns.",

However, PDE based models are not effective when used to inpaint large missing areas of images, such as that produced by object removal. To overcome this problem, in this paper, a two-phase image inpainting method is proposed. First, some edges which cross the damaged regions are located and the missing parts of these edges are fitted by using the cubic spline interpolation. These fitted edges partition the damaged regions into some smaller damaged regions. Then these smaller regions may be inpainted by using classical PDE models. Experiment results show that the inpainting results by using the proposed method are better than those of BSCB model and TV model.",

The fractional derivatives are described in the Caputo sense. This method is based on first taking the truncated Taylor expansions of the solution function in the fractional Riccati differential equation and then substituting their matrix forms into the equation. Using collocation points, the systems of nonlinear algebraic equation is derived. We further solve the system of nonlinear algebraic equation using Maple 13 and thus obtain the coefficients of the generalized Taylor expansion. Illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Math., 32(2) (2014), pp. 183–194), so that Conjugate Gradient (CG)-iteration counts decrease to 1/3~1/4 of direct CG. Second, MTEA uses a linear combination of exact matrix values in level L , L + s , L +2 s to predict matrix values in the following s –1 levels, and the coefficients of the linear combination is deduced by the quadric interpolation formula, then fully recalculate the matrix values at time level L +3 s , and continue like this iteratively. Therefore, the number of computing the full matrix decreases by a factor 1/ s . Last, the MTEA is analyzed in detail and the effectiveness of new method is verified by numerical experiments.",

Instead of searching a neighbourhood of the current point as done in the traditional hill-climbing, or along specified search directions in standard direct search methods, the new algorithm searches on a surface with radius determined by the motion of the stick. The significant feature of the proposed algorithm is that it only has one parameter, the search radius, which makes the algorithm convenient in practical implementation. The developed method can shrink the search space to a closed ball, or seek for the final optimal point by adjusting search radius. Furthermore our algorithm possesses multi-resolution feature to distinguish the local and global optimum points with different search radii. Therefore, it can be used by itself or integrated with other optimization methods flexibly as a mathematical optimization technique. A series of numerical tests, including high-dimensional problems, have been well designed to demonstrate its performance.",

The major advantage of the algorithm is that it maintains the effectiveness of TFI, while possessing the ability to deal with multi-block structured grid from the IDW method. In this approach, dynamic mesh generation is made in two steps. At first, all domain vertexes with known deformation are selected as sample points and IDW interpolation is applied to get the grid deformation on domain edges. Then, an arc-length-based TFI is employed to efficiently calculate the grid deformation on block faces and inside each block. The present approach can be well applied to both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) problems. The proposed method has been well-validated by several test cases. Numerical results show that dynamic meshes with high quality can be generated in an accurate and efficient manner.",

    "abstract": "For flow simulations with complex geometries and structured grids, it is preferred for high-order difference schemes to achieve high accuracy.In order to achieve this goal, the satisfaction of free-stream preservation is necessary to reduce the numerical error in the numerical evaluation of grid metrics.For the linear upwind schemes with flux splitting the free-stream preserving property has been achieved in the early study [Q.Li et al., Commun.Comput.Phys., 22 (2017), pp.64-94].In the current paper, new series of nonlinear upwind-biased schemes through WENO interpolation will be proposed.In the new nonlinear schemes, the shock-capturing capability on distorted grids is achieved, which is unavailable for the aforementioned linear upwind schemes.By the inclusion of fluxes on the midpoints, the nonlinearity in the scheme is obtained through WENO interpolations, and the upwind-biased construction is acquired by choosing relevant grid stencils.New third-and fifth-order nonlinear schemes are developed and tested.Discussions are made among proposed schemes, alternative formulations of WENO and hybrid WCNS, in which a general formulation of center scheme with midpoint and nodes employed is obtained as a byproduct.Through the numerical tests, the proposed schemes can achieve the designed orders of accuracy and free-stream preservation property.In 1-D Sod and Shu-Osher problems, the results are consistent with the theoretical predictions.In 2-D cases, the vortex preservation, supersonic inviscid flow around cylinder at M ∞ = 4, Riemann problem, and shock-vortex interaction problems have been tested.More specifically, two types of grids are employed, i.e., the uniform/smooth grids and the randomized/locally-randomized grids.All schemes can get satisfactory results in uniform/smooth grids.On the randomized grids, most schemes have accomplished computations with reasonable accuracy, except the failure of one third-order scheme in Riemann problem and shock-vortex interaction.Overall, the proposed nonlinear schemes have the capability to solve flow problems on badly deformed grids, and the schemes can be used in the engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new concept called Unified and Integrated Method for a shear deformable beam element.In this method, Timoshenko beam theory is unified and integrated in such a way that takes into account the effect of transverse shear and maintains the shear locking free condition at the same time to generate proper behavior in the analysis of thin to thick beams.The unified and integrated method is applied to finite element analysis (FEA) and isogeometric analysis (IGA) on two-node beam element.This method will be used to analyze uniformly loaded beams with various boundary conditions.A shear influence factor of φ, which is a function of beam thickness ratio (L/h), is expressed explicitly as control of the transverse shear strain effect.The analysis gives interesting results showing that applying the unified and integrated method in FEA and IGA will yield exact values of DOF's and displacement function even when using only a single element.Numerical examples demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the unified and integrated methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study presents a numerical solution to the three-dimensional solute transport in heterogeneous media by using a layer-integrated approach. Omitting vertical spatial variation of soil and hydraulic properties within each layer, a three-dimensional solute transport can be simplified as a quasi-three-dimensional solute transport which couples a horizontal two-dimensional simulation and a vertical one-dimensional computation. The finite analytic numerical method was used to discretize the derived two-dimensional governing equation. A quadratic function was used to approximate the vertical one-dimensional concentration distribution in the layer to ensure the continuity of concentration and flux at the interface between the adjacent layers. By integration over each layer, a set of system of equations can be generated for a single column of vertical cells and solved numerically to give the vertical solute concentration profile. The solute concentration field was then obtained by solving all columns of vertical cells to achieve convergence with the iterative solution procedure. The proposed model was verified through examples from the published literatures including four verifications in terms of analytical and experimental cases. Comparison of simulation results indicates that the proposed model satisfies the solute concentration profiles obtained from experiments in time and space.",

Compared with the classic a priori error analysis in literature, our technique can easily apply for any type regularity assumption on the exact solution, especially for the case of lower H 1+ s weak regularity under consideration, where 0 ≤ s ≤ 1/2. Because of the penalty term used in the CIP-FEM, Galerkin orthogonality is lost and Céa Lemma for conforming finite element methods can not be applied immediately when 0≤ s ≤1/2. To overcome this difficulty, our main idea is introducing an auxiliary C 1 finite element space in the analysis of the penalty term. The same tool is also utilized in the explicit a posteriori error analysis of CIP-FEM.",

The theorem shows that the upper and lower bounds series of linear functionals discussed can approach their exact values infinitely.

The conservation property is achieved by local mesh intersection and the mass of a tetrahedron of the current mesh is calculated by the integral on its intersection with the background mesh. For each current tetrahedron, the overlapped background tetrahedrons are detected efficiently. A mesh intersection algorithm is proposed to construct the intersection of a current tetrahedron with the overlapped background tetrahedron and mesh the intersection region by tetrahedrons. A localization algorithm is employed to search the host units in background mesh for each vertex of the current mesh. In order to enforce the maximum principle and avoid the loss of monotonicity, correction of nodal interpolated solution on tetrahedral meshes is given. The performance of the present solution reconstruction method is verified by numerical experiments on several analytic functions and the solution of the flow around a sphere.",

The iterative technique is based on the repeated solution by a fast direct method of a discrete Poisson equation on a uniform rectangular mesh. The problem is suitably scaled before iteration.

One of the test cases is an airfoil with a fully meshed domain. A specific rotation velocity is imposed as the airfoil boundary condition. The other test is a set of two cylinders that move toward each other. A mesh quality criteria is employed to identify critically distorted elements and to evaluate the performance of each mesh motion approach. The results obtained for each test case show that the pseudo-flow methodology produces satisfactory meshes during the moving process.",

The quantitative results for flapping jet are found to be in good agreement with available experimental data in terms of mean velocity, flapping-induced velocity and turbulence intensity. Results show that the flapping motion is a new flow pattern with characteristic flapping frequency for submerged turbulent plane jets, the mean centerline velocity decay is considerably faster than that of the stable impinging jet without flapping motion, and the flapping-induced velocities are as important as the turbulent fluctuations.",

The main focus was on designing a memory and computationally efficient code that, due to the typical conciseness of the Matlab coding language, could allow for fast and effective implementation of new models or algorithms. Innovative numerical methods are discussed in the paper. The pressure equation is derived with a quasi-segregation technique leading to an iterative scheme obtained within the framework of a global preconditioning procedure. Different levels of parallelization are obtainable by exploiting special pressure variable ordering patterns that lead to a block-structured Poisson-like matrix. Moreover, the new advection scheme has the potential of a controllable artificial diffusivity. Preliminary results are shown including a fully three-dimensional internal laminar flow evolving in a relatively complex geometry and a 3D methane-air flame simulated with the aid of libraries based on the Flamelet model.",

In particular, mixed convection due to moving surfaces is very important in these applications. Mixed convection in a channel, as a result of buoyancy and motion of one of its walls has received little research attention and few guidelines are available for choosing the best performing channel configuration, particularly when radiative effects are significant. In this study a numerical investigation of the effect of radiation on mixed convection in air due to the interaction between a buoyancy flow and an unheated moving plate induced flow in a uniformly heated convergent vertical channel is carried out. The moving plate has a constant velocity and moves in the buoyancy force direction. The principal walls of the channel are heated at uniform heat flux. The numerical analysis is accomplished by means of the commercial code Fluent. The effects of the wall emissivity, the minimum channel spacing, the converging angle and the moving plate velocity are investigated and results in terms of air velocity and temperature fields inside the channel and wall temperature profiles, both of the moving and the heated plates, are given. Nusselt numbers, both accounting and not for the radiative contribution to heat removal, are also presented.",

Our approach is based on an algorithm for finding the intersection of two non-matching grids. It has optimal algorithmic complexity and runs fast enough to make time-dependent velocity fields feasible. The evaluation of the integrals leads to increased precision and the unconditional stability. We demonstrate by numerical examples that the ELM with our proposed algorithm for accurate numerical integration has the following two features: first it is much more accurate and more stable than the ones with traditional numerical integration techniques and secondly the overall cost of the proposed method is comparable with the traditional ones.",

The shear creep behavior of the samples is characterized using the rheological tests. Based on the experimental measurements on mechanical properties under different normal stress conditions, an improved model is proposed to analyze the experimental results. It is demonstrated from a further discussion that such model can reflect the non-linear creep characteristics of structural planes, and especially, it is suitable for description of the viscoelastic and viscoplastic deformation behavior of structural planes.",

The stability studies are focused on the symmetric solitary wave for the subcritical flow with the Bond number greater than one third. When its steady symmetric solitary-wave-like solutions are randomly perturbed, the evolutions of some waves show stability in time regardless of the randomness while other waves produce unstable fluctuations. By representing the perturbation with a random variable, the governing FKdV equation is interpreted as a stochastic equation. The polynomial chaos expansion of the random solution has been used for the study of stability in two ways. First it allows us to identify the stable solution of the stochastic governing equation. Secondly it is used to construct upper and lower bounding surfaces for unstable solutions, which encompass the fluctuations of waves.",

Previously, most numerical and experimental researches focused on generating instability T-S waves through the external disturbances such as acoustic waves and vortical disturbances interacting with wall roughness or at the leading-edge of flatplate, whereas only a few paid attention to the excitation of the T-S waves directly by free-stream turbulence (FST). In this study, the generating mechanism of the temporal mode T-S waves under free-stream turbulence is investigated by using direct numerical simulation (DNS) and fast Fourier transform. Wave packets superposed by a group of stability, neutral and instability T-S waves are discovered in the boundary layer. In addition, the relation between the amplitude of the imposed free-stream turbulence and the amplitude of the excited T-S wave is also obtained.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Numerical investigation of the underexpanded sonic coaxial jets is carried out using large eddy simulation for three typical inner nozzle lip-thicknesses. Various fundamental mechanisms dictating the flow phenomena including shock structure, shear layer evolution and sound production are investigated. It is found that the inner nozzle lip induces a recirculation zone between inner and outer jets, which significantly influences the behaviors of shock structures and shear layers. The sound properties of the coaxial jets are further analyzed in detail. As the inner lip-thickness increases, the helical screech mode switches to an axisymmetric one and high-frequency screech also occurs with an oscillation frequency of recirculation zone. Based on the temporal Fourier transform and correlation analysis, the primary sources of low- and high-frequency screeches are associated with the downstream shock cells in the jet column and the secondary shock structures in the outer annular jet, respectively. The proper orthogonal decomposition analysis reveals that the dominant structures constructed by the most energetic modes shift from the downstream shock cells region to the upstream secondary shock region as the lip-thickness increases. The results obtained in this study provide physical insight into the understanding of the mechanisms relevant to the coherent structures and sound properties in sonic coaxial jets.",

The research results show that the flow is dominated by large-scale structures in the turbulence regime. Mushroom plumes emerge at both ends of each heat source, and smaller plumes increasingly rise. It is found that the gradient of root mean-square (rms) vertical velocities and the gradient of the rms temperature in the bottom boundary layer decreases with time evolution. It is further observed that the temporal evolution of the Kolmogorov scale, the kinetic-energy dissipation rates and thermal dissipation rates agree well with the theoretical predictions. It is also observed that there is a range of linear scaling in the 2nd-order structure functions of the velocity and temperature fluctuations and mixed velocity-temperature structure function.",

    "abstract": "A computational code is developed for the numerical solution of onedimensional transient gas-liquid flows using drift-flux models, in isothermal and also with phase change situations.For these two-phase models, classical upwind schemes such as Roe-and Godunov-type schemes are generally difficult to derive and expensive to use, since there are no treatable analytic expressions for the Jacobian matrix, eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system of equations.On the other hand, the highorder compact finite difference scheme becomes an attractive alternative on these occasions, as it does not make use of any wave propagation information from the system of equations.The present paper extends the localized artificial diffusivity method for high-order compact finite difference schemes to solve two-phase flows with discontinuities.The numerical method has simple formulation, straightforward implementation, low computational cost and, most importantly, high-accuracy.The numerical methodology proposed is validated by solving several numerical examples given in the literature.The simulations are sixth-order accurate and it is shown that the proposed numerical method provides accurate approximations of shock waves and contact discontinuities.This is an essential property for simulations of realistic mass transport problems relevant to operations in the petroleum industry.",

    "abstract": "The concrete aggregate model is considered as a type of weakly discontinuous problem consisting of three phases: aggregates which randomly distributed in different shapes, cement paste and internal transition zone (ITZ).Because of different shapes of aggregate and thin ITZs, a huge number of elements are often used in the finite element (FEM) analysis.In order to ensure the accuracy of the numerical solutions near the interfaces, we need to use higher-order elements.The widely used FEM softwares such as ANSYS and ABAQUS all provide the option of quadratic elements.However, they have much higher computational complexity than the linear elements.The corresponding coefficient matrix of the system of equations is a highly ill-conditioned matrix due to the large difference between three phase materials, and the convergence rate of the commonly used solving methods will deteriorate.In this paper, two types of simple and efficient preconditioners are proposed for the system of equations of the concrete aggregate models on unstructured triangle meshes by using the resulting hierarchical structure and the properties of the diagonal block matrices.The main computational cost of these preconditioners is how to efficiently solve the system of equations by using linear elements, and thus we can provide some efficient and robust solvers by calling the existing geometric-based algebraic multigrid (GAMG) methods.Since the hierarchical basis functions are used, we need not present those algebraic criterions to judge the relationships between the unknown variables and the geometric node types, and the grid transfer operators are also trivial.This makes it easy to find the linear element matrix derived directly from the fine level matrix, and thus the overall efficiency is greatly improved.The numerical results have verified the efficiency of the resulting preconditioned conjugate gradient (PCG) methods which are applied to the solution of several typical aggregate models.",
