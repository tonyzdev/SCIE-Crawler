    "abstract": "Background. Microbial and fungal cellulases are known to hydrolyse cellulose, which is ingested as plant material by herbivorous/omnivorous fishes. Microbial enzymes have enormous advantage of being produced in large quantities by established fermentation techniques. The present investigation aims to optimize the environmental and nutritional parameters for fermentation to enhance cellulase production by two bacterial strains isolated from fish gastrointestinal tracts. Materials and methods. Two bacterial strains, Bacillus subtilis CY5 and Bacillus circulans TP3, isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., and Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters, 1852), respectively were identified as potent cellulase producers. Both strains were cultured in tryptone soya broth for 24 h at 32 ± 2°C, when average viable count of 9.75 • 107 cells • mL-1 culture broth was obtained. This was used as the inoculum for the production medium. The fermentation medium was seeded with 1.0%, 2.0%, 3.0%, 4.0%, and 5.0% inoculum (tryptone soya broth) and incubated in static culture at 40°C to standardize the inoculum size for fermentation. The effect of different production parameters, such as fermentation condition, moisture, pH, temperature, inoculum size, and nitrogen sources on cellulase production by the isolated bacterial strains were studied. Results. Cellulase yield was highest (26 U in B. subtilis and 20.2 U in B. circulans) in solid-state fermentation (SSF). Enzyme production in both the isolates increased in an optimum pH range of 7.0 to 7.5. Minimum cellulase production was observed at 45°C, while maximum production was obtained at 40°C. To standardize the fermentation period for cellulase production, production rate was measured at 12-h intervals up to 120 h. Enzyme production increased for 96 h of fermentation in both strains, and decreased thereafter. The enzyme production increased with increased inoculum size up to 3.0 percentage points. Asparagine as the nitrogen source was most effective in B. subtilis CY5, while beef extract proved useful in optimizing enzyme production by B. circulans TP3. Conclusion. The results of this study will help to standardize the requirements for optimum production of cellulase by cellulase-producing fish gut bacteria and might contribute towards better fish feed formulation incorporating plant ingredients, especially in the larval stages when the enzyme system is not efficient.",

    "abstract": "The distribution of larvae and juveniles of Ayu, Plecoglossus altivelis (Temminck et Schlegel, 1846), is shaped by intricate interplays involving environmental variables and anthropogenic influences. The intricate interplay and equilibrium among these factors will govern the distribution and abundance of Ayu fish larvae and juveniles in estuarine settings. In this investigation, a hybrid Ant Colony Optimization-Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ACO-ANFIS) model was utilized to enhance the precision of Ayu fish larvae and juvenile’s occurrence estimation for the period from 2021 to 2022. The outcomes evinced that the hybrid model displays strong predictive capabilities, with R 2 test &amp;gt; 0.75, and AUC &amp;gt; 0.79. Among the environmental parameters, temperature, salinity, and turbidity exhibit the highest correlations with Ayu fish occurrence, with R values of 0.47, 0.54, and 0.40 for the Ka Long estuary, and 0.49, 0.50, and 0.42 for the Ba Lat estuary, respectively. The presence of Ayu species is limited to northern Vietnam, albeit with a declining pattern from the Ka Long estuary to the Ba Lat estuary. The study’s outcomes propose that the identification of suitable habitats and the cartography of fish distribution are invaluable for scrutinizing the ramifications of natural and anthropogenic influences on species distribution.",

    "abstract": "Following an introduction to the nature of fisheries catches and their information content, a new development of CMSY, a data-limited stock assessment method for fishes and invertebrates, is presented. This new version, CMSY++, overcomes several of the deficiencies of CMSY, which itself improved upon the “Catch-MSY” method published by S. Martell and R. Froese in 2013. The catch-only application of CMSY++ uses a Bayesian implementation of a modified Schaefer model, which also allows the fitting of abundance indices should such information be available. In the absence of historical catch time series and abundance indices, CMSY++ depends strongly on the provision of appropriate and informative priors for plausible ranges of initial and final stock depletion. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) now assists in selecting objective priors for relative stock size based on patterns in 400 catch time series used for training. Regarding the cross-validation of the ANN predictions, of the 400 real stocks used in the training of ANN, 94% of final relative biomass ( B / k ) Bayesian (BSM) estimates were within the approximate 95% confidence limits of the respective CMSY++ estimate. Also, the equilibrium catch-biomass relations of the modified Schaefer model are compared with those of alternative surplus-production and age-structured models, suggesting that the latter two can be strongly biased towards underestimating the biomass required to sustain catches at low abundance. Numerous independent applications demonstrate how CMSY++ can incorporate, in addition to the required catch time series, both abundance data and a wide variety of ancillary information. We stress, however, the caveats and pitfalls of naively using the built-in prior options, which should instead be evaluated case-by-case and ideally be replaced by independent prior knowledge.",

Silymarin, a mixture of flavonolignans from the seed of milk thistle (Silybum marianum), is used in treatment of liver disease, food and drug poising, and foetal diseases such as viral hepatitis, diabetes, and ischemia. Although, immunostimulant effects of the dietary silymarin were studied on different experimental animals, no information is available about the effects of silymarin on immune parameters of fish. The presently reported study was conducted to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of silymarin on some immunological and haematological parameters of rainbow trout. Materials and methods. Juvenile rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792), were maintained in 1000 L fiberglass tanks at 15 &#177; 2&#186;C supplied with systems of water recirculation and aeration. Silymarin extract incorporated into diets (0.0, 0.1, 0.4, and 0.8 g of per 1 kg of feed) of fish.&#160; The trout were fed silymarin-supplemented diet for 30 days. Haematological parameters, such as red blood cell count (RBC), white blood cell count (WBC), haematocrit (Hct), haemoglobin (Hb), differential leukocyte- and immunological parameters such as peroxidase, lysozyme, and complement activities, total protein, albumin and globulin levels were measured on day 7, 15, and 30 days of silymarin treatment. Results. The results indicated that oral administration of silymarin in fish, after 15 and 30 days of experimental periods, might enhance haematological and immunological parameters including lysozyme and complement activities, total protein and globulin levels, compared to the controls. Conclusion. The results suggest that oral administration of silymarin may be useful to strengthen the immune system in rainbow trout.",

Understanding how otolith chemistry is affected by temperature, salinity, interactive effects of abiotic factors, ontogeny, physiology, etc. is essential for the reconstruction of the environment that affected the fish. Otolith shape is also affected by environmental conditions in addition to the genotype. The applications of otolith chemistry and shape for stock discrimination have increased in recent years because of the advancements in analytical methods and the related software. The stock identification methods sometimes provide variable results but if we use complementary approach the information generated could be more reliable which can be used to prepare effective management and conservation strategies. It appears warranted to generate more information on the factors influencing otolith chemistry and shape especially when two or more factors exert synergetic influence. Therefore, the objectives of this review paper were to provide comprehensive information on various factors influencing the otolith chemistry and shape, and the utility of otolith chemistry and shape for fish stock discrimination with an emphasis towards the research areas needing additional studies.",

The objective of the presently reported study was to establish the lowest effective concentration of clove oil for the common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., and safe working ranges for the anaesthetic. Materials and methods. Carp were exposed to the concentrations of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100, 150, and 200 mg • L-1 of clove oil. The onsets of individual phases of anaesthesia and recovery rates were studied. In experiment 1 the fish were held in the anaesthetic bath until the lack of responses to handling was observed and in experiment 2—until the fading of ventilation. Results. Clove oil at the concentrations ranging from 30 to 200 mg • L-1 induced general anaesthesia. The lowest concentration causing general anaesthesia with an average induction time below 3 min was 40 mg • L-1. Recovery was concentration-independent and lasted for about 4 min (experiment 1). An increase in the concentration shortened the time of ventilation during anaesthesia and prolonged the recovery (experiment 2). Conclusion. Clove oil is a potent anaesthetic for carp, the safest and most effective at the concentrations of 30-50 mg • L-1. Therefore those solutions should be used, in the aquaculture practice, when the procedure requires more than 5 min of the exposure to the anaesthetic.",

    "abstract": "Background. The information on gut microflora in fish is scanty and there is a paucity of knowledge regarding microbial enzyme activity in fish gastrointestinal tracts. Although some information is available on the enzyme-producing bacteria in fish digestive tracts, almost nothing is known about their distribution in different regions of the gut. In the present study, an attempt has been made to investigate the distribution of enzyme-producing microflora in the foregut and hindgut regions of seven culturable freshwater teleosts. Materials and methods. Isolation and enumeration of aerobic bacterial flora in the foregut and hindgut regions of the gastrointestinal tracts of seven freshwater teleosts of different feeding habits, namely rohu, Labeo rohita; catla, Catla catla; mrigal, Cirrhinus mrigala; bata, Labeo bata; orange-fin labeo, Labeo calbasu; Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus; and climbing perch, Anabas testudineus, have been carried out. Microbial culture of the gut mucosa on selected nutrient media, following the enrichment culture technique, was done for bacterial isolation. Bacterial isolates were qualitatively screened on the basis of their extracellular enzyme-producing ability. The selected strains were further quantitatively assayed for amylase, cellulase and protease activities. Results. In general, bacterial population was lower in the foregut region of all the seven species of fish examined. Amylolytic strains were present in higher densities in the foregut region of orange-fin labeo and bata (12.20&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;103&nbsp;CFU&#183;g-1 gut tissue and &nbsp;11.50&nbsp;&times 103&nbsp;CFU&#183;g-1 gut tissue, respectively) in comparison to the hindgut region. The cellulolytic population exhibited maximum densities in the hindgut region of bata (7.20&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;103&nbsp;CFU&#183;g-1 gut tissue) followed by the foregut region of the same fish (5.50&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;103&nbsp;CFU&#183;g-1 gut tissue). Amylolytic and cellulolytic bacterial flora was not detected in both the fore and hindgut regions of climbing perch. Proteolytic bacterial flora was found in all the species of fish studied and the maximum count was observed in the hindgut region of bata (13.40&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;103&nbsp;CFU&#183;g-1 gut tissue), orange-fin labeo (9.00&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;103&nbsp;CFU&#183;g-1 gut tissue), Nile tilapia (8.30&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;103&nbsp;CFU&#183;g-1 gut tissue) and climbing perch (7.20&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;103&nbsp;CFU&#183;g-1 gut tissue). Minimum count of proteolytic bacterial flora was observed in the foregut region of all the fishes studied. Peak amylase and cellulase activities were exhibited by bacterial strains isolated from the foregut of orange-fin labeo (266.43 &plusmn; 0.15 U) and the hindgut of bata (64.01 &plusmn; 0.42 U), respectively. Maximum protease activity was exhibited by a strain isolated from the hindgut region of orange-fin labeo (44.33 &plusmn; 0.09 U), followed by the strains isolated from the hindgut regions of climbing perch (32.87 &plusmn; 0.12 U), bata (29.71 &plusmn; 0.11 U), and Nile tilapia (29.46 &plusmn; 0.11 U). Conclusion. The results of the present study indicate that there is a distinct microbial source of digestive enzymes apart from the endogenous sources in fish digestive tracts. The enzyme-producing bacteria isolated from the digestive tracts can be beneficially used as a probiotic while formulating aquafeeds, especially in the larval stages. However, further investigations are required to determine if the addition of such isolates to fish feeds do, in fact, provide some kind of benefit to the fish involved before advocating their use.",

    "abstract": "Background. The examination of morphological features related to feeding in fish, as well as their relation with body length, are of increasing scientific interest. In the present study, information on intestine (gut) morphometrics that appear in the relevant literature has been compiled, analysed, and discussed. Materials and methods. Search of gut-related bibliography was conducted, using online literature databaseson fish feeding and ecomorphology. The resulted data was tabulated. Relationships between mean, minimum, and maximum relative gut length (RGL) and intestine length weight index (ILW, Zihler's index), as provided by the original author, with species' fractional trophic levels (TROPHs; extracted from FishBase) were explored. Finally, using the relations between gut length (GL) and body length (L) provided by the original authors, regressions were reconstructed and compared based on species' feeding habits and taxonomy. Results. The amount of information related to gut morphometrics referred to 498 species. The relations between GL and L referred to 71 species, but four species were omitted from the analyses. Mean, minimum, and maximum RLGand ILW values were negatively related (for all cases: P < 0.01) with TROPH. The GL–L regressions performed for 67 species revealed the presence of two major groups as herbivorous fishes and carnivorous fishes. Grouping according to species' taxonomic order did not form any significant groupings. Conclusion. Existing information on intestine morphometrics is generally accumulated in a few scientific papers. All the analyses performed on the compiled data reinforced the pattern generally accepted that herbivores have longer intestines than carnivores. In addition, the influence of species' evolutionary history on comparisons of gut length between species with different feeding habits was not verified. Finally, equations relating RGL and ILW to TROPH can be used for TROPH value estimates from morphological data that are easy to obtain, especially in the lack of species' feeding habits data.",

    "abstract": "Background. Fish gut bacteria may be used as probiotics for fish. Those occurring in thegastrointestinal (GI) tract of rohu, Labeo rohita (Hamilton, 1822), have not been sufficiently studied. This study was intended: to detect bacteria in the intestine rohu by scanning electron microscopy (SEM); to evaluate the existence of heterotrophic, proteolytic, amylolytic, and cellulolytic bacteria in three different regions of the gut of rohu; and to identify more than 25% of the isolated gut bacteria by 16S rRNA. Materials and methods. The GI tracts were removed and divided into three regions: foregut, midgut, and hindgut. Tissues used for SEM were fixed in glutaraldehyde, washed in heparinised saline, dehydrated in graded ethanol, fixed in amyl acetate, dried with liquid nitrogen, coated with gold, observed, and photographed. Homogenates of the intestinal segments were spread onto tryptic soy agar plates and selected nutrient media plates to determine heterotrophic, proteolytic, amylolytic, and cellulolytic bacterial populations, respectively. Adherent bacterial strains isolated from the GI tract of 16 (out of 59) isolates were tried for identification by 16S rRNA genes. Results. Bacteria were observed to adhere to the gut enterocyte surfaces. Population level of enzyme-producing bacteria was higher in the midgut and hindgut regions than that observed in the foregut region. Furthermore, dense amylolytic and cellulolytic bacterial population in comparison to the proteolytic populationwas noticed in the GI tract of L. rohita. Highest density of the cellulolytic bacterial population in the hindgut region may indicate that fermentative degradation occurs in this part of the GI tract. Eleven adherent bacterial strains belonged to bacilli, 2 strains to Pseudomonas, 1 strain to Aeromonas, 1 strain was most closely relatedto Enterobacter, while 1 strain showed <97% 16S rRNA sequence similarity in BLAST program was treated as unknown. Conclusion. Autochthonous bacteria were present in the GI tract of rohu and that the autochthonous microbiota possess enzymatic activity that might be beneficial for the fish.",

    "abstract": "Background. The round goby, Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814), is a recent invader in the Curonian Lagoon, SE Baltic Sea. As invasive species are among the most severe threats for biodiversity loss and can induce food web alterations, the development of round goby population in the Curonian Lagoon and its possible impacts on fish community and the entire ecosystem are of great scientific interest. This research reports on the expansion and trophic role of round goby in the Curonian Lagoon. Materials and methods. Occurrence and abundance of round goby was investigated using a beach seine and gill nets at the northern and central parts of the Curonian Lagoon during a six-year period from 2007 to 2012. The trophic niche of the newcomer was revealed by applying gut content and stable isotope analyses (SIA). A total of 61 samples of other fish species were taken for SIA in order to reveal with which resident fish species the exploitative competition could be expected. Stable isotope mixing models were used to evaluate the contribution of round goby to the nutrition of top predators of the Curonian Lagoon: European perch, Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758; pike-perch, Sander lucioperca (Linnaeus, 1758); great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo; and grey heron, Ardea cinerea. Results. The survey showed that round goby expanded its distribution area and recently occurs in the entire Lithuanian part of the Curonian Lagoon. Variation in the density of round goby suggests that the invader&#8217;s abundance may be stabilised in the northern part of the lagoon. Gut content and stable isotope analyses showed round goby being mainly benthivorous. The largest trophic overlap with respect to SIA was detected between the invader and ruffe, Gymnocephalus cernua (Linnaeus, 1758), the fish which presumably exploits the same habitat type. According to stable isotope mixing models round goby was included with considerable shares into the diet of top predators. Conclusion. The further expansion of round goby inside the Curonian Lagoon is ongoing. However, there is evidence on population density stabilisation in the northern part of the lagoon. Native benthivorous fish, especially ruffe, may be affected through competition for food resources in habitats where the newcomer is numerous. Round goby significantly contributes to the diet of piscivorous fish and birds. That may promote the regulation of invader population abundance in the lagoon.",

    "abstract": "Background. on a short standardized segment of the genome. The main objective of the barcode of life project is to provide a database of genetic sequences which can be used as a tool for universal species identification. Indonesia has at least 1300 freshwater fish species, however unfortunately no species has been barcoded as yet. In the presently reported study, we subjected to barcoding a total of 14 species of freshwater fishes from Lake Laut Tawar, Indonesia. Materials and methods. On average, 10 random samples from each species were processed for DNA analysis. Approximately 655-bp were amplified from the 5′ region of the mitochondrial cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COX1) gene. All obtained sequences were edited and aligned using MEGA 4.0 program. Nucleotide divergence among sequences was estimated based on Kimura 2-parameter distances. Unique haplotypes were determined using DnaSP Version 5.10.02 software, and the genetic relations among haplotypes were assessed by constructing a phenogram using the neighbour-joining method Results. A total of 31 haplotypes from 14 freshwater fish species were produced in this study. The read lengths were 626-bp, where 259 sites were polymorphic, 254 sites parsimony informative, and five singletons. No stop codons, deletions, or insertions were observed in any of the sequences. The nucleotide distance between species ranged from 7.1%—between Puntius brevis (Bleeker, 1850) and Poropuntius tawarensis (Weber et de Beaufort, 1916)—to 30.4%—between Channa gachua (Hamilton, 1822) and Homaloptera sp.—indicating that P. brevis and P. tawarensis are very closely related. Conclusion. >This study confirms the utility of COX1 gene in accurate identification of 14 species of freshwater fishes from Lake Laut Tawar, however, three species could not be identified to species level namely Rasbora sp. (local name: relo), Homaloptera sp. (ilie) and Clarias sp. (mud). It is suggested that future studies should incorporate morphometric methods to resolve the taxonomic status of these undetermined species.",

The fish were weighed, and measured and their length–weight relations were determined. Samples were collected during 2009–2010 using four different types of fishing gear (beach seine, fyke nets, barrier trap, and trammel nets; mesh size: 25, 28, and 30 mm) that allowed both adult and juvenile specimens to be captured. Significant length–weight relations were found for all species. The exponent b varied between 2.753 for Pomatoschistus marmoratus and 3.650 for Aphanius fasciatus (mean value = 3.115). The length–weight parameters of the same species may be different in the population because of feeding, reproduction activities and fishing etc. Therefore, we need to know length–weight relations of fish, which are captured in a given place in a certain period of time. Length–weight relations for 5 out of the 29 fish species are presented for the first time from Homa Lagoon in the Turkish Aegean Sea.",

    "abstract": "Background. While some Lessepsian species provide economic benefits for Mediterranean fisheries, others cause economic losses. Lagocephalus sceleratus known as silver-cheeked toadfish poses a great risk to human health if consumed economic losses for fishers by damaging their fishing gears. This study aims to determine the socio-economic impact of silver-cheeked toadfish, with regards to its impact on biodiversity and socio-economic factors for small-scale fisheries. Materials and methods. Face-to-face interviews were completed with a total of 261 fishers from Izmir in the Middle Aegean region to Hatay in the Eastern Mediterranean region, to determine the problems arising from the presence of silver-cheeked toadfish species in the ecosystem and the resulting associated economic losses for a 1-year from 1 January to 30 December 2011. The elements, which should be taken into account in calculating silver-cheeked toadfish related economic losses, are related to fishing gear, labour and the associated losses in catches. However, losses associated with silver-cheeked toadfish predation were beyond the scope of this study. Results. Almost all fishers (91%) agree that silver-cheeked toadfish is a major problem, 82% believe that silver-cheeked toadfish negatively affects biodiversity, and 89% believe it lowers efficiency of their catches. Calculated silver-cheeked toadfish related losses were: 1300 TRY (≈442 EUR) per year, per fisherman; 263 296 TRY (≈89 521 EUR) per year, in total, for the interviewed fishers (261), and 204 fishers suffered economic losses relating to this species; which caused total losses of 6 033 577 TRY (≈2 051 416 EUR) per year in total for the 4719 fishers, which were 78% of all fishers (6051) in the study area. Two-thirds of the study respondents think that the most effective way to battle this problem would be to try to eliminate this species from Turkish waters. Among them, 32% of the fishers believe the most suitable gear to eliminate L. sceleratus from the marine ecosystem is the purse seine and 61% consent to fish L. sceleratus for 4 TRY each as a target species. Conclusion. To start a bounty system and a premium payment for each pufferfish caught will both help to reduce negative impact of the species on the ecosystem and provide an extra income for the fishers.",

    "abstract": "Background. The annular seabream, Diplodus annularis (Linnaeus, 1758), is the most common sparid fish in the Mediterranean Sea. This species is widespread in Tunisia. Despite their economic importance, due to their excellent white and delicate flesh (demersal fish) and their significant size, few studies have hitherto focused on stock discrimination and on the fisheries management. The goal of this research was to evaluate the stock structure of D. annularis for two Tunisian insular populations based on the otolith shape, using different statistical approaches. Materials and methods. The specimens of Diplodus annularis were collected during five months ranging from May through September 2014 at two sites: Djerba and Kerkennah. In total, 120 fish were collected from the two study sites: 60 specimens of each population (30 males and 30 females) and were included in different statistical analyses. The Fourier coefficients were determined to evaluate the degree of similarity in the otoliths and detect the reciprocal variability. Results. By comparing the two studied populations, we revealed statistical significant differences, an asymmetry (left–right), of otoliths (P < 0.05). In the same population, symmetry (left–right) was detected for the males, females of Kerkennah, and females of Djerba. However, an asymmetry was detected only for the males of Djerba. Also, sexual dimorphism was observed only for the Djerba population. Conclusion. The comparison of the otolith morphology of the two populations showed a clear difference in shape and a left–right asymmetry of otoliths. This asymmetry indicates that the two populations belong to different stock of fish. The stocks characterization is considered as an important tool for fisheries management. Further studies are necessary to determine the origin of the otolith shape differences and whether they are related only to environmental conditions or a genetic basis may also be responsible.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the feeding ecology of anchovies in the southern waters of Korea is crucial for improving ecosystem management. However, to date, few studies have examined seasonal changes in the diet of Pacific anchovy, Engraulis japonicus Temminck et Schlegel, 1846, in Korean waters, with the majority of these focusing on the larval and adult stages. The presently reported study provides updates on the feeding habits of E. japonicus off the southern coast of Korea. We analyzed 347 individuals. One-way analysis of similarity was performed to evaluate the differences in diet composition among size classes and seasons of E. japonicus , and correspondence analysis was conducted using the matrix of the percentage by number (% N ) data for prey with occurrence of less than 10% to determine the distribution of prey across all size classes and each season. The diet of E. japonicus was investigated according to season and four size classes. The fork length of these specimens ranged from 5.4 to 14.1 cm. A total of 55 prey taxa of varying sizes between 0.33 mm (diatom Coscinodiscus spp.) and 5.8 mm (fish larvae) were recorded. Anchovies were exclusively planktivorous, and copepods were the most common prey, comprising 82.1% of the identified food items and 84.3% of anchovy stomach contents analyzed. However, their occurrence and abundance varied according to season and Pacific anchovy size class. According to the percentage of the index of relative importance (%IRI), the most important prey items were the copepods Calanus sinicus (48.0%), Paracalanus orientalis (31.7%), bivalve larvae (5.8%), Ditrichocorycaeus affinis (4.2%), and calanoid copepods (2.4%). Analysis of similarities and similarity percentage analysis indicated that a distinct diet of Pacific anchovy in the southern waters of Korea is potentially driven by differences in hydrological conditions. Correspondence analysis revealed that anchovies had the most significant impact on the differences between size classes. The results deepen our understanding of prey species diversity and intraspecific food competition off the southern coast of Korea.",

    "abstract": "Background. The Ganga River (Ganges) is known of its rich fish diversity which is adversely affected by degrading environmental and ecological conditions. There are more than 300 exotic fish species in India. Many of them (particularly Cyprinus carpio) escaped from confinement and are now present in the Ganga River, challenging its ecological equilibrium. The aim of this project was to study the population characteristics of Cyprinus carpio (i.e., the abundance, size range, food and feeding, gonado-somatic index (GSI), gonad maturity stage, maturity and breeding) and the altered fishery dynamics. Materials and methods. The commercially caught fishes, including the exotic ones, were identified, examined and measured. Important indices such as: the abundance index of exotic fishes, the gonado-somatic index (IG), as well as the gonad maturity stage of the escapee C. carpio were determined. The gut content was also analyzed to identify food items and thereafter the food richness, diet breadth, and gut repletion index (GRI%) were calculated using the Simpson's diversity index. Results. C. carpio introduced about sixty years ago for aquaculture has now been found to invade into the Ganga, the largest river of the country contributing significantly to the fishery. The abundance index of C. carpio ranged from 12.2% to 45.5 % in 250 km long river stretch of the Ganga River flowing along Kanpur to Varanasi in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The gut content analysis revealed the presence of Eichhornia (9.8%), Pistia (11.6%), Nymphaea (8.5%), annelids worms (7.8%), algae (20.2%), mud and detritus (14.8%). The calculated diet breadth ranged from 0.82% to 0.91%; food richness ranged from 12 to 16, and the gut repletion index (GRI%) was 100% at different sampling sites. Mature females represented all the six reproductive stages with varying gonado-somatic index (IG) (0.5 to 30) in different catches. Presence of spent, ripe, and mature females was recorded. Conclusion. Abundance of exotic fish primarily C. carpio and Oreochromis niloticus in the fishery of the Ganga River was observed. The gonado-somatic index (IG) and the presence of all the six gonadal stages confirmed that C. carpio established its breeding population. The dominant catch of exotic fishes negatively impacted on the important indigenous fishes particularly Indian major carps (Catla catla,Labeo rohita,and Cirrhinus mrigala). The change in dynamics of the fishery due to the presence of common carp attracted attention to conserve rich indigenous germplasm facing threats of shifting from their natural habitats.",

    "abstract": "Background. The aquarium fish trade is characterized by an enormous number of species. Aquarium fish may have an impact on native biota by means of their invasiveness as well as through pathogen transfer. The Czech Republic has become a gateway for aquatic pets into the European Union. The aims of this study were to identify the most common aquarium fish species on the wholesale market, to estimate temperature suitability for seasonal (winter and summer) survival in the EU, and also to assess the invasiveness risk of the most common aquarium fishes with the strongest temperature matching. Materials and methods. Data on aquarium fish species, their origin, and availability from producers and traders based in the Czech Republic were collected based on all available sources. The target area was defined as all member states of the EU. Estimation of the temperature suitability for each species was done using Climatch 1.0 software. The Freshwater Fish Invasiveness Screening Kit (FISK) was employed for species with temperature suitability within the target area exceeding 10% in the coldest quarter of the year. Results. In total, 1118 fish species representing 51 families were identified. Thirty-three species belonging to 13 families were classified as &#8220;very common&#8221;. Three sources of origin were identified: domestic production within the EU, farm production outside the EU, and wild harvests in the region of origin. The major suppliers outside the EU are in south-east Asia. Only one common species originated from wild harvests. FISK scoring divided the 11 species evaluated as having the strongest temperature suitability in the EU (TSEU) into seven species bearing medium risk and four species representing high risk. The family Cyprinidae was the most frequently represented among all evaluated taxa (seven species), but the majority of high-risk fishes belonged to the family Poeciliidae (three species). The highest score was earned by Carassius auratus (Linnaeus, 1758). Conclusion. The risk potential of aquarium fishes most traded in the EU seems to be not alarming. Attention should be focused on the possibility of novel pathogen transfer to native aquatic biota as an important aspect of regulating the aquarium fish trade.",

    "abstract": "Background. At the end of 1980s, ecological regime shifts occurred in the Baltic. Since, the Baltic fish assemblage has been dominated by sprats, whereas before cod was the dominant fish species. The majority of previous food studies refer to the period before the shift. This raises the question, how changes in the Baltic ecosystem have affected the diet of cod. The aim of the presently reported study was to identify the differences in the food composition of cod depending on the area, depth, season, and the cod size and compare it with the findings from the 1970s and 1980s. Materials and methods. Food composition and selection of prey size for Baltic cod was evaluated by examining the stomach contents of 556 adult cod, collected in 2006 and 2007. Fish stomachs were sampled from research catches within the Polish Exclusive Economic Zone. Results. The main component of the cod diet were the clupeids, constituting more than 67% of the total weight of the food recovered from the specimens studied. Other fishes in the diet represented Gobiidae, Ammodytidae, as well as young cod. The dominant invertebrate in the diet was the isopod Saduria entomon which accounted for 13% of the diet by weight. The weight proportion of larger fish, such as herring, Clupea harengus (L.), and cod, increased with the cod size, while the proportion of small- and medium-sized fish (sprats, gobies) decreased. The food composition of cod varied seasonally. The weight proportion of European sprat, Sprattus sprattus (L.), was much higher in winter (55%) than in fall (27%), while the proportion of cod in the diet was higher in the fall (10%) than in winter (4%). The proportion of sprat in the diet increased with depth, while that of Ammodytidae and Gobiidae showed a decreasing trend. At depths greater than 40 m, the proportion of invertebrates in cod stomachs decreased. This study demonstrated a significant area effect for sprat; year effect for sprat and Saduria entomon; a seasonal effect for young cod and S. entomon; and a depth effect for sprat, young cod, and S. entomon. The occurrences of herring and small cod increased in the stomach as the predator increased, while no significant relation was found for sprat and S. entomon. The data collected do not indicate that cod select a specific size of sprat or herring, though cod were found to use size selection for S. entomon and juvenile cod. Conclusion. The food composition of cod has undergone certain changes compared to results of Załachowski (1977, 1985), which covered the 1970s and 1980s. Currently, the proportion of clupeids in the food is approximately 67% (in weight), while during the 1977–1982 it was in the range of 25%–50% depending on cod length. In 2006 and 2007 sprat was the main cod diet component rather than herring.",

    "abstract": "Background. The bogue, Boops boops (Linnaeus, 1758); large-eye dentex, Dentex macrophthalmus (Bloch, 1791); common two-banded seabream, Diplodus vulgaris (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1817); and axillary seabream, Pagellus acarne (Risso, 1827) are four commercially important sparid species which are distributed in the Mediterranean. Although they are very common in the Mediterranean, information regarding; growth, length at first maturity, and age are scarce and variable. This study provides some of the first data on the above-mentioned biological parameters of these four sparid species for the Turkish coasts of the Aegean Sea (Mediterranean). The aim of the present study is to expand our knowledge on the biology of these commercial sparid species from the Aegean Sea. Materials and methods. Fish samples were collected between July 2004 and June 2007 by R/V Egesüf from İzmir Bay. Demersal trawl samplings were carried out by a traditional trawl net with a 5 m codend (600 mesh circumference at the codend) and made of knotted polyethylene material with 40 mm mesh size netting. Results. The length–weight relations determined in the course of this study were: W = 0.005L3.25 (bogue), W = 0.005L3.03 (large-eye dentex), W = 0.007L3.31 (common two-banded seabream), and W = 0.009L3.14 (axillary seabream). The respective L¥ and k parameters of von Bertalanffy growth equation were: 29.58 and 0.266 for bogue; 24.3 and 0.399 for large-eye dentex; 28.0 and 0.253 for common two-banded seabream; and 22.7 and 0.315 for axillary seabream. Furthermore, lengths at first maturity were determined as: 12.96 (♀) and 9.35 (♂) cm for bogue; 10.83 (♀) and 11.77 (♂) cm for large-eye dentex; 12.87 (♀) and 13.37 (♂) cm for common two-banded seabream; and 14.45 (♀) and 13.91 (♂) cm for axillary seabream. Conclusion. The presently determined parameters of age, growth, reproduction, and mortality of these four species will be useful for estimating the relevant parameters of population dynamics and will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of the long-term changes of the stock sizes.",

    "abstract": "Background. The &lsquo;Lessepsian migration&rsquo; is a unidirectional phenomenon of successful biotic colonisation from the Red Sea into the eastern Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal. In this study, 45 Lessepsian marine fish species were screened for their potential invasiveness in the south-western coasts of Anatolia (Mu&#287;la region, Turkey), with the aim to inform policy makers on proper management and control measures. Materials and methods. Species were screened with the Aquatic Species Invasiveness Screening Kit (AS-ISK) for their potential invasiveness in the south- western coasts of Anatolia&mdash;the Risk Assessment (RA) area. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the predictive ability of AS-ISK to discriminate between the Lessepsian fish species posing a high risk and those posing a medium risk of being invasive for the RA area. The following species were studied: Alepes djedaba, Apogonichthyoides pharaonis, Atherinomorus forskalii, Bregmaceros nectabanus, Callionymus filamentosus, Champsodon nudivittis, Champsodon vorax, Cynoglossus sinusarabici, Dussumieria elopsoides, Equulites klunzingeri, Etrumeus golanii, Fistularia commersonii, Hemiramphus far, Herklotsichthys punctatus, Jaydia queketti, Jaydia smithi, Lagocephalus guentheri, Lagocephalus sceleratus, Lagocephalus spadiceus, Lagocephalus suezensis, Liza carinata, Nemipterus randalli, Ostorhinchus fasciatus, Oxyurichthys petersii, Parupeneus forsskali, Pelates quadrilineatus, Pempheris rhomboidea, Pomadasys stridens, Pteragogus pelycus, Pterois miles, Rachycentron canadum, Sargocentron rubrum, Saurida lessepsianus, Scomberomorus commerson, Siganus luridus, Siganus rivulatus, Sillago suezensis, Sphyraena chrysotaenia, Sphyraena flavicauda, Stephanolepis diaspros, Torquigener flavimaculosus, Trachurus indicus, Upeneus moluccensis, Upeneus pori, Vanderhorstia mertensi. Results. BRA and BRA + CCA thresholds of 18.5 and 29.5, respectively, were identified that reliably distinguished between potentially invasive (high risk) and potentially non-invasive (medium or low risk) species. Based on both thresholds, 14 species were categorised as high risk (amongst which devil firefish, Pterois miles, was the highest-scoring one), 28 as medium risk, and one as low risk. The CCA resulted in an increase from the BRA score for 42 (93.3%) of the screened species, and 12 of these achieved the highest possible (positive) change in BRA + CCA score of 12 points. Conclusion. The thresholds set in the presently reported study for risk of invasiveness of the Lessepsian fishes under study in the south- western coasts of Anatolia can be transferred to other AS-ISK based applications in other RA areas in case of small sample sizes. The outcomes of this study will be of use to fish biologists, fisheries scientists and environmental managers/stakeholders in a joint effort to ensure better conservation and management actions with regard to the role of Lessepsian fishes in the RA area.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the reproductive biology of fishes is crucial to making accurate and scientifically sound recommendations for fisheries management. The presently reported study is the first to report the reproductive characteristics of the data-deficient and recently described yellowfin snapper, Lutjanus xanthopinnis Iwatsuki, Tanaka et Allen, 2015, collected from the eastern South China Sea, Malaysia. A total of 572 fish specimens were sampled monthly from March 2022 to April 2023 using a gillnet and a trawl net. Subsequently, these specimens were measured and weighed. Their total length (TL) ranged from 15.3 to 26.8 cm (19.25 ± 2.04 cm; mean ± SD). Their body weight ( W B ) ranged from 53.5 g to 279.7 g (114.5 ± 40.3 g; mean ± SD). For the reproductive biology study, the following parameters were determined: the sex ratio, gonadosomatic index (GSI), hepatosomatic index (HSI), spawning period, fecundity, condition factor ( K ), length at maturity, and the gonadal maturity stages. In the sex ratio, males (M) were significantly dominant over females (F) (M:F = 1:0.75) ( χ 2 = 11.18). Consequently, the monthly mean GSI of pooled sex revealed a consistent trend from January to August, indicating spawning seasons with peak periods in March and April. The batch fecundity of 67 mature females (16.0–25.2 cm TL; 64.5– 279.3 g W ), was determined to range from 16 405 to 94 357 oocytes. The fecundity increased with gonad weight in contrast to weight and length. The length at first maturity of females and males was 14.53 and 20.56 cm, respectively. Females matured earlier than males. Macroscopic and histological examination of gonads revealed monthly variation in the ratio of gonad stages for males and females. This study offers crucial data on the reproductive biology of L. xanthopinnis , which will help with sustainable fishery management in this area and can be used as a reference for the management of similar fish populations in other regions of the world.",

    "abstract": "The southern Java waters are characterized by a strong upwelling process, making the region a potential hotspot for fishing activities, including the largehead hairtail, Trichiurus lepturus Linnaeus, 1758. This study provides data on various aspects of T. lepturus in the southern Java waters, including reproductive biology, growth parameters, mortality rates, spawning potential ratio (SPR), and yield per recruit ( Y/R ). The results are intended to help sustain the management of T. lepturus fisheries in the southern Java waters. A total of 19 587 fish specimens were collected monthly between January 2019 and December 2021 from fishermen’s catches in the southern Java waters at the Palabuhanratu Archipelago Fishing Port, West Java Province, Indonesia. The data collected involved information on length, weight, sex, and gonads. Length-frequency data were analyzed using various fisheries assessment models. A length–weight relationship follows a positive allometric growth pattern. The sex ratio was slightly female-biased. Gonadal maturity stages (GMS) and the gonadosomatic index (GSI) indicated a prolonged spawning period. The length at first maturity ( L m50 ) males and females was estimated at 84.5 cm and 77.0 cm, respectively. The von Bertalanffy growth equation of T. lepturus in southern Java waters is L t = 131.67(1 – e –0.22( t + 0.5094) ). Total mortality ( Z ), natural mortality ( M ), and fishing mortality ( F ) were 1.60 year −1 , 0.44 year −1 , and 1.16 year −1 , respectively. The spawning potential ratio (SPR) was 26%, and the yield per recruit ( Y / R ) analysis suggested that the current fishing effort is above the maximum sustainable yield level. Trichiurus lepturus in southern Java waters is experiencing high fishing pressure, which may compromise its reproductive potential and long-term sustainability. Management measures should be implemented to regulate the fishing effort and ensure the sustainable exploitation of this vital fishery resource.",

The total length (TL), standard length (SL), and body weight (BW) were determined for each fish individual to the nearest 0.1 cm and 0.1 g, respectively. All LLR and LWR parameters of 23 fish species were statistically significant ( P &amp;lt; 0.001). The length–weight relations of 17 species have not previously been available in FishBase. Moreover, we provided a new distribution record of fish ( Rasbora atridorsalis ). Our study provided LWR values for the first time, which will help validate the accuracy and predictability of Bayesian models in estimating species-specific growth parameters for data-poor species. The majority of the LWR relations obtained in this study are new to this region. The availability of species- and region-specific data on length–weight relations could help inform future research and management of these species.",

Biotic components grown in the area amass such metals within their body through nutritional uptake and accumulation. The present investigation was carried out to study the extent of accumulation of different waste metals in tissues of cichlids commonly cultured in composite industrial wastewater-fed fishponds (Bheris) in East Calcutta Wetlands (ECW), a Ramsar site in India. Materials and methods. AAS studies were employed to estimate metal (Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, and Pb) concentrations in water, and bottom sediment of fishponds and fish tissues (gill, liver, muscle, and bones) of cichlids: Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus L. and Mozambique tilapia, O. mossambicus (Peters, 1852), collected from contaminated and control sites. Results. The concentrations of metals in bottom sediment were found higher than those of the overlying water. It was evident from the experiment that, either bone or liver was the site of maximum accumulation for the elements while muscles were the site of least metal accumulation in both fish species. Chromium, which was a highly publicised contaminant of tannery effluents, showed a similar distribution pattern (muscle < gill < liver < bone) in these fishes. Concentrations of non-essential metals like Pb were highest in Nile tilapia liver (17.9 mg&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;kg-1) followed by Mozambique tilapia liver (14.7 mg&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;kg-1). Principal component analysis with Varimax rotation revealed that Fe and Mn were in the first and second component, respectively, to influence metal uptake and bioaccumulation. Conclusion. Tissue-specific and species-specific patterns of metal concentration and partitioning were apparent from our experimentation. Dendrograms showed two definite clustering pattern, gill and muscle in one cluster with bone and liver in the other, two important organs so far as partitioning (in bone) and detoxification (in liver) were concerned.",

Despite the importance of Lake Tanganyika&rsquo;s biodiversity for science and the livelihoods of the riparian people, high-resolution surveys of the fish biodiversity are sparse and fragmentary, especially along the western (Congolese) shoreline. The coast suffers locally from intensive human activities and lacks adequate protective measures or nature reserves. However, in view of the intra-lacustrine endemism of this fish fauna, conservation needs to be managed lake-wide at a fine scale, necessitating detailed inventories on fish species distribution. The study aims at updating knowledge on fish diversity and distribution along the north-western and central western shores of Lake Tanganyika. Materials and methods. Fish specimens were collected using gill- and seine nets, by snorkelling and SCUBA diving, and through purchases on the local markets. Results. Over 28 locations were sampled, and 84 cichlid- and 30 non-cichlid fish species (belonging to Protopteridae, Clupeidae, Cyprinidae, Alestidae, Claroteidae, Clariidae, Malapteruridae, Mochokidae, Poeciliidae, Latidae, and Mastacembelidae) collected. Conclusion. Our records substantially expand the known range of fish species in a range of habitats. As numerous specimens are hard to assign to nominal species, a taxonomic revision of a number of genera is underway. It should take into account intraspecific geographic variation.",

    "abstract": "Background. Phytase produced by gut bacteria increases the availability of phosphorus and other important nutrients in ruminants by virtue of enzymatic hydrolysis of the phytic acid, an antinutritional factor present in the majority of plant feedstuffs. This topic, however, has been insufficiently investigated in fish. This study was intended: to evaluate the presence of phytase-producing autochthonous bacteria in the gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of 14 freshwater teleost fishes; and to identify the most promising phytase-producing strains by phenotypic characterization and 16S rDNA. Materials and methods. The GI tracts were removed and divided into proximal (PI) and distal (DI) intestine. Homogenates of intestinal segments were spread onto sterilized tryptone soya agar and modified phytase screening media (MPSM) plates to determine autochthonous culturable heterotrophic and phytase-producing microbiota, respectively. Data were presented as log viable counts (LVC) g-1 intestine. Out of 95 phytase-producing isolates, primarily selected 32 isolates were studied for phytase-assay using MPSM broth. Promising phytase-producing isolates were evaluated for other exo-enzymes (amylase, cellulase, protease, lipase) using 4 selective media. Two most promising phytase-producing isolates were identified by phenotypic characterization and 16S rDNA. Results. Population of heterotrophic bacteria was highest (LVC = 8.29 g-1 intestine) in the DI of Gudusia chapra followed by DI of Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (LVC = 6.82 g-1 intestine). However, more than log 4 reduction of the phytase-producing bacteria was observed compared to heterotrophic bacteria. Phytase-producing microbiota was highest in the PI of G. chapra (LVC = 3.95 g-1 intestine) followed by PI of Labeo calbasu (LVC = 3.78 g-1 intestine). The strain LB1.4 isolated from DI of Labeo bata showed highest phytase activity (2.33 ± 0.006 U · mL–1) followed by the strain GC1.2 (2.19 ± 0.018 U · mL–1) isolated from PI of G. chapra. Both isolates were efficient in producing other exo-enzymes. Phenotypic characterization and nucleotide homology analysis revealed that the isolates LB1.4 and GC1.2 were similar to Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus atrophaeus, respectively. Conclusion. Autochthonous phytate degrading bacteria were present in the GI tract of fish that might endow ecological advantages to overcome the anti-nutritional effects of plant phytate.",

    "abstract": "Background. Traditional Chinese herbs (TCHs) are widely used for improving non-specific immunity of fish in aquaculture. Possible effects of many important TCH on red drum, Sciaenops ocellatus (Linnaeus, 1766), have not been adequately studied. The aim of the presently reported study was to investigate the effects of ten TCH on selected immunological- and haematological responses of red drum. Materials and methods. >Ten TCH preparations, consisting of selected parts of plants and fungi, known in medicinal practice as: Astragalus membranaceus, fructus forsythiae, Polyporus umbellatus, Scutellaria baicalensis, Wolfiporia extensa, rhizoma coptidis, radix glycyrrhizae, flos lonicerae japonicae, isatidis radix, and bupleuri radix were used in the experiment. A dose of 10 g of each TCH was decocted and concentrated, then mixed with the diets (mixed diets) at ratio of 2%. After 28 days of feeding, the fish were infected with Vibrio splendidus and observed for 14 days for possible mortalities. Leukocyte phagocytic activity and lysozyme activity (LZM) were measured on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35. Relative percentage survival (RPS) of each TCH treatment was also investigated after the fish exposure to V. splendidus. Results. Red drum fed 2% doses of individual TCH extracts significantly (P &#60; 0.05) increased its: phagocytic percentage (PP) (with the exception of flos lonicerae japonicae treatment), phagocytic index (PI) (with the exception of flos lonicerae japonicae- and bupleuri radix treatments), LZM (with the exception of Wolfiporia extensa treatment), and RPS (with the exception of P. umbellatus, Wolfiporia extensa-, radix glycyrrhizae-, flos lonicerae japonicae-, isatidis radix-, and bupleuri radix treatments). The indexes of PP, PI, and LZM, for all experimental groups, decreased quickly on day 35 (7 days after TCH diets were discontinued). On the other hand, PP values were significantly (P &#60; 0.05) higher than in control (with the exception of flos lonicerae japonicae- and Wolfiporia extensa treatments). Also PI values were significantly higher (P &#60; 0.05) than in control (with the exception of flos lonicerae japonicae-, Wolfiporia extensa-, and bupleuri radix treatments). LZM values exhibited no significant difference (P &#62; 0.05) in all treatment groups compared with control. Most importantly, the A. membranaceus-, or S. baicalensis-, or fructus forsythiae-fed groups were significantly protected (P &#60; 0.01) against V. splendidus challenge compared to control. RPS of A. membranaceus- and S. baicalensis groups were the highest, reaching 88.9% on day 28, followed by the fructus forsythiae group, whereas bupleuri radix- and Wolfiporia extensa treatments showed the lowest values. Conclusion. A. membranaceus, S. baicalensis, and fructus forsythiae were effective in preventing red drum from acquiring the disease while challenged by V. splendidus.",

    "abstract": "Pescatourism is a relatively new concept of merging tourism with fisheries. Its intention is to supplement incomes of fishermen and their families in the situation of declining living resources of the sea and to provide an attractive activity for tourists visiting the sea coast. Pescatourism should be considered different activity from fisheries tourism, or recreational fishing (including charter fishing), which usually denote angling. It also contributes to the education of the society and public awareness about the state and problems of the marine sector, including ecosystems, and experiencing the traditional fishing culture. This new activity first stared in Italy in 1982 and soon spread to other Mediterranean countries. Pescatourism can be considered a branch of sustainable tourism and an activity parallel to agrotourism. This essay provides an overview of pescatourism (and related activities) in European countries (Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Cyprus, Germany) with additional examples from elsewhere. Chances for implementing pescatourism in other countries are analysed (Turkey, Algeria, Poland). Despite all these positive features, it can easily be a commercial activity which does not provide any benefits to fishers and sustainability of marine living resources if the licence right is given to charter operators rather than to fishers.",

    "abstract": "Background. The East Kolkata Wetlands in India (a Ramsar site) are sewage-fed, nutrient-rich water bodies successfully used for fish production. The vermiculated sailfin catfish, Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus (Weber, 1991), exotic to India, has invaded these wetlands. The management and control of this catfish has been hindered, because of the lack of information on its abundance, population structure, biological traits, level of establishment, and competition with native fish species. Materials and methods. Within 2013–2015 studies were carried out on the population structure of P. disjunctivus, its food habits, reproductive biology, and initial impacts in the wetlands through monthly and seasonal collection of samples, examination of food items, reproductive parameters, catch data, and gathering fishers experience. Results. The length (TL) and weight of the specimens ranged from 10 to 55 cm and from 120 to 1250 g, respectively. Major food items of the catfish were detrital matter (%IRI 56), unidentified plant matter (%IRI 11), fish eggs (%IRI 11), polychaete worms (%IRI 5), and other minor items (%IRI 0.3 to 4). At 50% similarity, the food items of P. disjunctivus overlapped with that of Macrognathus pancalus, Channa punctata, Nandus nandus, Anabas testudineus, Clarias batrachus, Oreochromis niloticus, Cirrhinus mrigala, and Cyprinus carpio while at 80% it overlapped with that of C. mrigala and C. carpio. The fecundity of P. disjunctivus, in the wetlands, was the highest recorded for the species. Females attained the first maturity at 24 cm TL and reproduced multiple times within July–November. The breeding period of the species overlapped with 13 native fish species, of which it seriously overlapped with that of Gudusia chapra, Amblypharyngodon mola, Pethia conchonius, P. ticto, N. nandus, C. punctata, and A. testudineus. The sailfin catfish has established reproducing populations in the wetlands and reached 'invasive' proportions constituting 4.83% (300.04 t · year–1) of the mean annual fish catch (6203.85 t · year–1) from the wetlands. The invasive risk assessment showed a high risk of the species in the current scenario and probable climate change scenarios in future in the region. Conclusion. Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus has successfully colonized the sensitive East Kolkata Wetlands, which might easily spread to neighbouring water bodies including the sensitive Ganga River and Sundarban mangroves and cause ecological and economic disturbance unless preventive measures are taken as the species has high invasive risk in the region.",

The purpose of this research was to estimate the size at sexual maturity ( L m ) for 20 fish species belongs to 14 families from a wetland (Gajner Beel ) ecosystem in the north-western (NW) Bangladesh through multi-models such as length ( L max ) based empirical model, gonadosomatic index (GSI)-based model, and logistic model using commercial catches from January to December 2018. Also, we assessed the L m in other water-bodies worldwide. Specimens’ total length (TL) was noted up to 0.1 cm using measuring board body weight (BW) and gonad weight (GW) weighed by digital electronic balance with 0.01 g accuracy. To assess the L m , maximum body length ( L max ) based empirical model; the relation between TL (total length in cm) vs. GSI (gonadosomatic index in %); and a logistic model were considered. The minimum L m was 4.64, 3.90, and 4.15 cm for Chanda nama Hamilton, 1822 and the maximum was 25.33, 24.50, and 24.70 cm for Channa striata (Bloch, 1793) through L max , GSI, and logistic-based models, respectively. From these three models, the minimum mean L m was 4.23 cm for C. nama and the maximum was 24.84 cm for C. striata . The L m with 50.0% species was in 8.80 cm TL. We also calculated the L m from different bodies of water based on L max . This study was generated data of 17 new L m among 20 species, which are globally absent. Therefore, the study will help develop sustainable management strategies, conservation through the implementation of mesh size based on the size at sexual maturity ( L m ).",

The immuno-modulating effects on rainbow trout of short- and long-term feeding using dry feed with inclusion of beta-glucan (0.2%) have therefore been evaluated. Materials and methods. The immune reactivity was assessed by measuring susceptibility to I.multifiliisinfections and plasma lysozyme in the host, factors which are considered innate response parameters. Rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss(Walbaum, 1792) (Actinopterygii: Salmoniformes: Salmonidae),were fed (control feed or glucan-containing feed) for 14 or 35 days before challenge (exposure to infective I. multifiliis theronts) and the resulting infection (number of trophonts in the skin) was recorded on day 11 post-exposure to theronts. Results. All fish obtained infection following parasite exposure but glucan-fed fish showed a lower infection at day 46 compared to fish fed control-feed. The lysozyme activity of fish plasma was evaluated throughout the experimental period and found slightly but significantly increased in association with glucan-feeding at day 14, 17, and 46. Conclusion. No evidence for an exhaustion of these selected innate response parameters due to prolonged glucan-feeding could be detected within the experimental period of 46 days.",

    "abstract": "Background. Sturgeons have long been extinct in Polish inland waters. A substantial effort has recently been put into their restitution, covering the drainage areas of two major Polish rivers, the Oder and the Vistula. The stocked fishes are clinically healthy, but very little is known about their potential to transmit viral diseases including koi herpes virus (KHV) to healthy fishes of other species, which may pose a threat to the disease-free zones. This study was intended to determine if sturgeons could be asymptomatic carriers of KHV. Materials and methods. A total of 29 sturgeons (two species; length 8&ndash;37 cm) originating from fish farms in northern Poland with a known KHV history in common carp or koi in the area were examined: 15 Russian sturgeons, Acipenser gueldenstaedtii, with clinical signs of a disease and 14 asymptomatic Atlantic sturgeons, A. oxyrinchus. The former were sent to the laboratory alive while the latter were sent fixed in ethanol. As it is required for detection of a latent KHV infection in acipenserids, two independent procedures were applied. The preliminary results were obtained using PCR. Those findings were subsequently confirmation by nested PCR. The latter procedure consists of sequence analysis of PCR products and direct detection of KHV infected cells in tissue materials by in-situ hybridization on nucleic acid level or indirect immunofluorescence on KHV protein level. Results. KHV genome parts were found in nine Russian sturgeons and four Atlantic sturgeons. Comparison of PCR results obtained from three primer pairs used for KHV diagnostic in sturgeon showed that those designed by Bercovier et al. were most sensitive and robust for this purpose. In order to confirm the presence of viral particles the most useful method was in-situ hybridization (ISH), allowing the detection of KHV in gill samples obtained from live sturgeons. Conclusion. This preliminary study shows that sturgeons can be carriers of KHV. Therefore a viral diagnostics is highly recommended not only for sturgeons obtained from the environment but also for fertilized eggs, fry, and fish intended for re-stocking measurements of inland waters.",

    "abstract": "Background. Fish pond management can substantially modify the hydrological regime and ecological quality of receiving waters (usually rivers, canals, and ponds downstream in an interconnected system) with potentially positive or negative impacts on watershed functioning. To evaluate these effects with respect to carp pond management, the environmental impacts of semi-intensive farming on discharged water quality were monitored at four differently managed carp ponds, differing in trophic status (two eutrophic and two hypertrophic ponds). Materials and methods. Fundamental determinants of pond inflow and outflow water quality were monitored monthly from April to October 2009. Water temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen concentration and saturation were measured in situ whilst hydrochemical and microbiological parameters were assessed in the laboratory. Results. Compared to the inflow water, in the effluents there was a significant decline in numbers of bacterial loading indicators (Escherichia coli, enterococci, faecal coliform and mesophilic bacteria) in the outflow water. In ponds with the poor quality inflow water (downstream of water treatment plant discharges), a significant decrease was also registered in nutrients (N-NH4, N-NO3, total nitrogen, P-PO4, and total phosphorus) and organic loads? (five-day biological oxygen demand, chemical oxygen demand) of pond effluents. At the pond supplied with good quality river water, however, the same determinants showed that effluent water quality worsened significantly. Total organic carbon and suspended solids increased in effluents of ponds with high fish biomass stocked. Conclusion. The results demonstrate that, during the growing season, properly managed carp ponds represent ecosystems with high self-cleaning ability. They may play an important role in the nutrient balance, storage and trapping in agricultural landscape with high population density.",

    "abstract": "Background. The paternal mouthbrooding Banggai cardinalfish, Pterapogon kauderni Koumans 1933, has an exceptionally restricted endemic range for a marine fish, is traded internationally as a marine ornamental and listed as endangered in the IUCN Red List. This paper aims to contribute to the body of knowledge regarding the biology of this species, based on studies on the endemic population in the Banggai Archipelago and the introduced population in Palu Bay, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia. Materials and methods. Length frequency data collected over the period 2004–2012 (n = 23230) were analysed using the ELEFAN approach (FiSAT software). A length–weight relation was derived from measurements of 1002 individuals from the Banggai Archipelago. Specimens from the Palu Bay population were used to study reproductive parameters (n = 80), morphometric relations (n = 54) and feeding habits (n = 30). Results. The ELEFAN analysis suggested an annual recruitment peak (September to December) and VBGF parameter estimates of L∞ = 7.1 cm (SL), K = 0.74 year–1 and t0 = –0.11 year, suggesting first maturity at 1 year, and longevity of 3–5 years. Total mortality (Z) and natural mortality (M) estimates of 4.4 year–1 and 2.2 year–1 yielded fishing mortality F = 2.2 year–1 and exploitation rate E = 0.5. Length–weight relation parameters were: a = 0.18; b = 2.15. There was no significant morphological difference between sexes. Gonad maturation began at 2.9–3.5 cm SL, all specimens ≥ 4.2 cm SL were sexually mature. Mean observed fecundity (59, n = 21) and number of eggs brooded by males (59, n = 17) were similar. Observed sex ratio was 1.67 males per female. Gut content indicated an omnivorous, predominantly carnivorous diet. Copepods and decapod larvae were the most abundant components in adult (SL ≥ 4.2 cm) and sub-adult (SL ≤ 4.2 cm) diets respectively. Adult diet appeared to be more varied. No empty guts were observed. Conclusion. This study provides data for a major reassessment of Pterapogon kauderni life history parameters in FishBase, the global database of fishes. P. kauderni spawning is associated with the lunar cycle; the seasonal recruitment peak is probably related to improved reproductive success during the calm season. With strong indications of a decline in the endemic population due to habitat degradation and loss (independent of fishing pressure), current exploitation levels may be unsustainable. Research is required to further refine life-history parameters (e.g. sex ratio) and elucidate issues such as fasting in brooding male Banggai cardinalfish and ontogenetic differences in diet.",

    "abstract": "Background. Prussian carp, Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782), is one of the successful invaders of freshwater systems of Turkey. Although, Prussian carp has rapidly expanded its area of distribution in Anatolia during the last two decades, there is limited information about its biological features in new environments. In order to determine the impact of invasive species on ecosystem, the life history characteristics of an exotic fish species in different locations should be monitored. The presently reported study provides information about the growth and reproduction of Prussian carp introduced into a reservoir in Central Anatolia. Materials and methods. Age, growth, and reproduction of Prussian carp were studied during a 3-year period in Gelingüllü Reservoir, Kızılırmak River Basin. A total of 344 specimens were caught by gill nets. Age was determined from scales. Length–weight relation, von Bertalanffy equation, and specific growth rate were used to evaluate the fish growth. In order to assess growth and reproduction patterns, fecundity, GSI, and variations in oocyte size were determined. Results. Both males and females reached a maximum age of 5+ years. Fork length was 6–27 cm in males and 5.6–26.8 cm in females. Both sexes matured during their second year of life (1+ year). In the Gelingüllü Reservoir population the males were predominant¾the overall sex ratio was 1.39 : 1 (193 males to 139 females) and differed significantly from unity. The von Bertalanffy growth equation was Lt = 32.17 (1 – e–0.232(t – 0.094)) cm for males and Lt = 36.03 (1 – e–0.212(t – 0.205)) cm for females. Growth in length was approximately 70% in males and 85% in females during the first year of life. The somatic condition of the fish increased markedly during late spring and summer. A prolonged spawning period was observed from April to August. Maximum egg diameter was 1.51 mm and maximum absolute fecundity was 174 000 oocytes. Conclusion. Compared to previously published data, the studied Prussian carp population was characterized by more rapid growth during the first year of life, earlier maturity, higher fecundity, and a shorter life span. These life history characteristics are typical of invasive species.",

    "abstract": "Background. Assessing patterns in habitat utilization and changes in the composition of biont assemblages is a key tool for efficient ecosystem conservation planning and management. Nevertheless, habitat use patterns by juvenile fish still need more comprehension. Therefore, the presently reported study investigated relations between the type of nursery ground and the structure juvenile fish assemblages in a tropical coastal area of the south-western Atlantic. Materials and methods. From December 2009 to November 2010, we conducted monthly sampling of ichthyofauna in two habitat types (mangrove and sandy beach) used as nursery grounds by juvenile fish of the south-western Atlantic. Species richness and abundance were used to identify spatial and temporal patterns in the distribution of fish assemblages throughout habitats' dynamics. Results. A total of 845 fishes representing 16 families and 34 species were found during the presently reported study: Albula vulpes (Linnaeus, 1758); Atherinella brasiliensis (Quoy et Gaimard, 1825); Strongylura marina (Walbaum, 1792); Tylosurus acus acus (Lacepède, 1803); Caranx crysos (Mitchill, 1815); Caranx latus Agassiz, 1831; Oligoplites saurus (Bloch et Schneider, 1801); Selene setapinnis (Mitchill, 1815); Selene vomer (Linnaeus, 1758); Centropomus parallelus Poey, 1860; Centropomus undecimalis (Bloch, 1792); Harengula clupeola (Cuvier, 1829); Opisthonema oglinum (Lesueur, 1818); Anchoa tricolor (Spix et Agassiz, 1829); Anchovia clupeoides (Swainson, 1839); Diapterus auratus Ranzani, 1842; Diapterus rhombeus (Cuvier, 1829); Eucinostomus argenteus Baird et Girard, 1855; Eucinostomus gula (Quoy et Gaimard, 1824); Eucinostomus melanopterus (Bleeker, 1863); Bathygobius soporator (Valenciennes, 1837); Conodon nobilis (Linnaeus, 1758); Haemulon plumierii (Lacepède, 1801); Haemulopsis corvinaeformis (Steindachner, 1868); Hemiramphus brasiliensis (Linnaeus, 1758); Lutjanus apodus (Walbaum, 1792); Lutjanus griseus (Linnaeus, 1758); Lutjanus jocu (Bloch et Schneider, 1801); Mugil brevirostris (Ribeiro, 1915); Mugil curema Valenciennes, 1836; Mugil curvidens Valenciennes, 1836; Paralichthys tropicus Ginsburg, 1933; Sphyraena barracuda (Edwards, 1771); Sphoeroides testudineus (Linnaeus, 1758). No significant differences in species richness and total abundance were found between habitats and seasons. Nevertheless, our analyses showed that distinct sets of species use these areas. Moreover, we identified a strong relation between the rainfall and the species turnover in both habitats studied. Conclusion. Diversity of nursery grounds in coastal areas not only increases fish diversity but also plays an important role in the sustaining fish stocks.",

Therefore, P. erythrinus is a valuable component of the commercial fishery in Tunisia and plays an important role in microeconomics of local areas. The goal of this study was to investigate the stock structure and otolith asymmetry for specimens of the common pandora sampled from two lagoons—Ghar El Melh and Bizerte. Materials and methods. We collected a total of 119 specimens of P. erythrinus from the two lagoons, from May through July 2016. The Elliptical Fourier Analysis (EFA) was determined to evaluate the degree of similarity in the otoliths and detect the reciprocal variability. Results. The Discriminant Factor Analysis for the sagitta shape clearly demonstrated an asymmetry when comparing otoliths (left–right) (P < 0.05) within each population and a difference in shape when comparing the same side between the two populations: between the two sides (right–right and left–left). Conclusion. The comparison of the otolith morphology of the two populations showed a clear difference in shape and a left–right asymmetry of otoliths between and within populations. This result is probably related to genetic and local environmental factors. In fact, this investigation improves the knowledge on the stock discrimination for P. erythrinus and provides useful information for analysing fisheries management of this species in Tunisia.",

    "abstract": "Background. Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), which act in a similar way to natural hormones, lead to disorders of the endocrine system in animals and humans (endocrine disruptors). Among food products, fish are considered to be the main source of these compounds in the human diet, posing a health risk to consumers. The aim of this study was to determine concentrations in fish and their environment of certain organochlorine pesticides in fish and their environment and to estimate daily intakes (EDI) of individual pesticides from the fish examined. Materials and methods. Analyses aimed at detecting the pesticides (OCPs: a-, b-, g-HCH, heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, aldrin, dieldrin, and endrin) included samples of water taken from the lower stretch of the Oder River and three fish species, which are commonly harvested in that area. Quantitative analyses were carried out using the Capillary Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry method in a GC MSD HP 6890/5973 apparatus. Results. The study found that concentrations of OCPs in fish gonads were significantly higher than in the muscle tissue. The dominant pesticide compound in gonads of roach and bream was g-HCH, whilst b-HCH predominated in the muscle tissues of those fishes. Endrin, on the other hand was the major pesticide in the muscle tissue of ide. Mean concentrations of OCPs in the gonads ranged from 0.385 to 0.544 ng· g–1 wet weight (w.w.) for a-HCH, 0.745 to 0.832 ng· g–1 w.w. for g-HCH, 0.479 to 0.576 ng· g–1 w.w. for dieldrin, and 0.381 to 0.684 ng· g–1 w.w. for endrin. Concentrations of the studied compounds in the water taken from the Oder River followed the order: endrin > g-HCH > a-HCH > dieldrin > b-HCH > heptachlor ≈ aldrin > heptachlor epoxide. The highest log BCF was obtained for fish gonads and ranged from 1.5 (endrin) to 3.4 (heptachlor epoxide). Estimated daily intakes (EDI) varied from 0.0014% to 0.097% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI). Conclusion. This study revealed no direct risk linked to the consumption of fish captured from the study area. However, from the ecological aspect, the accumulation of organochlorine residues in fish gonads has been considered a dangerous phenomenon, as this may result in decreased reproduction of fish and other aquatic organisms, potentially leading to their extinction.",

An understanding of the complex ecological variables determining species richness in these rivers is lacking. The relation between the ecological parameters (climate, hydrology, and morphometry) and the fish species richness were assessed in fourteen major rivers of India. Materials and methods. The data of seven ecological variables of fourteen major rivers of India for the years 1994&#8211;2009 were quantitatively analysed for determining their influence on fish species richness. Principal factor analysis (PFA) was carried out for dimension reduction and eliminating collinearity. Subsequently, fish richness was regressed on the retained factors under generalised linear model (GLM) for determining contribution of factors towards species richness in rivers. Results. The most influential determinants of species richness were the factors such as: surface area of the river basin (0.439) followed by fish habitat availability potential (0.326) a synthesis of the variables rainfall, discharge and sediment load. The predicted loss of fish species is evident at a 10% alteration in the ecological variables of the rivers. Conclusion. The predicted loss of fish species richness is indicated at a10% alteration of the habitat factors in most of the rivers and can be useful for river planners and conservationists.",

    "abstract": "Background. Mouth characteristics are considered important yet restraining factors for food acquisition in fishes. Nevertheless, their relations with total length (TL) are not thoroughly examined. In the present study mouth characteristics were estimated for 61 fish species from the northern Aegean Sea and their relations with TL were established, and the relation of mouth area with feeding habits was tested. Materials and methods. TL, horizontal mouth opening (HMO), and vertical mouth opening (VMO) were measured in 61 species, and mouth area MA was estimated. Relations between mouth characteristics and TL were established using power regression, and the validity of the power model was tested, using Student's t-test. In order to explore whether there is a grouping of species based on their feeding habits, the MA–TL regressions of all species were plotted together and the general regression lines per functional trophic group were compared using analysis of variance. Finally, the relative MA was estimated and related to trophic level. Results. All relations examined were statistically significant (P < 0.05), with only one exception (VMO–TL relation in Dentex dentex). The allometric model (for HMO–TL, MA–TL, and VMO–TL) was valid for the majority of species (52, 47, and 49 species, respectively), with positive allometry prevailing in the HMO–TL and MA–TL relations, and negative allometry in the VMO–TL relations. The analyses employed revealed that MA, for the same TL, increases faster in carnivores than in omnivores, and that in general carnivorous species tend to have larger mouths than omnivorous ones. Finally, there is a strong positive relation between relative MA and trophic level (P < 0.01). Conclusion. There is a strong relation of mouth characteristics to body length and feeding habits. These relations and the way that MA increases in relation to feeding habits could be attributed to structural changes in order for growing fish to meet their increased energetic demands. Establishing such relations is essential for estimating trophic levels of species, which are key parameters for ecosystem-based management models, when data on species' feeding habits are not available.",

Captures of Gymnura altavela from the Syrian marine waters allowed to improve knowledge of size at first sexuality of males and females, reproductive period and fecundity. Materials and methods. In all, 114 specimens were measured for disk width (DW) and weighed. Sexual maturity was determined in males from the length of claspers and aspects of the reproductive tract, and in females from the condition of ovaries and the morphology of the reproductive tract. Hepatosomatic index (HSI), gonadosomatic index (GSI) were calculated in males and females, and their variations related to size were considered in all categories of specimens. To investigate the embryonic development and the role of the mother during gestation, a chemical balance of development (CBD) was determined, based on the mean dry mass of fertilized eggs and fully developed oocytes. Test of normality was performed by using Shapiro–Wilk's test, with P < 0.05. Tests for significance (P < 0.05) were performed by using ANOVA, Student t-test and the chi-square test. The linear regression was expressed in decimal logarithmic coordinates. In the relation mass versus total length and liver mass versus total length, comparisons of curves were carried out by using ANCOVA. Results. Females significantly outnumbered males throughout the year. Size at sexual maturity occurred for males at 771 mm DW and for females at 961 mm DW, and maximum size reached 893 mm DW and 1342 mm DW for males and females, respectively. Size at birth ranged between 281 and 367mm DW. Relations size (DW) versus total body mass (MT) did not show significant differences between males and females, relations size (DW) versus liver mass (ML) were significantly different between males and females suggesting that liver plays a more important role in life cycle of the latter. HSI increased with size of specimens especially in females. Similar patterns were observed for GSI in males and females. Females with active vitellogenesis were found throughout the year, and females carrying developing embryos in spring and in autumn, suggesting two gestation periods each year. CBD reached 22.3 and showed that G. altavela is a matrotrophic species. Ovarian fecundity was significantly higher than uterine fecundity, and litter size ranged between 1 and 4. Conclusion. The reproductive biology of G. altavela from the Syrian coast showed that a sustainable population is established in the area. The species develops K-selected biological characteristics as specimens from different marine areas and other elasmobranch species, it explained why it is endangered in the area.",

Larvae (1.19 ± 0.03 g) were fed four formulas of diet containing 0.0% (control), 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1.0% Achyranthes aspera seeds. After 51 days, larvae of each feeding treatment were divided into two groups. One groups was exposed to UV-B radiation (80 µW · cm–2) and the other one remained unexposed. Results. Average weight of fish was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in fish fed 0.5%-seed-supplemented diet (compared to other treatments). UV-B radiation affected the growth of fish fed 0.1%-seed-supplemented- and control diets; other two treatments remained unaffected. Total serum protein-, albumin-, and globulin levels were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in exposed fish compared to the unexposed ones. Among the exposed groups, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase levels were minimum in fish fed 1.0%-seed-supplemented diet, whereas the highest levels of myeloperoxidase, hemagglutination titre, and white blood cells were found in fish fed 0.5%-seed-supplemented diet group. Conclusion. Dietary supplementation of A. aspera seed at 0.5% level enhanced the growth and immunity of UV-B exposed fish.",

    "abstract": "Background. Exoenzyme-producing gut microbiota and their likely use as probionts have been widely investigated in major carps. However, reports on exoenzyme-producing capacity together with inhibition of fish pathogens are scarce. The presently reported study aimed at characterization of novel probionts from the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract of an Indian major carp&#8212;catla, Catla catla (Hamilton, 1822) depending upon extracellular enzyme-production, antagonism against Aeromonas spp., growth in fish mucus, bile tolerance, and bio-safety to the target fish. Materials and methods. GI tracts were divided into proximal and distal parts, homogenized, and plated onto selective media plates following enrichment culture technique. Exoenzyme-producing isolates were selected through qualitative and quantitative assay of 6 enzymes. Inhibition of Aeromonas spp. was tested through &#8216;cross-streaking&#8217; and &#8216;double-layer&#8217; method. Tolerance to GI condition was determined by growth in sterilized fish mucus and exposure to bile juice. Bio-safety evaluation was done by intra-peritoneal injection of live candidate probiotics and co-culture with autochthonous gut bacteria. &#160;Further, 16S rDNA fragments from the putative probiotics were sequenced, edited, analysed, identified, and deposited to the GenBank. Results. Seventeen potent isolates were primarily selected through the ability of producing extracellular enzymes, viz., amylase, protease, lipase, cellulase, phytase, and xylanase. Further study portraying antagonism against Aeromonas salmonicida, A. hydrophila, and A. veronii led to select the strains CCH1A and CCH1Ph as putative probiotics. Both the strains were competent to grow in intestinal mucus and could resist diluted bile juice (9% and 10.5%, respectively). The isolates did not produce any disease symptom or mortality in Catla catla fingerlings during the 21 day trial and were competent to grow with other autochthonous isolates. On the basis of phenotypic characteristics and 16S rDNA sequence analysis, the strains CCH1A and CCHIPh were identified as Bacillus aerius (KF623288) and Bacillus sonorensis (KF623289), respectively. Conclusion. Exoenzyme-producing gut bacteria may inhibit the growth of pathogenic Aeromonas spp. and tolerate gastrointestinal condition. Further research is inevitable to explore their potentialities in aquaculture.",

    "abstract": "Background. The goliath grouper, Epinephelus itajara (Lichtenstein, 1822), is the largest Atlantic grouper. It has been the first marine fish subjected to a fishing moratorium in Brazil (since 2002). The aim of this study was to investigate basic biological aspects, particularly the diet and reproduction of this endangered species. We believe that our results, together with information already available in the literature, may be a foundation for new management and conservation strategies for this grouper in Brazil. Materials and methods. Specimens were obtained from an artisanal fish landings collaborative monitoring program in the cities of Caravelas and Alcobaça, Abrolhos Bank, eastern Brazil. Because of the fishing moratorium, we relied on sporadic incidental captures from fishermen or donation from the law enforcement agencies. Diet and reproduction of the goliath grouper was evaluated based on 34 specimens obtained between May 2005 and September 2010. Results. Body size of 32 females ranged from 27.4 to 150.0 cm total length (TL) (mean 87.4 ± SD 34.8), while size of 2 males were 97.0 and 115.0 cm TL. Of these, 16 specimens (47%) were juveniles. Sex ratio was estimated as 1 : 16 (males to females). Two developing females were recorded, one obtained in February 2006 and another in January 2007. The length of first maturation (L50) for females was estimated at 105.64 cm and the length where 100% of individuals are mature (L100) at 126.0 cm TL. A total of 34 stomachs were analyzed, six of them were empty. Teleosts and decapods dominated the diet. The major food items of mangrove-associated fish were decapods Callinectes sp., while the coral reef-associated fish ingested mainly the boxfish Acanthostracion sp. The most important item for juveniles was Callinectes sp., while Acanthostracion sp. was the most important item for adults. Conclusion. We suggest that the goliath grouper moratorium in Brazil should be maintained for a relatively long time frame—more than four decades.",

    "abstract": "Background. Biological invasions are often listed among the main threats to the ecosystem and are considered drivers of biodiversity loss. The Indo-Pacific lionfish, Pterois volitans (Linnaeus, 1758) (hereafter lionfish), invaded the Atlantic Ocean where it threatensthe stability of the marine ecosystem. It would be crucial to know its biological characteristics to understand how environmental parameters could affect its growth. It is also important to continue the earlier efforts of management and control. In this study, we described the L&ndash;W and L&ndash;L relations and the relative condition factor of lionfish in two natural protected areas in the southern coast of Quintana Roo, Mexico. Materials and methods. Lionfish were captured during 2012 and 2013 from the Reserva de la Biosfera Banco Chinchorro (RBBC) and the Parque Nacional Arrecifes de Xcalak (PNAX). The length&ndash;weight relation was calculated based on the equation&nbsp; W = aTLb. The relative condition factor was calculated through the relative weight. Results. A total of 817 lionfish were caught in the frames of this study. In this number, there were 449 individuals from the RBBC (282.1 &plusmn; 62.1 mm TL) and 368 from the PNAX (249.2 &plusmn; 77.6 mm TL). The L&ndash;W relation for lionfish from the RBBC was W = 0.0041 TL3.258 and that for the PNAX was W = 0.0049 TL3.191. There was a significant difference between these relations (ANCOVA, F = 3.91; P = 0.0481). The growth type was positive allometric. The L&ndash;L relation was significant. The relative condition factor differed between areas only in 2013, but a high value was determined in 2012. Conclusion. The L&ndash;W&nbsp; relations were different between locations (RBBC and PNAX) but no between years. The relative condition factor showed high values (&gt;100) for both locations which may imply that lionfish is in good shape, in the studied location, due to environmental factors providing good food supply and because of the lack of predators. These results may be useful as a baseline to document the population dynamics of lionfish in the region.",

Materials and methods. The specimens of L. ramada were collected during three months (from March to May 2013) at two sampling sites: the marine (Cap Zebib sea resort) and the estuarine (Mellegue Dam) in Tunisia. We analysed sagittal otolith shape variation for 120 individuals (60 fish of each study site comprising 30 males and 30 females) for both sexes (males and females) and two sides (left and right otolith) for each specimen. Results. Statistical- and discriminant function analysis of the sagittal otolith shape clearly demonstrated statistically significant differences from the two populations. These results were also confirmed by highly statistically significant difference between otolith shape (left and right) for both sexes. An asymmetry was detected when comparing otoliths of the same side (RR–LL) between different sampling sites. Conclusion. The shape variability of otolith between these two sampling sites is probably correlated with local environmental and ecological factors.",

    "abstract": "Background. Despite increasing reports of non-native freshwater fish dispersal in Poland, a risk identification and risk assessment (RA) of their current or future impacts has not been undertaken. In this study,&nbsp; to advise policy and management decisions the Aquatic Species Invasiveness Screening Kit (AS-ISK) was applied for the first time in Poland (the RA area) to identify whether or not non-native pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbosus (Linnaeus, 1758), a freshwater sunfish, posed a high risk of being invasive in the RA area. Materials and methods. The AS-ISK was used to screen L. gibbosus for its potential invasiveness in the RA area under current climate conditions of the RA area (i.e. humid continental) and future predicted climate conditions (i.e. temperature increase by 1.5&ndash;3.0&deg;C). The risk screening was based on available evidence of the species&rsquo; life-history traits (LHT) from its introduced European range, including both ambient and artificially-heated environments. Results. A LHT-based model for predicting L. gibbosus invasiveness revealed that the population in the Oder Canal, which receives heated-water discharge from the &ldquo;Dolna Odra&rdquo; electric power station, is amongst the most invasive in Europe. The basic AS-ISK score of 16.5 suggests the species already poses a risk of being invasive in Poland, and this risk is expected to increase under future, warmer climate conditions (AS-ISK Climate Change score = 28.5). Factors and traits affecting L. gibbosus&rsquo; invasiveness were current rate and range of spread, high climatic match, parental care, relatively small size at maturity, opportunistic foraging behaviour, and elevated likelihood of being illegally stocked. Conclusion. Although L. gibbosus is known to cause adverse impacts in some circumstances, these are poorly understood for most of Europe, including the RA area, where the species is likely to disperse and establish new viable populations more widely, especially under future climate conditions. This first application of AS-ISK in Poland emphasises the need for national-level risk screening of non-native species in general, and freshwater fishes in particular, as part of Poland&rsquo;s non-native species management strategy for the control and containment of invasive species.",

    "abstract": "Background. The bogue, Boops boops (Linnaeus, 1758), is the most common sparid fish in the Tunisian waters. Despite its economic importance, the stock discrimination of this species is poorly understood up to date. As the otolith shape has long been known to be species-specific and recent studies have shown its value as an indicator of stock identity, the presently reported study was carried out for the first time to investigate the discrimination of the stock structure of B. boops samples collected from two sampling sites at the marine stations of Monastir and Zarzis located in northern Tunisia using the otolith shape descriptors analysis. Materials and methods. A total of 183 adult samples of B. boops were collected between January and August 2019 from two sampling sites at the Monastir and Zarzis marine stations. The outlines of sagittal otolith pairs from fish samples collected from the two sites were digitized and analyzed for shape variation by elliptical Fourier analysis (EFA). Results. Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) showed statistically significant differences in otolith shape within and between fish samples in the two sites, i.e., there was an asymmetry. This asymmetry was found between the left and right otoliths within each site, as well as between the same sides (left–left) and (right–right) otoliths between the Monastir and Zarzis stations. Conclusion. Fish stock samples at the two stations represent two groups or populations of the Tunisian bogue stock and should be managed separately. In addition, the asymmetry in the otolith shape between fish samples from the two stations can be attributed to differences in the rate of growth resulting from local environmental factors such as water temperature, salinity, habitat, and diet. However, the inter-individual or even the intra-population asymmetry between the right and left otoliths can be explained by the possibility of having intra-individual stress that led to abnormalities in the development of the individuals or by the presence of poor living conditions for the larvae, resulting from unfavorable environments.",

Enormous diversities exist regarding shape, number, and arrangement of the olfactory lamellae, distribution of the sensory and non-sensory epithelium as well as the abundance of various receptor cells among different teleosts. This study was aimed at describing the morphology, histology and SEM ultrastructure of the olfactory epithelium of a spotted snakehead fish, Channa punctatus (Bloch, 1793). Materials and methods. OE of C. punctatus was examined through LM and SEM. Results. Olfactory epithelium of C. punctatus containing 18 to 20 lamellae provides a large surface area. Sensory epithelium possesses both ciliated and microvillous olfactory receptor cells (ORC), which are intermingled and distributed throughout the epithelium. ORCs are arranged in alternate rows with supporting cells (SCs). ORC is columnar cell with a round cell body, an axonal process and a long dendrite. The apical surfaces of the ORCs are provided either with 10–12 cilia or numerous microvilli and the SCs with fingerprint like microridges. ORCs with rod-shaped dendrite ending were found in small numbers. Non-sensory epithelium is composed of ciliated nonsensory cells (cNSC) and covered with a dense carpet of cilia, which help in ventilating the olfactory chambers. Conclusion. A large surface area of OE, the high density of both ciliated and microvillous ORC and adequate arrangement for ventilating the olfactory chambers indicate that C. punctatus is very much dependent on its olfactory sense.",

    "abstract": "Background. The Lessepsian migrant ichthyofauna along the approximately 2000 km of the Libyan coastline has been poorly known. A comprehensive study, addressing this issue, was needed and therefore the presently reported research project is intended to close the gap, through identifying the fish species and assessing their distribution. Materials and methods. The catches of commercial fisheries vessels were monitored and examined in a standardized procedure between January 2005 and March 2006. The project covered a total of 4273 specimens, comprising 1901 specimens of Siganus luridus, 1885 specimens of Siganus rivulatus, and 487 specimens of fourteen other Lessepsian fish species. Results. Sixteen Lessepsian fish species, representing 14 families, were recently found along the Libyan coast, two of which are considered to be first records for Libya: Herklotsichthys punctatus (Rüppell, 1837) and Liza carinata (Valenciennes, 1836). Approximately 50% of the immigrants were found along the entire stretch of the Libyan coast, 12.5% in the east and central regions, and 37.5% were restricted to the eastern part of the Libyan coast. All were found in the coastal area (1-50 m depth), 12.5% on the vegetation, 31.25% on sandy bottoms, 12.5% on rocks, while the majority of them (43.75%) were pelagic. Regarding the size, 75% were medium, 18.75% large, and 6.25% were categorized as small. Conclusion. The north African coast (west of the Nile delta)-compared with the Levantine- and Anatolian coast of the Mediterranean Sea-was considered to be settled by immigrants from the Red Sea with some delay, due to sea currents. If so, this situation has changed meanwhile at least for fishes. More than 37% of the recorded Lessepsian fish species are of commercial value, especially rabbitfish (Siganus spp.). The future research should be focussed on monitoring the stocks, especially of the commercially valuable species, regarding the biology and ecology of the Lessepsian migrants. Also, possible further additions to the fish fauna, by new invaders, should be recorded.",

    "abstract": "Background. Carp fish offal contains high amount of protein and lipid. The quest for protein sources alternative to fish meal has been a priority in aquaculture research because of growing concerns on the future availability of fish meal for incorporation in fish diets. This study determined the extent to which carp fish offal could be fermented and used to replace fish meal in the formulation of diet for fingerlings of Labeo rohita. Materials and methods. Fish offal, comprising viscera of carp, was fermented along with mustard oil cake and rice bran anaerobically by a microbial suspension (108 cells · mL-1) under ambient temperature (27-30°C). The fermented mixture was mixed with fish meal, mineral- and vitamin mixture to prepare three experimental diets: 1) a reference diet (T1), without any fermentation mixture, containing 40% fish meal, 2) a diet containing 25% fish offal (fermented) and 25% fish meal (T2), and 3) a diet containing 30% fish offal (fermented) and 20% fishmeal (T3). These diets were tested to evaluate growth and biochemical composition of the body of the fingerlings of Labeo rohita and apparent protein digestibility (APD) and intake rate of the diets by the fish. Proximate analysis of feed ingredients, experimental diets, faecal samples and the carcass were performed following the AOAC procedures. Results. Fingerlings of Labeo rohita, reared for 60 days with the diets containing fermented fish offal mixture (T2 and T3), showed higher growth and higher values of protein and lipid in the carcass than those reared with the reference diet (T1). Apparent protein digestibility of the diets did not vary significantly, but average feed intake rate of the T2 and T3 diets were higher than the T1 diet. Conclusion. Fermented fish offal is a viable alternative of fish meal in the formulation of diet for fingerlings of Labeo rohita. Fifty percent replacement of fish meal is possible by a mixture containing 30%fish offal. Further studies are required to improve quality of the fermentation mixture and increase the rate of replacement of fish meal.",

    "abstract": "Background. The spotted snakehead, Channa punctatus is a highly priced freshwater food fish species in India. The culture of snakeheads is still not common due to the scarcity of quality seed supply and lack of knowledge on their feeding and breeding techniques. Therefore an experiment was conducted to test the efficacy of a new spawning agent, Ovatide in stimulating ovulation of snakehead fish under a controlled captive condition. Materials and methods. In total, 12 matured females and 24 male fish weighing 50&#8211;90 g were randomly selected for three hormonal treatment groups and one control group. Both male and female fish in each treatment group were administered with either saline (0.9% NaCl, control group), or 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mL of Ovatide per kg of body weight (BW), respectively. Each breeding set consisted of two males and one female. The hormone-treated fish were then held in concrete tanks for spawning. The breeding performance was evaluated based on spawning fecundity, spawning response, percentage fertilization, and percentage hatching. Results. No spawning behaviour or performance was observed in control group. Partial spawning was observed with the Ovatide dose of 0.2 mL &#183; kg-1 BW, and complete spawning was noticed in the medium Ovatide dose (0.4 mL &#183; kg-1 BW), and the higher dose (0.6 mL &#183; kg-1 BW) administered fish. The highest total spawning fecundity (P < 0.05) was recorded when the females were injected with 0.4 mL of Ovatide &#183; kg-1 BW than those injected with other doses. The latency period and the number of spawned eggs were ranged from 25 to 31 h and from 1080 to 5814, respectively. The highest fertilization- (90.6%) and hatching (91.33%) rates were also observed at the medium dose (P < 0.05). With regard to hatching rates, no significant difference was noticed between the medium- and higher doses of Ovatide-treated groups. Conclusion. The synthetic gonadotropin-releasing hormone with a dopamine antagonist at the dose of 0.4 mL &#183; kg-1 BW could be used as an appropriate stimulating agent for successful spawning and induced breeding of C. punctatus under captive conditions.",

    "abstract": "Background. A new taxonomy of tubenose gobies of the genus Proterorhinus has been proposed recently. However, some of taxonomic hypotheses have not been confirmed by recent genetic studies or seem not to correspond with ecological features and genetic differentiation of these fishes. The aim of this paper was to test the new taxonomy through a phylogeographic analysis of the fish from 15 sites in Southern Ukraine and Russia, through analyzing the genotypes deposited in the GenBank and to define the range of those species. Materials and methods. Fin clips were sampled from 52 specimens of tubenose gobies collected from 2003 up to 2009 in 15 localities of the Ponto-Caspian basin. Genomic DNA for amplification of mitochondrial cyt b gene fragment (about 408 bp) was extracted using the Diatom&reg;DNA Prep 100. The haplotype MedianJoining Network was constructed using the Network 4.5.1.0. software. Results. Tubenose gobies from the Black Sea basin are represented by two euryhaline species historically distributed in different areas: P. semilunaris in the north-western part of the Black Sea basin (and possibly eastern Aegean basin) and P. marmoratus in the north-eastern part. The hypothesis about freshwater and marine Black Sea Proterorhinus species seems to be not probable. The validity of endemic Crimean P. tataricus is not confirmed, several independent findings presume it to be conspecific with P. marmoratus. Some Crimean rivers and reservoirs are populated by P. semilunaris which could spread from the Dnieper River basin through the Severo-Krymskyi channel or may be accidentally introduced. The populations from the Caspian Sea and Sea of Azov basins represent the distinct evolutionary lineage of tubenose goby. But their taxonomic state should be analyzed by further molecular genetic studies of a wide scope of Caspian samples. Conclusion. The present data on the variability of the mitochondrial cyt b gene fragment in different tubenose goby populations result in revision of some previous taxonomic hypotheses in this fish group. At the same time further molecular genetic researches of Caspian populations seem to be the main tool for future development of taxonomic conclusions.",

Knowledge of the feeding ecology of fish species is essential for implementing a multispecies approach to fishery management. Therefore this work was intended to analyse stomach contents and dietary changes according to fish size, season, sex, and depth to better understanding the ecological role of this species in Adriatic demersal marine communities. Materials and methods. A total of 1646 specimens of hake were collected in the Adriatic Sea by oceanographic bottom trawl surveys carried out from 2005 to 2006 during summer- and winter seasons. Principal feeding indices, species diversity Bray–Curtis similarity index, feeding strategy plot, barplot on numeric, and weight abundance data were obtained in order to increase knowledge on the diet of hake. Results. The hake diet mainly consisted of crustaceans (particularly Decapoda) and teleosts (particularly European anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus, and red bandfish, Cepola macrophthalma). Cluster analysis of %N (numeric prey abundance percent) showed different feeding habits of three mainly groups: small hakes (<150 mm), medium sized hakes (from 150 to 300 mm) and large hake (> 300 mm) from crustaceans (small specimens) to teleost fishes (medium and large specimens). Conclusion. Feeding habits were size-dependant with fish diet being higher in stomachs of larger specimens. Feeding activity seemed to increase during growth, being smaller in immature individuals compared to adults, while no differences were found between females and males diet. Seasonal variation in diet showed an increase of teleost fishes in winter and crustaceans in summer.",

The Cortez Province (CP) is located in the transitional warm-temperate/subtropical region that allows the ichthyological component inhabiting it to be a mixture of elements of different biogeographic affinities. Since the first systematic analysis of the fish fauna of the Gulf of California in the 1960's a major portion of the endemic species was recognized. Subsequently, a total of 31 new endemic species have been described in the CP. This study constitutes an amendment of the fish component of the CP, including the most relevant ecological attributes of the species, along with an updated taxonomic list. Materials and methods. A comprehensive literature review was made, considering current biological knowledge, and taxonomic status of the endemic species from the CP. Those fish species with restricted distribution ranges, falling within the limits of this province, were considered endemic. Additionally, and to recognize the dominant ecological attributes of the CP endemic species, the preferential habitat, bathymetric distribution, the reproduction strategy, and the maximum total length (TL) were recorded. Results. Seventy-nine endemic species were recognized and grouped in 13 orders, 29 families, and 59 genera. Gobiidae (12), Chaenopsidae (8), and Labrisomidae (7) are the families with the highest species richness, and Sebastes (6 species), the most diverse genus. Forty-five percent of the species are associated with coral and rocky reefs, with 35% distributed within the first 10 m depth layer. The dominant reproduction strategies are: oviparous with benthic eggs and pelagic larval phase (48.7%), and oviparous with pelagic eggs (25.6%). More than half of the species (52%) are shorter than 10 cm (total length). Conclusion. The list of endemic species presented in this study is not conclusive, still undescribed species have not been included, detected differences (morphologic and/or genetic) in several species with disjunct populations may increase the diversity of this province.",

The wide availability of specimen-based museum collections allows scientists to address a variety of ecological and systematic hypotheses from a broad timeframe and extensive spatial scale. However, techniques employed to preserve and maintain these collections affect morphology, potentially altering or skewing any morphological comparisons inherent in research study questions. The purpose of this study was to better understand and describe the effects that preservation techniques may have on fish specimens. Materials and methods. Bluegill, Lepomis macrochirus Rafinesque, 1819, and green sunfish, Lepomis cyanellus Rafinesque, 1819, were initially preserved for six weeks in a 10% formalin solution and then transferred to 70% ethyl alcohol for 46 additional weeks to determine how the commonly used preservation methods influence morphology. Fish were photographed at 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 39, and 52 weeks of preservation to assess changes in shape. Standard length and maximum depth were measured on all fish images using Sigma Scan Pro. These measurements were then used to generate aspect ratios (maximum depth vs. standard length) for each fish. Additionally, geometric morphometric techniques (relative warp analysis) using 10 digital landmarks, were also used to evaluate overall morphological change. Results. During the 52-week period of preservation, fish standard length was reduced, but this dimension shrank proportionally with body depth. This finding was confirmed along the major gradients elicited from relative warp axis scores tested using repeated measures ANOVA. However, with both species, morphological contortions were observed immediately after the fish were placed in formalin and again when this fixative was replaced with ethyl alcohol. Conclusion. Ultimately, shape stabilized after a period of acclimatization of up to 39 weeks. This stabilization phenomenon provides evidence that long term museum collections do plateau in shape change and may be compared to address a variety of ecological and evolutionary hypotheses. &#160",

    "abstract": "Background. The characteristic feature of the genus Coregonus is the multitude of nominal species of obscure identity. The northeastern Europe is inhabited by, inter alia—the vendace, Coregonus albula (Linnaeus, 1758)—considered the European cisco—and the least cisco, C. sardinella Valenciennes, 1848—often referred to as the Siberian species. There is a large area in where the ranges of both species overlap. Using morphological- as well as genetic tools we attempted to test the working hypothesis that the Coregonus fish (ciscoes) inhabiting the above-mentioned transitional zone represent a single species. Materials and methods. Within 1995–2009 we collected 344 ciscoes from five lakes in Bolshoy Solovetsky Island and determined diagnostic morphological traits for the two species. For some samples, the polymorphism of the creatine kinase isoloci (CK-A1,2*) and the fragment of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoding the sub-unit 1 of NADH-dehydrogenize complex (ND-1 fragment) was also studied. Results. According to one of the main taxonomical characteristics—the number of vertebrae—the cisco of Solovetsky Island occupies an intermediate position between C. albula and C. sardinella. The molecular markers, however, did not reveal any differences between the ciscoes of Bolshoy Solovetsky Island and the vendace found elsewhere. All specimens had the type allele of creatine kinase (CK-A*100) which was considered to be typical for C. albula at other locations as well as the haplotype E of mtDNA widespread in vendace populations. Conclusion. The cisco from Solovetsky Island is more similar to typical vendace. Differences in some morphological traits between Solovetsky Island populations and the vendace from elsewhere are likely to reflect adaptation to environmental conditions. Thus it appears that morphological criteria do not allow reliable differentiation between two forms of ciscoes as well as between least cisco and vendace because they are influenced by environmental conditions. We believe that the presence of populations with intermediate features is a strong argument for combining C. albula and C. sardinella into a single species (C. albula).",

    "abstract": "Background. Insufficiently controlled stocking compromises the high diversity of wild trout stocks of Serbia. Native brown trout, Salmo cf. trutta Linnaeus, 1758, and Macedonian trout, Salmo macedonicus (Karaman, 1924), reveal remarkable diversity assessed using the mtDNA molecular markers, with the eight exclusive and several more widely spread haplotypes found in them. Four alien trout species and strains and one strain of Macedonian trout were introduced into the home areas of the native wild trout stocks in Serbia. In addition to them, wild trout stocks were also affected by farmed rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792), and brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis (Mitchill, 1815), that regularly escape to streams, and from Ohrid trout, Salmo letnica (Karaman, 1924), and Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (Linnaeus, 1758), stocked into streams and reservoirs. Risk of invasiveness that wild trout stocks are exposed to and their restoration were driving forces for this study. Materials and methods. Trout specimens from the Jerma River sampled in 2013 were additionally analysed for their mtDNA haplotype. The invasiveness potential of eleven alien trout species and strains introduced by stocking into wild brown- and Macedonian trout stocks in Serbia were assessed with the Fish Invasiveness Screening Kit (FISK). Results. Five of introduced trout species and strains were classified as having a high risk (sensu lato) and two of them as having a high risk (sensu stricto) of being (or becoming) invasive. Conclusion. Progressively rising and insufficiently controlled fishing and management with stocking of non-indigenous trout in wild brown trout stocks are the main current threats to the original diversity. Alien brown trout strains cross breed with native brown trout and incorporate into their stocks. Currently, feral rainbow-, brook-, and Ohrid trout reveal great invasive potential by naturalization in waters heavily stocked with them. The fisheries measures aiming to control and/or to eradicate alien strains of brown trout involve the restriction of stocking, landing of trout suspected as of alien strain or species, as well as the stringent control of stocking material used for the restorative stocking. They are mandatory, regarding the conservational dependence of wild brown trout stocks.",

    "abstract": "Background. Several studies have highlighted the negative potential of recreational boat fishing to put pressure on coastal fish species and in particular on those that are vulnerable. We focused on this problem launching the first such survey in the area on this type of fishery in the Azorean region. We were trying to assess the catch, harvest, and effort, to investigate spatial and temporal variability, compared with commercial artisanal harvesting, and to evaluate ecological implications of this activity. Materials and methods. Recreational boat fishing was surveyed at the islands of Faial and Pico during 2004 and 2005 to assess the level of pressure on fish communities. Eighty-seven anglers representing 46 boats were interviewed. The questionnaires covered fishing data (fishing technique, gear, fishing effort, and spatial distribution), socio-economic information, and biological sampling (species identification and measurements). Results. The anglers from the recreational boats surveyed employed four different fishing techniques, however, the demersal fishing was undoubtedly the most common (87.5%). The activity took place around the islands with no activity at neighbouring offshore fishing grounds. A total of 32 fish species were identified in the demersal fishing catch. The estimated catches reached 163 t per year (39.7% of the commercial artisanal captures). The weighted mean trophic level and vulnerability index values from the demersal fishing catch corresponded to 3.8 and 45.3, respectively. Conclusion. The impact of the demersal recreational fishing on the fish communities of the shelf and upper slope of the islands studied is substantial, affecting a number vulnerable fish species (e.g., Epinephelus marginatus, Polyprion americanus, and Scorpaena scrofa). The recreational fisheries in the area is also a major competitor for the same resources as the commercial artisanal fishermen, since 75% of the species composition captured by recreational boat anglers is simultaneously landed by commercial artisanal fisheries. A monitoring program covering the recreational fisheries is urgently needed to improve the current management strategy in the coastal areas of the Azorean Archipelago.",

    "abstract": "Background. Under culture conditions, intra-cohort cannibalism is one of the main factors that affects the growth and survival of fishes, especially during the early life stages of carnivorous species. Cannibalism is chiefly influenced by environmental factors, but parental effects cannot be excluded. The complete elimination of cannibalism in the larviculture of carnivorous fish species is virtually impossible, but it may be possible to mitigate its impact through a better understanding of the extrinsic and intrinsic factors that affect the intensity of cannibalism. The presently reported study had two complementary objectives: a) it examined how the growthâ€“cannibalismâ€“survival dynamics in cultured larvae of European catfish, Silurus glanis Linnaeus, 1758, is affected by maternal influence, and b) it evaluated the possibility of reducing cannibalism while supplementing food with tryptophan (TRP), which is a precursor of serotonin that has a becalming effect on fish. Materials and methods. Two 30-day experiments were conducted (0L : 24D, 26.5â€“27.0Â°C). In the first experiment, 3â€“day old larvae of European catfish originating from four female parents (f1, f2, f3, and f4) were cultured in full siblings groups. In the second experiment, larvae from all four progenies were reared together and fed commercial diets supplemented with different doses of tryptophan (T0, T1, T2). Fish mortality including cannibalism, growth, and biomass were estimated every 10 days during both experiments. Results. In both experiments, cannibalism was the main cause of mortality and losses to type II (complete) cannibalism were higher than those caused by type I (incomplete) cannibalism. No maternal influence on cannibalistic behaviour was found. Tryptophan supplementation had no significant effect on fish growth or survival. Conclusion. The results of presently reported studies confirmed that cannibalism is an important factor affecting survival in larviculture of European catfish. Controlled conditions used in initial rearing of European catfish larvae, significantly enhanced the survival of juvenile catfish in comparison to traditional pond culture.",

    "abstract": "Background. Although, presence of tannase-producing and/or tannin tolerant gut bacteria has been documented in ruminants and non-ruminant herbivores, the topic is rarely addressed in fish. The present study aimed at enumeration of autochthonous tannase-producing bacteria in the gut of freshwater teleosts. Materials and methods. This study covered seven freshwater teleost fish species: rohu, Labeo rohita (Hamilton, 1822); catla, Catla catla (Hamilton, 1822); mrigal, Cirrhinus mrigala (Hamilton, 1822); grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella (Valenciennes, 1844); common carp, Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758; silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Valenciennes, 1844); and Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758). Gastrointestinal (GI) tracts of the fish studied were divided into proximal (PI) and distal (DI) parts, homogenized and plated onto Tryptone Soya Agar (TSA) plates. The pure colonies were spotted on selective tannic acid (TA) agar plates to determine the tannase-producing bacteria. Extracellular tannase-producing capacity of the isolates was determined through qualitative and quantitative assay using TA media plates or broth, respectively at three different pH levels (5.5, 7.0, and 8.5). Further, 16S rRNA gene fragments of the promising tannase-producing bacteria were sequenced, aligned, analysed, identified, and deposited to the GenBank. Results. Totally 685 strains were isolated on TSA plates, of which 116 strains (37 from PI and 79 from DI) grow on TA media and were defined as tannase-producers. The highest percentage of tannase-producing strains was noticed in the DI regions of grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idella (38.98%), and tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (37.74%). The lowest frequency of tannase-producing bacteria was revealed in PI region of catla, Catla catla (2.12%). The intestine of Indian major carps was relatively poorly colonized by tannase-producing bacteria compared to that of exotic carps. Evaluation of tannase-producing capacity revealed that the majority of the isolates exhibited maximum extracellular tannase production at pH 7.0. Quantitative evaluation, showed highest tannase activity by strain HMT1 (0.28 &#177; 0.001 U) isolated from silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix, followed by strains ONH2Ph (0.19 &#177; 0.005) and ONH13B (0.17 &#177; 0.009 U) isolated from tilapia. Analyses of the 16S rRNA partial gene sequences revealed that strains ONH2Ph and ONH13B showed high similarity to Bacillus subtilis (KP765736) and Brevibacillus agri (KP765734), respectively. Whereas, strain HMT1 was most closely related to Klebsiella variicola (KP765735). Conclusion. The study revealed existence of tannase-producing bacterial symbionts within fish GI tracts. Tannin-degrading bacteria detected in the presently reported study might aid in overcoming the anti-nutritional effects of dietary tannins within fish gut.",

    "abstract": "Background. Although the Congo basin is the second largest river basin in the world and it has been considered a biodiversity hotspot for fish, still many parts of this basin remain poorly studied. In this study, we examined the poorly known ichthyofauna of three major north-eastern tributaries of the Congo basin (Itimbiri, Aruwimi and Lindi/Tshopo). A checklist of the ichthyofauna is provided and two synonymies are presented. As such, it contributes to unraveling the poorly known fish diversity in the whole Congo basin. An improved knowledge of the ichthyofauna is a sound baseline for further studies and conservation Materials and methods. Fish specimens from five recent expeditions have been identified, and the older collection material from the study area, housed at the Royal Museum for Central Africa and other institutions has been checked and re-identified when necessary. Results. In total, 320 species were recorded, 232 of which from the Itimbiri, 246 from the Aruwimi, and 187 from the Lindi/Tshopo, with the Mormyridae being the most dominant family in all three basins. Micralestes sardina &nbsp;Poll, 1938 is relegated to synonymy with Micralestes humilis Boulenger, 1899, and Enteromius trinotatus (Fowler, 1936) is designated as a replacement name for Enteromius tetraspilus (Pfeffer, 1896). Within the Aruwimi, a clear difference in species richness and composition is apparent between the headwaters (Ituri/Epulu) and the lower reaches near the Congo main stream. The headwaters are characterised by low species richness, with the Cyprinidae being the most dominant family, while the lower reaches are more species rich, with mormyrid species being the most dominant. The presence of two waterfalls on the Ituri/Epulu has a noticeable impact on the fish distribution. Finally, the hypothesis that an ancient connection between the north-eastern part of the Congo basin and the region of the Albertine Rift is still reflected in their present ichthyofauna is not confirmed. Conclusion. This study provides a first checklist of the ichthyofauna in the north-eastern tributaries of the Congo basin, and illustrates the influence of physical barriers on fish diversity and distribution.",

    "abstract": "Background. The leopard grouper, Mycteroperca rosacea (Streets, 1877), is endemic to north-western Mexico and has high commercial value. Although facts of its basic biology are known, information on its trophic ecology, in particular, is scarce. The objective of the presently reported study was to characterize the feeding habits of M. rosacea through the analysis of stomach contents, and to determine possible variations linked to sex (male or female), size (small, medium, or large), or season (spring, summer, autumn, or winter), in order to understand the trophic role that this species plays in the ecosystem where it is found. Materials and methods. Fish were captured monthly, from March 2014 to May 2015 by spearfishing in Santa Rosalía, BCS, Mexico. Percentages by the number, by weight, and frequency of appearance of each food category, the index of relative importance (%IRI), and prey-specific index of relative importance (%PSIRI) were used to determine the importance of each prey item in the leopard grouper diet. Diet breadth was calculated using Levin's index. Possible differences in the diet by sex, size, or season were identified through a multivariate PERMANOVA analysis. Results. A total of 341 leopard grouper specimens were collected, 309 of which had stomachs containing food. A total of 28 prey species were identified. According to the %IRI, the contribution to the diet of the coastal pelagic prey Nyctiphanes simplex and Sardinops sagax (Jenyns, 1842) was 87%, whereas according to the %PSIRI the contribution to the diet of those two prey species was 57%, in addition to several demersal prey species. A PERMANOVA analysis indicated that there were significant differences in the diet of leopard grouper by sex, size, and season, but the interactions sex–size, sex–season, size–season, and sex–size–season, were not significant. Conclusion. Mycteroperca rosacea was identified as a carnivorous predator with narrow trophic width, with significant differences in diet according to the sex, size, season, and size–sex interactions, which could be the result of different energetic requirements, hunting abilities, and food availability. The %PSIRI turned out to be the most adequate index to determine the feeding habits of fish, as it provides a better mean value to determine the most important prey.",

    "abstract": "Background. Because of the advancement of multiple spawning of carps, the importance of a quality larval diet is increasing day by day. The larval fish do not have the necessary enzyme or the amount of digestive enzymes to digest feed at optimum level. Therefore, fermentation of feed ingredients and/or formulated diets by bacterial enzymes to produce simpler forms of nutrients may be beneficial for them. Materials and methods. Five isocaloric (4.38 kcalּg-1) and isonitrogenous (35% crude protein approximately) experimental diets (D1-D5) containing 32% fish meal, 34% mustard oil cake, 30% rice bran, and 2% cod liver oil, were fermented in vitro with Bacillus circulans cells (at the rate of 108 bacterial cells per g) at 37oC for 1-5 day duration (1 day: D1, 2 days: D2, 3 days: D3, 4 days: D4, and 5 days: D5). The bacterial strain [extracellular enzyme producer Bacillus circulans (Lr 1.1)] used for fermentation was isolated from the intestine of rohu, Labeo rohita fingerlings. The reference diet (RD), containing same ingredients, was not fermented with bacterial cells. Rohu spawn (av. wt. 0.35 ± 0.01 mg) were fed ad libitum for 21 days in the laboratory condition at 30 minutes interval starting from 0900 h to 1600 h. Results. Fermentation of diets resulted in an increase in crude protein and free amino acid contents and decrease in crude fibre content. Diets D4 and D5 resulted in best growth and survival (98% and 98.33%, respectively) of rohu spawn compared to those fed with the reference diet (RD) and other experimental groups. A significant positive correlation was obtained between RNA : DNA ratio and specific growth rate (SGR) of 18 dietary groups (6 groups in triplicate). Conclusion. Fermentation of feed ingredients may be practiced as a tool for starter diet formulation to obtain better growth and survival of rohu spawn. The enzyme-producing strain, Bacillus circulans could be used to ferment diets for 4 to 5 days to increase the bioavailability of nutrients.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of feeding rohu, Labeo rohita, fingerlings with diets containing raw or extruded grass pea seed meal on growth, feed utilization efficiency, and carcass composition. Materials and methods. Extrusion of finely ground grass pea seeds was performed in a twin-screw extruder at 130oC and 400 rpm. Six isonitrogenous (35% crude protein approximately) and isocaloric (16 547.7 J ּ g-1) diets were formulated incorporating raw and extruded grass pea seed meal at 20, 30, and 40% levels by weight into a fish meal based control diet. The diets were fed to rohu fingerlings in triplicate treatments at the rate of 3% of body weight for 60 days and fish performance in terms of growth, apparent protein digestibility (APD), and carcass composition was studied. Results. Extrusion of grass pea seed meal was effective in significantly reducing the ANFs, such as tannins (77%), trypsin inhibitor (below detection limit), and β-ODAP (46.09%). Phytic acid and nutrient components were not affected by extrusion. In terms of growth response, FCR and PER, 40% extruded grass pea meal incorporated diet resulted in significantly (P < 0.05) the best performance of rohu fingerlings. The APD values obtained for extruded seed meal incorporated diets were significantly higher in comparison to those for non-extruded ones. The carcass protein and lipid contents increased over the initial value in all dietary treatments with no significant differences in fish fed diets containing extruded grass pea seed meal. Conclusion. Extrusion is an effective treatment to reduce/eliminate the ANFs in legumes. Improved growth, feed utilization efficiencies, and APD in rohu fingerlings indicate that extrusion processing is also effective in improving the nutritional characteristics of grass pea.",

    "abstract": "Background. Cobalt (Co) is an essential mineral required in trace quantity in the diet of fish. Although freshwater fish are capable of accumulating adequate quantity of trace minerals from the medium, Co is extremely scarce in the freshwater resources. Therefore, freshwater fish require a supplement of Co in the diet. Since information regarding requirement of Co for growth and its balance in the body of fish is poorly documented there is scope to quantify requirement of cobalt for common carp. Materials and methods. Two separate trials were made with fingerlings of common carp, Cyprinus carpio: a growth trial made in outdoor cement tanks for 60 days and a digestibility trial made in 15-L glass aquaria in the laboratory for 7 days. Four experimental diets (average crude protein 30.94%) supplemented by four different levels of Co (0.00%, 0.05%, 0.10%, and 1.0%) were formulated and tested in these two trials. Growth was evaluated from gain in weight, specific growth rate, feed conversion ratio, and deposition of protein and lipid in the body of the fish. Apparent protein digestibility (APD) of the diets was evaluated from the proportion of chromium (Cr) and protein in the diet and faeces. Water qualities were checked every week and levels of Co in liver, kidney, gill, gut, and caudal trunk of the fish were determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer at the end of 60 days in the growth trial. Results. Fingerlings of C. carpio fed 0.1% to 1.0% cobalt-supplemented diet (CSD) showed significantly higher growth than the control diet. Although conversion rate, weight gain and SGR were significantly higher in 0.05% CSD as compared with control diet (0.00% CSD), there was no significant difference in apparent protein digestibility (APD), apparent net protein utilization (ANPU), and deposition of crude protein in the body between fish fed control and 0.05% CSD. Fish fed 1.0% CSD showed significantly higher level of Co in different tissues as compared with other diet groups. Conclusion. It is concluded from the present study that dietary supplement of Co (0.1% to 1.0%) serves as a growth promoter for common carp. Increased growth with no additional tissue burden of Co is achieved at 0.1% dietary Co, while a higher level of supplement (1.0%) may result in increased deposition of Co in different tissues.",

    "abstract": "Background. Polandis one of the largest common carp producers in the European Union. By 2006, the annual production of carp and other cyprinid fish species had reached around 17 000 t. The economic efficiency of pond farms is not only significant for the performance of Poland's traditional carp market, but it also supports the non-productive environmental functions of earthen carp ponds. The objective of this study was to determine the costs and revenues of carp ponds, and to identify the key conditions for improving the profitability of carp farming in Poland. Materials and methods. Data from 2005–2007 were collected through a survey of 18 carp farms keeping full accounting records of a total pond area of 17-302 ha, accounting for around 34% of the total in Poland. Data was both biological and economic. The former consisted of survival rate of different age groups of fish. The latter included farm revenues (sales of carp and other species, angling fees, and other income sources) and annual production costs. The cost was separated into two main parts, variable- and fixed costs. The income was determined by subtracting the annual total cost from the total revenue. The profitability was defined as the cost-to-income ratio. The results were compared with available economic indicators of carp production in Germany and Hungary in 1999-2002. Results. The proceeds from the sale of market-size carp had a predominant share of total revenues of the investigated farms. The variable cost consisted of labour (37%) and feed (20%), while the share of the remaining cost components did not exceed 10% of total expenses of fish farms. Only in 2007 was pond fish production profitable (merely 3.95%) while in 2005 and 2006, the total costs of the farms were higher than their revenues (on average –7.42% and –2.42%, respectively). The average survival rates of stocking carp in the studied farms, including fry between 0 and 2 years of age, were very low at 36% and 38%, respectively. The survival rates of market-size carp were much higher, on average 67%. Conclusion. The economic situation of Polish carp farms, within the studied time period, was difficult. The low survival rates of stocking carp seemed to be one of the main causes for the low return on carp production. This may be a compound effect not only of epizootic diseases but also of piscivorous animals and environmental restrictions imposed on carp ponds.Farmers could find it difficult to reconcile fish production with the pond environmental functions and the need to maintain a healthy profit margin without external financial support.",

    "abstract": "Background. Thirty species were previously recorded for unstructured habitats (unvegetated soft substrates: USS) in Pantanos de Centla. However, a lack of information on the tropical ichthyofauna of the structured habitats such as marginal vegetation (MV), submerged macrophytes (SM) and coarse woody debris (CWD) emphasizes the importance of the aim of this paper that is the updating the records of the species distributed in these habitats, as they have been frequently reported as high biodiversity sites that are currently threatened by anthropogenic activities. Materials and methods. Sampling was carried out in 30 shallow sites, each with unstructured habitats and the three structured habitats, in Pantanos de Centla, a Ramsar wetland, over a period of three years. Fish were collected with a dip net, a drop net and a Renfro beam net. Results. A total of 6506 fish of 37 genera and 44 species were collected. Eleven species are new records for Pantanos de Centla, and the scientific name of 11 species was updated. The Poeciliidae and Cichlidae families are dominant with 10 and 13 species, respectively. Nine species of the genus Cichlasoma sensu lato were placed in six genera. Three species are new records for the Usumacinta Province. Ctenogobius claytoni, Gobionellus oceanicus, and Rhamdia quelen proved to be synonyms. Of all species, 84% were collected from USS, however, the number of species distributed in USS, MV, and SM was similar (CCj 0.4736-0.5813). Conclusion. Most of the species that were added to the previously recorded species list of Pantanos de Centla, inhabit structured habitats. This confirms the importance of including these habitats in surveys aimed at generating checklists, and of analysing the distribution of fish species in shallow tropical ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Background. The red mullet, Mullus barbatus L., is abundantly captured and targeted throughout the year in Tunisian waters but not all aspects of its biology have been studied well. One of them—the feeding behaviour of this fish may be important for stock assessment, ecosystem modelling, and understanding mechanism and processes which structure and influence the fish assemblages. The aim of this paper is to describe the diet of specimens from the northern coast of Tunisia, to analyse seasonal variations in its composition and to delineate feeding intensity in relation to sex and size. Materials and methods. Red mullet were sampled from different landing sites along the northern Tunisian coast and the Gulf of Tunis. Random samples were taken from both commercial and demersal trawlers from January to December 2005. A total of 472 specimens were examined following the commonly accepted procedures. The following parameters were analysed: vacuity index, percentage frequency of occurrence, percentage numerical abundance, percentage gravimetric composition, and index of relative importance. The trophic level for any consumer species was calculated, for total sample, but also in related to size, sex, and season. Results. Mullus barbatus mainly fed on crustaceans and polychaetes. According to the classification of fishes in functional groups based on their TROPH red mullet is an omnivorous feeder, animal species being preferential preys. Basing on data assembled by Stergiou and Karpouzi for the Mediterranean ichthyofauna, the estimated trophic levels for the red mullet ranged between 2.79 and 3.57 units. Such within-species differences in trophic levels might reflect the combined effect of the following factors: area, year, length structure, and differential fishing pressure between years and/or areas, because fishing removes the largest individuals of a species, which generally have higher trophic levels. Conclusion. The red mullet is not only omnivorous, but also opportunistic feeder with trophic level related to body size, season, geographic area and fishing pressure.",

The knowledge of the age and growth of the species in the two connected regions is essential for the proper management of the resources. The aim of this study was to estimate the age and growth of Liza aurata in the Messolonghi-Etoliko Lagoon system and the neighbouring coastal waters of the Gulf&nbsp; of Patraikos (Western Greece). Materials and methods. From December 1992 to February 1994, a total of 1146 individuals of Liza aurata were caught in the Klisova Lagoon (part of the lagoon complex of Messolonghi-Etoliko) and their adjacent sea coastal area, using barrier fish traps, seine, and trammel nets.&nbsp; The fish age was determined from scale readings. Back calculated lengths at age, as derived using scales readings, were used to estimate the growth parameters of von Bertalanffy equation. The length&ndash;weight relation was estimated by the equation: W = a &middot; Lb. Results. The total length (L) of examined specimens ranged from 9.7 to 59 cm. The scale readings revealed nine age classes in the Gulf of Patraikos (0 to VIII) and seven (0 to VI) in the lagoon. Maximum age was found to be 8 and 6 years for females and males, respectively. The analysis of the residuals sum of squares showed that the VBGF curves of sexes between the Patraikos sea area and the lagoon were not significantly different (sexes: F = 0.51, P &gt; 0.05 and regions: F = 0.46, P &gt; 0.05, respectively). The estimated values of VBGF for all samples were L&yen; = 65.08 &plusmn; 2.61 cm; k = 0.149 &plusmn; 0.017 year&ndash;1 and to = &ndash;1.15 &plusmn; 0.063 year. No significant difference on the length&ndash;weight relations among the sexes was found (F = 3.15, P &gt; 0.05) while a significant difference on the length&ndash;weight relations among the regions (sea: W = 0.0036L3.26; lagoon: W = 0.0057L3.13) was found (F = 21.1, P &lt; 0.05) which reproduced a rather low difference (&lt;&plusmn;5%) along the size (weight) of species. The length&ndash;weight relations exhibited allometry. Conclusion. The age and growth in length and weight of Liza aurata in the lagoon system of Messolonghi-Etoliko and the neighbouring seawaters of Gulf of Patraikos were not significantly different. This could be explained by the fact that the relative high salinity situation of the lagoon may rebut their high trophic advantage for the fish and/or alternatively, by a scenario that is based on the seasonal migrations of species between sea and lagoon.",

    "abstract": "Background. The distribution of freshwater fishes in Cyprus is poorly known. The island is particularly interesting because of its biogeographical isolation and the long-term influence of humans on the biota, especially due to the recent damming of many rivers. This study documents preliminary baseline freshwater fish assemblage patterns including insights on the impact of the dams. Materials and methods. Site-specific fish presence data were gathered using a backpack electrofishing device, literature reviews and unstructured expert interviews. Results. A total of 53 aquatic sites in 18 river basins of Cyprus were surveyed, most of which have dam reservoirs along parts of their channels. The survey confirms the existence of sixteen fish species of which 12 are non-indigenous. Native species were found at very few sites, although the European eel was reported to be ubiquitous. Twenty-four sites sustained non-indigenous fish (45% occurrence at all sites, or 60% at all sites with fish present). Reservoir dams were the most species-rich generic habitats but hosted almost exclusively non-indigenous species. Conclusion. Cyprus' streams are characterized by a scarcity of fishes. The absence of primary- and primary-like native species is attributed to the palaeogeography of the island which has not been connected to the continent since the Messinian Salinity Crisis. At present, only two peripheral (Anguilla anguilla and Salaria fluviatilis) and one secondary (Aphanius fasciatus) native inland fish species are reported. These, along with euryhaline marine transient species suffer from the extensive degradation of natural riverine habitats. Dams influence riverine fish assemblages by degrading downstream aquatic habitats, impeding fish movements, and by providing refuges for non-indigenous fish populations.",

    "abstract": "Background. Obtaining the appropriate quantity of milt and spermatozoa of biologically good quality depends on a number of environmental factors. Additional factors may be involved while using a hormonal stimulation. The aim of this study was to analyse the effect of time, after stimulation with Ovopel [(D-Ala6, Pro9-NEt)-mGnRH+metoclopramide] (1 granule · kg–1 body weight) on semen quality indicators of common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., over the period of 72 h post injection. Materials and methods. The total volume of milt (TVM, mL), volume of milt per 1 kg of the male body weight (VOM, mL · kg–1 b.w.), total sperm production (TSP, ×109), and their concentration (×109 mL–1) in milt were determined. Additionally, the motility of spermatozoa (%) by means of the subjective method and the osmotic pressure of seminal plasma (mOsm · · kg–1) were determined. The milt was collected 24 h (group I, n = 10), 48 h (group II, n = 10), and 72 h (group III, n = 10) after stimulation with Ovopel. Results. No significant differences (P > 0.05) in the main parameters of milt i.e., the motility and concentration of spermatozoa in the milt, as well as in the osmotic pressure of seminal plasma were found between the experimental groups of the fish. Higher TSP and VOM values were recorded 24 h after Ovopel injection compared to samples obtained after 72 h (P <0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively) and 48 h (P > 0.05). TVM values were also higher at 24 h after the injection than those noted at 48 and 72 h (P < 0.01). Conclusion. The lack of significant differences in the motility and concentration of spermatozoa in milt at 24, 48, and 72 h after injection indicate that time after Ovopel administration does not have an influence on the main indicators of common carp milt quality. However, we noted significant differences in TSP, TVM, and VOM between samples obtaining 24 h and 72 h after hormonal stimulation. The highest quantity indicators i.e., the number of spermatozoa in milt and volume of obtained milt noted for samples obtained after 24 h suggest that this time is better for milt sampling than time after 48 and 72 h.",

    "abstract": "Background. Elasmobranchs can play important roles in marine communities. But, relatively little is known about their diet, and movement. Sphyrna lewini (Griffith et Smith, 1834) consumes fishes, cephalopods, rays, and crustaceans. Carcharhinus falciformis (Müller et Henle, 1839) feed on fishes, cephalopods, crustaceans and sea turtles. To date, there are no studies available on the trophic ecology of sharks in Malpelo Island. The aim of this study was to describe the trophic ecology of S. lewini and C. falciformis, using stable isotope analysis of δ13C and δ15N, to better understand the role of both shark species in the Malpelo Island ecosystem. Materials and methods. In January, February, and November 2013, specimens of Sphyrna lewini and Carcharhinus falciformis illegally caught at Malpelo Island were confiscated at the port of Buenaventura, Colombia. For each shark specimen, total length and sex were registered. Samples of muscle tissue were taken from the nape of all specimens. Each muscle sample was lyophilized for 24 h and analysed with lipid and urea extraction and without extraction. For each shark specimen, a subsample of ~1.0 mg was used for isotopic analysis. Results. A total of 14 Sphyrna lewini (Griffith et Smith, 1834) and 12 Carcharhinus falciformis (Müller et Henle, 1839) were analysed. δ13C values were similar between S. lewini (–16.3 ± 0.1‰) and C. falciformis (–16.5 ± 0.1‰). Sphyrna lewini showed a wider trophic niche than C. falciformis, with low trophic overlap (5%) between the two species. The δ15N values of S. lewini (15.9 ± 0.11‰) were higher than those of C. falciformis (14.9 ± 0.09‰). In C. falciformis, δ13C values were similar in both sexes (–16.5 ± 0.1‰), while δ15N values were significantly different between males (14.6 ± 0.1‰) and females (15.0 ± 0.1‰). The trophic position of S. lewini was 5.25 ± 0.12, and that of C. falciformis, 5.48 ± 0.18, which suggests that both shark species occupy a high position in the marine food chain. Conclusion. Both shark species co-occur at Malpelo Island, but they do not share food resources and feeding areas, and they probably feed far from the island, using it as a resting and cleaning area. This indicates the need for more research to increase biological and ecological knowledge of both species, particularly within marine protected areas and their influence areas throughout the Colombian Pacific.",

    "abstract": "Background. Southern Mediterranean lagoons are poorly studied. The Mellah Lagoon is the only coastal lagoon in Algeria. Characterized by low anthropogenic pressure it has a crucial environmental and socioeconomic role because of its fishing activities and conservation status. The spatial and temporal variations of fish assemblage structure in relation with the environmental parameters were investigated. This study contributes to a better understanding of the functioning of the Mellah Lagoon, thus providing useful data regarding its conservation and management. Materials and methods. Sampling was carried out monthly during one year at four stations with a beach seine of 3-mm mesh. Environmental variables were measured during each sampling. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and cluster analysis were used to assess environmental influences on fish spatio-temporal assemblages. Results. A total of 11 fish species representing 8 families were collected and examined: Aphanius fasciatus (Valenciennes, 1821); Atherina boyeri Risso, 1810; Liza saliens (Risso, 1810); Liza aurata (Risso, 1810); Mugil cephalus Linnaeus, 1758; Mugilidae gen sp.; Pomatoschistus marmoratus (Risso, 1810); Diplodus sargus sargus (Linnaeus, 1758); Sparus aurata Linnaeus, 1758; Syngnathus abaster Risso, 1827; Anguilla anguilla (Linnaeus, 1758); Hyporhamphus picarti (Valenciennes, 1847). Resident species presented the highest abundance values, accounting for 96% of the total number of fish captured, while marine migrant species that use the lagoon as a nursery ground contributed the most to the community species richness (7 species). Atherina boyeri (87.59% of total catch by number) was the most abundant species. Environmental parameters measured were uniform across the whole lagoon. However, temperature and salinity showed a seasonal pattern. The CCA analysis based on species abundance indicated the absence of clear spatial and temporal patterns in fish assemblage. The majority of the species had mean values of distribution in relation to environmental variables. Conclusion. The fish assemblage of the shallow water (<1.5 m) of the Mellah Lagoon is characterized by a small number of species dominated by resident species. The low species richness, the dominance of resident species, and the weak spatial and temporal patterns in the fish assemblage are mainly the result of a high degree of confinement because of the low freshwater inputs from the wadis and the limited tidally-driven exchanges between the lagoon and the sea. To maintain high biodiversity and a sustainable fishery in the lagoon, it is necessary to develop a management plan which would facilitate a proper water exchange between the lagoon and the sea and would promote colonization of the lagoon by marine species.",

    "abstract": "Background. Introduction of the common carp, Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758, may cause a cascade of alterations in trophic webs, among other negative effects, indirectly due to its feeding behaviour. A simplified model site, covenient for studying such interrelations is Lago de Pátzcuaro, México, a shallow lake where carp was first introduced in 1974. The aim of our study was to characterize diet composition, diet breadth and trophic position of C. carpio and local fish fauna, and to assess diet overlap between fish fauna from sites with different habitat characteristics during the wet and the dry seasons. Materials and methods. We assessed the diet of C. carpio and local fish fauna in six sites during the wet and the dry seasons. Stomach content analysis was carried out separately for each length class. The importance of each item was estimated by the index of relative importance (IRI) and the omnivory index was used to assess the feeding behaviour. The trophic guild and trophic position were determined using the TrophLab software and stable isotope analysis. Diet breadth was calculated by Levin's Index and diet overlap by the Horn's Index. Fish dorsal muscle and water hyacinth tissues were obtained from nitrogen isotope signature analysis. Results. We found that C. carpio is an omnivorous fish that feeds in shallow areas with water hyacinth cover and rooted macrophytes, consuming mainly detritus and plant debris (>60%). However, δ 15N values indicate that C. carpio is also a secondary consumer because it also ingests invertebrates associated with plant debris. The carp diet overlaps with native blackfin, Goodea atripinnis Jordan, 1880, at most sites. Small carp (",

    "abstract": "Background. Understanding the reproduction of the spotted flounder, Citharus linguatula (Linnaeus, 1758), has been considered a major step toward understanding its population dynamics, especially, in the northern Aegean Sea. So, the presently reported study aimed to study the reproductive biology of C. linguatula and provided the first data of its fecundity. Materials and methods. This study was carried out between September 2006 and September 2008 in Saros Bay (Northern Aegean Sea, Turkey), which had been closed to trawl fishing since 2000. The gonadosomatic index, length at maturity (L50), and absolute fecundity were analysed. Results. The elevated GSI values observed, suggested the spawning period was from September to November. The length at maturity (L50) was at 15.0 cm TL for females and 14.0 TL cm for males. The relations between the absolute fecundity and total length, total weight, and age of the spotted flounder females were estimated as Fa = 0.1878TL3.29, Fa = 58.515TW + 36.453, and Fa = 887.59A – 389.43, respectively. Conclusion. The identification of reproductive strategy is necessary to obtain a better understanding of its biology.",

    "abstract": "Background. Some studies in the Neotropical ecozone evaluated the correlation between the ichthyofauna and the physical and chemical characteristics of streams. This study aimed to estimate the environmental quality of Neotropical streams through quality protocols and diversity indexes. The hypothesis is that it is possible to identify fish species indicators of variables and streams quality associated to environmental conservation and degradation. Materials and methods. Sampling occurred quarterly from October 2012 to July 2013, totalling four phases of field surveys in three sample units on each stream (Água dos Anjos Stream, Monjolinho Stream, and Ubá Stream, upper Paraná River basin) in southern Brazil. The Indicator Value Method (IndVal) was used to relate the ichthyofauna (abundance and relative frequency of fish species) to physical and chemical variables and streams and their respective environmental characteristics. Results. A total of 33 species were analysed as possible indicators by the IndVal method, and 21 species showed a significant relation (P < 0.05) to one or more environmental variables. The exotic Poecilia reticulata Peters, 1859 was best linked to low-oxygen water. Bryconamericus iheringii (Boulenger, 1887) was an indicator of the stream with the worst environmental quality among the analysed streams, and also indicated significantly lower extent of riparian vegetation (<6 m) and unstable substrate. Geophagus brasiliensis (Quoy et Gaimard, 1824) was also indicator of the stream with inferior environmental quality and low of riparian vegetation (<6 m). On the other hand, Trichomycterus diabolus Bockmann, Casatti et de Pinna, 2004 was indicator of diverse habitats environments, as it was linked to higher extent of riparian vegetation (>18 m) and high water oxygenation. Conclusion. The fish species: P. reticulata, B. iheringii, and G. brasiliensis were indicators of inferior environmental quality, and T. diabolus was an indicator of superior quality, and its abundance can characterize as important bio-indicators of environmental characteristics of Neotropical streams.",

    "abstract": "Background. The observed expansion of the red lionfish, Pterois volitans&#160; (Linnaeus, 1758), in the Caribbean represents one of the most rapid marine fish invasions in the history. The invasion rate of this top predator has resulted in a marked negative effect on local fish populations in the Caribbean by impacting local biodiversity. The main aim of this work was to conduct the morphological identification of prey items from the lionfish diet, and to determine the spatio--temporal variation of the lionfish diet composition in different sites of the Mexican Caribbean, to have a better knowledge of how this invasive species is impacting local species of commercial or ecological importance in the region. Materials and methods. The Mexican Caribbean study area was divided in three zones; North (one locality Isla Contoy), Central (three locations Xpu-Ha, Akumal and X&#8217;Cacel), and South (two locations Banco Chinchorro and Xcalak). The fish were collected, from different habitats, using SCUBA diving and Hawaiian harpoon. Collected fish were taxonomically identified, measured for total length (TL) and standard length (SL), and weighed to the nearest gram. Prey items were identified using a dissection microscope. After identification, prey items were separated, counted, and weighted individually. Finally, statistical analyses were made for all the samples using this study database, containing predators and prey items. Results. A total of 76 prey species were identified in 962 lionfish stomachs; 47 of them represented fishes and 29&#8212;crustaceans. Fishes of families Pomacentridae, Labridae, and Scaridae were the most abundant diet components of lionfish. Rhynchocinetidae, Penaeidae, and Solenoceridae were the most representative Crustaceans families among the prey items. Molluscs were present as diet components only as incidental food. Conclusion. Red lionfish, known for its high competitive capacity, preyed more intensively on fishes than on crustaceans. Therefore, it is evident that the lionfish presence in the Mexican Caribbean may affect mainly the local population of reef fishes. The presently reported results contribute to a better understanding of the red lionfish invasion in the Caribbean.",

    "abstract": "Background. Five species of Ponticola have hitherto been recognized among freshwater gobies in the Ponto&#8211;Caspian basin. In 2014 a number of specimens representing this genus were collected in northern Iran. The detailed morphological and karyological study of those gobies collected revealed significant differences between them and their known congeners. The aim of this study was to describe these fish as a new species from the Caspian Sea basin. Materials and methods. The fish specimens were collected in August 2014 at two localities of the Sefid-Rud River drainage, and in the Gisum River, Guilan Province, northern Iran. In total, 18 specimens were used for karyological study following a previously described method. Both karyotyped and intact specimens were then morphologically investigated using characters developed for study on gobiids, and particular for freshwater Caucasian gobies. The comparative materials were specimens from museum collections, as well as published descriptions, illustrations, and measurements of other species. Results. Ponticola iranicus sp. nov. differs from its congeners in a set of the following features: D1 VI, D2 I/(14&#189;) 15&#189; &#8211; 17&#189;, A I/10&#189; &#8211; 13&#189;; nape scaled completely, scales cycloid; cycloid scales covering upper part of opercle; lateral line system with posterior sub-orbital row d2 continuous; predorsal area uniform, dark grey; first dorsal fin with oblique black stripe between first two or three rays; short dark grey strip on upper part of pectoral fin base; karyotype consisting of 46 acrocentric chromosomes. Conclusion. All known&#160; Ponto&#8211;Caspian gobies demonstrate mosaic pattern of morphological and karyological features that presumes their polyphyletic origins. Further phylogenetic studies by molecular genetic methods are necessary for identification of their marine ancestors and clarifying of common trends in the evolution of the Ponto&#8211;Caspian goby group.",

    "abstract": "Background. The Pacific red snapper, Lutjanus peru (Nichols et Murphy, 1922), is one of the most exploited species by artisanal fisheries in Mexico, where it is valued due to its high catch rates and economic value. This study investigated the feeding habits of L. peru in two ecosystems of the southern Gulf of California with contrasting physical and oceanographic conditions. Feeding habits were compared by sex (male or female), size (juvenile or adult), and season (cold or warm), in order to determine whether this species plays the same trophic role in the two ecosystems. Materials and methods. Samples were obtained from the northern Sinaloa coast (SIN region) and south-eastern Baja California Sur coast (BCS region). Percentages by number, weight, and frequency of each food category were determined, and the index of relative importance (%IRI) was calculated to define the main food categories. Diet breadth and diet similarity between sexes, sizes and among seasons were also calculated. Results. A total of 182 stomachs from the SIN region were analysed and 32 prey items from 15 families, 18 genera, and 25 species were identified. According to the index of relative importance (IRI), the most important prey items were the shrimp, Penaeus californiensis (73%); the ostracods, Myodocopida gen spp. (10%); and the squid, Loligo spp. (5%). A total of 233 stomachs from BCS were analysed and 31 prey items from 17 families, 19 genera, and 26 species were identified. The most important prey items according to the IRI were the red pelagic crab, Pleuroncodes planipes (42%); the ostracods, Myodocopida gen spp. (28%); and the shrimp, Penaeus californiensis (20%). Significant differences were identified in the trophic spectra by region, size and season. There were no significant differences by sex. Conclusion. Lutjanus peru displayed a specialist trophic behaviour, with differential utilization of the trophic niche and adequate food resource distribution.",

Observation of haematological parameters allows the most rapid detection of changes in fish after cadmium and nickel injection Disrupted haematological patterns appear very quickly and precede changes in fish behaviour and visible lesions. The rapidity of toxic effects exerted by xenobiotics is related to the blood&#8217;s transport function, with the blood distributing the metals to all the body parts. Materials and methods. Each experiment took 60 days and was divided into 8 stages during which blood was collected for assays. At each stage, blood samples were assayed for selected haematological parameters (RBC, WBC, Hb, Hct, MCV, MCHC, MCH). Results. Cadmium and nickel exposure-related changes in haematological parameters were detected. Immediately after injection, the haematological parameters were seen to change, a return to the normal values being observed after some time. The study allowed following the changes in the haematological parameters of cadmium- and nickel-injected carp during the process ofdetoxification. Conclusion.

The most suitable method of determining the reproductive cycle in fishes is to observe seasonal development changes in the gonads. The present paper describes morphological changes in gonads of Mystus montanus. Materials and methods. The individuals of M. montanus were sampled monthly in captive condition throughout one year to determine the changes occurring in gonadal histology and reproductive status. The stages of gonadal maturation and the seasonal changes in the proportion of oocyte development within the ovaries were noticed and maturity stages were assessed by microscopic and also macroscopic observations. Results. The peak spawning period of Mystus montanus was noticed during November-January in male and October-December in female. The size at first maturity was 10-11 cm (8-12 g) in male and 13-14 cm (14-16 g) in female, respectively. M. montanus spawned only once in a year with the onset of north-east monsoon. The gonadosomatic index (GSI) ranged from 2.8 to 8.5 in males and from 4 to 16 in females and their condition factor (CF) was 4-6 and 6-9, respectively. Conclusion. The sequence of gonadal maturation in M. montanus is morphologically and histologically divided into five stages viz. immature, maturing, mature, matured, and spent or rest.",

    "abstract": "Background. The aquaculture rainbow trout may be a valuable source of long chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (LC n-3 PUFA). In the retail these fish are mainly present as a whole or gutted. The present study was aimed at comparing changes occurring in lipids of whole and gutted rainbow trout stored in ice. Materials and methods. The analysis were performed after 0, 3, 7, and 14 days of storage in ice at 2°C and the following assays were carried out: proximate composition; lipid composition high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC); fatty acid composition gas chromatography /mass spectrometry (GC/MS) by direct tissue saponification; contents of lipids extracted, using the Bligh-Dyer technique; UV-VIS, IR, and fluorescence lipid spectra; peroxide value (PV); anisidine value (AsV); and acid value (AC). Results. Gutting prior to storage made it possible to extend the sensory shelf-life by about 2-3 days and affected the quantitative fatty acid composition and oxidation level during storage in ice. The rainbow trout lipids are resistant to oxidation; oxidation product decomposition rather than lipid oxidation proceeds during storage, the decomposition being more intensive in whole than in gutted fish. It is only when the fish lose their eating quality (2 weeks) that a small increase in the level of oxidation occurs, accompanied by an about 15% loss of n-3 PUFA and a 20% loss of DHA, but only in the whole fish. Conclusion. Gutting rainbow trout prior to storage in ice is appropriate by the extending the shelf-life by about 2-3 days and keeping stable amount of n-3 PUFA during 2 weeks of storage.",

    "abstract": "Background. The effect of the magnetic field on fish egg shells has not attracted major interest of researchers, even though it could have been predicted that such effect may be vital to fish embryogenesis. One of the hitherto-neglected aspects of the magnetic field action of fish eggs are the changes in the egg shell permeability and possible alteration of the process of embryogenesis. Studying this process and learning the associated phenomena may be important in explaining cases of substantial mortality of the embryos. Materials and methods. Fish eggs (Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L.; sea trout, Salmo trutta L.; and rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792) and isolated egg shells, in a custom-made osmometer setups, were subjected to the action of a stable magnetic field (2 mT). The ultrastructure of the egg-shells was studied using a scanning electron microscope (JEOL JSM 6100). Results. Stable magnetic field (2 mT), affecting fish eggs, caused statistically significant increase in the egg-shell permeability to water, in the period of the egg activation (and also less distinct increase during the entire embryogenesis). Conclusion. Weak, stable magnetic field increases egg-shell permeability to water affecting water management processes in fish eggs, during incubation. This phenomenon may have practical implications for fish hatcheries.",

    "abstract": "Background. Hyperostosis is a productive change characterized by an increase of the periosteal ossification combined to resorption of the bony tissue. It is common in several fish species. Its presence has been reported in the silver scabbardfish, Lepidopus caudatus (Euphrasen, 1788). The aim of the presently reported study is to improve the knowledge on the presence of hyperostotic pterygiophores in L. caudatus. Materials and methods. In total, 50 specimens of Lepidopus caudatus, captured off the coast of Messina (Sicily, Italy) were examined by radiography. Deformed pterygiophores were decalcified and processed for histopathological examination, and the sections obtained were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Results. Forty (80%) of the 50 specimens examined showed skeletal deformities exclusively on the pterygiophores of the dorsal fin. In total, 433 deformities were observed. Histological examination showed slight expansion of the bone tissue, which was poor in cells and characterised by thin layers of compact bone tissue. Macroscopic, radiographic, and histological findings were consistent with diagnosis of hyperostosis. Conclusion. Hyperostosis of L. caudatus does not affect its consumption. However, it may be a complication for filleting techniques as the presence of hyperostosis along the longitudinal axis of teleosts does not allow a complete and repeatable filleting technique. This could increase the possibility of bacterial contamination, loss of muscle tissue, and imperfections in cutting and trimming.",

    "abstract": "Background. Fish may experience periods of food deprivation or starvation in nature and under culture conditions. Because of the wild stock reduction of some sturgeon species, Siberian sturgeon, Acipenser baerii Brandt, 1869, has been used as a biological model of physiological and nutritional studies since the 1980s. There are no published records on the physiological responses of Siberian sturgeon to starvation. Hence, in this study the effect of short-term starvation (0, 2, 4, and 8 days) on plasma thyroid hormones (T3 and T4), total protein levels, and hepato-somatic- (HSI), viscero-somatic- (VSI), and digestive-somatic (DSI) indices in juvenile Siberian sturgeon was investigated. Materials and methods. The experiment was conducted at the International Sturgeon Research Institute of Rasht (Iran) in October 2009, using a semi-natural environment (natural photoperiod and natural water temperature fluctuations). After a period of adaptation (10 days on a formulated diet), 180 juvenile Siberian sturgeon individuals (mean weight ± standard error at start of experiment: 19.32 ± 0.43, n = 15) were randomly distributed among twelve circular, 500-L, fibreglass tanks with a flow-through system. In this trial, control (C) was fed a formulated diet to apparent satiation four times daily throughout the experiment. The other three groups were deprived of feed for 2- (2S), 4- (4S), and 8 (8S) days, respectively. At the end of the starvation periods, blood samples were collected to analyze biochemical and physiological parameters. Results. Plasma T3, T4, and total protein levels did not significantly vary between the fed and the starved fish. In comparison to the starved groups, after 8 days of starvation, plasma total protein in group 8S (3.43 ± 0.20) was markedly higher than in 2S (2.67 ± 0.07) and 4S (2.37 ± 0.12) groups. In the presently reported study, a decrease in the measured morphometric indices was observed with an increase in the length of the starvation period. Conclusion. The results suggest that Siberian sturgeon has metabolic adjustment ability to short periods of starvation due to reduced basal metabolism rate and energy reserves utilization during starvation.",

    "abstract": "Herring, Clupea harengus L., is an important commercial fish species in the Baltic Sea region since medieval times. The western Baltic spring spawning herring (WBSS) is one of three major Baltic Sea herring stocks, supporting a significant over-regional fishery in the western Baltic Sea as well as in the Kattegat and Skagerrak area. One major component spawns in the vicinity of the German island of Rügen and the associated major spawning ground, the Greifswalder Bodden (GWB), a shallow, semi-enclosed sub-system of estuarine character. Research of herring biology and ecology has an extensive history in the area probably due to the long fishery tradition and the importance of this particular herring stock for the local Baltic coast economy. In this review most of the scientific findings about WBSS in its spawning areas, mainly the GWB, is summarized. This study is based on critical review of over 120 publications and scientific sources from the past 100 years containing relevant information on possible consequences of multiple environmental and anthropogenic induced stressors of herring recruitment and productivity. Besides current peer reviewed literature a significant amount of grey literature was included, consisting primarily of papers and reports written in German language and representing the only historical data sources and published documentation of regional western Baltic herring ecology.",

    "abstract": "Background. The majority of the European populations of the Prussian carp, Carassius gibelio, consist predominantly of females reproducing by gynogenesis but include a small portion of males. Mechanisms for the occurrence of males in natural populations and their functions are still unclear. The aims of this study were to show the ploidy level by karyotype, some taxonomic characteristics by analysis of morphology, and the reproductive potential by histology of gonads of Prussian carp individuals of a certain age from two types of naturally existing unisexual triploid and a diploid-polyploid populations. Materials and methods. In total 31 specimens from three different populations inhabiting the Vistula River basin, the Baltic Sea watershed, have been analyzed. Kidneys were used to prepare chromosome slides using standard procedures. Air-dried slides were stained with Giemsa solution. For each fish, 23 metric characteristics of the body were measured. Selected meristic characteristics (external and internal) were determined. The gonads were fixed in buffered formalin or in Bouin's solution; histological sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). The developmental stages of germ cells and gonads were determined according to Rinchard and Kestemont and Billard. Results. All individuals of two populations were triploid females with high chromosomal variability from 150 to 160 chromosomes (and microchromosomes). Among individuals of the third population, males and females of 2n = 100 and one triploid male 3n = 160 (151–162) chromosomes were detected. The individuals from analyzed populations differed in the number of: branched rays in the dorsal fin, lateral line scales, serration in dorsal D and anal A fin rays, and vertebrae. Gonad histology of the ovaries indicated the females were mature at the age of 3. Testes morphology of diploids and one triploid male indicated their reproductive abilities. Conclusion. The results of the study confirmed the tendency to increase the number of males in C. gibelio populations. In several or some populations apart from diploid males a small number of fertile triploid males occur. High chromosomal variability within the females from unisexual populations may be influenced by their different mode of origin. The future research should be focused on karyological identification of other C. gibelio populations to explain the origin of triploid males and their role in reproduction.",

The Dniprodzerzhynsk reservoir is one of six reservoirs built on the Dnieper River, which currently supports important commercial and recreational fisheries. To date, there are no published data on the reservoir’s non-commercial fish species, among which gobies are considered to be the most abundant and important species. The goal of this work was to contribute to general knowledge on local gobiid fauna, focusing on their mesohabitat preferences. Materials and methods. Sampling in the Dniprodzerzhynsk reservoir was conducted during late August of 2011 and 2012 within the framework of routine annual juvenile fish surveys in the Dnieper reservoirs. Fish were collected at sampling sites located along the reservoir shoreline using a beach seine made of mill sieving gauze (1 mm mesh size). Mesohabitat features were recorded at each beach seine haul site, and included maximum depth, substrate type, and vegetation density. These data were used to identify fish mesohabitat preferences with the aid of Ivlev’s electivity index. Results. Seven gobiid species were collected: western tubenose goby, Proterorhinus semilunaris (Heckel, 1837); knout goby, Mesogobius batrachocephalus (Pallas, 1814); Pontian monkey goby, Neogobius fluviatilis (Pallas, 1814); round goby, N. melanostomus (Pallas, 1814); racer goby, Babka gymnotrachelus (Kessler, 1857); Pontian bighead goby, Ponticola kessleri (Gunter, 1861); and ratan goby, Ponticola ratan (von Nordmann, 1840). Ratan goby was recorded for the first time from this reservoir. Most frequently encountered were monkey goby (76.27%), followed by western tubenose goby (32.20%), racer goby (31.36%), round goby (14.41%), bighead goby (10.17%), while knout and ratan gobies were the most rare (each accounting for 1.69%). All gobiids showed preferences for certain mesohabitat features such as bottom substrate and aquatic vegetation density. Conclusion. The gobiid fauna of the reservoir is rich and is dominated by monkey goby. The occurrence of ratan goby, an estuarine and marine species that adapted to freshwater conditions, is an evidence for ongoing PontoCaspian gobiid invasion to the Dnieper reservoirs.",

    "abstract": "Background. Species identification from recovered fish scales, e.g., from the sediment or stomach contents, has proven to be problematic for clupeid species. To ensure reliable species discrimination within Clupeidae, we attempted to reveal inter- and intra-specific, as well as, the intra-individual variability of scale shape in two sympatric clupeid species the European pilchard, Sardina pilchardus (Walbaum, 1792) and the round sardinella, Sardinella aurita Valenciennes, 1847. Our aim was to test, whether the landmark-based geometric morphometric method is reliable for species identification from mixed samples. Materials and methods. The specimens of European pilchard and round sardinella were collected between May and October 2014 from the Gulf of Ambracia, Greece. The scale samples were taken from ten body areas (marked by letters A–J) of 487 specimens in total. A multiple-step analysis was conducted on randomly selected blind samples. The differences between body areas were assessed with canonical variate analysis (CVA) and discriminant function analysis (DFA) to compute generalized Mahalanobis distances (D) and discriminant functions (T2), respectively. Results. The CVA based on the total scale samples showed that in sardinella, all body areas differed significantly from each other (D = 2.54 ± 0.79, P < 0.001) except for one (area I vs. J: D = 22.36, P = 0.085). In pilchard, two body area pairs represented non-significant group pairs (area D vs. G: D = 1.03, P = 0.12; and area F vs. G: D = 1.21, P = 0.06), whereas all other areas were significantly different (D = 2.43 ± 0.88, P = 0.003). At the last step of the blind sampling procedure, all scales were correctly classified by species with an average discrimination rate as high as 96.3%. Conclusion. In contrast to scale identification based merely on morphology, the geometric morphometric method is capable of detecting differences in scale shape from mixed samples that are unattainable with the former approach. Therefore, a more reliable and effective species identification can be accomplished from recovered scales, especially when discriminating species within the same family or genus.",

    "abstract": "Background. In fishery biology, information on life-history traits is extremely useful for species conservation and the monitoring, management and sustaining of fish stocks. Nevertheless, detailed biological information is very limited for tropical fishes, especially for those with low economic value, such the Atlantic bumper, Chloroscombrus chrysurus (Linnaeus, 1766). This species is commonly captured by artisanal fisheries in tropical waters and the lack of information makes difficult the development of strategies for the proper management of the species. Therefore, the presently reported study intended to provide new data on the biological parameters of C. chrysurus to fill the gap in the existing knowledge. Materials and methods. Life-history traits of the Atlantic bumper, C. chrysurus, were estimated from 335 fish collected in a western Atlantic region during fishery surveys carried out between 2010 and 2012. Age and growth were determined by annuli counts of sagittal otoliths. Growth parameters were calculated by adjusting the back-calculated length-per-age to the von Bertalanffy growth model. Empirical equations and data on maturity were used to estimate the size and age at first maturity, as well as the optimum size and age. Theoretical longevity and natural mortality were also estimated for the species. Results. Six age classes were identified and asymptotic length (L&infin;), growth rate (k), and the theoretical age when the specimen was at zero length (t0) and for the whole population those parameters assumed the following values: L&infin; = 25.49 cm, k = 0.33 year&ndash;1, and t0 = 0.058 years. No evidence of sexual size dimorphism was found, with no significant differences in growth characteristics and in the length frequency distribution between sexes. The principal vital parameters were as follows: size (L50 = 15.8 cm) and age (T50 = 2.9+) at sexual maturity, optimum length (Lopt = 13.08 cm), and optimum age (Topt = 2.1+), as well as its theoretical longevity (A0.95 = 9.17) and natural mortality (M = 0.92) Conclusion. The determined size and age at sexual maturity, optimum length and age, theoretical longevity, and natural mortality indicate that the studied population of C. chrysurus is overexploited. The Atlantic bumper is vulnerable to fishing pressure and should be managed with caution.",

    "abstract": "Background. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are natural and anthropogenic compounds discharged into the environment known to disrupt the endocrine system of humans and animals by mimicking functions of steroids in vivo. Many important events occurring during early postembryonic development, in relation to the gene expression attracted our attention. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a sensitive and highly reproducible method for gene expression analysis, with gene expression levels quantified by normalization to reference gene. The aim of this study was to select the suitable reference gene after EDCs exposure and during early postembryonic development. Materials and methods. For the study of the fish age effect, juveniles of Gobiocypris rarus Ye et Fu, 1983, were obtained at: 18, 22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, and 50 days post fertilization (dpf). For mRNA expression analysis of the juvenile fish after EDCs treatment, the juveniles at 31 dpf were exposed to bisphenol A (BPA) (10 nM) and 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) (1 nM), respectively dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or solvent (0.001% DMSO, v/v) control group for 3 days. Cq values of the reference genes were obtained using qRT-PCR. The stability of these reference genes was analyzed by BestKeeper, geNorm, and NormFinder software, respectively. The expression of each reference gene was calculated using the 2–ΔCq method. In parallel, the mRNA expressions of cyp19a1b were normalized by the single most/least stable reference gene and the combinations of top-ranked reference genes. Results. In this study, six candidate reference genes, actb, ef1a, gapdh, g6pd, tbp, and tuba1, were chosen to analyze their expression stability in relation to fish age and in the juvenile fish exposed to BPA and EE2. During early postembryonic development of Gobiocypris rarus, actb,ef1a, and gapdh were identified as the most stably expressed reference genes. In the juvenile fish exposed to BPA and EE2 for three days, gapdh, and actb were the most stable. However, g6pd and tuba1 were identified as the least stably expressed genes during the early postembryonic development and under BPA and EE2 exposure. Conclusion. The presently reported study suggested that the mRNA expressions of the reference genes could be affected by chemical exposure or different physiological periods. In addition, it was indicated that stable reference gene should be selected to normalize the target gene expression to assure the correctness and accuracy of the experiment results. The last but not the least, we successfully obtained five commonly used reference genes of Gobiocypris rarus Ye et Fu, 1983, which can be applied in future studies serving as the stable reference gene and providing a broader range of selecting the stable reference gene.",

Fish farmers for decades have been using formaldehyde (FA) for control but this compound is problematic due to its carcinogenic and allergenic nature. Alternative auxiliary substances for bath treatment are needed and therefore we decided to compare efficacies of sodium percarbonate (SPC), peracetic acid (PAA), and hydrogen peroxide (HP) for control of ichthyobodosis in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Materials and methods. An experimental infection of Ichthyobodo necator on rainbow trout (2–3 g) was established (total parasite population up to 142 000 flagellates per fish) and duplicated controlled water bath treatments were conducted with specified water quality criteria. Four compounds: SPC (40, 80, and 120 mg · L–1), PAA (0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mg · L–1), HP (15 and 30 mg · L–1), and FA (40 and 80 mg · L–1) were tested. The compounds were applied for 2 h (as static freshwater bath treatments at 13°C) in 20-L aerated tanks (containing 10 L of the treatment solution). Results. FA at a concentration of 80 mg · L–1 and PAA at 0.3 mg · L–1 showed almost complete elimination of parasites but it was found that also SPC at a concentration of the 120 mg · L– was highly effective in eliminating I. necator. In addition, SPC and PAA (80 mg · L–1 and 0.2 mg · L–1, respectively) also significantly reduced the parasite load compared to untreated control fish. HP significantly reduced parasite populations at a concentration of 30 mg · L–1, but the compound elicited adverse reactions in fish. Conclusion. It is suggested that SPC and PAA may serve as alternatives to formaldehyde for control of ichthyobodosis in rainbow trout farms.",

    "abstract": "Background. Fishing is a primary activity of great importance in the Canaries and has traditionally played an important role in reducing poverty, in job creation, strengthening food security and sovereignty, and increasing the value of its products. This study is needed to analyze fishing contribution in a region strongly based on tourism. Aims were: to update the inventory of fishing techniques, to detail the biodiversity involved, and for the first time to analyze the contribution of the landings. We also identify threats to the activity and draft a plan with strategic actions for its sustainability. Materials and methods. Data on the fisheries and the 2007–2018 series of landings were taken from the regional government website. Once the database was refined, data were analyzed in main four environmental resource categories: shellfish (SHS), demersal fish (DMF), coastal pelagic fish (CPF), and oceanic pelagic fish (OPF). To analyze the economic contribution of the fisheries, first-sale reference prices were compiled from fisheries entities. To estimate the contribution of this sector to the regional GDP, its economic value was compared with the mean value of GDP for 2014–2018 GDP. Results. The versatility is the main characteristic of the fleet, which was stabilized around 600 vessels within 2016–2018. Fishing techniques vary enormously, and eight categories of fishing gear were identified. Total landings ranged between 5560 t in 2007 and 15466 t in 2016, with a mean value of 11 254 t · y–1. SHS reached a mean value of 111 t, representing only 1%, DMF 1683 t (16%), CPF 1926 t (17%), and OPF 7533 t (65%). Biodiversity targeted by these fisheries throughout the 2007–2018 period involved about 200 species. As a primary sector, the Canary Islands' fishing activity made a mean value of the economic contribution of €73.19 million per year at first-sale in 2007–2018, contributing 0.19% of the regional GDP overall during 2014–2018. When the fishing activity is considered together with other local socio-economic sectors in the value-added chain of seafood, it contributes acceptably to the regional economy. Conclusion. Overexploitation of fish stocks is the greatest problem to solve, followed by poaching and the growth of intense recreational fishing. Ad-hoc strategic and structured actions for the sustainable development of the fishing activity are proposed.",

    "abstract": "Background. The climate changes observed in the world over the past several decades strongly affect global aquaculture and fisheries. Ukraine is among the 24 countries, whose aquaculture and inland fisheries are currently facing medium stress, and will be potentially under higher stress in the future. The purpose of our work was to find a relation between air temperature and its impact on the spreading of infectious in freshwater aquaculture of Ukraine in the context of global climate change. Materials and methods. During 2011–2017, an epizootiological survey on experimental fishery farms of different patterns of ownership was conducted. The objects of research were the clinically healthy and diseased freshwater fish of different age groups, as well as parasites and bacteria of different etiological groups that affect aquatic organisms. A review of the clinical and parasitological study of different age groups and hybrids of silver carp, Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Valenciennes, 1844) and bighead carp, Hypophthalmichthys nobilis (Richardson, 1845), common carp, Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758, and some cultured rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792), and brown trout, Salmo trutta were conducted. Research methods common for ichthyopathology, microbiology, and fisheries were used. Results. The study on fish diseases was conducted both in aquaculture and natural waters, in particular in the reservoirs of the Dnieper Cascade. Not only the growth and development of fish but also the signs and the course of various diseases appeared to depend on water temperature. The resistance of the fish and other hydrobionts to the influence of threshold temperatures depends on their adaptation to particular factors. In the years with a relatively warm vegetation period, the infection rates significantly increased to 25% and above. A significant broadening of the spectrum of parasitic infections over the last decade has been noted. An ecological misbalance in the ecosystems, an increase in the level of organic pollution of water, and, as a result, in the number of pathogenic microorganisms that may be harmful to fish and human health were registered. Conclusion. Taking into account the results of the analytical studies regarding climate change in Ukraine, we can predict outbreaks of bacterial and parasitic diseases in fish in the years to come, which may cause significant economic damage to aquaculture farms.",

    "abstract": "Background. The Gotland Basin spawning ground is one of three main spawning areas of Baltic cod, Gadus morhua Linnaeus, 1758. The threshold water parameters for cod development are the salinity exceeding 11‰ and the oxygen level above 2 mL· L–1. Such conditions are only present when the 11‰ isohaline is above the 2 mL· L–1 isooxygen. In such situation the water volume between the isolines is called the “suitable reproduction volume”. When the position of the isolines is reversed, the salinity and the oxygen level of the water layer demarcated by them are below the required thresholds and as such the water is unsuitable for the cod development. We refer to it as the “unsuitable reproduction volume”. The main aim of the presently reported study was to examine whether variations in suitable and unsuitable reproduction habitat estimates could explain the fl uctuations in cod recruitment. Material and methods. The suitable and unsuitable reproduction volumes in the Gotland Basin were estimated based on single point observations at three oceanographic monitoring stations using the contouring software Balthypsograph. To test the spatial hydrological heterogeneity in the Gotland Basin we used 15 observations during 1969–1995 on four stations in each of two transects. The oceanographic monitoring and demersal trawl research survey data from 1974–2012 have been used in analyses. Results. The sufficient reproduction conditions in the southern Gotland Basin persisted only until 1981. In later decades the reproduction potential of the Gotland Basin has decreased. The latest major North Sea water infl ows in 1993 and 2003 in the Central Gotland Basin formed the suitable reproduction volume below the layers where cod eggs are fl oating. A significant relation between the recruit abundance and suitable and the unsuitable reproduction volumes was found only for the Southern Gotland Basin (P < 0.03). Conclusions. We demonstrated that single-point estimates sufficiently quantify the reproduction conditions in the Gotland Basin and thus can be used for estimation of the reproduction volumes. The unsuitable reproduction volume concept can be used as an ecological indicator for egg survival probability in the Gotland Basin. However, it is too premature to re-define the concept of the suitable reproduction volume because it is applicable only to the Gotland spawning ground",

These values can change during a fish life and therefore they are not related to the fish total length. We collected a total of 404 fish specimens from the Gulf of Tunis, including three pelagic species: Sardina pilchardus (Walbaum, 1792) (74 otolith pairs), Trachurus mediterraneus (Steindachner, 1868) (66 otolith pairs), and Chelon auratus (Risso, 1810) (60 otolith pairs) and three benthic species: Gobius niger Linnaeus, 1758 (77 otolith pairs), Mullus barbatus Linnaeus, 1758 (60 otolith pairs), and Trachinus draco Linnaeus, 1758 (67 otolith pairs). The relation between the total length and the otolith mass asymmetry was first calculated and compared, and then was evaluated. The comparison of the otolith mass asymmetry between benthic and pelagic species showed a significant difference ( P &amp;lt; 0.05), where the absolute mean value of X does not exceed the critical value (0.2) for all the studied species. No relation has been found between the magnitude of the otolith mass asymmetry and the length in both benthic and pelagic specimens. Environmental factors have an indirect effect on somatic growth and otolith accretion. The significant difference found in this study can be due to the difference between the benthic and pelagic environments.",

The data were collected weekly from May 2020 to September 2021 by commercial fishing vessels ( n = 62 days for trammel nets, n = 75 days for longlines). The results of the study indicated that more than 90% of the catch composition consisted of non-indigenous species in trammel net fishery and Pterois miles (Bennett, 1828), Siganus rivulatus Forsskål et Niebuhr, 1775, Siganus luridus (Rüppell, 1829), and Scarus ghobban Forsskål, 1775 were the most commonly caught species. Although indigenous species were more common in longlines compared with trammel nets, non-indigenous species Lagocephalus sceleratus (Gmelin, 1789) and Lagocephalus suezensis Clark et Gohar, 1953 were represented by relatively high catch ratios. The results also revealed that the CPUE of non-indigenous species exhibited seasonal differences. Although some non-indigenous species caught within this study have a market value, some other highly invasive species do not. Therefore, it is critically important to develop effective management tools to control bio-invasion. This study provides the first comprehensive research by utilizing basic data with relatively long-term surveys in the small-scale fishery on the Mediterranean coasts of Türkiye.

Concurrently (during general anaesthesia) fish behaviour was also observed. Results. The behavioural reactions were similar for all four treatments. The first symptom was agitation followed by sedation, loss of equilibrium, and deep anaesthesia. Small differences were observed during initial contact of fish with the anaesthetic. The ECG analysis, however, revealed significant differences in heartbeat and respiratory frequencies related to the concentration used. Irrespective of the MS-222 concentration used, the recovery time was similar in all treatments and did not exceed 5 minutes. Conclusion. The ECG method can be an important and objective tool supplementing the data acquired during visual observations of responses to anaesthesia. Its major advantage is the comparativeness of data.",

    "abstract": "Background. Luminous vibriosis caused by Vibrio harveyi, is a serious disease problem in shrimp aquaculture. The use of &quot;green water&quot;, a technique that involves the stocking of tilapia, Oreochromis in the reservoir for the production of green microalgae, Chlorella is believed to help in the reduction of the incidence of luminous vibriosis. Though most shrimp farmers have been using Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus for the production of &quot;green water&quot;, the mechanism involved in the efficiency of using this fish species in reducing luminous vibriosis remains unknown and is largely based on speculations. It was for this reason that the present experiment was conducted. The aim of the study was to determine the antibacterial activity of &quot;green water&quot; obtained from tank culture of Oreochromis mossambicus against Vibrio harveyi under laboratory conditions. Materials and methods. &quot;Green water&quot; collected from broodstock and juvenile tanks of Oreochromis mossambicus as well as water from a commercial shrimp pond, and filtered boiled seawater were inoculated with Vibrio harveyi. Luminous bacteria were counted in nutrient agar, while presumptive and green colony-forming vibrios were determined on thiosulfate-citrate bile salt (TCBS). The experiment was carried out for one week. Results. Luminous bacteria were not detected, and the presumptive and the green colony-forming vibrios were generally lowest in &quot;green water&quot; obtained from the broodstock tank. Luminous bacteria in &quot;green water&quot; obtained from juvenile tank were not detected starting day 5, indicating delayed inhibition. Conclusion. The present findings show that &quot;green water&quot; from broodstock tank of O. mossambicus has the ability to inhibit luminous vibriosis over a one-week period, and that broodstock are a better source of &quot;green water&quot; than juveniles in controlling luminous vibriosis.",

Sapphire damselfish, Pomacentrus pavo (Bloch, 1787) (family Pomacentridae) are reef fish found in tropical and temperate oceans but also are popular aquaria species in commercial and private operations; yet, there remains a paucity of information regarding diseases in this species. Thus, reporting of disease occurrences in this species is vital and serves as a foundation upon which to gather and build our knowledge base for this species. Materials and methods. Acaptive sapphire damsel presented with severe nonresolving abdominal distension. The fish was humanely euthanized and fixed tissues submitted for routine histological examination. Additionally, special histochemical stains were done including: periodic acid-Schiff&prime;s (PAS), modified acid-fast, Pearl&prime;s iron, and Gomori methenamine silver (GMS). Results. Grossly, a brown gelatinous material was coating the coelomic cavity and its contents, resulting in adhesion of the coelomic organs. The liver was diffusely pale. Histological examination revealed severe hepatocellular vacuolation and sheets of adipocytes replacing the hepatic parenchyma. Positive staining was observed in hepatocytes and pigmented macrophages with modified acid-fast, Pearl&prime;s iron, and periodic acid Schiff&prime;s. Inflammatory cell infiltrates were multifocally scattered throughout the abdominal fat and mesentery. Conclusion. The gross and histological findings were consistent with lipoid liver disease (ceroidosis), steatitis, and peritonitis. Possible contributing factors are vitamin E deficiency/depletion, rancid feed, and chronic stress. This case represents an initial documentation for this disease in this species.",

    "abstract": "Background. The work was the continuation of previous study, which indicated that melatonin influences the inhibition of hypothalamic dopamine secretion in vitro. In the presently reported study, the influence of melatonin injection into the third cerebral ventricle on the release of dopamine was tested. The aim of this study was to investigate if and how melatonin affects dopamine secretion in the hypothalamus of mature female carp. Materials and methods. The concentration of dopamine in hypothalamic tissue was determined radioenzymatically. The experimental groups were fish deprived of melatonin by pinealectomy, fish that received intraventricular injections of melatonin, fish that received intraventricular injections of physiological saline, and intact fish (control treatment). The study was carried out in the summer during spawning and in the winter when fish gonads were regressed. Results. Melatonin injection resulted in an increase in dopamine concentration in the hypothalamus, which indicates that melatonin influenced aminergic nuclei inhibiting secretion of dopamine. Dopamine probably remained unreleased in the hypothalamic tissue, whereas in pinealectomized fish the lack of melatonin influenced continuous dopamine secretion, what was shown as the low dopamine level in the hypothalamus. The results confirmed the previous study effect of melatonin in mature female carp, and point to an inhibitory effect of intraventricularly injected melatonin on the release of dopamine from the hypothalamus. This effect occurred only in the summer experiment, indicating a seasonal impact of melatonin on the dopaminergic system. Conclusion. By inhibiting the release of hypothalamic dopamine, which blocks gonadotropin secretion, melatonin has a potential stimulatory effect on the release of LH and in this way may be involved in control of reproduction in carp.",

    "abstract": "Background. The stinging catfish, Heteropneustes fossilis (Bloch, 1794), has recently raised interest among fish farmers, ornamental fish keepers, and pathologists. Its natural populations are threatened due to habitat loss and high fishing pressure. A number of factors may influence the reproductive success of this. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of one of such factors—the water hardness—on the course of the embryogenesis, the structure of the egg shell, the general morphology, and the behaviour of the hatched larvae. Materials and methods. The fertilised eggs were incubated at a constant temperature of 23 ± 0.2°C in water of different hardness: 0ºGH (soft), 9ºGH (moderately soft), 18ºGH (moderately hard). Egg membranes of activated eggs were viewed under a scanning electron microscope. Also egg membranes strength and egg deformations were determined 1.5 h after fertilisation. Images of eggs and newly hatched larvae, recorded with the observation sets described above, were measured and analysed. Results. The study showed the eggs were surrounded by thin, translucent, ~5 µm thick membranes equipped with numerous outgrowths on the external surface and porous on the inner side. The following observations were made within 828 h° (degree-hour) at 23 ± 0.2°C: the highest volume of eggs (1.16 ± 0.092 mm3) was typical for eggs incubated in soft water (0°GH), while the lowest egg volume (0.99 ± 0.113 mm3) was recorded in eggs incubated in moderately soft water (9°GH); yolks spheres were greenish in colour, the embryonic disc and the embryo itself being reddish; the embryo performed diverse movements (quasi-peristaltic, cardiac muscle contractions); after few hours of hatching, the pigments developed resulting in colour appearance; club-like primordial barbels were formed 24 h after hatching; the larvae commenced feeding on day 3 post hatching. Conclusion. Water hardness influences embryonic and larval development and the effects may be diverse. Low water hardness is recommended for egg incubation. However, the situation changed when the egg membrane protection ceased to exist at hatching. Increasing water hardness a few hours prior to the expected hatching time prevents larval deformation.",

    "abstract": "Background. The fishes of the genus Schizothorax, commonly known as snowtrouts, are a group of species that are difficult to distinguish based on external morphological characters. One of them, Schizothorax plagiostomus Heckel, 1838, is a commercially important freshwater fish with wide distribution along the Himalayan foothills. However, recent observations have indicated drastic declines and change in the stock structure of this species in many areas of its range due to the introduction of exotics, water impoundments (dams), and overfishing. Therefore, this study was intended to verify the variation in stock structure of this species in Kashmir Himalaya by using morphological characters generated by truss network analysis. Materials and methods. A total number of 189 specimens of S. plagiostomus were collected from three different water bodies of Kashmir Himalaya. A truss network was constructed by interconnecting 12 landmarks to form a total of 30 distance variables extracted from digital images of samples using tpsDig2 and PAST software platforms. The transformed truss measurements were subjected to principal component analysis, discriminant function analysis, and univariate analysis of variance for identification of different parameters responsible for population discrimination among these water bodies. Results. The principal component analysis generated nine components explaining 86.4% of total variance in samples. The step-wise discriminant function analysis retained two variables that significantly discriminated the populations. These two variables showed significant variation in head region, body depth, and caudal peduncle region of fish. Using these variables, 98.4% of the original groups were classified into their correct samples and 93.7% of cross-validated groups omitting one procedure were classified into their correct samples. Conclusion. This study has provided basic information about morphometric variation of S. plagiostomus, which could be indicative of the underlying stock structure of the species. A clear phenotypic divergence among S. plagiostomus samples revealed the existence of three differentiated groups viz., the Dal Lake population, the Jhelum River, and the Lidder River populations in Kashmir Himalaya. This study should be considered in fisheries management and commercial exploitation of this species and any stock enhancement program.",

    "abstract": "Background. Long whiskered catfish, Mystus gulio (Hamilton, 1822), enjoys a high consumer preference and market demand in many Asian countries including India. However, the growth of this fish is very slow under normal aquaculture conditions. The non-hormonal growth promoter—cholymbi—which contains minerals and the essential amino acids lysine and methionine, is widely used in livestock and poultry as a feed additive to improve growth and survival. Supplementing feed with cholymbi may increase the growth and survival of Mystus gulio. Materials and methods. A feeding trial was conducted to determine the effect of dietary cholymbi supplementation on growth, survival, and feed conversion ratio of long whiskered catfish fingerlings. Four isoproteic diets (crude protein 37%) were formulated to incorporate cholymbi at 0%, 0.25%, 0.50%, and 0.75% diet. The diets were fed to triplicate groups of fish twice daily to supply 5% of the total body weight per day for 120 days. Water quality parameters were maintained within the range suitable for catfish growth. Results. Weight gain (WG), protein efficiency ratio (PER) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were all affected by diet (P < 0.01, 0.001, and 0.001, respectively). The group fed the 0.50% cholymbi diet had the highest WG and PER and the lowest FCR, although not significantly different from the group fed the 0.25% cholymbi diet. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) in carcass proximate composition of catfish fed diets containing these different levels of cholymbi. Gut protease, amylase, and lipase activities were stimulated by dietary inclusion of cholymbi at all levels compared to control. Conclusion. As cholymbi is a newly introduced dietary supplement for fish, more research is needed to optimize its supplementation to improve growth, PER, FCR, and survival of long whiskered catfish. Until then, a diet with 0.50% cholymbi can be recommended to improve the aquaculture production of this species.",

    "abstract": "Background. The omnivorous freshwater loach, Lepidocephalichthys guntea (Hamilton, 1822)inhibiting unique ecological niche where oxygen content is low. Its alimentary canal is remarkably short, which is surprising considering the fact that this fish is an omnivore. This peculiarity can be correlated with the specific nature of food. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the mucosal adaptation of the intestine in adult L. guntea with respective digestive- as well as respiratory function. Materials and methods. The surface design of the mucosa of different sections (anterior, mid, and posterior) of the intestine of L. guntea were studied using light and scanning electron microscope following commonly accepted procedures. Results. The mucosa of the anterior intestine was provided with various types of mucosal folds and crowded with almost closely oval or rounded columnar epithelial cells with prominent microridges. The irregular mucosal surface of the mid intestine was exemplified by regularly spaced columnar epithelial cells with minute and prominent microridges/microvilli. On the contrary, irregular mucosal folds with stumpy villi were detected in the posterior intestine. The mucosal surface of that region was made up of columnar epithelial cells containing inconspicuous microridges. In that region the submucosa was provided with increasing number of blood vessels. Various cellular elements in the anterior and mid intestine were accordingly adapted to serve the important functions of absorption and gas exchange. However, the arrangement of low mucosal folds and dense blood capillaries in between the folds in the posterior intestine unequivocally suggested its respiratory role. Conclusion. The micro-architectural pattern and cellular architecture of the anterior intestine and middle intestine of L. guntea unequivocally suggests that these two regions are adapted to serve major role of digestion and absorption process. However, major changes that appear in the posterior intestine are considerably reduction of the absorptive area and the penetration of blood capillaries in between the columnar epithelial cells. Therefore, the posterior intestine of L. guntea is probably adapted to suit its role for aerial respiration. However, further investigation is needed the detailed physiological processes involved for aerial respiration in the region concerned.",

    "abstract": "Background. Loach fishes, Cobitis sp., are found in the majority of streams in the southern Caspian Sea basin, but reproductive parameters of them are barely known. Reproductive conditions are key parameters of fish populations and their assessment is very important for several reasons. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to obtain reproductive characteristics of this fish which will be a first report for the basin. Materials and methods. Sampling was done at monthly intervals throughout the year and 226 individuals of Cobitis sp., were caught from the Babolrud River in the southern Caspian Sea basin, north of Iran. Age, sex ratio, fecundity, oocytes diameter, gonadosomatic- and modified gonadosomatic indices were estimated. Regression analyses were used to find relations between fecundity and fish size (length and weight), gonad weight, and age. Results. Sex ratio differed significantly from unity, and the percentage of females was greater than that of males. The mature females and males were longer than 45 and 35 mm in total length (+2 and +1 in age, respectively). The average egg diameter was 0.58 mm. The spawning took place from beginning of May to late July, when water temperature was between 19.1 and 24.6&deg;C. Average GSI value at the beginning of the reproduction period was 8.93% and ranged between 4% and 26% in ripe, mature females. The average of absolute and relative fecundity was calculated 2172 and 590, respectively. The absolute fecundity was significantly related to body weight and gonad weight. Conclusion. Based on the pattern of gonadosomatic index, it was concluded that this fish has a prolonged active reproductive period. Their reproduction in this basin shows some differences from other reports, which might be related to different environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Background. Previous reports emphasized exo-enzyme production and pathogen inhibition as major criteria to select putative probiotics in carps. However, adhesion ability to the gut epithelium could be one of the decisive factors. The presently reported study was aimed to determine the probiotic potential of autochthonous bacteria isolated from gastrointestinal (GI) tract of rohu, Labeo rohita (Hamilton, 1822). Apart from characterization of functional probiotic attributes and bio-safety, the presently reported study utilized in vitro model system for preliminary selection of potentially adherent strains. Materials and methods. Altogether, 126 exo-enzyme producing bacteria were isolated from the proximal (PI) and distal (DI) segment of the GI tract and evaluated for enzyme-producing ability (viz., amylase, protease, lipase, cellulase, phytase, xylanase). Pathogen inhibition was tested by cross-streaking and double-layer method. Based on the cumulative results, isolates LR3H1A and LR3F3P were selected and identified by phenotypic and 16S rRNA partial gene sequence analyses. Both the strains were tested for their ability to grow in fish mucus, tolerance to fish bile, and bio-safety. Cell surface characteristics of the strains were analysed by aggregation assays and bio-film forming ability was determined through adherence to glass and polystyrene surfaces. Results. Seven strains (PI-4, DI-3) were primarily selected as efficient exo-enzyme producers, of which 3 strains (PI-2, DI-1) were found to be antagonistic against &ge;1 of the 6 tested fish pathogens. Partial characterization of the cell-free supernatant revealed that the antagonistic compound was proteinaceous, showing its maximum efficacy at 30&deg;C and pH 7. Isolates LR3H1A and LR3F3P were identified as Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii (KF623286) and Bacillus tequilensis (KF623287), respectively. Both the strains grew well in fish mucus, tolerated diluted bile juice, and showed evidence of bio-safety. Both the strains were categorized as a moderate bio-film producer, although LR3F3P was noticed to possess stronger cell surface hydrophobicity, auto&#8208;aggregation and co&#8208;aggregation capacity than LR3H1A. Conclusion. Owing to better colonization potential, presently reported study indicated B. tequilensis LR3F3P as a putative probiotic for feed application.",

    "abstract": "Background. Understanding the life history of a species is essential for fully understanding its role within an ecosystem. However, many of the fish species of high ecological value have not been studied due to their less prominent roles in local recreational and commercial fisheries in comparison to other targeted species. These valuable fishes are also important trophic linkages between small neritic fishes and large, economically valuable apex predators. This study describes for the first time the yearly age and growth patterns of three small tuna species inhabiting South Florida (USA) waters: blackfin tuna, Thunnus atlanticus (Lesson, 1831); little tunny, Euthynnus alletteratus (Rafinesque, 1810); and skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis (Linnaeus, 1758). Materials and methods. Tuna specimens were collected in two ways: via donations obtained from various fishing tournaments and charter captains in the areas of the Florida Straits as well as hook-and-line catches performed especially for this project. Age determination was based on sagittal otolith hyaline deposition patterns. Marginal increment analysis was used as an indirect validation method. Growth parameters were determined by comparison of the fish fork length and the hyaline band measurements. Results. Two hyaline bands formed each year in all three species—one in winter and one in summer. The von Bertalanffy growth equation produced a growth rate for each species: blackfin tuna, L¥ = 95.34 cm, K = 0.28, and t0 = –1.53; little tunny, L¥ = 77.93 cm, K = 0.69, and t0 = –0.69; and skipjack tuna, L¥ = 112.76 cm, K = 0.24, and t0 = –1.70. Parameters of each resulting von Bertalanffy equation were compared among species showing that little tunny grew the fastest, but skipjack had the largest estimated size. Results were also compared with growth rates currently used in stock assessments by fisheries management organizations, such as the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). Conclusion. Sectioned otoliths indicate two bands a year for these three species in the Florida Straits. Results were comparable to other studies, with a similar finding of two bands per year in hard parts for these species. Further knowledge of these populations will aid in stock assessments for these species and the ongoing shift to ecosystem-based management plans.",

Increased seahorse trade globally has posed a threat to seahorse populations worldwide. Thailand has been reported to be one of the major seahorse exporter countries, but study on seahorse fisheries and trade is limited. The presently reported study surveyed seahorse trade on the east coast of the Gulf of Thailand. Materials and methods. A total of 23 fishing ports, docks, and villages along the east coast of the Gulf of Thailand were surveyed from March 2011 through November 2012. The fishermen and primary traders were interviewed and samples of captured seahorses were examined aiming to assess the trade species and volumes, fishing method used, prices, trade routes, and the destinations of the trade. Results. Live seahorses were obtained solely from artisanal fisheries and were mainly supplied for domestic, public, and home aquaria through primary and secondary traders. Live trade comprised 4 species, Hippocampus mohnikei Bleeker, 1854, H. kuda Bleeker, 1852, H. spinosissimus Weber, 1913, and H. trimaculatus Leach, 1814. The prices varied dependent on size and species. The majority of seahorse trade was from the dried trade, originating mainly from non-selective trawlers in middle scale fisheries. Three species, H. kuda, H. spinosissimus, and H. trimaculatus, were found in the dried trade. Dried seahorses were mainly exported for their use in traditional Chinese medicine. The prices of dried seahorses depended on their size and fishing method used. Trade routes of both live and dried seahorses involved several levels of traders; more levels of traders were involved in the dried trade. Conclusion. Non-selective trawlers were the main source of seahorse supply along the east coast of the Gulf of Thailand. Restriction of fishing equipment used or defining protection areas may help conserving the seahorse population in Southeast Asia. Further surveys of seahorse distribution and trades covering Thai waters will provide complete information of trades in Thailand.",

    "abstract": "Background. The Neotropical genus Austrolebias is the most diverse of the Rivulidae family, with 22 species recorded in Brazil, with 21 found in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. Austrolebias quirogai Loureiro, Duarte et Zarucki, 2011 is an annual fish previously only found in Uruguay and there is currently no information about their ecology and life history. Here, we recorded A. quirogai for the first time in temporary wetlands in Brazil. Furthermore, we provide information about population parameters, life history traits, conservation status, and habitat characteristics. Materials and methods. We captured the fish with a D-shaped hand net in a sampling survey carried out in October 2012 in the Jaguar&#227;o-Chico River, Acegu&#225; municipality, Brazil. We analysed density (CPUA), body size, length&#8211;weight relation (LWR), condition factor (K), and sex ratio. Results. We recorded a total of three populations of Austrolebias quirogai in the Jaguar&#227;o-Chico River. The CPUA was 0.33 fish &#183; m&#8211;2. The sex ratio relation did not differ significantly and was 1.5 : 1 (M : F). The mean body size between sexes was not statistically different. The LWR of A. quirogai was W = 0.011TL3.23. The value of parameter b was significantly different from 3.0 for males and females, both sexes presenting positive allometric growth. The K for A. quirogai differed between sexes. Females had higher values than males. All populations of A. quirogai were found in ponds smaller than 1000 m&#178; and were degraded by the activity of rice and soybean cultivation and overgrazing. We consider A. quirogai an endangered species in Brazil because of: its reduced area of occupancy, populations becoming severely fragmented, and suffering a continuous decrease in their area of occupancy and the quality of habitat. Conclusion. The observed results may be used to assist the development of management strategies and conservation of the species and its habitat. Moreover, they provide basic information for the evaluation of the conservation status of the species according to IUCN criteria and for the definition of priority areas for conservation in southern Brazil. Further studies should focus on the distribution, life history and ecology of the species to aid in their conservation.",

    "abstract": "Background. In taxonomic studies of fish, the use of preserved samples has been a common practice. Under the framework of morphometrics, the effect of the preservation techniques on body shape is rarely taken into account. Changes during preservation can cause errors in the results, which may eventually lead to wrong conclusions. To explore the effect of a traditional preservation procedure, we quantified the changes in body shape and size of the golden mojarra, Diapterus aureolus (Jordan et Gilbert, 1882), using geometric morphometrics. Materials and methods. Fish fresh samples were photographed and frozen for at least seven months. Then, they were set in 10% formaldehyde, and passed through a wash of tap water and submerged in 70% ethanol. After five months the samples were photographed again. The differences between the mean shapes of two data groups (fresh fish and fixed specimens) were calculated by using the Procrustes distance. Effects associated with preservation were visualized by comparing the mean shape from each group, using a thin plate spline. A canonical variate analysis was carried out to detect the degree of intra- and inter-specific variation with D. brevirostris as an outgroup. Also, matrices of correct classification, based on Mahalanobis distances, were obtained. Results. Procrustes distance between the two data sets was statistically significant (P &#60; 0.001), suggesting that the fixation process produces changes in body shape. Canonical Variate Analysis verified that there were significant differences among three groups (fresh D. aureolus, fixed D. aureolus, and D. brevirostris; P &#60; 0.001 for both CV1 and CV2), which were correctly classified (98.9%). In spite of the significant differences detected between the fresh and fixed data sets, these were less than those found in the outgroup. The pooled data of all specimens belonging to D. aureolus (fresh and fixed) produced a definitive correct classification (100%) between D. aureolus and D. brevirostris, indicating that the differences caused by the preservation method is not enough to confound species and, consequently, taxonomic integrity was totally acceptable. Conclusion. Our results show a change in size and shape that are consistent with changes obtained with this and other methods applied to other species: generally shapes change and sizes tend to shrink with preservation of specimens. This is probably caused by dehydration from freezing and thawing, exposure to ethanol, and dissolution of skeletal structures caused by formaldehyde. While this effect was clear, it was not enough to confuse species. Caution is advised when working with groups with a close relation (populations or not clearly-defined species). We recommend a similar exercise with a case study with these levels of divergence.",

    "abstract": "Background. Biological invasions represent a threat to the ecological stability of the ecosystem. Two lionfish species, the red lionfish and the devil firefish—both tropical marine predators native to the Indo–Pacific—were introduced to the Atlantic Ocean. However, only one—the red lionfish, Pterois volitans (Linnaeus, 1758)—has reached the level of an invasive species so far. It is crucial to learn its biology and ecology to understand trends of its invasion and impacts on native fauna, and to determine ecological changes as the invasion progresses. This study reports the growth and mortality of P. volitans in coral reefs of the Parque Nacional Arrecife Alacranes, off the northern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, in Southern Gulf of Mexico. Materials and methods. Lobster diver fishers participated in voluntary captures of lionfish during the lobster fishing seasons of 2010–2012. In the laboratory, lionfish were taxonomically identified, measured, and weighed. Their length–weight relation was determined according to the commonly used equation: W = aTLb. Fish total lengths were used to calculate the parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) of lionfish based on the size-frequency analysis routine ELEFAN in the FiSAT II software. Results. A total of 776 lionfish (9.0 to 38.9 cm in total length, 7 to 874 g in total wet weight) were collected. The VBGF parameters estimated were L∞ = 42 cm, K = 0.88–1, t0 = –0.107 years. The total mortality instantaneous rate (Z) calculated by the total length converted catch curve was 2.06 year–1. Conclusion. This study provides first calculation of growth parameters and mortality of P. volitans in Southern Gulf of Mexico as determined by size-frequency analysis. Results contribute to the knowledge on the biology of P. volitans and to a better understanding of aspects of its biological invasion in the region.",

    "abstract": "Background. The global community infers trends in fisheries through the catch data assembled by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) from its member countries. Thus, inferences depend on the quality of the member country data, and hence their national data collection systems. Syria&#8217;s national catch data are assembled from market assessments (market sales) from a subset of fish markets, therefore exclude non-commercial landings and direct sales that by-pass markets. Furthermore, discards are also not accounted for. Our goal was to provide comprehensive estimates of Syrian marine catches for 1950&#8211;2010 by fishing sectors plus major discards, using a catch reconstruction approach. Materials and methods. Catches were estimated from 1950&#8211;2010, by industrial (large-scale commercial), artisanal (small-scale commercial), recreational (small-scale non-commercial), and subsistence (small-scale non-commercial) sectors, plus major discards. We reviewed published literature, grey literature, and unpublished data from local experts to obtain a first comprehensive estimate of total Syrian catches (landings + discards). Results. The reconstructed catch for 1950&#8211;2010 (including reported data) is nearly 170&#160;000 t, which is 78% more than Syria reports to the FAO. By 2010, reconstructed catch was over 2 times the reported data. The reconstruction added 74&#160;000 t of unreported catches, consisting of 38&#160;600 t of artisanal-, 16&#160;000 t of industrial-, 4000 t of recreational-, and 3000 t of subsistence catches, plus around 12&#160;000 t of discards. Syrian fisheries are dominated by the artisanal sector (67% of total catch, including discards), while industrial, recreational and subsistence catches account for 29%, 3%, and 2%, respectively. Discards accounted for 7% of total catch. Conclusion. Our reconstructed catch estimates for Syria provide a comprehensive account of total removals by Syria for 1950&#8211;2010. This study also supports other observations that the state of the fisheries is declining due to overexploitation, as suggested by the observed increase in fishing effort, declining CPUE and the amount of juvenile fish in catches. More effective management measures are needed to ensure Syrians can benefit more from their local fisheries.",

    "abstract": "Background. The socio-economic characteristics of small-scale fisheries have rarely been documented in the eastern Mediterranean. This study aimed to determine the current socio-demographic status, historical changes in demography and fishing activity, fishing expenditures, and the main problems of small-scale fisheries in the Aegean Sea. Materials and methods. Data were collected in 2018, using face-to-face questionnaires from small-scale fishers (n = 190) representing three sub-regions (northern, central, and southern Aegean Sea). The questionnaire included information regarding the main characteristics of fishing vessels, demographic characteristics of fishers, expenditures involved, and other important issues. Furthermore, some demographic characteristics (e.g., age and marriage status) and fishery-specific characteristics (e.g., active fisher ratio) observed in our study, were compared to the published data, to reveal if any changes have prevailed historically. Results. The mean age of fishers was 50 ± 10 years, and many of them were married males with primary school education. The highest two fisheries expenditures were fuel and oil expenses and personnel (crew) expenses. The fisheries expenditures did not show a statistically significant difference in terms of geographical location. However, there was a significant difference in the total fisheries expenditures depending on fishery type; fishers who use an encircling net reported higher expenditures, in comparison to other fishing types. The results showed that the active fisher ratio and the ratio of fishers who do not have other income has decreased significantly over the last 10 years. In addition, engine power (kW) showed a significant increase over the last 15–16 years. The main problems identified were insufficient inspection, illegal fisheries, and a decrease in stocks. Conclusion. Increased fishing expenditures and decreasing fish stocks in the Aegean Sea resulted in a decrease in the number of active fishers. Therefore, many fishers tended to have additional jobs, and some of them considered leaving fishing. To maintain the sustainable management of the small-scale fisheries in Turkey, we suggested that the catch and fishing effort should be monitored using the mandatory logbooks, and the hook number should be standardized.",

The experiments for obtaining backcrosses were conducted in the Luchegorsk experimental station of the TINRO Centre in 2010. 16 one-year-old backcross hybrids sterlet × (sterlet × kaluga) and 14 one-year-old backcrosses kaluga × (sterlet × kaluga) were karyologically studied by using previously described method. From one to 23 metaphase plates were analyzed from every studied fish. Results. Average chromosome numbers in 14 backcross hybrids sterlet × (sterlet × kaluga) varied from 139 to 157. It means that hybrid males (sterlet × kaluga), participated in their origin, produced spermatozoa with 79–87 chromosomes. Two other backcrosses sterlet × (sterlet × kaluga) had about 178 and 184 chromosomes. Thus, they got 118–124 chromosomes from their fathers. Among backcrosses kaluga × (sterlet × kaluga), 11 specimens had 201–214 chromosomes, and three specimens: 219–223. It means that hybrid males, participating in their origin, should produce spermatozoa with 66–84 and 84–93 chromosomes, respectively. Conclusion. This study suggests non-random generation of chromosome sets in spermatozoa of fertile sterlet × kaluga hybrids. However, the mechanisms of meiosis, providing a non-random production of spermatozoa with similar numbers of chromosomes, are still unknown.",

    "abstract": "Background. A wide range of morphological anomalies, including abnormalities in scale shape and structure, have been described from a large number of fish species worldwide. Quite often, such reports linked the observed abnormalities to the quality of aquatic environment. The presently reported study was initiated to explore and categorize the abnormalities found in the scales of seven freshwater fish species of Czech Republic: Ctenopharyngodon idella (Valenciennes, 1844); Gymnocephalus cernua (Linnaeus, 1758); Hypophthalmichthys molitrix (Valenciennes, 1844); Hypophthalmichthys nobilis (Richardson, 1845); Leuciscus idus (Linnaeus, 1758); Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758; and Sander lucioperca (Linnaeus, 1758). The observed abnormalities are discussed in the context of contaminated aquatic environments with the intention to understand the aetiology of the abnormalities. Materials and methods. Samples were collected at 3 sites (ponds) in the Czech Republic. In total, 10 200 scales were collected, cleared in 1% potassium hydroxide, and observed under a light microscope. Four variables were measured for each scale: anterior–posterior length (major axis, MAA), dorsal–ventral length (minor axis, MIA), diameter of the focus in the centre of the scale, number of radial lines (radii) starting from near focus, and the ratio of major to minor axes were calculated as a measure of scale shape. Results. The anomalous scales, 63 in total, were collected from ten different body regions in seven species studied. They exhibited different shapes and sizes: 30 scales showed severe anomalies and 33 only slight ones. Based on the MAA : MIA ratio, the majority of the scales examined had a narrow to rectangular or broad to squarish shape. Elongated scales were only obtained from H. molitrix, H. nobilis, and C. idella. There were one square-shaped and 8 rectangular-shaped scales in G. cernua, 3 and 6 in P. fluviatilis, and 2 and 1 in S. lucioperca. Conclusion. The presently reported cases of fish scale abnormalities should direct the future work on the relations between the state of the environment and fish health. Another interesting question to answer would be to determine whether or not the removal of abnormal scales would lead to replacement by either normal or abnormal scales.",

    "abstract": "Background. Fish epidermal mucus is a key component of innate immune system and plays a major role in protecting fish against invading pathogenic microbes. The information on the role of epidermal mucus components is insufficient for many commercially important freshwater fish species. Hence, this study was directed to understand the innate immune components of epidermal mucus in these fish species. Materials and methods. Mucus samples were obtained from African catfish, Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822); Indonesian snakehead, Channa micropeltes (Cuvier, 1831); striped snakehead, Channa striatus (Bloch, 1793); marble goby, Oxyeleotris marmorata (Bleeker, 1852); Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758); and Asian redtail catfish, Hemibagrus nemurus (Valenciennes, 1840). The variation in the protein profile of the mucus were observed using SDS-PAGE analysis. The specific activities of various hydrolytic enzymes including lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase, esterase, and protease were analysed in the mucus and the levels of enzyme activities were compared among the experimental fishes. We also elucidated the effect of various protease inhibitors on the protease activity and identified the type of proteases in the fish mucus by azocasein hydrolysis assay and zymography. Results. Significantly (P < 0.05) highest levels of lysozyme-, alkaline phosphatase-, and esterase activities were observed to be 15.77, 18.96, and 10.65 U · mg–1 protein respectively in C. striatus followed by 13.67, 15.06, and 16.67 U · mg–1 protein, respectively in C. gariepinus. The highest level of protease activity was recorded in H. nemurus (1630.97 U · mg–1 protein) and C. gariepinus (1596.4 U · mg–1 protein). A wide range of variation was noticed in the enzyme activities of fishes, even from the same genus, for example C. micropeltes and C. striatus. Specific inhibitors were added to azocasein hydrolysis assay and zymography experiments to characterize the individual proteases present in the mucus of each fish species. This result revealed the highest level of serine proteases in mucus of redtail catfish and African catfish compared to cysteine and metalloproteases. In contrast, Indonesian snakehead and marble goby had similar levels of serine, cysteine and metalloproteases. Conclusion. This study provides an insight into the presence of various epidermal mucus enzymes in fishes and therefore believed to be the components of innate immune system that may possibly provide protection for the fish against invading pathogenic microbes.",

    "abstract": "Background. Poultry by-product meal (PBM) has been used as a potential substitute for fish meal (FM) in aquaculture feeds. However, there are concerns that high replacement of FM protein with PBM protein could adversely affect of the fish flesh quality, due to lowered (Σ n-3 PUFA) fatty acids content. While fatty acid composition of fish muscle has critical importance in human nutrition, the fish liver is a key organ that facilitates digestion of feed and plays an important role in fish digestive system. As has been recently demonstrated, the monitoring of this organ is important in FM replacement experiments. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential use of PBM on the fatty acid composition of the muscles and on the histological structure of the liver of fry of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758). Materials and methods. Five isonitrogenous (34%, crude protein), isolipidic (9%, crude lipid), and isoenergetic (15 MJ · kg–1, digestible energy) diets were formulated to contain graded levels of PBM, where FM protein was replaced with PBM protein at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% level with lysine-, methionine-, and threonine supplementation. Triplicate groups of 20 fish (mean weight 0.879 g) were fed three times daily to apparent satiation for 12 weeks. Results. At the end of the experiment, the fatty acid contents of the fish muscle were significantly affected by the experimental diets. As the FM content decreased, there was no reduction of saturated fatty acids; the diet with lowest FM protein percentage having the highest monounsaturated fatty acids and lowest polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) proportions. The replacement of FM by PBM had a profound impact on the fatty acid composition of tilapia muscle with an increase in Σ n-6 PUFA and a decrease in the Σ n-3 and Σ n-3 : Σ n-6 PUFA ratio. The histological examination of liver tissue in all treatments of this study, revealed no histological abnormalities. Conclusion. The replacement of FM with PBM (range 0%–100%) significantly decreases the amount of docosahexaenoic acid (12.2%–1.2%) and eicosapentaenoic acid (4.4%–0.4%) in the muscle of fish. Therefore, further study is needed with PBM as a substitute of FM to determine acceptable fatty acid composition for commercial production.",

All these species had been previously reported only from higher latitudes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, leading to their classification as anti-equatorial. Their presence in equatorial Indonesian waters at 1.4°N latitude suggests that their distributions extend beyond those usually regarded as anti-equatorial and that a re-evaluation of their biogeographical classification would be in order. In particular, the need for further research on deep-sea fish diversity in extremely low latitude regions is highlighted.",

No studies, however, have been conducted on this monogenean’s infection dynamics. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and mean abundance of L. floridanus on channel catfish fry in a cohabitation experiment. The experiment was performed in triplicate and involved the introduction of five infected fish to a 40-L aquarium that contained 30 naive fish. The trial lasted 29 days and was conducted in a system with a continuous water flow. The percentage of naive fish that were infected increased sharply, from 0% to 100%, between the second and third days after cohabitation. On the subsequent days of the experiment, 100% prevalence was observed, except for days 23 and 26, when it was 66%. The dynamics of infection with L. floridanus showed its main peak five days after cohabitation, exhibiting a dome-shaped function. The left side of the fitted function represented the abrupt increase in parasite abundance in a few days, while the right side depicted its gradual decrease. One would expect that when L. floridanus enters the catfish culture system, it will be able to infect all fish (100% prevalence) within a few days. This would occur primarily in floating cage culture systems, where fish density is usually high. The parasite can disperse rapidly throughout all the gill arches when its abundance exceeds a certain threshold. Further studies on the reproductive patterns of this parasite and the factors affecting its variability are necessary to have a better understanding of its host dynamics and life cycle parameters.",

The objective of this study was to provide a detailed description of the urohyal bone of two species of Tlaloc — Tlaloc labialis (Günther, 1866) and T. candalarius (Hubbs, 1924)—and to evaluate the usefulness of this osteological structure in delimiting these taxa. The urohyal bone is a single bony structure located in the ventral part of the head in both species and is the result of ossification of an unpaired tendon of the sternohyoideus muscle. Data from cleared and double-stained museum specimens of the focal taxa were analyzed, including morphometric measurements of each urohyal bone taken using an ocular micrometer connected to a stereomicroscope. We found the most notable difference between the two species was the height of the urohyal neck, which was significantly narrower in T. candalarius (6.66%–11.11% of total urohyal length) than in T. labialis (13.15%–25%) based on the non-parametric Mann–Whitney U test. Our results show that measuring the urohyal bone offers a reliable and attractive alternative for taxonomic determination of Tlaloc labialis vs. T. candalarius due to the operational simplicity and speed of such measures. Our work also highlights the utility of more detailed osteological analyses in taxonomic and systematic studies of profundulids.",

    "abstract": "The Pacific white shrimp, Penaeus vannamei Boone, 1931, is one of the valuable globally-cultured species. However, its production in the Philippines has declined due to disease outbreaks. One essential approach to improve shrimp production is the use of domesticated broodstock to produce pathogen-free larvae, combined with well-formulated maturation diets, although fresh feeds can pose risks like disease transmission and water quality issues. Golden apple snail foot tissue meal (GASFTM) presents a cost-effective alternative protein source to squid meal, offering high protein content and the potential to improve aquaculture feed formulations. A 32-day feeding trial evaluated the effects of GASFTM on ovarian maturation of P. vannamei female broodstocks. Five isonitrogenous and isolipidic experimental diets containing increasing levels of GASFTM: control (0%), T1 (25%), T2 (50%), T3 (75%), and T4 (100%) were formulated. Polychaetes/squids and a basal control diet were used as the positive and negative controls, respectively. Each treatment with triplicate groups of 15 unilaterally eyestalk-ablated shrimp female broodstocks at early stages of ovarian development was fed with test diets. The ovarian development was tracked every four days. The results showed that the maximum ovary shadow ratios (OSR) as a measure of ovarian size was not different among the treatments. Ovarian maturation time (OMT) defined as the period between the initial and maximum OSR development indicate that the test diets with 50%, 75%, and 100% GASFTM were significantly shorter than those of the other treatments. The study also indicated that the test diets with 75% and 100% GASFTM inclusion were the most effective on P. vannamei ovarian maturation, followed by the test diet with 50% GASFTM inclusion. These findings suggest that GASFTM is a viable protein source for enhancing ovarian maturation and reproductive performance in P. vannamei broodstock.",

This approach has potential because the spot arrangement is usually specific to each individual. In this study, we analyzed the flank spot patterns of individuals from two rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792) populations—one naturalized population ( n = 56, Calafquén Lake, Región de La Araucanía) and one farmed population ( n = 45, Piscícola Huililco Ltd., Región de La Araucanía)—to evaluate whether these spot patterns are useful for the photo-identification of fish. The flanks of the individuals were photographed with a digital camera. Then, the spot pattern of each image was annotated with freely available software (Interactive Individual Identification System, I3S) to evaluate the performance of these patterns in identifying individuals based on a ranking image score where each image was compared with all annotated images stored in an identification database. Spot patterns for long-term identification were also evaluated using a subset of images from the farmed population. The use of spot patterns showed a high performance for the identification of individuals, because in both populations, all annotated images ranked the first ranking score, indicating perfect recognition. The long-term analysis revealed a high performance in recognition of individuals because 75% of the images of fish at the age of 2 years were successfully matched with images of the same fish at the age of 3 years.",

The following species were covered: Hypanus americanus (Hildebrand et Schroeder, 1928); Gymnura lessae Yokota et Carvalho, 2017; Narcine bancroftii (Griffith et Smith, 1834); Dipturus olseni (Bigelow et Schroeder, 1951); Rostroraja texana (Chandler, 1921); Pseudobatos lentiginosus (Garman, 1880); Rhinoptera bonasus (Mitchill, 1815); Sphyrna tiburo (Linnaeus, 1758); Squatina dumeril Lesueur, 1818; Mustelus canis (Mitchill, 1815); Mustelus norrisi Springer, 1939. The values of the allometric growth parameter b ranged from 2.5 to 3.2, consistent with the expected range. The somatometric growth exhibited negative allometry in fifteen estimations, isometry in six, and positive allometry in two. The LWR differed by sex in five of the six species examined under this criterion, with females consistently exhibiting greater size and weight than males. This study provides the first published LWR for Narcine bancroftii , Dipturus olseni , Rostroraja texana , and Pseudobatos lentiginosus , along with novel LWR estimates for Hypanus americanus , Gymnura lessae , Rhinoptera bonasus , Squatina dumeril , and Mustelus canis in the Gulf of Mexico.

Our results showed that the lengths at first maturity were 34.13 ± 0.12 cm for females M. cephalus and 33.29 ± 0.15 cm for males. For C. ramada , the corresponding sizes at first maturity were 30.5 ± 0.22 cm for females and 29.4 ± 0.17 cm for males. The gonadosomatic index indicated that the spawning season for M. cephalus extends from August to October, while that of C. ramada occurs from October to December. Notably, M. cephalus reaches sexual maturity at a larger size compared to C. ramada . We also assessed the von Bertalanffy growth parameters for both species: L ∞ = 77.87 cm, K = 0.1147 a –1 , t 0 = –2.41 for M. cephalus , and L ∞ = 52.01 cm, K = 0.1782 a –1 , t 0 = –1.41 for C. ramada . Our findings provide essential insights into the reproductive biology and growth parameters of these two Mugilidae species.

    "abstract": "Application of feminization techniques using estrogen hormones can be relevant in cases where there is an insufficient supply of female stock for broodstock production. This study aimed to evaluate the feminization efficiency (FE) of 17β-estradiol (E2) at various concentrations using two different methods applied to the saline-tolerant SpiN ( Oreochromis spilurus × O. niloticus ) tilapia hybrid developed by the University of the Philippines Visayas (UPV). E2 concentrations of 0, 50, 100, and 200 mg · kg –1 were orally administered through dietary supplementation for 28 days (d) to one batch after yolk-sac absorption. Another batch, still with yolk-sacs, was immersed in E2 solutions at concentrations of 0, 50, 100, 200, and 400 µg · L –1 for 5 d. Soft dorsal fin tissues from phenotypically identified female tilapia were collected upon sexual maturation and processed for DNA extraction, PCR, and gel electrophoresis to determine the genotype. Selective removal of the first six dorsal spines was conducted to generate up to 63 unique codes for temporary fish identification. Treatments 2 (50 mg · kg –1 ) and 3 (100 mg · kg –1 ) resulted in the highest FE for dietary supplementation at 94.74% and 95.24%, respectively, while feminization through larval immersion was observed only in Treatment 3 (100 µg L −1 ) at an efficiency of 16.67%. Neither feminization method significantly affected the survival of the fish. These results demonstrate that dietary supplementation with 50–100 mg · kg –1 of E2 is an effective and reliable method for feminizing UPV SpiN tilapia hybrid. PCR-based genotyping confirmed the conversion of genetic males (XY) into phenotypic females. This approach offers a practical strategy to enhance broodstock management, particularly in the development of all-female stocks for breeding. Future studies should focus on evaluating the growth and reproductive performance of sex-reversed individuals for long-term broodstock viability.",

    "abstract": "Valenciennea wardii (Playfair in Playfair et Günther, 1867) often exhibits color variations depending on its habitat. However, owing to its reclusive behavior and low abundance, it is challenging to collect V. wardii using fishing gear, and ecological and population genetic studies remain limited. On 11 November 2024, a single specimen of the tropical gobiid fish V. wardii , which was previously unrecorded in the waters around the Korean Peninsula, was collected from the coastal waters off Ulleung Island via SCUBA diving. It was analyzed using detailed morphometric and meristic measurements in conjunction with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I ( COI ) sequencing to confirm its taxonomic identity. Morphological analysis revealed distinct characteristics, particularly brown transverse body bands and a black blotch with a white margin on the first dorsal fin, which distinguish it from other closely related species. Genetic analysis showed high similarity to V. wardii specimens collected from the South China Sea and Sri Lanka but indicated notable divergence from those collected in the Philippines, suggestive of potential cryptic diversity within the species. This study reports the poleward range expansion of V. wardii and proposes the new Korean name “gal-saeg-tti-bok-gi-mang-duk” based on the characteristics of this species having dark brown transverse bands. These records provide concrete evidence for the poleward expansion of this tropical marine fish species and play a crucial role in monitoring the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems.",

The total length (TL), wet weight (WW), gutted weight (BW), viscera weight (VW), and gonad weight (GW) were determined for each sea cucumber to the nearest 0.1 cm for length and 0.01 g for weight. The sex of each individual was identified through macroscopic observation of gonad coloration, facilitating the categorization of biometric relationships according to sex. Results revealed negative allometric growth ( b = 1.458) for H. tubulosa , with length increasing more than weight. The allometric growth values, calculated as 1.208 in males and 1.584 in females, did not differ significantly between the sexes. The mean condition factor was 2.42 ± 1.04, displaying significant seasonal patterns, with peaks in February and October and the lowest values during summer. Notably, smaller individuals (&amp;lt;100 g) exhibited significantly higher K values, suggesting better health. A strong positive linear relationship was observed between wet and gutted weights ( R 2 = 0.549). Body composition analyses revealed a declining proportion of gutted weight with increasing total wet weight, whereas the relative proportions of viscera, gonads, and water content were positively correlated with body size. These findings offer region- and species-specific insights that can enhance the accuracy of stock assessments and support adaptive management strategies for the H. tubulosa fishery.",

Growth studies were conducted with juvenile mrigal to determine the minimal requirements for the branched-chain amino acids: isoleucine, leucine, and valine.The experimental diets were formulated from purified ingredients to contain 40% crude protein. Casein and gelatin served as protein sources and were supplemented with crystalline L -amino acids to provide an amino acid pattern found in mrigal muscle protein. The amino acids for which the requirements were being determined was were supplemented at varying levels. Dietary inclusion levels for isoleucine ranged from 0.88 to 1.45%, for leucine from 1.36 to 2.05%, and for valine from 1.23 to 1.75%.Results. he optimum dietary requirements for isoleucine, leucine, and valine for mrigal, estimated using break point analysis were 1.25%, 1.73%, and 1.55% of dry diet, respectively. These values correspond to 3.12% isoleucine, 4.33% leucine, and 3.87% valine when expressed as a percentage of dietary protein.

    "abstract": "Background. Melatonin regulates various physiological and neuroendocrinological processes that occur rhythmically, and stimulates or inhibits endocrine activity of various body glands. This acts on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by synchronizing animals with their reproductive cycles. The proximity of melatonin receptors and dopamine and gonadoliberin production sites has led to a hypothesis that dopamine may be a link between melatonin and hypothalamic LHRH. Melatonin may have an indirect influence on animal reproduction through dopaminergic structures of the hypothalamus, but the mechanism involved remains unknown, also in fish, for this reason, the present experiment was conducted. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of melatonin on dopamine release from hypothalamic cells of mature female carp in vitro. Materials and methods. Hypothalami were perifused with a mineral medium containing melatonin (group 1), in the presence of implanted pineal glands (group 2), and with a pure mineral medium (control). Perifusion was 180 min long and samples of the effluent perifusate were collected at 15-minute intervals. Dopamine concentration in the medium was analysed radioenzymatically. The experiment was carried out in the summer during spawning and in the winter during regression. Results. The results indicate that melatonin inhibits the release of dopamine from hypothalamic cells. This effect was only noticeable in the experiment conducted during the spawning period. Conclusion. The present findings show that melatonin may have a role in the hypothalamic control of hypophyseal activity during the spawning period of carp.",

    "abstract": "Background. After their deposition in water, eggs of perch form characteristic, long gelatinous ribbons (strands) floating within the water column. The ultrastructure of the external gelatinious egg envelope of members of the family Percidae was believed to be amorphous. The aim of the presently reported study was to describe the ultrastructure and function of the gelatinous egg envelope composing the perch egg ribbon. Materials and methods. Fresh eggs of European perch, Perca fluviatilis L., were collected, in the form of egg ribbons, from females caught at the spawning grounds on the Odra River side canal Dziewoklicz, within the city limits of Szczecin, Poland. After fertilization eggs were fixed in 4%formaldehyde. In the laboratory, the commonly accepted techniques (dehydration, critical-point drying, sputter coating) were used to prepare samples for examination with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The observations were photographically documented. Results. Closely below the surface of the gelatinous egg ribbon we observed a network of microtubules. These microtubules opened at the egg ribbon surface in the form of ring-like or nozzle-like pores. Conclusion. The gelatinous egg envelope of perch is a complex microtubular network that likely performs a skeletal role for the egg ribbon. Our results also suggest that the regular surface openings of the aforementioned network may play an attachment function (micro-suckers) reciprocally between eggs and between eggs and other objects, thereby facilitating the fastening the eggs to underwater vegetation.",

Asian watermoss, Salvinia cucullata; water spinach Ipomoea reptans; water chestnut, Trapa natans; and lesser duckweed, Lemna minor from north-east India are important sources of proteins, vitamins and minerals, suitable for incorporation in fish diet. The aim of the present study was to compare the efficacy of these aquatic weeds based formulated diets on growth, feed utilization and nutrient turnover from feed to fish flesh of fingerlings of two species of Indian major carps: catla, Catla catla (Hamilton, 1822), and mrigal, Cirrhinus mrigala (Bloch, 1795). Materials and methods. The fingerlings were hand-sorted and distributed in 15 glass aquaria (each having 50 l capacity) at a stocking density of 5 fishes per aquarium. Five formulated diets (containing 26%&ndash;28% of crude protein approximately) were prepared and analyzed for proximate composition. The diets were fed to catla and mrigal fingerlings in triplicate treatments at the rate 3% of body weight for 60 days and fish performance in terms of growth, feed utilization and carcass composition was evaluated. Results. The whole body composition and energy content of C. catla fingerlings before and at the end of feeding trials did not differ significantly (P > 0.05), however, the proportion of crude lipid content was high when fed with diet F2 (P < 0.05). In case of C. mrigala, crude protein, as well as lipid contents, were significantly higher in all the groups of fish at the end of experiment as compared to the initial fish. The hepatic- as well as the muscle tissues of catla and mrigal fingerlings fed the diet F2 (containing I. reptans) displayed high contents of crude protein and vitamin E (P < 0.01). Interestingly, although no difference in muscle glycogen level in C. mrigala was observed irrespective of the diet fed however, muscle and liver glycogen contents in Catla catla fingerlings fed F2 diet was significantly higher compared to glycogen contents of these tissues of initial fish or fish fed with control diet. Conclusion. Presently reported study suggests that I. reptans, being a rich source of nutrients, is suitable for incorporation in fish diet for C. catla and C. mrigala fingerlings.",

This information is required to develop a practical protocol for the production of monosex populations of these species for aquaculture. Materials and methods. Cultured larvae and juveniles were collected weekly, measured (total length; TL), prepared histologically and then examined microscopically for the presence of characteristic stages of gonadal differentiation. Results. In Atlantic cod, undifferentiated gonads were present by 18 mm TL, at 84 days post hatch (dph), and definitive germ cells by 19 mm TL (90 dph). Ovarian cavities were first observed at 27 mm TL (102 dph), and by 35 mm TL (112 dph) anatomical divergence into two types of gonads was clear. In haddock, undifferentiated gonads were observed at 21 mm TL (64 dph) and an ovarian cavity was evident at 29 mm TL (71 dph). Conclusion. Gonadal differentiation in Atlantic cod and haddock occurs at roughly the same size in both species (27 and 29 mm TL, respectively). For successful sex reversal, the administration of steroids should therefore begin at approximately 25 mm TL, shortly after weaning onto dry feed.",

    "abstract": "Background. Increasing global usage of inorganic fertilizers, including phosphate-based fertilizers has its negative consequences on the aquatic environment. Effects of single superphosphate fertilizer (SPF) remain unknown, particularly its influence on the respiratory dynamics of fish under continuous exposure. We investigated the effects of single SPF on the survival and respiratory dynamics of Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus, under laboratory conditions. Materials and methods. Nile tilapia fingerlings (of mixed sex) (5.40 . 0.03 g) were exposed to various concentrations of the fertilizer in five treatment regimes (in triplicate): 0.88, 1.75, 3.50, 7.00, 14.00 g . L–1 (and 0.00 g . L–1 for control). Each replicate was carried out in a 30-L circular plastic tank based on 20 fingerlings. The study involved: the mortality estimation, the oxygen consumption, the histopathological effects on fish gills, and the activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) in liver of fish exposed to sublethal concentrations (0.44, 0.22, 0.11, 0.06, and 0.03 g . L–1) of single SPF for eight weeks under laboratory conditions. Results. Acute concentrations of SPF had serious adverse effects on mortality, oxygen consumption and opercular ventilation rates of exposed fish. All variables showed a dose-dependency. A mean value of 96-h LC50 of the SPF to the test fish was calculated to be 3.76 g . L–1. At various acute concentrations, oedema and hyperplasia of gill lamellae were observed in exposed fish. Exposure of the fish to sublethal concentrations of the SPF resulted in reduction in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase activities in liver. Conclusion. Concentrations of SPF in natural water bodies are deleterious to aquatic fauna. With rapid global economic development and need for more food production, pollution from agricultural fertilizers remains a major threat to the aquatic ecosystem. Therefore it is ultimately important that a balance is struck between achieving economic excellence and environmental protection through good pollution management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Background. Limited information is available on the reproductive biology of grey mullets mainly because it is very difficult to collect fully mature specimens. In the presently reported study the reproductive biology of two mugilid species, namelyLiza saliens andLiza ramada, was studied in the Vistonis and Porto Lagos estuarine systems. Materials and methods. Gonadosomatic index (GSI) and standard length at first maturity (SL50) were calculated. In order to estimate which oocytes are going to mature, oocyte size-frequency profiles were constructed for each fish and only the most advanced yolked oocytes were considered. The fecundity estimates were obtained using the volumetric method. Results. The results indicated that the sex ratio was in favour of females for both species. The gonadosomatic index indicated that the spawning season of L. saliens extends from June through October and that of L. ramada&mdash;from September through January. L. ramada sexually matures at a greater size and older age than L. saliens. For a correct estimate of the fecundity, the smallest group of eggs in both species (&lt;0.20 mm) was rejected. For L. saliens the absolute fecundity varied from 245&nbsp;000 to 555&nbsp;000 eggs, while for L. ramada from 150&nbsp;000 to 685&nbsp;000 eggs. Fecundity is probably more correlated with the weight of the fish for both species. Conclusion. For the estimation of fecundity the total number of the oocytes is often used. However, this can be misleading as shown from the frequency distribution of the oocytes in the two grey mullet species, where a large proportion of the oocytes will never mature and therefore they do not contribute to the reproduction process. The percentage of these oocytes can be high, as shown in the current study (3.9%&ndash;28.1%).",

A recent effort to identify stocks of marine fishes of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman revealed that several species have abnormal otoliths. This is the first study reporting and describing the occurrence of abnormal otoliths from the fishes collected from the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. Materials and methods. A total of 225 fish specimens belong to 83 species and 33 families were randomly sampled from the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The standard lengths (SL) were measured to the nearest 0.5 mm. The otoliths were extracted, cleaned, and described following available literature. The specimens and their otoliths were deposited in the Zoological Museum at Shahid Bahonar University of Kerman (ZM-SBUK). Results. Among the studied 83 species, we found six species having abnormal otoliths (4.8% of the studied specimens). They belong to six families; Carangidae, Chanidae, Chirocentridae, Leiognathidae, Paralichthyidae, and Sparidae. The number of specimens with abnormal otoliths only in one side (either right or left side) was six, and those with abnormal otoliths in both sides was five. The left otoliths presented more extreme changes than the right. The observed abnormalities can be classified into three types; asteriscus attached to sagittal (the most common); otoliths with a more translucent or crystalline appearance in surface or outlines; and those with an abnormality in their sulcus region. Conclusion. Ecologically, the Persian Gulf is an environment having various kinds of stresses such as salinity fluctuation, acidification, and the water temperature. Such stressors probably affect otolith formation during the larval stages of these fishes and are responsible for the observed abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Background. The distribution of early ontogenic stages of small pelagic fishes is important for understanding the dynamics of their fluctuating populations. To fill a gap in the knowledge we conducted a comparative analysis on the distribution of eggs and larvae of the exploited populations of European anchovy, Engraulis encrasicolus (L.) and round sardinella, Sardinella aurita (Valanciennes, 1847), in the eastern coast of Tunisia. Materials and methods. A multidisciplinary survey was carried out in the summer of 2008, from June 23 through July 9. Samples were taken over a grid of 71 stations. Temperature and salinity profiles were recorded at each station by CTD casts and water samples were taken by means of a Rosette equipped with Niskin bottles. Ichthyoplankton was sampled by oblique tows with a Bongo net of 60 cm mouth diameter and 335-&#181;m mesh nets. To specify the preferred spawning environment the quotient values were estimated for each variable. Results. The eggs and larvae of both species represented an important proportion of the ichthyoplankton, around 50% for each ontogenic stage. Anchovy mainly spawned in the shelf edge, north-east of Kuriate Island, with a minor spawning area near Cap Bon and Kelibia. The main spawning area of the round sardinella was in the warmer waters. It was located near the major spawning ground of anchovy. Anchovy eggs were scarce in the coastal zones and in the south of the study area, whereas round sardinella eggs were scarce in the north. The main spawning grounds of anchovy coincided with the area of higher zooplankton abundance while round sardinella spawning grounds correspond with those areas of highest chlorophyll-a and zooplankton. This distribution suggests a propensity for food availability, for both adults and larvae, as the location of spawning grounds of these species. Conclusion. Both anchovy and sardinella spawned mainly in deeper waters within the limits of the continental shelf. Each species appeared to have a specific strategy for spawning that was influenced by physical and biological variables.",

This work constitutes the first complex attempt to study aspects of biology, feeding, bathymetric distribution, and habitat preferences of S. loppei. Materials and methods. The biological samples of S. loppei, as well as the data on its abundance and distribution, were collected during the annual bottom trawl survey series BALAR-MEDITS carried out from 2005 through 2010. The biological sampling included: weighing and measuring the fish, gonad weighing, determination of sex and maturity stage, age estimation through otolith readings, and stomach content analysis. Results. The sampled individuals ranged from 5.5 to 12.8 cm in total length (TL). The females predominated in the smaller size classes, and males being more abundant in the larger ones. All females sampled were mature (or approaching maturity). The age determined ranged from 0 to 5 years and from 1 to 5 years, for females and males, respectively. The estimated values of the von Bertalanffy asymptotic length L∞ (cm) and growth coefficient k (year–1) for females and males were 10.9 and 0.53 and 12.4 and 0.49, respectively. According to the age–length key, all females of S. loppei should be attaining their first maturity during their first year of life. The diet of S. loppei consisted predominantly of crustaceans (mysids and decapods) followed by teleosts fishes. A specialized feeding behaviour was indicated by the Levin's index for numerical composition and frequency of occurrence assuming values of 0.18 and 0.28, respectively. The presence of S. loppei was restricted to sandy-mud deep continental shelf bottoms from 90 to 180 m depth. This distribution did not overlap with that of other small scorpion fish species inhabiting the area. Conclusion. Unlike its congeners, S. loppei demonstrated specialised feeding habits and habitat requirements. Being the only small scorpion fish inhabiting this benthic habitat in the study area might have reduced the interspecific competition, facilitating feeding and growth and allowing an early achievement of sexual maturity.",

Each of these species are targeted by artisanal- and small-scale commercial fisheries throughout the country. As such the purpose of this study was to provide baseline reproductive information that can be used for future evaluation and management of the fishery. Materials and methods. We used recently developed methods for rapid, low-cost, on-site, histology-based reproductive analysis that requires minimal research infrastructure. These methods use standard techniques (e.g., plastic embedding) that have been modified such that work can be conducted in remote field settings without electrical service. We studied the following fish species: the teardrop threadfin bream, Nemipterus isacanthus (Bleeker, 1873); the dash-and-dot goatfish, Parupeneus barberinus (Lacepède, 1801); the blue sea chub, Kyphosus cinerascens (Forsskål, 1775); the striated surgeonfish, Ctenochaetus striatus (Quoy et Gaimard, 1825); and the orange-lined triggerfish, Balistapus undulatus (Park, 1797). Results. In all species, length was an approximately cubic function of weight. Female B. undulatus mature at a smaller size than males; in the other four species males mature at a smaller size. Nemipterus isacanthus, K. cinerascens, C. striatus, and B. undulatus are gonochores. Females are rare or absent in the largest size classes of N. isacanthus, P. barberinus, C. striatus, and B. undulatus. For P. barberinus and B. undulatus, size classes well below maximum observed size are responsible for the majority of egg production. Conclusion. Our results differed markedly from those of macroscopic and data-deficient approaches and may help to avoid unnecessary management actions. Further, an emergent pattern challenges a current paradigm in reef-fish conservation and management; contrary to a general assumption for many reef-fish species, the largest size classes of at least three species did not have the highest per-capita fecundity. Because females were rare or absent in the largest size classes, smaller fish are responsible for the majority of egg production. Thus, for coastal communities dependent upon reef fishes for sustenance, our results suggest it may be easier to balance food needs and conservation by fishing across a broad size range. Further, because of diminished concern about targeting the larger size classes commonly assumed to be responsible for the majority of egg production, doing so will simultaneously promote adequate reproductive output.",

    "abstract": "Background. Atlantic horse mackerel, Trachurus trachurus (Linnaeus, 1758), is among bento-pelagic species subject to discard within deep-water rose shrimp fisheries, and how such species would react to light wavelength is therefore important, to be consistent with the Common Fishery Policy (CFP). Despite the existing literature currently available, there is still paucity of relevant information about how artificial light wavelengths affects the behaviour of T. trachurus juveniles. In this context, the effects of different artificial light wavelengths on some behavioural features of juvenile T. trachurus were investigated. Materials and methods. Maintained in a fish tank, the juveniles of Atlantic horse mackerel, after acclimatization, were subject to six different light wavelengths, representing the following colours: white, violet, blue, green, yellow, and red. Subsequently, behavioural features, specifically phototaxis (degree of attraction or repulsion toward the light source) were tested. Results. By phototaxis per light wavelength, the studied juvenile individuals produced statistical differences in the presence frequency (P < 0.05) revealed by blue that noticeably attracted some, relative to the white light that repulsed others. Yet, violet and red lights produced much less but no significant attraction of these juveniles (P > 0.05). Conclusion. The presently reported study has provided additional information about ecological knowledge and understanding specific to juvenile T. trachurus individuals, which can further the development of (selective) light fishing techniques, aimed at reducing unwanted catches of commercial pelagic fisheries.",

The results indicated that glucose levels (P &#60; 0.05) and digestive enzymes (lipase and amylase) in the blood serum decreased in fish fed diets containing kefir (P &#62; 0.05). On the contrary, the activity of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, and LDH) increased insignificantly (P &#62; 0.05). In conclusion, digestive and liver enzyme activities were affected by quantitative changes in dietary kefir insignificantly but further research is needed to establish whether the liver and digestive enzyme physiology of Coruh trout can be affected by kefir-supplemented diets in a long-term trial.",

    "abstract": "Background. The goliath grouper, Epinephelus itajara (Lichtenstein, 1822), is the largest Atlantic grouper. It has been the first marine fish subjected to a fishing moratorium in Brazil (since 2002). The aim of this study was to investigate basic biological aspects, particularly the diet and reproduction of this endangered species. We believe that our results, together with information already available in the literature, may be a foundation for new management and conservation strategies for this grouper in Brazil. Materials and methods. Specimens were obtained from an artisanal fish landings collaborative monitoring program in the cities of Caravelas and Alcoba&#231;a, Abrolhos Bank, eastern Brazil. Because of the fishing moratorium, we relied on sporadic incidental captures from fishermen or donation from the law enforcement agencies. Diet and reproduction of the goliath grouper was evaluated based on 34 specimens obtained between May 2005 and September 2010. Results. Body size of 32 females ranged from 27.4 to 150.0 cm total length (TL) (mean 87.4 &#177; SD 34.8), while size of 2 males were 97.0 and 115.0 cm TL. Of these, 16 specimens (47%) were juveniles. Sex ratio was estimated as 1 : 16 (males to females). Two developing females were recorded, one obtained in February 2006 and another in January 2007. The length of first maturation (L50) for females was estimated at 105.64 cm and the length where 100% of individuals are mature (L100) at 126.0 cm TL. A total of 34 stomachs were analyzed, six of them were empty. Teleosts and decapods dominated the diet. The major food items of mangrove-associated fish were decapods Callinectes sp., while the coral reef-associated fish ingested mainly the boxfish Acanthostracion sp. The most important item for juveniles was Callinectes sp., while Acanthostracion sp. was the most important item for adults. Conclusion. We suggest that the goliath grouper moratorium in Brazil should be maintained for a relatively long time frame&#8212;more than four decades.",

    "abstract": "Background. The authors suggest that skin injury, particularly scale loss, during the capture may be one reason of the escape mortality. However, skin and fin damages are not responsible for all of the observed mortalities occurring during the fish passage through the mesh of the trawl codend. Nevertheless, physical damages may expose escapees to secondary infections from bacteria and fungi. This study investigated the types and occurrence of deformation for red mullet escapees to better understand the cause of their death. Improving the survival rate by using alternative gear modifications require detailed information on assessments of escape mortality including trawl gear-induced injuries. Therefore we aimed to determine the damages of body parts among the escaped red mullet from trawl codends. Materials and methods. Injuries and mortalities sustained by red mullet, Mullus barbatus Linnaeus, 1758, escaping from three different trawl codends were investigated in the Aegean Sea within 10&#8211;18 February 2012. The fish were held captive in fish cages and their behaviour was observed by divers three times per day for a period of 9 days. During the observation, dead fish were removed and immediately transferred to the laboratory for measurement and post-mortem examination. Results. The rates of escape mortality of red mullet penetrating through 40 mm square mesh codend, 44 mm diamond mesh codend, and 50 mm diamond mesh codend were 26.3%, 46.3%, and 27.4%, respectively. In total, 323 red mullet died after escaping from codends. Two of these could not be examined because of post-mortem decomposition and 21 others were defined as undamaged. Scale loss was the most common injury (300 fish, 93.5%) in red mullet individuals that died due to post escape mortality. The second most common injury was tissue loss (34.6%) followed by skin loss (19.9%). The majority of scale damage cases was around the abdomen and on either side of the caudal peduncle. In general, the frequency of the scale loss increased towards the tail. The frequency of different fin injuries of escaped fish were: 58.6% (torn), 44.5% (broken), and 6.2% (loss), respectively. Conclusion. Red mullet escape mortality was highly correlated to fish length (P &#60; 0.001), however, we identified no clear relation between fish size and scale loss.",

    "abstract": "Background. Due to their location between the continent and the sea and their shallow depths, lagoons play an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing a selection of habitat types for many species, functioning as nursery areas and feeding grounds for marine opportunistic fishes. The fish fauna of the Nador Lagoon (NE Morocco), as in the majority of southern Mediterranean lagoons, has been insufficiently studied, even though the lagoon itself supports important commercial fisheries. The presently reported study investigated the spatial and seasonal uses of shallow habitats for fish fauna in the Nador Lagoon. Materials and methods. Sampling was done using a beach seine net at six stations covering almost entire lagoon and representing habitats differing in many parameters such as the distance from the inlet, bottom sediment characteristics, presence of macroalgae, etc. The fish abundance was standardized as catch per unit effort (CPUE) and the fish community was analysed both in terms of its taxonomic and functional composition (by making use of both ecological and dietary preference guilds). Results. A total of 2872 individuals, representing 15 species from 12 families, was collected during the four seasons. Only six species were always present in all seasons. Fish abundance peaked in spring and the species diversity was higher in spring and summer. The fish assemblage was largely dominated in terms of ecological guild by the resident and benthivorous species. Spatial and seasonal fish assemblages differed both in terms of fish abundance and diversity and also in terms of functional guilds composition. In autumn, the fish assemblage was dominated by the marine juvenile migrants whereas in winter, spring, and summer, resident species were the most abundant. Conclusion. The combination of taxonomic and functional characteristics of the fish assemblages, determined in the presently reported study, may contribute to a better understanding of the ecological networks of the Nador Lagoon, thus providing useful data for its conservation and management.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of partial to full replacement of commercial diets with live insects on growth and health parameters of rainbow trout, as well as on sensory and texture attributes and fatty acid composition of fish muscle. Materials and methods. Five isocaloric diets containing commercial pellets and live insects were evaluated in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792), in a 60-day feeding trial. Control Group (K) was fed commercial pellets only. In other groups, 25% gross energy of pellets was replaced by live adult house cricket, Acheta domestica (Group C), live superworm, Zophobas morio larvae (Group L), or a combination of 12.5% crude energy of each (group LC). The insect-only group (I) was fed live cricket and superworm only (50% by 50% crude energy). Results. No significant differences were found in growth, survival, feed conversion ratio (dry basis), or energy utilization between groups. The protein efficiency ratio was highest in Group K and decreased with increasing cricket proportion. Insect inclusion was associated with lower content of nutritionally valuable n-3 fatty acid in fish muscle. Subjective sensory evaluation of cooked fillets revealed significantly less acceptable taste, aroma, and aftertaste in Group I than for Groups K, L, and LC. Some differences were found in the whiteness and redness of fillets between groups. The control group had significantly lower hardness compared to those receiving insect diets. No gross morphological or histopathological anomalies of viscera in any group and no significant differences in 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity were observed. Conclusion. Live insects replaced the commercial diet of the equivalent caloric level without negative effects on the growth or health of rainbow trout. The lower content of n-3 fatty acids and differences in color and texture of fillets from fish fed insects may influence acceptability to consumers. The high cost of insects compared to commercial feed currently limits their widespread use in trout production.",

This study analyzed the variation of abundance and spatial distribution of fish eggs and larvae sampled from December 2017 to April 2018 along approximately 23 km in the downstream/upstream direction (departing from the city of Santarém) in the lower stretch of the Amazon River, with emphasis on gradients: vertical (subsurface and depth) and horizontal (in the mid channel and the shore proximity). Materials and methods. Fish eggs and larvae were collected at six sampling stations, each representing the mid channel, the shore proximity areas, and both the subsurface (by means of horizontal trawling) and the depth of 10 meters (by means of a conical plankton net with a mesh size of 300 µm). Results. During the sampling period, a total of 62 eggs and 8188 fish larvae were collected. The larvae represented seven orders, 21 families, 29 genera, and 46 species-level taxa: Strongylura timucu, Leporinus sp., Rhytiodus microlepis, Schizodon fasciatus, Schizodon vittatus, Brycon amazonicus, Characidae gen. sp., Potamorhina altamazonica, Potamorhina latior, Psectrogaster amazonica, Psectrogaster rutiloides, Rhaphiodon vulpinus, Anodus elongatus, Hemiodus immaculatus, Hemiodus microlepis, Hemiodus unimaculatus, Prochilodus nigricans, Semaprochilodus insignis, Semaprochilodus taeniurus, Mylossoma albiscopum, Mylossoma aureum, Piaractus brachypomus, Triportheus auritus, Triportheus spp., Rhinosardinia amazonica, Engraulidae gen. sp., Pellona castelnaeana, Pellona flavipinnis, Microphilypnus sp., Plagioscion squamosissimus, Trachelyopterus galeatus, Tatia sp., Cetopsidae gen. sp., Doradidae gen. sp., Heptapteridae gen. sp., Brachyplatystoma filamentosum, Brachyplatystoma juruense, Brachyplatystoma sp., Calophysus macropterus, Hypophthalmus marginatus, Pimelodus blochii, Pseudoplatystoma punctifer, Pseudoplatystoma tigrinum, Sorubim elongatus, Sorubim lima, Colomesus asellus. Among them, 65% perform reproductive migrations and about 80% are of commercial interest in the region of the lower Amazon River. Regarding the spatial variation, the egg concentration was uniform and no significant differences were observed. For the larvae, there was both a horizontal (t-test, df = 4, t = 23.827, P < 0.001), and vertical (t-test, df = 4, t = 4.086, P = 0.015) spatial variation, with the highest abundance values recorded in the shore proximity areas and in the subsurface of the water column. Conclusion. The studied environment functions as an important mechanism of exchange between spawning zones and nursery sites. Any alteration in these areas can certainly modify the composition, abundance, and distribution of the ichthyoplanktonic community and affect the processes of biological recruitment of fishery resources in the region.",

    "abstract": "The spotted rose snapper, Lutjanus guttatus (Steindachner, 1869), is an important resource for the coastal fisheries of the Gulf of California, mainly due to its high commercial value. Despite this, there are no management measures for this species, owing in part to a lack of information on its basic biology and its trophic ecology in the area. In this context, the presently reported study had as objective to describe the feeding habits of L. guttatus through stomach content analyses, as well as to describe possible changes linked to sex, size, and season. Specimens were caught monthly from June 2016 to September 2017 with gillnets in Santa Rosalía, BCS, Mexico. The abundance, weight, and frequency of occurrence of each prey were assessed, and these parameters were integrated into the index of relative importance (%IRI) to determine the importance of each prey item in the L. guttatus diet. The Levin’s index was used to assess the trophic niche width of the species, the feeding strategy was evaluated using Costello’s graphic method and the trophic level was calculated. Finally, to establish whether there were significant differences in the diet by sex, size, or season a PERMANOVA test was used with a 95% confidence level. A total of 202 L. guttatus stomachs were analyzed, 191 of which contained food. A total of 26 prey items were identified. According to the %IRI, the most important prey were the teleost fishes Harengula thrissina (Jordan et Gilbert, 1882) (45.7%) and Sardinops sagax (Jenyns, 1842) (34.8%), the euphausiid Nyctiphanes simplex (13.4%), and the crustacean Penaeus spp. (5.6%). The PERMANOVA analysis resulted in significant differences between the analyzed categories; however, there were no significant differences in the interactions among the categories. According to Levin’s index, L. guttatus had a narrow trophic width, with changes in the main prey consumed by the different categories. According to our results, L. guttatus can be considered a benthopelagic opportunistic carnivorous predator with a narrow trophic niche, presenting mostly quantitative variations in its diet according to sex, size, and season. Its trophic plasticity allows it to take advantage of the most available and abundant food resources.",

    "abstract": "The striped piggy, Pomadasys stridens (Forsskål, 1775), is a recent invasive fish species in the eastern Mediterranean. Although its population dynamics was investigated in detail in its natural distribution area, the western Indian Ocean, an important data gap still exists in the Mediterranean. This study was carried out to determine the growth, mortality, and the length–weight and length–length relations of invasive striped piggy right after its establishment in the area. Samples were collected seasonally between April 2014 and December 2015 by using bottom trawl from 10 and 20 m depth contours off the north-western coast of the Gulf of Iskenderun. After the length, weight, and sex of fish were recorded, sagittal otoliths were extracted and examined for age determination. Then length–length, length–weight, and length at age relations, growth performance, and mortality rates were calculated for both sexes and pooled data. In the study, a total of 1131 individuals were investigated, the total length of which ranged between 7.3 and 18.9 cm. The mean length was 12.32 ± 0.11 cm. There was no significant difference between the length–weight relation (LWR) parameters of sexes and pooled data. The overall LWR was found to be TW = 0.0113 * TL^3.096 in all specimens. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters were not significantly different between males and females. The model parameters for both sexes were L ∞ = 22.01 cm, K = 0.22 years –1 , t 0 = –1.30 years. The growth performance index ( Ø ′) was calculated as Ø ′ = 2.03. For combined sexes, the total, natural and fishery mortality rates were Z = 1.14 years –1 , M = 0.66 years –1 , and F = 0.48 years –1 , respectively. The exploitation rate of the stock was found to be E = 0.42. The growth performance of the invasive striped piggy population was determined to be similar to the ones reported from the Gulf of Suez where was the closest natural distribution area of the species. Although striped piggy is proper for human consumption and commercially caught in its native range, its fishery has not yet been established in the Eastern Mediterranean and we found that there was insufficient fishery pressure on the invasive population.",

    "abstract": "Background. In the Mediterranean Sea, habitat preferences of small benthic fishes of shallow waters have been poorly investigated. Although combtooth blennies are not of interest for fisheries, they are often the dominant fish community on rocky bottoms within the first meter of depth and in tidal pool environments, playing so an important role in the functioning of the coastal ecosystem. This study represents the first detailed investigation concerning habitat preference and depth distribution of combtooth blennies in the Ionian Sea. Materials and methods. Occurrence and abundance of species were investigated by a non-destructive visual census method using snorkelling or SCUBA diving. We investigated 5 habitat types (bathymetric intervals between 0 and 3 m of depth) to find difference in species richness and abundance in each one and between. Studies were conducted from June to October 2014 in the south-eastern coast of Sicily. Statistical method of the electivity index (EI) and principal component analysis (PCA) were utilized for the evaluation of the habitat preference of 11 species of combtooth blennies. Depth distribution for each species was box-plotted. For each habitat and depth, the Shannon–Wiener Index (H') and the Simpson Index (D) were calculated. Diversity profiles were performed in order to give a better understanding of the correlation between diversity and both habitat types and depth. Results. During a total of 2485 observations of combtooth blennies a total of 11 species were recorded: Aidablennius sphynx (Valenciennes, 1836); Coryphoblennius galerita (Linnaeus, 1758); Lipophrys trigloides (Valenciennes, 1836); Microlipophrys canevae (Vinciguerra, 1880); Parablennius gattorugine (Linnaeus, 1758); Parablennius incognitus (Bath, 1968); Parablennius pilicornis (Cuvier, 1829); Parablennius sanguinolentus (Pallas, 1814); Parablennius zvonimiri (Kolombatović, 1892); Salaria pavo (Risso, 1810); Scartella cristata (Linnaeus, 1758). The maximum Shannon–Wiener Index (H'= 2.335) and Simpson Index (D = 0.898) values were recorded on \"rocks with algal cover\"; while, concerning the depth, the maximum values of both indices were recorded within the first meter. The diversity indices showed the highest values in the most heterogeneous habitat types. There was a negative correlation between depth and diversity indices. Results showed a clear habitat preference for the following species: A. sphynx, P. gattorugine, P. sanguinolentus, S. pavo and S. cristata. Conclusion. This study highlights the importance of depth and habitat heterogeneity in biological diversity, species richness and population abundances of combtooth blennies in the Mediterranean Sea.",

    "abstract": "Following an introduction to the nature of fisheries catches and their information content, a new development of CMSY, a data-limited stock assessment method for fishes and invertebrates, is presented. This new version, CMSY++, overcomes several of the deficiencies of CMSY, which itself improved upon the “Catch-MSY” method published by S. Martell and R. Froese in 2013. The catch-only application of CMSY++ uses a Bayesian implementation of a modified Schaefer model, which also allows the fitting of abundance indices should such information be available. In the absence of historical catch time series and abundance indices, CMSY++ depends strongly on the provision of appropriate and informative priors for plausible ranges of initial and final stock depletion. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) now assists in selecting objective priors for relative stock size based on patterns in 400 catch time series used for training. Regarding the cross-validation of the ANN predictions, of the 400 real stocks used in the training of ANN, 94% of final relative biomass ( B / k ) Bayesian (BSM) estimates were within the approximate 95% confidence limits of the respective CMSY++ estimate. Also, the equilibrium catch-biomass relations of the modified Schaefer model are compared with those of alternative surplus-production and age-structured models, suggesting that the latter two can be strongly biased towards underestimating the biomass required to sustain catches at low abundance. Numerous independent applications demonstrate how CMSY++ can incorporate, in addition to the required catch time series, both abundance data and a wide variety of ancillary information. We stress, however, the caveats and pitfalls of naively using the built-in prior options, which should instead be evaluated case-by-case and ideally be replaced by independent prior knowledge.",

A total of 30 units of DCP and 30 units of BCP, of which 15 were gapped and 15 were conventional, were deployed in each fishing trial. Over the sampling period, 12 fishing trials were conducted resulting in a total of 180 hauls per pot type per design. The results showed the potential of 48 × 25 mm escape gaps with flaps in improving the selectivity and efficiency of crab pot gears used in catching blue swimming crab Portunus pelagicus (Linnaeus, 1758). The gapped crab pots significantly reduced the catch of undersized P. pelagicus by 48% in DCP and by 79% in BCP. The non-target catch was also reduced in the gapped pots by 67% in DCP and 72% in BCP. In addition, the capture of legal-sized P. pelagicus was not affected by the presence of the escape gaps in both DCP and BCP. Further, catch species richness was reduced in gapped DCP. The catch retrieval and sorting time was also reduced in both gapped DCP and BCP.",

    "abstract": "The rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792), is a popular species for Czech recreational fishing, both on trout fishing grounds and even some designated as non-trout waters if they have sufficient environmental quality. Rainbow trout are usually stocked using a “put-and-take” management approach, in which the majority of fish are caught and harvested during the fishing season. Rainbow trout stocking and return data in anglers’ catches were analyzed with respect to the time period between stocking and catch and the rates of return were evaluated. Two differently managed types of fishing grounds were taken into account—the non-trout and trout grounds. The study was conducted on five fishing grounds (four rivers) in the Czech Republic within 2007–2020. The average proportion of stocked rainbow trout caught during the first two weeks after release on non-trout fishing ground is 92.3%, significantly ( P &amp;lt; 0.001) higher than the 64.1% taken from designated trout grounds. On the trout fishing grounds, rainbow trout tend to be caught more evenly throughout the fishing season. Mean total individual return rates ranged between 36.8% and 53.4% in the non-trout fishing ground and between 29.8% and 68.4% in the trout fishing ground. The respective weight return rates were 47.7%–79.5% in the non-trout fishing ground and 34.4%–75.3% in the trout fishing ground with no significant differences in individual ( P = 0.50) and weight-related ( P = 0.19) returns. The vast majority of rainbow trout are caught and harvested shortly after being stocked. The proportion of stocked fish caught within two weeks of release in non-trout fishing grounds is significantly higher than in trout grounds. Stocked rainbow trout tend to be caught more evenly throughout the fishing season in trout fishing grounds due to lower angling pressure and legal restrictions (artificial flies and lures only). Both individual and weight returns for the entire year (season) were similar in non-trout and trout areas.",

In 2018–2019, we investigated 360 small water bodies across the country, all of which were potentially suitable for lake minnows. Results revealed that lake minnows were present in only 12 water bodies, all concentrated in one regional park in the southern part of the country. However, by 2024 the species had gone extinct at nine of these sites due to habitat loss. At present (2025), only one viable Lithuanian population of this species can be considered to exist. Our results conclusively show that the species is on the very edge of extinction. Urgent action is needed to protect this species in Lithuanian waters, with special emphasis on revitalizing its most suitable habitats and translocating fish from the only currently known population in Lithuania.",

This study investigated the impact of these invasive alien species on fish communities in large lakes and small reservoirs over a 5-year monitoring period (2019–2023). Eight sites, including four lakes and four reservoirs, were surveyed twice a year. Fish were collected using cast nets, kick nets, and gillnets (for lakes). Species diversity indices (Shannon’s H ʹ, Pielou’s J ʹ, and Margalef richness) and dominance indices were calculated. Poisson-based analysis of variance models was applied to examine the relationship between the densities of invasive alien species and the diversity of fish communities. Sites with higher densities of largemouth bass and bluegill had significantly lower diversity indices. Non-metric multidimensional scaling analyses indicated distinct community groupings according to the type of waterbody and the presence of invasive alien species. These results emphasize the need for continued monitoring and management strategies tailored to different habitat scales.",

In extreme cases the differences in egg size of the same female reached up to 11 percentage points (linear size) and over 40 (volume)! A strict relationship was found between duration of embryonic development and egg size: the smaller the egg, the shorter its embryogenesis. Biological meaning of this phenomenon has been discussed.",

Even thoughSerranus cabrilla has been aby-catch species in trawling operations, it is now becoming an economically important fish species on the Turkish Coast of Aegean Sea, because of its low market price. For an efficient fisheries management of the stocks it is important to know important biological parameters of the commercially exploited species. Therefore the aim of this study was to obtain necessary growth- and reproductive characteristics of comber representing the local population of this fish in the study area. Materials and methods. Biological aspects of comber were examined based on a total of 1452 specimens collected from the Aegean Sea, during the period January 2005&ndash;December 2005.Age of fish was determined by otolith reading. Length&ndash;weight relation and the von Bertalanffy equationwere used to evaluate the fish growth. Results. Annuli on otoliths indicated the presence of 6 age classes. The computed growth parameters were: L&infin; = 23.88 cm; k = 0.298 year&ndash;1 and to = &ndash;1.577 year. The length&ndash;weight relations were calculated as: W= 0.0111&middot; L2.998 for sex combined. The growth performance index (&Phi;&prime;) was 2.230. The fish mature sexually for the first time at a total length of 13.20 cm (L50). The spawning season of comber was from March to May, with a peak in April. Conclusion. The comber grows rapidly attaining almost 75% of its linear growth during the first two years of life and then the growth slows down. The growth coefficient, (k), indicates slow attainment of maximum size because of significantly correlated to temperature of sea water, leading to a considerable variability in the life span between areas.",

The effective management of aquaculture production of&nbsp; this species requires contemporary knowledge of broodstock structure, mating patterns, and genetic diversity of broodstock. The aim of the present study was the application of microsatellite DNA analysis for estimation of gene diversity in the Siberian sturgeon farmed at a Polish fish farm. Materials and methods. Fin clips were randomly sampled from 94 specimens of Siberian sturgeon broodstock reared at the WÄ…sosze Fish Farm near Konin, Poland. The analysed broodstock has been kept there since 1996, with new specimens being introduced annually. The fish were studied in 2007-2008. Genomic DNA for amplification of microsatellite loci was extracted using Chelex 100. Six microsatellite loci (Afu-19, Afu-39,Afu-68,AfuB-68, Spl-163, andSpl-168) were amplified for examination of the genetic variability of the studied fish. Results. Within 94 individuals of the Siberian sturgeon, a total of 74 alleles were detected in six polymorphic microsatellite loci. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 8 to 18, with an average allele number being 12. The genetic diversity of six microsatellite loci varied from 0.686 to 0.811. Conclusion. This technology has great potential for use in aquaculture of sturgeon fish, especially when levels of genetic variation could be monitored and inbreeding controlled in commercial breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "Background. Common carp, Cyprinus carpio, is a model organism within Teleostei. Oligopeptides are a new and promising alternative source of amino acids in animal as well as in human nutrition. In common carp, the membrane protein that transports oligopeptides across the enterocyte membrane is encoded by the gene PepT1 (SLC15A1). The aim of this paper was to sequence the PepT1 (SLC15A1) in common carp. Materials and methods. Intestine samples were isolated from six-week old common carp. Total RNA was isolated using a Trizol method. Reverse transcription was used to synthesize cDNA. Two different pairs of primers were designed, according to the zebrafish (Danio rerio) PepT1 sequence, and used for PCR. The amplified DNA was isolated by electrophoresis, cloned (pCRII-TOPO vectors), sequenced, and subjected to in silico analysis. Results. Two nucleotide fragments of the PepT1 gene were obtained and analyzed using bioinformatic tools. Both fragments showed a high degree of homology with the known PepT1 genes of other teleosts, mammals, and birds. High homology of the PepT1 gene, and similar primary protein structure among the aforementioned taxa probably reflects the conservative function of the PepT1 protein product. Both fragments of the PepT1 gene were deposited in GenBank (FJ556590; FJ529670). Conclusion. The sequenced fragments of the common carp PepT1 gene will allow evaluation of PepT1 expression in the intestines of fish fed diets containing various forms of protein, which is an issue of importance regarding fish nutrition and its import for aquaculture.",

Rabbitfishes, Siganus rivulatus and S. luridus, are among the most successful invaders in the Mediterranean Sea but population parameters in their new environment are barely known. Fecundity and condition are key parameters of fish populations and their assessment is very important for exotic species; this information is needed to properly evaluate their reproductive and invasive potential. The current is study contributes to fill this gap by exploring fecundity and condition of those two fish species. Materials and methods. About 1000 individuals of Siganus rivulatus and S. luridus were processed from off the Lebanese coasts over a 20-month period. Fecundity and condition index were estimated and compared. Regression analyses tested the dependence of fecundity on fish length, mass, and gonad mass. Results. Fecundity values were assessed for S. rivulatus and for S. luridus: Fabs = 272 043 ± 144 666 (SD), Frel = 2123 ± 808 oocytes · g-1 for S. rivulatus and Fabs = 245 273 ± 164 211, Frel = 1584 ± 627 oocytes · g-1 for S. luridus. The relation between Fabs and gonad mass [g] was y = 14 339x + 59 297 for S. rivulatus and y = 9245x + 62 140 for S. luridus. Condition exhibited a clear seasonal trend for the two rabbitfishes. It increased in spring prior to the reproduction period and again in autumn before the decrease of seawater temperature, and remained low during the cold period. Its values were significantly higher for S. luridus than to S. rivulatus. Conclusion. S. rivulatus displayed a higher fecundity while S. luridus showed a better condition in the Eastern Mediterranean. Gonad mass was the best predictor of fecundity for both species while condition exhibited a clear seasonal trend in both rabbitfishes.",

Our previous study demonstrated that sharpsnout seabream, Diplodus puntazzo (Walbaum, 1792),can be fed with up to 34.8% sunflower meal (SFM), with excellent results in growth parameters and feed efficiency.&nbsp; The aim of the current study was to test the replacement of fish meal with SFM in the diet formulation for sharpsnout seabreamand to evaluate growth, nutritive parameters, amino acid retention, and body composition of the fish during the fattening period. Materials and methods. Sixteen baskets (300 L capacity), each with thirteen fish, were distributed in a recirculated saltwater system to allow four experimental diets containing 40% crude protein (CP) and 20% crude lipid (CL) with 0%, 11.7%, 23.5%, and 34.8% SFM partially replacing fish meal to be used in quadruplicate for this experiment.&nbsp; The fish were fed these diets ad libitum during the experiment, which lasted for 162 days.&nbsp; Growth, nutrition efficiency, biometrics, carcass composition, amino acid composition, and amino acid retention of the experimental fish were evaluated. Results. There were no statistical differences in the growth parameters among the treatments.&nbsp; However, fish fed a diet containing 34.8% SFM had the lowest feed intake (FI), lowest feed conversion ratio (FCR), and the highest protein efficiency ratio (PER).&nbsp; There were also no statistical differences in the biometric parameters although fish fed the diet containing 10% SFM had the lowest CP levels.&nbsp; Leucine was the only difference in the essential amino acid (EEA) profile with fish fed a diet containing 11.7% SFM having the lowest levels of leucine.&nbsp; Although there were fluctuations among the amino acid retentions, they were not statistically significant. Conclusion. SFM (up to 34.8%) can be included in the diets of sharpsnout seabream, thereby, replacing 27% of the fish meal without altering the fish growth.&nbsp",

Conclusion.Population of monkey goby in the Bulgarian Danube is an example of a stable native population defined by balanced sex ratio, three-year life span, and recruitment represented by strong cohort of 0+ fish, some of them maturing in their second year of life.",

The European eel, Anguilla anguilla (L.), is considered an endangered species and a series of protective measures have been implemented within the European community in order to enhance natural stocks. Restocking natural habitats with larger eels reared from the glass-eel stage in recirculated farming systems may be one solution. Gill diseases caused by monogenean parasites of the genus Pseudodactylogyrus are currently causing morbidity and mortality in these farms and previously applied standard treatments have recently failed. Therefore the applied control methods should be verified and novel solutions proposed. Materials and methods. Eels infected by Pseudodactylogyrus anguillae were obtained from a typical recirculated eel-culture system which had been treated regularly but recently unsuccessfully with benzimidazole anthelmintics. In the laboratory infected eels were subjected to bath treatments with flubendazole (5 or 10 mg &middot; L&ndash;1) or praziquantel (5 or 10 mg &middot; L&ndash;1) for 24 h at 25&ordm;C and parasite infections were recorded three days post-treatment. Results. Gill monogeneans, Pseudodactylogyrus anguillae, were not controlled by the anthelmintic flubendazole at any of the dosages tested whereas praziquantel showed a significant effect when used as bath (5 and 10 mg &middot; L&ndash;1). Conclusion. The failure of flubendazole for control of pseudodactylogyrosis may result from selection of anthelmintic resistant parasite strains due to use of benzimidazoles for decades. Future treatment regimes during acute outbreaks may be based on praziquantel. A risk for future continued selection for anthelmintic resistance exists and supplementary non-chemical methods (mechanical and biological) in rearing of European eel should be emphasized in the future management practice of eel.",

    "abstract": "Background. The northern Iberian chub Squalius carolitertii (Doadrio, 1988) is a small endemic cyprinid inhabiting the rivers of the Iberian Peninsula. The knowledge of feeding patterns is essential to understand the ecological role of fish populations, helping to the development of conservation and management plans. The aim of the present study was to analyze the ontogenetic dietary shifts and food selection of S. carolitertii, contributing to knowledge of the feeding behaviour of this fish species. Materials and methods. Diet composition of S. carolitertii was compared to benthos and drift composition in a river of Central Spain (Ávila, River Tormes) using selectivity indices of Ivlev and Savage. The age of 57 S. carolitertii collected in August 2010 was determined by scale reading and by length frequency analyses (LFA) with the Petersen method. Maximum length of benthos, drift and prey invertebrates was measured for each item to establish whether prey-size selection depends upon the size-frequency distribution of available prey. Results. Detritus were found in 33 fish (57.9% of occurrence). Nymphs of Baetis spp. were the most abundant prey (46.6%) and were identified in the 49.1% of the stomachs. Moreover, Baetis spp. was selected positively from the benthos and drift by all age classes. Abundant potential prey items such as Epeorus spp. in the benthos and Simuliidae in the drift were negatively selected. Individuals without detritus in the gut contained more animal prey items than individuals with a dominance of detritus, and the frequency of occurrence of detritus decreased with the age. Mean prey size increased with fish size (r = 0.646, P < 0.001). Conclusion. Age-related diet shifts occur at three different levels: (1) frequency of occurrence of detritus decreases with fish age; (2) prey selection varied with fish age; and (3) mean prey size increased as fish size increased. The rejection of Epeorus spp. and Simuliidae suggests that other factors, apart of prey abundance, including site-specific prey accessibility, prey size, energetic selection criteria and prey preference of fishes play an important role in feeding behaviour of S. carolitertii. Prey-size selection is probably dependent on the size-frequency distribution of the available prey.",

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent and bioacumulative chemical pollutants which exert negative physiological effects on the reproductive system of mature male and female fish. PCBs present in the aquatic environment may also have an influence on developing embryos. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Aroclor 1254, a polychlorinated biphenyls mixture, on the embryonic development of Prussian carp, Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782), and common carp, Cyprinus carpio L. Materials and methods. The samples of eggs obtained from 4 females of each species were divided into two dishes and incubated separately after fertilization (common carp) or activation (Prussian carp) with common carp sperm. The incubation, with Aroclor 1254 (1 or 10 ng Â· mLâ€“1) or in water with no PCB added, lasted for 4 days. The mortality, hatching rate, number of hatched larvae, and number of deformed larvae were observed. Results. After 24 h of incubation of Prussian carp and common carp eggs there were no significant differences in the percentage of living eggs between the Aroclor 1254 treated groups and the control one. The lowest tested concentration of PCB (1 ng Â· mLâ€“1) accelerated the hatching of Prussian carp larvae at 75 h of incubation. The significant increase in the percentage of deformed larvae was observed only in the experiment with common carp eggs incubated with Aroclor 1254 at the concentration of 10 ng Â· mLâ€“1. Conclusion. Results of the presented data showed that Aroclor 1254 (at tested concentrations) is not harmful for the development of activated Prussian carp eggs but teratogenic effect was observed in the case of common carp embryos.",

    "abstract": "Background. Beluga, Huso huso, known also as the great sturgeon, is a valuable fish in terms of meat and caviar production. It has been implicated that intensive fish culture is a major culprit for deterioration of water quality through metabolic excretion of fish in the aquatic environment. The aims of this study were: to determine the effect of the stocking density on the water quality, to assess the effect of water quality changes on growth of beluga juveniles, and also to determine the optimum density for culture in fiberglass tanks. Materials and methods. Fish were randomly distributed into 15 tanks at 5 different densities including 1 kg &#183; m&#8211;2 (3.90 kg m&#8211;3), 2 kg &#183; m&#8211;2 (7.09 kg &#183; m&#8211;3), 4 kg &#183; m&#8211;2 (14.54 kg &#183; m&#8211;3), 6 kg &#183; m&#8211;2 (21.19 kg &#183; m&#8211;3), and 8 kg &#183; m&#8211;2 (28.64 kg &#183; m&#8211;3) with 3 replicates. Specific growth rate (SGR), yield (Y), average daily growth (ADG), absolute weight gain (AWG), and relative weight gain (RWG) were calculated. Throughout the experiment, water quality parameters including ammonia (NH3), nitrite (NO2), nitrate (NO3) dissolved oxygen (DO), and oxygen saturation (OS) were also measured. Results. Stocking density considerably influences the growth of beluga juveniles and water quality during 56 days of rearing. DO, OS, NO2, NO3, and NH3 were significantly different among treatments. pH and temperature showed no significant effect under different stocking densities. NO2 and NO3 increased, while DO decrease as the stocking density of fish increased. At the end of the 56 days of rearing, all the growth parameters (final weight, total length, SGR, Y, ADG, AWG, and RWG) were significantly different among treatments. Survival was 100% in all of the rearing densities. Conclusion. Results of this study showed that the density of fish had a significant effect on water quality and a high density culture accompanied by intensive feeding may result in high concentrations of nitrogen compounds, and low concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the water of culture tanks. Each of the factors (increase nitrogenous compounds and decrease in oxygen) could suppress the growth of Huso huso juveniles.",

This study was initiated by the first observations of a coastal and benthic Atlantic fish species—Parablennius pilicornis (Cuvier, 1829)on the southern coasts of France.This fish has been recorded in the Mediterranean Sea since 1963, until recently colonizing its entire western part as well as the Adriatic Italian coasts. The aim of this study is to analyse and understand the dynamics of this invasion of P. pilicornisand to report its most recent sightings along theProvencal coast, France. Materials and methods. The data on the geographic distribution of P. pilicornis were either extracted from the relevant literature (majority of records) or contributed by the present authors. For the French coast, particularly the coast of Provence, the latter were data from underwater visual censuses, conducted during various studies or monitoring programs. The data were critically selected, organised, and analysed. Results. Two dispersal pathways seem to have been followed by P. pilicornis. The first follows the coast of Morocco, Algeria, and Italy. The second pathway goes through the Spanish and French coasts. The meeting point of these two ways may be located on the coast of Provance, where we lastly observed this species in 2006. The emergence of P. pilicornis in the Mediterranean Sea corresponds clearly to a marginal dispersal. Colonization of the western Mediterranean took 43 years. Conclusion. Since P. pilicornis is already present on the Italian coast of the Adriatic Sea, the colonization of the eastern Mediterranean seems imminent.Global change, including rising temperatures, seem to be a factor promoting the repartition area of this fish with tropical affinities.",

The blackspotted smooth-hound, Mustelus punctulatus Risso, 1826, has been regularly caught in the northern Adriatic Sea, although a decreasing trend in its catches was observed off the coast of Slovenia within the last decade The knowledge of feeding behaviour of elasmobranch fish species, through understanding of the local food web structure, contributes to better and more efficient fish stock assessment and ecosystem modelling. This study is a first step in determining the prey consumption by the blackspotted smooth-hound in the area. Materials and methods. A total of 151 blackspotted smooth-hounds caught by commercial fishermen in the Gulf of Trieste from 4 June 2002 to 4 June 2003 were examined in this study.&nbsp; The stomach contents were removed, sorted and identified to the lowest possible taxon using identification keys. Preys were counted and weighed. Frequency of occurrence (F%), relative abundance (N%), the percentage by weight (W%), the Index of Relative Importance (IRI), and its standardized value (%IRI) were calculated following standard procedures. For comparing the diet between four different size classes we calculate average prey weight, dietary diversity, average meal, and trophic level for each size class. Results. A total 130 fish stomachs contained prey items. Crustaceans were the most important prey items (IRI% = 56.14), whereas cephalopods were the second mostly preyed animals (IRI% = 20.2). Teleost fish and bivalves were also found in the stomachs. The most important prey species was Solecurtus strigillatus. Larger sharks consumed larger preys. Male and female sharks consumed similar food. Juvenile individuals consumed predominantly crustaceans, while cephalopods were more important in the diet of adult individuals. The calculated trophic index (TROPH) of M. punctulatus from northern Adriatic Sea was 3.7, showing that it is a highly carnivorous species. Conclusion. This study is a first step in determining prey consumption by Mustelus punctulatus which is, despite the fact that is still common in the area, a rather poorly known species. For elucidating the role of benthic sharks in the study area the further step would be to study the diet of a closely related common smooth-hound M. mustelus.",

    "abstract": "Background. The genus Atlantirivulus includes 11 species distributed along coastal river basins and lagoons of eastern and southern Brazil. Most killifishes are threatened with extinction mostly due to their restricted distribution ranges, small population sizes and habitat loss; poor knowledge on ecological and life history information further increase the threats. Atlantirivulus riograndensis (Costa et Lan&#233;s, 2009) is a non-annual, small-sized fish endemic in the Laguna dos Patos basin and adjacent coastal areas in southern Brazil. There is no information on the life history and ecology of the species. In this paper, we analyzed population traits of A. riograndensis to support conservation efforts. Materials and methods. Fishes were captured with a D-shaped hand net in six sampling surveys carried out between 2008 (June, August, October) and 2009 (March, August, October) in the type locality of A. riograndensis. The variation of abundance, body size, and condition factor over time, sex ratio and length&#8211;weight relations were analyzed. Results. The estimated abundance was of 1.97 specimens per 1 m2. The TL means increased along the year, and males were larger than females. Strong differences in proportions of sexes were detected, with high bias for females. The species showed allometric positive growth (b=3.3), and the general condition factor (CF) was 0.258 &#177; 0.003. Conclusion. Atlantirivulus riograndensis inhabits small water bodies and apparently has a small population size. The population is female-biased, and males are typically bigger than females. The species has an allometric positive growth. The body size variation is related to individual growth throughout each study year, and probably by high mortality of adults in dry season. This study presents new original data on basic traits of the natural history of A. riograndensis. The observed results may be used to assist the development of management strategies and conservation of the species and its habitat, mainly in a region where 90% of wetland systems were lost by agriculture, and the remaining areas are at high risk due to the expansion of exotic pine plantations.",

This species is listed as an Endangered cartilaginous species on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Although heavily exploited, until now, no study&nbsp; has been performed on this skate along the Syrian coast in the Levantine&nbsp; basin. This study focuses on the determination of the reproductive period, size at maturity and fecundity of D. oxyrhinchus. Materials and methods. Total length and total weight were determined for 249 specimens of the longnosed skate, captured off Syrian coast. Skates collected were measured and weighed according to standard procedures. Based on the acquired measurements the following relations were determined: disc width&ndash;total weight (DW&ndash;TW), total weight&ndash;total length (TW&ndash;TL), total weight&ndash;disc width (TW&ndash;DW), and total length&ndash;disc width (TL&ndash;DW). Median size (TL50) at maturity was estimated according to commonly accepted methods. Hepatosomatic index (HSI) and gonadosomatic index (GSI) were calculated for males and females. The proportion of the occurrence of developmental stages were noted seasonally. Ovarian fecundity was calculated based on ripe follicles in both ovaries of mature females. Fecundity, expressed as annual egg production per female. Tests for significance (P &lt; 0.05) were performed by using ANOVA, Student t-test, and the chi-square test. In the relations TW&ndash;TL and TW&ndash;DW, comparisons of curves were carried out by using ANCOVA Results. The observed sex ratio was 58.2% &divide; 40.2% (female &divide; male). Mean body measurements of females (n = 14) were slightly higher than males (n = 8). The total length of females ranged from 34.1 to 100.0 cm and males from 34.5 to 81.6 cm. The total length&ndash;total weight, disc width&ndash;total weight, and total length&ndash;disc width relations were TW = 0.0009TL3.35 and TW = 0.0033DW3.34and DW = 0.6894TL + 0.281, respectively, for all sexes combined. Median size (TL50) at maturity were estimated as TL50 = 79.5 cm for females (n = 149) and TL50 = 70.9 cm for males (n = 100). This species had a continuous reproductive cycle. Fecundity was estimated between 50 and 100 egg cases per year. Conclusion. Information on the reproduction of D. oxyrinchus may allow the decision makers to set appropriate catch limits based on biological reference points, and serves as a baseline in the event of increasing exploitation rates. Especially, this information showed that a possible nursery area maybe established in the Syrian marine waters.",

    "abstract": "Background. Freshwater fishes are among the most threatened taxa worldwide. The proliferation of introduced species in the Iberian Peninsula is currently one of the main drivers of native fish declines. One of such species, the bleak, Alburnus alburnus (Linnaeus, 1758), has become widespread in the last 25 years and, due to its phylogenetic proximity, poses a high risk of hybridization with native species. The aim of this study was to improve the current knowledge on this issue by 1) evaluating the presence of hybrids with Alburnus alburnus in the wild, using molecular screening of individuals representing the intermediate morphology and 2) testing if artificial crosses between Alburnus alburnus and the highly threatened native cyprinid Anaecypris hispanica (Steindachner, 1866) resulted in viable hybrid offspring. Materials and methods. The genetic profile of Alburnus alburnus was established using the cytochrome b and beta-actin genes to allow comparisons with the profiles of the sympatric species with which it could potentially hybridize: Anaecypris hispanica; Squalius alburnoides (Steindachner, 1866); and Squalius pyrenaicus (G&uuml;nther, 1868). This profile was further used to assess if fish with the intermediate morphological features were indeed hybrids. Finally, artificial crosses between Alburnus alburnus and Anaecypris hispanica were conducted to test the viability of the offspring. Results. Alburnus alburnus individuals were genetically identical to the stocks introduced in Spain and the Czech Republic. A reference library composed of 15 species-specific nDNA loci was built and used to characterize wild fish showing intermediate morphological features. Results showed that Alburnus alburnus is currently hybridizing with males and females of Squalius alburnoides and that morphometric identification is insufficient for a reliable detection of the hybrids. Artificial crosses between the bleak and the highly threatened Anaecypris hispanica did not result in viable offspring. Conclusion. Phylogenetic relatedness, traduced in the absence of pre- and post-zygotic barriers to reproduction, together with other factors related to the ecology and life history of the species involved are essential for hybridization to occur. As such, the proliferation of the bleak through the Iberian hydrographical network represents a serious additional threat for the already imperilled native Squalius and Anaecypris species.",

    "abstract": "Background. Shrimp fisheries using fyke nets have been associated with a massive acquisition of teleost fishes as bycatch, potentially resulting in the decimation of their stocks. Based on this assumption, the presently reported study intended to test an alternative modification of a commonly used fyke net, in order to minimize the impact of its low selectivity. Materials and methods. To evaluate the alternative design proposed in this work, a total of 44 sampling efforts, including 22 with a control gear (CG) and 22 with a modified gear (MG), were conducted at a subtropical coastal lagoon system located in southern Brazil. In all trials, the fyke nets were installed at the fishing area approximately at 18:00 h and removed approximately at 06:00 h. The duration of each trial was nearly 12 h, which was similar to the catching time preferred by local fishermen. Results. Bycatch (BC) was preponderant in both modalities but the results showed that MG presented a reduction by 66 percentage points in BC catches, being more selective than CG. Additionally, the non-parametric test showed no significant differences of shrimp catches between the fishing gears used (MG and CG). So, the tested bycatch reduction devices (BRD) reduced the bony fishes acquisition preserving the volume of the target catch. Conclusion. The vertical opening reduction due the adoption of guiding panel + fan upper panel contributed to bycatch reduction, being a consistent BRD to reduce the potential impacts of this fishing gear over the bony fishes stocks.",

Materials and methods. Specimens of C. nobilis were collected monthly from August 2011 through July 2012, using an artisanal shrimp outrigger trawler from the local fleet. The population structure was analysed by sex, length, and seasons. Stomachs and gonads were removed and examined to define the length at first maturity (L50) and the feeding habits of C. nobilis in north-eastern Brazil. Results. A total of 272 specimens were caught. The sex ratio was similar among females and males in the area. The mean size at first maturity (L50) was estimated as 14.3 ± 0.65 cm. The diet of the species was mainly based on crustaceans (Penaeidae) and fish, however, it was not observed differences in the diet between juvenile and adults, and climate seasons. Conclusion. Conodon nobilis was classified as a zoobenthivore species, and showed a higher proportion of individuals caught above the L50. The information here provided, combined with other studies in the region, may contribute to the development of improved management strategies to species conservation and exploited marine habitats in northeast Brazil, which is still mostly unknown.",

    "abstract": "Background. The majority of European populations of vimba, Vimba vimba (L.), have been classified into increasing categories of conservation status while Polish populations of this fish are classified as CR (critically endangered) and in fact they are facing extinction. In many rivers in Poland, including the Odra River, restitution efforts of vimba have been undertaken. Monitoring some biological parameters of the population such as the rate of growth (increase in mass and length), age structure, sex structure, and condition nay help to evaluate the success rate of the restitution efforts. Materials and methods. In total, 210 individuals of vimba, caught in the waters of the southern part of the Odra River estuary, mainly in Lake DÄ…bie, between 28 May 2007 and 30 June 2008 were studied as to their age, condition, rate of growth in mass and length. Making use of the linear R–L dependence, the back calculations were made according to the Rosa Lee procedure with a standard of 20 mm. Results were approximated by 5 mathematical models of growth proposed by von Bertalanffy, Ford–Walford, Gompertz, and based on second degree polynomial function and modified power function. Increase in mass was described by a modified von Bertalanffy equation. The condition of the fish was described by the Fulton (K) and Le Cren (Lc) formulae. Results. Females dominated in the material studied, they constituted over 61% of all individuals. In the age structure groups, females were most often found in groups: 10+ (13.33%), 9+, and 11+ (12.86% each). Males were found in the greatest number among 5-, 6-, and 7-year-old fish (4+, 5+, and 6+, respectively). The mean standard length and mass of the vimba fish studied were 306.33 mm and 286.02 g, respectively. The annual increase in length of the fish approximated 20 mm, being the most intense in the first two years of life (23–24 mm). Fulton and Le Cren coefficients of condition were 0.93 and 1.64 and the ranges of these values were 0.69–1.47 and 1.15–2.60, respectively. Conclusion. Analysis of back readings and empirical results proved that the growth of vimba was best approximated by the von Bertalanffy model. Comparative analysis of condition coefficients of the population of vimba in the Odra River estuary and other populations showed that the condition of analysed vimba population in individual years of live was lower.",

    "abstract": "Background. Hatching is a process in which the embryo emerges from the egg by breaking the protective egg shell. Our preliminary observations indicate that hatching duration and time-distribution may vary among and within the fish species, and that some embryos fail to hatch or hatch incompletely, probably due to the &ldquo;incorrect&rdquo; hatching way. So the aim of this study was a detailed description of hatching of three fish species: common carp, barbel, and rainbow trout. Materials and methods. Three species of fish: common carp, Cyprinus carpio; barbel, Barbus barbus; and rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss; were examined for their hatching modes. The mode and the time of hatching of each larva were noted. Newly hatched larvae were counted and examined. The malformations were classified. Observations of embryos and larvae were done using the stereoscopic microscope Nikon connected to the computer with the MultiScan 8.4 image analysis system; the hatching embryos and larvae were photographed. Results. Three modes of hatching were observed, two of them similar in all three fish species. Some fish started hatching tail first from the egg shell, others head first or&mdash;specifically for barbel&mdash;yolk sac first. The data obtained in the present study showed that tail hatching was the most successful in all fish species, and shown by most good quality larvae. The majority of tail-hatched larvae developed normally and were viable, and only some of them were deformed and showed slight morphological defects, mainly single vertebral malformations that in most cases were negligible. Head hatching was the precarious in carp, and in all fish species less common and successful comparing to the tail hatching. Conclusion. The hatching mode could beused as another good parameter for estimation of quality of eggs and larvae.",

    "abstract": "Background. Shrimps are one of the most valuable marine resources of Oman and shrimp fisheries is greatly contributing to the national economy, and sustainability of traditional fisheries villages. However, the shrimp trawl fishery has one of the highest bycatch rate of any fishery and cause negative impacts to marine populations and benthic habitats. This study provides the first data on the composition and abundance of the bycatch in the main shrimp fishing grounds distributed along the south-eastern coastline of Oman in the Arabian Sea. Materials and methods. Shrimp trawl survey was conducted monthly from January to December 2013 in seven sites using demersal otter trawl. Overall, 93 trawl catches were used for the analysis of the bycatch composition based on weight, number, and frequency of occurrence. Top ten species and top fish families, cephalopods, and crabs were defined in the bycatch. The bycatch compositions were compared in different regions using biodiversity indices and the cluster analysis. Results. Mean monthly bycatch during the shrimp trawling survey in the coastal waters of Oman in 2013 ranged from 22.2 to 191.5 kg · h–1, in different months with an overall mean (±SE) of 58.7 ± 5.2 kg · h–1 (n = 93). The bycatch to catch ratio was estimated 8.9 : 1 for shrimp fisheries. This ratio fluctuated significantly over the year with minimum values from April to September. The bycatch composition included 97 bony fish species from 36 families, 12 species from 7 elasmobranchs families and several species of cephalopods and crabs. Catfishes (Ariidae), frogfish (Antennariidae), ponyfishes (Leiognathidae), and rays (Dasyatidae and Gymnuridae), represented a majority of the bycatch. Conclusion. Shrimp fishery in Oman is affecting mainly small-sized and slow-moving fishes, and invertebrates with low economic value. However, the fine-meshed shrimp trawls also capture juveniles of commercial important fishes and cause some ecological problems. The results from the study point out the necessity of management actions to develop a special policy on bycatch reduction in Oman fisheries.",

    "abstract": "Background. The ability to distinguish between stocks in mixed fisheries is a prerequisite for a sustainable fisheries management. In the Gulf of Bothnia the relative contribution of endangered river-spawning and sea-spawning whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus (Linnaeus, 1758), to fisheries catches are currently not well known. This also applies to the southern &#197;land Islands, a major feeding ground for river-spawning whitefish from northern rivers. River- and sea-spawning whitefish are mixed while away from the breeding grounds and off the spawning season, and cannot be distinguished based on external features. Materials and methods. Analysis on gill raker numbers of river-spawning (n = 480) and sea-spawning (n = 456) whitefish from twelve locations at the Finnish west coast and the &#197;land Islands was performed. In whitefish sampled from feeding grounds at the &#197;land Islands the strontium concentration was analysed in otoliths from fish (n = 20) with low (27) and high (30) number of gill rakers. Results. A marked difference in the mean gill raker number of the river- and sea-spawning whitefish stocks was observed. The weighted mean of gill rakers of whitefish caught at spawning locations showed that the number of gill rakers of fish from rivers and the sea were 29.9 &#177; 2.14&#160; (n = 480) and 26.7 &#177; 2.21&#160; (n = 456), respectively. The difference between the two groups was highly significant (t = 22.50, df = 934, P &#60; 0.0001). The means differed by 3.20 (2.92&#8211;3.48, 95% CL) indicating the groups are well separated.&#160; In whitefish sampled at feeding grounds at the &#197;land Islands, otolith strontium concentration was higher (t = 2.09, df = 18, P = 0.04) in fish having 27 gill rakers (3.86 &#177; 0.30 mg &#183; g&#8211;1, n = 10), compared to those having 30 gill rakers (3.54 &#177; 0.35 mg &#183; g&#8211;1, n = 10).&#160; Otolith strontium analysis thereby supported the utility of gill raker counting data for estimating the proportion of river- and sea-spawning whitefish in mixed populations. As expected, the gill raker counting method successfully indicated temporal alterations in the proportions of river- and sea-spawning whitefish on feeding grounds. Conclusion. Gill raker counting is an easy, fast, and inexpensive method that can be used to estimate the spatiotemporal occurrence and migratory patterns of river- and sea-spawning whitefish at the southern feeding grounds in the Gulf of Bothnia, and thereby aid in a sustainable management of whitefish stocks.",

    "abstract": "Background. One of the largest European populations of white bream, Blicca bjoerkna (Linnaeus, 1758), can be found in the estuary of the Oder River. This fish is not only very abundant in this area but also attains sizes that have no match in other areas of central Europe. In search for the clues behind such reproductive success we decided to study the annual development cycle of gonads of white bream from three sites in the lower Oder River, north-western Poland, differing in temperature regimes (depending on their position and the distance from the discharge outlet of the Dolna Odra Power Plant). Materials and methods. White bream individuals were obtained from the three sites as bycatch of commercial fishing in 2009 and 2010. Three sites were sampled: (1) the Oder River above the power plant, (2) the warm-water canal with post-cooling water discharged from the power plant, and (3) Lake Dąbie, 20 km below the warm-water canal. The fish age was determined as 2+ through 9+. In total, 506 females and 190 males were designated for histological analyses. The analysis of the annual cycle of gonad development was performed in both sexes using histological methods. A standard paraffin technique and Heidenhain's iron hematoxylin staining were used. Results. In the Oder River, spawning of white bream lasted from early May to late June. In Lake Dąbie, it extended until the beginning of July. The spawn was laid in 2 or 3 portions. In the warm-water canal spawning began one month earlier, in April. The bream males from the thermally unaffected Oder River were ready for reproduction approximately one month earlier than the females and maintained their reproductive potential similarly to the females. Males from the warm-water canal became sexually mature two months earlier (February) than those from the river above the power plant. Conclusion. In waters with elevated temperature, gametogenesis of white bream occurs without problems and the fish exhibit a typical pace of growth depending on the temperature. In the perspective of climate warming, white bream will be able to maintain its status of a common species in the natural waters of the region.",

    "abstract": "Background. Fish-based indices for evaluation of river ecosystem quality have been used since the 1980s, when the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI) was first introduced. Assessment of the ecological status of rivers, based on fish assemblages is required by the Water Framework Directive. During last 15 years a number of national assessment methods based on fish fauna were developed. The recently designed tool for fish-based assessment of ecological status (EFI+IBI_PL) applied in river monitoring in Poland is presented in this paper. Materials and methods. The new European Fish Index EFI+ is a multimetric tool consisting of two specific indices, each with two metrics developed separately for salmonid- and cyprinid-river zones. Those metrics were used in the European intercalibration process to validate national methods. However, the original EFI+ method is not adequate to some lowland river types (physical-factor classification), so it was complemented by a type-specific modification of the Index of Biotic Integrity (IBI_PL). The method was tested on fish data from 493 sites located in 431 surface water bodies sampled in 2011–2012 according to the CEN standard 14011. Results. The EFI+ index was adapted to the specificity of Polish rivers by eliminating some inconsistences of the ecoregion division and problems related to the lack of the Dniester River in the EFI+ software and presented in this paper as EFI+PL. The index of diadromous fish occurrence (D) was also adapted from an original EFI+ method and used as a supplementary assessment tool. Specific IBI metrics were developed for large lowland rivers (with sandy or gravel bottom substrate), organic rivers (flowing through peat areas), and rivers connecting lakes (with the presence or lack of salmonid fish species). A software tool for indices calculation was also developed. The method combination (EFI+IBI_PL) was than tested on a set of 493 monitoring sites sampled in 2011–2012. Both indices classified the highest percentage of sites into moderate ecological state/potential class, but for IBI_PL this percentage was much higher than for EFI+. Percentage of sites classified to good ecological status or high ecological potential by IBI_PL index were lower than for EFI+. The analysis indicates the consistence of classification for 77% of sites to high/good and below good ecological status by the EFI+PL/IBI_PL method and pressure index. Conclusion. The results of a two-years monitoring program show that the combination of modified EFI+ and IBI methods can be applied as a tool for river ecological status assessment in Poland, however some further method modifications are needed.",

    "abstract": "Background. This study is the first attempt to acquire information about growth, age composition, and mortality of European hake, Merluccius merluccius (Linneaus, 1758), in the northern Aegean Sea. In Turkey, the hake is a very important commercial species captured with demersal trawls. Therefore the management of the hake fishery is important for the stock sustainability. The aim of this study was to determine the age composition, growth, and mortality of hake from Gökçeada Island, northern Aegean Sea, Turkey. Materials and methods. A total of 2253 hake specimens were collected monthly in three fishing seasons off Gökçeada Island from September 2013 to April 2016 with a commercial trawler. Fish age was estimated based on otoliths. Growth parameters were calculated according to the von Bertalanffy growth equation. Results. The total length ranged from 5.9 cm to 51.2 cm for all individuals. The length–weight relation was W = 0.0034TL3.2249 (R² = 0.9655). The age of the fish was estimated to range from 1 to 6 years. Growth parameters were as follows, L∞ = 88.54 cm, k = 0.1088, t0 = –0.9962 for males, L∞ = 102.34 cm, k = 0.0908, t0 = –1.3105 for females, and L∞ = 102.66 cm, k = 0.0992, t0 = –0.8085 for all fish sampled. The total, natural, and fishing mortality ratio of the samples were found as 2.21, 0.57, and 1.64, respectively. Conclusion. The exploitation ratio (E) of the samples was estimated to be 0.74, showing a high fishing pressure on the hake population and it will be the main argument for the need of a strict management on the hake fishery in the area studied. The other argument is the high number of juveniles in the catch composition. It is expected that the results of the presently reported study will contribute to the sustainable fishery for hake. The minimum landing size in the Turkish waters should be increased from 20 cm to 25 cm to ensure at least single breeding of Merluccius merluccius.",

    "abstract": "Background. Fish farms attract both juvenile and adult wild fishes in great numbers and diversity. These wild fishes also become an easy target stock for local fishers, both professional and recreational. There are three groups of interest in this study, the fish farmers, small-scale fishermen (professional), and recreational fishers (mostly anglers but also spear fishers). This study was intended to determine conflicts derived from the adverse social and bioecological interactions from the perspective of both local fishermen and fish farmers and to determine the observed incidence of predators. Materials and methods. In this study, 48 randomly selected fish farms, 28 fishery cooperatives, and 33 fishing ports located close to aquaculture areas were visited for face-to-face interviews with the fishermen of small-scale fisheries (SSF) between July 2015 and July 2017. The main purpose of the survey questionnaire was to ask SSF fishermen for their opinion about offshore aquaculture and vice versa—ask the fish farmers about SSF, emphasizing issues potentially creating problems. Data were collected mainly on sociodemographic profiles, current problems, reciprocal conflict issues, the impact of offshore fish farming on SSF activities, and on bioecological interactions such as predator attacks and problems with farm fish escapes. Results. Approximately 77% of fishermen in Izmir and 71% of fishermen in Muğla declared that they had problems with the sea-cage fish farms. On the other hand, 40% of fish farmers in Izmir and 54% of fish farmers in Muğla reported problems with local SSF. The fishermen believe that in recent years, Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus monachus), sea turtle (Caretta caretta), and invasive fish (pufferfish, etc.) populations have been increasing in Muğla. Additionally, 46% of Muğla fish farmers and 60% of Izmir fish farmers acknowledged cases of fishes escaping from sea-cages. In terms of the predators, 84% of Muğla and 75% of Izmir's fishermen expressed their concerns regarding predator attacks on the sea-cage farms. Conclusion. Further studies, based on socioeconomic issues, are needed for better understanding the dimensions of incomes and economic losses of SSF and cooperation issues in the area where the interaction is high. We suggest that all stakeholders, small-scale fishermen, in particular, must be integrated with a management plan, and the cooperation among both fishing groups should be encouraged.",

    "abstract": "Background. The European grayling, Thymallus thymallus (Linnaeus, 1758), is a fish species of high value in recreational fishing. The monitoring of changes in grayling populations is a high priority in fisheries. Data on the harvest of recreational anglers can potentially serve as an easy and inexpensive way to monitor changes in fish populations. This study aimed to assess spatio-temporal trends in catches of grayling in a larger geographical area. Materials and methods. This study analysed harvest rates of grayling by recreational anglers on 241 fishing grounds, in the Czech Republic, within 1986–2015 (30 years). Data from individual angling logbooks were used. The data were collected by individual anglers and processed by the Czech Fishing Union (Český rybářský svaz). Results. Over the period of 30 years, Czech anglers harvested a total of 9 928 grayling specimens weighing altogether 3 357 kg. Within the period surveyed, both parameters (the grayling biomass harvested and the representation of grayling in overall fish harvest) decreased to 10% of the initial values. The percentage of fishing grounds with a harvest of grayling decreased to 30% of the initial values. Harvest per effort decreased to 20% of the initial values over 11 years. There was only a weak correlation between fish stocking and fish harvest. There was a negative relation between the number of angler fishing visits with both catch (fish number) and yield (biomass) of grayling. The harvest was positively correlated with fishing effort. The mean size of harvested grayling remained constant (~0.35 kg) over 30 years. Conclusion. Harvest of grayling significantly declined over the last three decades, implying that increased effort in conservation of grayling is necessary. Future studies should focus on monitoring of the remaining self-reproducing grayling populations.",

    "abstract": "Background. The molecular diversity of brown trout, Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758, has been poorly studied in Croatia. The control region of mitochondrial DNA (CR mtDNA) is in addition to other molecular markers a reliable for identifying phylogenetic lineages (haplogroups) and haplotypes of brown trout. Based on analyses of the control region of mitochondrial DNA several major brown trout phylogenetic lineages were identified of which the Danubian (DA) haplotypes, though not all, are considered native to Croatian rivers belonging to the Danube basin. The introduction of allochthonous haplotypes into natural streams seriously threatens the genetic diversity of this species. Therefore, the aim of this study was to map brown trout populations inhabiting Croatian rivers of the Danube River basin and to investigate their molecular diversity and phylogeographic patterns of the established haplotypes. Materials and methods. Anal fin tissue was taken from 141 specimens of brown trout in 14 localities in the protected areas of Croatia, situated in the mountainous regions of Gorski Kotar, Žumberak, as well as Mountain Papuk in the western Slavonia. The total DNA was extracted and then the amplification of the mtDNA control region was carried out using primers Trutta-mt-F and HN20. Amplification of the 440 bp long region of the LDH-C1 gene locus was done using primers Ldhxon3F and Ldhxon4R. Amplified LDH-C* fragments were used for Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) analysis using BselI restriction enzyme. Results. Analysis of the CR mtDNA revealed the presence of two phylogenetic lineages, the DA and the Atlantic (AT). Haplotypes Da1, Da2, and Da22 were recorded within the DA lineage and At1 was recorded within the AT haplogroup. Two new haplotypes were described for the first time in this study and are named Da1f and Da1g. Restriction analysis of the lactate dehydrogenase gene locus revealed a high degree of hybridization between brown trout of DA and AT haplogroups. Conclusion. The results of this study confirmed the complex molecular diversity of brown trout and the high degree of the introduction of non-native haplogroups into rivers of the Danube basin in Croatia. Conservation of native brown trout populations has become evident, as introduced allochthonous DA and AT haplogroups severely disrupt the indigenous brown trout stock.",

To understand the effects of artificial breeding on the genetic diversity of three consecutive P. vachellii breeding populations (F1, F2, and F3) since 2012, a genetic analysis was conducted using polymorphic microsatellite markers. The mean allele number, expected heterozygosity, observed heterozygosity, and the polymorphic information content from generation F1 to F3 decreased from 7.75 to 5.63, from 0.77 to 0.63, from 0.83 to 0.77, and from 0.72 to 0.58, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance showed greater genetic divergence within the three generations (93.67%) than that among the generations (6.33%), and the overall differentiation level was moderate. Additionally, the lowest genetic differentiation was between F2 and F3 ( F st = 0.0484), and the highest was between F1 and F3 ( F st = 0.12864). Inbreeding occurred in each generation and was the highest in generation F3. Structural analysis showed that the three P. vachellii generations were most likely divided into two different genetic clusters. Although genetic diversity declined slightly in the mass selection lines after three breeding generations, overall genetic diversity was maintained at a relatively high level. To minimize the loss of genetic diversity and inbreeding in the subsequent breeding process, a moderate number of parents can be used for each generation. Information regarding the genetic diversity and structure of the selective P. vachellii breeding generations obtained in this study will be useful for future broodstock management and selective breeding programs.",

In order to provide theoretical support for fishery resource assessment and sustainable utilization of D. anguillare , an important bycatch in the offshore area of China, the relations between morphological traits and body weight were investigated based on the measurement of 28 metric traits for the first time. The correlation analysis showed that 25 morphological traits were significantly ( P &amp;lt; 0.05) correlated with the logarithm of body weight (lg X 0 ), in which the correlation coefficient of the total length ( X 1 ) was the largest with the extremely high significance ( P &amp;lt; 0.01). The optimum multiple regression equation of morphological traits was constructed after deleting redundant independent variables: lg X 0 = 0.367 + 0.003 X 1 + 0.010 X 7 – 0.010 X 8 + 0.011 X 10 + 0.042 X 14 + 0.006 X 15 + 0.024 X 19 – 0.004 X 23 . The total length ( X 1 ) had the highest positive direct relation with lg X 0 (0.699), which was in accordance with the results of determinate coefficient analysis, while the indirect effect of body height ( X 7 ) through lower jaw length ( X 19 ) to lg X 0 was the greatest. The gray correlation analysis indicated that body length ( X 2 ) and distance from snout to dorsal fin origin ( X 22 ) were the most closely related to body weight. The comprehensive comparison showed that X 1 , X 2 , and X 22 should be used as the ideal morphometric traits for measuring the body weight of D. anguillare , and the conclusions obtained from this study will provide valuable references for fishery resource management of this commercial fish species.",

    "abstract": "European grayling, Thymallus thymallus (Linnaeus, 1758) (Actinopterygii: Salmoniformes: Salmonidae), represents one of the highly attractive riverine fishing species in Europe. Its populations have declined in the Czech Republic due to various adverse factors. Current approaches for strengthening these populations based on restocking with artificially reared 1+ or 2+ old individuals have proven to be ineffective. This study focuses on the possibilities of supporting or restoring these populations by reintroducing two-month-old, fast-growing fry reared in ponds. In June 2021, 5400 advanced fry marked with Alizarin Red (ARS) were introduced into three free-flowing South Bohemian streams. The recapture rates and biometric data (length and weight) of stocked grayling were assessed at the release sites as well as further downstream. The first electrofishing monitoring was conducted at the end of the growing season (October) and after their first winter (March). Water temperature and flow rate at the stocking sites were monitored throughout the growing season. The substantial number of recaptured individuals across all monitored sites suggests that the fry successfully adapted to their new habitat and significantly contributed to the composition of local fish communities. Downstream movement of stocked fry correlated with lower water temperatures and higher flows. Our findings demonstrate that some introduced individuals successfully overwintered at all three reintroduction sites. Marking with ARS has proven to be a very effective non-invasive method of group marking juvenile fish and is suitable for monitoring stocking programs. The production and stocking of fast-growing advanced fry of European grayling is thus a promising strategy for revitalizing and strengthening the populations of this threatened fish in running waters.",

    "abstract": "Background.There is still a widespread notion that bony fishes with high fecundities are more productive and therefore more resistant to overexploitation.The purpose of this study was to formally explore the relationship between fecundity and reproductive success expressed as maximum annual reproductive rate, i.e. the number of new spawners produced by existing spawners at low population densities.Material and methods.We used maximum annual reproductive rate from a recent study covering 49 species of bony fish; we used fecundity estimates from the published literature.Results.We found no significant relationship between fecundity (ranging from 368 to 10 million eggs) and maximum annual reproductive rate (ranging from 0.4 to 13.5 replacement spawners).Conclusion.Fecundity in oviparous bony fish without parental care has no relation with reproductive success.Apparently high fecundity in bony fish has evolved to counterbalance pre-adult mortality, as indicated by the fact that variance in fecundity is 3 orders of magnitude larger than variance in annual reproductive rate.",

    "abstract": "Determining the age and growth of fish from temperate waters from hard structures is a classical procedure in fisheries science, with scales usually used when a nondestructive process is required.The ability to accurately determine ages from scales is therefore crucial, especially as the data generated are the foundation for determining population growth rates, mortality rates, ages at maturity, recruitment patterns, and production (Ricker 1975, Bagenal and Tesch 1978, Campana 2001)-information integral to the formulation of many fisheries management strategies.Ageing fish from scales is prone to errors arising from the subjective interpretation of their features (Mann and Steinmetz 1985).Interpretation is made difficult when, for example, annuli overlay each other at the scale margin-a common feature of scales taken from older fish-and when false checks are produced during a growth year.These factors may ultimately result in an age misclassification (Beamish 1979, Campana 2001).This paper reports on a case study regarding the effects of the subjectivity of scale ageing on subsequent growth and recruitment outputs.Research investigating the factors affecting the recruitment of roach, Rutilus rutilus (L.), in the River Stour, Essex, England, between 1969 and 1996 had revealed annually variable recruitment patterns and the infrequent recruitment of strong year classes",

This species is not fished commercially at present. The high content of vitamin A and vitamin D in burbot liver oil was first reported in 1930. Since that time, there have been little or no research studies made on the nutritional components of burbot liver oil. The present study was aimed to assess the key nutritional components present in liver oil isolated from burbot caught in two northern Canadian lakes. Materials and methods. Liver oil extracted from liver isolated from burbot caught in two northern Canadian lakes was tested for n-3 fatty acids and fat-soluble vitamins. Thermal stability of the liver oil was also evaluated. Burbot tissue was also analyzed for comparison purposes. Results. The contents of n-3 fatty acids, vitamin A and vitamin D of burbot liver oil were found to be comparable to those of the (reference) cod liver oil. Vitamin K content was discovered to be surprisingly high in comparison to known leafy green vegetable food sources. Conclusion. Burbot liver oil could provide a single source of dietary supplement of n-3 fatty acids, vitamin A, vitamin D, and vitamin K to meet the daily recommended nutritional allowances.",

    "abstract": "Background. Asian pangasiids (Actinopterygii: Siluriformes: Pangasiidae), commonly referred to as \"panga\", have recently became an important item on the European fish markets. The fish are currently imported from south-east Asia but the growing consumers' demand is likely to motivate European fish growers to culture the \"panga\" locally. This in turn could bring about unforeseeable consequences for the aquatic environment. The presently reported study provides the first record of a pangasiid fish (two specimens) from the European natural waters. We attempted to identify the fish through complex morphometric procedures and to study all their parasites, thus determining their potential threat for the environment. Materials and methods. Two specimens of pangasiid fish were captured in a pond, in the city of Szczecin, Poland. The fish were examined following procedures commonly accepted in morphological studies yielding detailed measurements. The key structures were described and illustrated (e.g., the shape of dentition on both the vomerine and palatine plates). The measurements were taken with an electronic calliper and a dissecting microscope (Nikon SMZ 1000), coupled with the Lucia Measurement System. Additionally, during necropsy, selected organs were checked for the presence of parasites. Results. One of the fish specimens hosted the monogenoid parasite, Thaparocleidus caecus, that has never been found in Europe. Metric and meristic characters of fish studied, as well as the presence of monogenoid T. caecus suggest that the fish found were representatives of Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, however, some features, especially those related to the ratio between fins and body or total length, differ markedly from the species description. Comparative analysis suggested that the two specimens collected in Szczecin are hybrids, most likely of P. hypophthalmus with other species, of unknown origin, presumably imported from Thailand. Conclusion. The specific identity of pangasiids imported alive to Europe should be monitored in the future. Additional genetic studies are needed. The monogenoid parasite found on the fish studied poses no threat to the native ichthyofauna (because of its very narrow host-specificity).",

The aim of present study is to provide information on age structure and growth, length at sexual maturity, annual cycle of gonad development, and diet of rock goby in the south-eastern Black Sea. Materials and methods. One hundred seventy-five specimens of G. paganellus were sampled from two stations in the province of Rize, south-eastern Black Sea. Samplings were performed by free diving using spear gun and hand net at night time. Specimens were dissected and sagittal otoliths, stomachs, livers, and gonads were removed. Otoliths were cleaned, immersed in glycerol, and examined on black background using reflected light at low magnification to determine age. Mean size at sexual maturity (L50) (i.e., size at which 50% of fish are mature) was estimated for males and females by fitting the logistic Gompertz function to the proportion of mature fish per cm size-class. The gonadosomatic index, seminal vesicle somatic index, and hepatosomatic index were calculated on monthly basis. The quantitative importance of different prey in the diet was assessed by calculating the frequency of occurrence, the percentage number, and the percentage mass of prey. The main food index (IMF) was calculated to combine the three used methods (IMF = (0.5 (%F + %N) %W)0.5). Results. The maximum age was estimated to be 7 and 6 years for males and females, respectively. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters was estimated from the mean age-length data for males and females (males: L∞ = 13.1 cm, k = 0.34, to= –0.11; females: L∞ = 18.2 cm, k = 0.18, to= –0.07). The estimated length at sexual maturity was 5.20 and 5.50 cm for males and females, respectively. The spawning season was between March and May. Total fecundity ranged from 1550 to 5839 eggs/female, with an average of 4322 ± 1109 eggs per female. The rock goby feeds on a wide variety of prey items, particularly on gammarids, brachyurans, natantians, bivalves, isopods, and fish. Conclusion. Growth rate (K) and growth performance index (φ'), length at sexual maturity, fecundity and feeding habits of Black Sea rock goby differ from Atlantic populations.",

    "abstract": "Background. Poor selectivity of trawl cod-ends has been a major problem of the modern-day fisheries, contributing to destruction of non-target organisms. It is expected thatincreased trawl selectivity can reduce bycatch and discards. This would only be true if significant numbers of the escaping fishes survive. The chances of survival of many species after escaping the trawl cod-end are still poorly known. This study was aimed at providing mortality estimates of brown comber, Serranus hepatus, escaping from two different demersal trawl cod-ends (40 mm diamond and square) in the Aegean Sea. We also looked at possible seasonal variation in the survival rate of escaped brown comber (diamond mesh). Materials and methods. Two experiments were conducted off the Yassica Island, Izmir Bay (Aegean Sea, Turkish coast): in winter 2007 and summer 2008. Five hauls were performed in winter (January&ndash;February 2007), and nine hauls in late summer (September 2008). Sampling time was 15 min, except for a control cage in 2007 experiments. Results. No significant difference in the mortality of brown comber for 40 mm diamond mesh cod-end was demonstrated between the winter (2.2 percentage points) and the summer (1.9 percentage points). Throughout each period of this experiment, the survival of escaping brown comber showed a length-dependent mortality, with the majority of dead fish being less than 8.8 and 9.4 cm in length for diamond and square test cages, respectively. The experiments carried out in 2008 demonstrated that the survival of brown comber for diamond and square test cages was generally very high (98.1% and 82.9%, respectively). Conclusion. The escape mortality of brown comber was negligible for two different cod-ends and seasons.",

    "abstract": "Background. Shark populations within the eastern Mediterranean are declining due to overfishing. Unfortunately, our knowledge on the biology of sharks and specifically dogfishes within eastern Mediterranean is extremely limited due to the lack of landings. Mustelus mustelus (Linnaeus, 1758) is one of such deficiently known cartilaginous fishes and the relevant information on its age and growth in the eastern Mediterranean is missing. The understanding of growth and reproductive behaviour is important for management and conservation of this species. The presently reported study was intended to determine age, growth, and some reproductive parameters of Mustelus mustelus collected in the Gulf of Iskenderun, the north-eastern Mediterranean Sea. Materials and methods. In this study, a total of 155 Mustelus mustelus were caught in the north-eastern Mediterranean Sea between March 2012 and October 2015. Fish age was determined based on band counts of sectioned vertebrae. The periodicity of band pair formation was examined using the marginal increment analysis. Growth parameters for all specimens were then determined by fitting the observed and the length-at-age data using the von Bertalanffy Growth Equation. The size and age at which 50% of both sexes reached maturity was estimated by a logistic model for maximum likelihood process and the gonadosomatic index was determined. Results. The total length and weight of the specimens examined ranged from 44.3 to 162.6 cm and from 241.3 to 12 060 g, respectively. The presently reported study provides new maximum lengths (162.6 cm) for M. mustelus from the north-eastern Mediterranean. The fish studied represented age groups from 0 through 25. The observed sex ratio was 1 ÷ 1.04 (females ÷ males). Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were estimated to be L∞ = 195.13 cm, W∞ = 20 060 g, K = 0.06, and t0 = −4.27 for all specimens. Length–weight relation was found to be W = 0.0027L3.0054 (R2 = 0.98) and 95% confidence intervals of b = 2.936–3.075, t-test P < 0.05. All studied specimens of M. mustelus represented isometric growth (b = 3). Condition factor ranged from 0.148 to 2.87 for females and from 0.103 to 1.024 for males. The length at 50% maturity and the age at 50% maturity were 109 cm and 8 in females and 92 cm and 7 in males, respectively. It was observed that mean GSI values were low in September and July, reaching a maximum in January to February. Conclusion. The results of this study could give useful insight for management plans and conservation of M. mustelus in the Mediterranean coast of Turkey.",

    "abstract": "Background. Laguna de Tamiahua is ecologically and economically important as a nursery area that favours the recruitment of species that sustain traditional fisheries. It has been studied previously, though not throughout its whole area, and considering the variety of habitats that sustain these fisheries, as well as an increase in population growth that impacts the system. The objectives of this study were to present an updated list of fish species, data on special status, new records, commercial importance, dominance, density, ecotic position, and the spatial and temporal distribution of species in the lagoon, together with a comparison of Tamiahua with 14 other Gulf of Mexico lagoons. Materials and methods. Fish were collected in August and December 1996 with a Renfro beam net and an otter trawl from different habitats throughout the lagoon. The species were identified, classified in relation to special status, new records, commercial importance, density, dominance, ecotic position, and spatial distribution patterns. Results. The 45 species collected by the authors plus an additional 125 species previously reported provided an updated list of 170 species. Families with the highest number of species were Sciaenidae (16 spp.) and Gobiidae (12 spp.). Poecilia latipunctata Meek, 1904 is endemic to Mexico and in danger of extinction and Hippocampus zosterae Jordan et Gilbert, 1882 is under special protection. New records are Ariopsis assimilis (G&uuml;nther, 1864), Mugil liza Valenciennes, 1836, Symphurus civitatium Ginsburg, 1951, and Aluterus schoepfii (Walbaum, 1792). Commercially important species are Lutjanus griseus (Linnaeus, 1758), Lutjanus synagris (Linnaeus, 1758), Bairdiella chrysoura (Lacep&egrave;de, 1802), Cynoscion arenarius Ginsburg, 1930, Cynoscion nebulosus (Cuvier, 1830), Cynoscion nothus (Holbrook, 1848), and Archosargus probatocephalus (Walbaum, 1792). The highest densities were recorded for Eucinostomus melanopterus (Bleeker, 1863), Eucinostomus gula (Quoy et Gaimard, 1824), Syngnathus scovelli (Evermann et Kendall, 1896), Achirus lineatus (Linnaeus, 1758), and Cathorops aguadulce (Meek, 1904). The dominant species were Cathorops melanopus (G&uuml;nther, 1864), Citharichthys spilopterus G&uuml;nther, 1862, and E. gula. Conclusion. The majority of the fishes collected in the Laguna de Tamiahua favoured seagrass beds along &lsquo;costa mar&rsquo;, the islands Juan A. Ram&iacute;rez and del Idolo, and areas near the northern and southern inlets. Of the 170 fish species, 10 were present in the 15 compared lagoons, five were recorded only in Tamiahua, and the other species were present in 2 to 14 lagoons. The lagoons most similar to Tamiahua regarding the composition of ichthyofauna were Tampamachoco, T&eacute;rminos, Alvarado, and Madre. This study contributed to the knowledge on a lagoon that sustains local and regional fisheries on which local communities depend.",

The poorly known anchovy Stolephorus nelsoni Wongratana, 1987 (Engraulidae), previously known only from the type specimens from Australia, is redescribed and its validity confirmed, on the basis of the holotype, paratype, and 15 additional specimens from Indonesia and Australia. Similar to Stolephorus brachycephalus Wongratana, 1983 in sharing the maxilla reaching more or less to the posterior border of opercle, a predorsal-fin scute absent and the preopercle rounded, the specific distinctiveness of S. nelsoni and differences between the two species have remained unclear. This study sought to confirm the validities of the two species and the distributional range of S. nelsoni. Materials and methods. Seventeen and 9 specimens of S. nelsoni and S. brachycephalus, respectively, including the holotype of each, were examined morphologically, counts and proportional measurements following Hata and Motomura (2017). Results. Comparisons of S. nelsoni with S. brachycephalus revealed the former to have 12–14 (mode 13) branchiostegal rays [vs. 10–11 (11)], 15–17 branched anal fin rays [vs. 20–22 (20)] and relatively fewer gill rakers [37–43 (39, 40) on the first gill arch vs. 35–37 (35)]. Stolephorus nelsoni also differed from S. brachycephalus in body depth [21.7%–23.7% (mean 22.6%) of standard length vs. 18.2%–20.3% (19.1%)], anal-fin base length [16.1%–19.3% (17.6%) vs. 21.6%–24.4% (23.2%)], caudal-peduncle length [15.7%–21.7% (18.8%) vs. 12.6%–15.2% (14.1%)] and snout length [4.5%–5.5% (5.1%) vs. 3.6%–4.3% (4.0%)]. Conclusion. The validities of both species were confirmed, Indonesian examples of S. nelsoni being the first known records of the species outside Australian waters.",

    "abstract": "Background. Fishing operations for albacore, Thunnus alalunga (Bonnaterre, 1788), are mainly carried out by pelagic longline in the Mediterranean, whereas driftnets are the main fishing gear for albacore catch in Turkey. The albacore driftnet fishery has been carried out since 2004 and about 40 vessels participated in this venture between May and July especially in the Gulf of Antalya. The aim of this study was to determine the Catch Per Unit of Effort (CPUE) and bycatch from the Turkish albacore fleet during the 2010&#8211;2011 fishing seasons. Materials and methods. This study was carried out with 18 representative drift-netters based at the port of Alanya, Ka&#351;, Fethiye, and S&#305;&#287;ac&#305;k from May to July 2010 and from May to July 2011. On each fishing trip, data were collected on date, location, depth, fishing boat characteristics, fishing gear aspects, and the capture of both target and non-target species by weight (biomass) and number. Results. A total of 125 data sets were collected. The mean CPUEs for albacore by number and weight were 13 &#177; 1.6 specimens and 90 &#177; 11 kg per km of net, respectively. A total of 12 species, belonging to 9 families were caught during the sampling period. The target species&#8212;albacore&#8212;had the highest ratio both in number (76.6%) and weight (62.8%) followed by, Euthynnus alletteratus, Xiphias gladius, Thunnus thynnus, and Auxis rochei. Ratios of biomass and number ratios of the non-target species to the target albacore were 1 : 0.59 kg and 1 : 0.31 individuals, respectively. Conclusion. Traditional Turkish pelagic driftnet fishery, dating back to the early 1900s, was halted in July 2011 by the Turkish fisheries authority to comply with the international ban. The Turkish fisheries authority strongly supports the transition towards the usage of pelagic longlines as recommended by ICCAT and should supply technical support to the fishermen.",

    "abstract": "Background. Farmed fish reared in aquaculture systems are exposed to physiological stressors from biological, chemical, and physical sources. The consequences of these stressors affect the productivity of farming outcomes by reducing immune response, growth, and development within fish. A 24-h study was performed to determine the effects of supplementing puerarin&#8212;the most biologically active ingredient present in the roots of kudzu (Pueraria lobata)&#8212;within farmed fish on acute handling stress. Materials and methods. Fingerlings of Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, were maintained at 16&#8211;18&#186;C in 10 US gallon (37.8 L) glass tanks, supplied with recirculated and aerated dechlorinated water. Puerarin was given to fish through supplementation to commercial fish feed pellets. Acute handling stress was induced through transferring the fish from their housing tanks into 8 designated tanks at 0000 h. Subsequently, at 5 h post-transfer all the fish were fed to satiation, following which the stressed groups were chased with nets. Results. The results indicated that administration of puerarin through feed supplementation reduces plasma glucose, hematocrit, plasma protein, and improves spleen somatic indices after 24 h, and thereby counteracting the negative consequences of acute stress induced through handling. Conclusion. The results suggest that supplementation of puerarin to commercial fish feed improved overall fish health through enhancing systemic circulation while attenuating plasma glucose. Being one of the first studies to study the effects of puerarin on fish, our results are in agreement with prior research with puerarin on other animal models.",

    "abstract": "Background. Stocks of many marine fishes are in decline and a number of studies suggest that for some species the impact of recreational angling may be important. To date, only recreational (leisure) fishing surveys have been conducted in Portugal, with no studies on beach angling competitions, dynamically increasing in number over the past 10 to 20 years. In view of the above, we decided to evaluate the impact of such events on the Algarve coast (southern Portugal) in terms of the abundance, diversity, and respective weight of fish species caught and outline some conservation measures and recommendations for the management of the targeted species. Materials and methods. Participants of 22 angling competitions taking place between February and June 2007 were surveyed. In each competition a random sample of anglers was interviewed, and the specimens caught by each participant were identified, weighed, and measured. Results. Thirteen taxa belonging to eight families were identified, and the most common were: garfish, Belone belone (Linnaeus, 1761); mullets, Mugilidae (not identified); and mackerels, Scomber spp. A total of 563 specimens were sampled, totalling 75.4 kg of weight, with the average catch per angler weighing 0.5 ± 0.05 SE (n = 153) kg. Differences were also observed between the length at first maturity (L50) of the specimens caught and their respective Minimum Landing Size (MLS) and Allowed Minimum Size (AMS), most particularly in the case of the European seabass, Dicentrarchus labrax (L.), with almost all individuals caught measuring below the species-specific L50. Analysis of time series of competition results (1996–2009) showed no evidence of a decrease in catches or in mean weight. Conclusion. Based on the results we propose that the AMS for beach angling competitions should be increased to the MLS in order to prevent the capture of juvenile fishes, especially the sea bass. Future studies should address the size selectivity of the hooks used in beach competitions, with a view to the implementation of a minimum hook size for competitions.",

    "abstract": "Background. Cannibalism occurs at various ages or sizes depending on fish species and the respective environments. Barramundi, Lates calcarifer(Bloch, 1790),is a popular and valuable species in aquaculture on the Asian and Australian continents. In its culture, cannibalism can cause severe losses during the early stages of development particularly before fish reach a length of about 10 cm. Hence the present study aimed to study the effect of the two photoperiods, constant darkness and continuous light on the rate of sibling cannibalism in barramundi juveniles reared indoors under intensive conditions. Materials and methods. The indoor experimental setup consisted of two separate systems labelled system 1 and 2. Each system consisted of three rectangular rearing tanks each of 60L capacity connected to a mechanical and a biological water-cleaning unit. System 1 was kept under 24 h of light provided by two 36 watt fluorescent tubes. System 2 was kept under 24 h of darkness except for a short period of 6 min during each feeding time. Each rearing tank was randomly stocked with 187 juveniles. A commercial fish feed was provided to the fish by handad libitum four times during the day time. The experiment was conducted for 112 days. Results. In both light and dark systems, larger specimens were much more active during feeding, chasing smaller siblings away from the provided feed, leaving them only the remains to feed on. The accumulated observed mortality was similar under both dark and light conditions. In the present study although feed was provided ad libitum, cannibalism still occurred under both light and dark conditions. However, the rate of cannibalism was significantly (P < 0.05) lower under dark conditions. The results show that a potential predator can swallow a prey up to a maximum of 67% of its own body length. Similar growth performances were observed in the fish groups reared under darkand lightconditions. Conclusion. The application of constant darkness is therefore a useful strategy in significantly reducing cannibalism when rearing barramundi. Furthermore, such a strategy also leads to the formation of a more uniform population of fish which is a desire of the grower.",

    "abstract": "Background. Because estuarine fish communities undergo temporal changes in abundance and species composition, the influence of environmental factors on diel and seasonal variation in the structure of a fish community was evaluated. This information is necessary to extend our knowledge of fish communities in tropical estuaries. The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that the total number of fish, species richness and fish composition would undergo temporal variations related to the variability of environmental conditions. Materials and methods. In Pueblo Viejo Lagoon (western Gulf of Mexico), six 24-h sampling cycles every 2 months were carried out. Fish were collected every 2 h during each 24-h cycle using a beach seine net. Data were analysed using repeated measures PERMANOVA and canonical correspondence analysis. Results. Diel variation in total fish number and species richness tended to peak at dawn and dusk, with significant differences between the periods of day, night and twilight. Total number of fish had significant pulses during the dry season and rainy season, whereas species richness showed a pulse in March&ndash;July. Fish community structure was mainly influenced by salinity, temperature, rainfall, and seagrass cover. Seasonally, three fish groups were observed. The fish assemblage during the rainy season was mainly characterized by low-salinity tolerant species. The fish assemblage during the cold-dry period was dominated by species with low-temperature affinities whereas filter-feeding species tended to be dominant during the warm-dry period. Differences in fish assemblages among diel periods were mainly due to some species were typically diurnal, nocturnal or crepuscular. Conclusion. This study allowed determining that total fish abundance and richness are related at diel level with the transition period between the activities of diurnal and nocturnal species, and with fish strategies of predator avoidance and foraging. At seasonal level, these seem to be coupled to periods of high productivity in the system. Moreover, the fish composition showed a seasonal succession of species, which may be determined by a combination of temporal changes in salinity, rainfall, temperature, and by the different feeding strategies of species.",

    "abstract": "Background. White sturgeon iridovirus (WSIV) is one of the most serious threats for sturgeon aquaculture as the mortality in juvenile individuals can reach 95%. At the turn of the century WSIV was reported among hatchery-raised white sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836, in North America, Russian sturgeon , Acipenser gueldenstaedtii Brandt et Ratzeburg, 1833, in northern Europe but also pallid sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus albus (Forbes et Richardson, 1905) and shovelnose sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus platorynchus (Rafinesque, 1820) in North and South Dakota. The clinical signs of infection include cessation of feeding and edematous and pale gills. Those pathological changes lead to respiratory problems of the juveniles and deterioration of their overall condition. Rapid detection of pathogen particles under aquaculture conditions is crucial, therefore the principal aim of this study was to establish a molecular method for rapid and effective detection of the WSIV. This is the first study thoroughly comparing WSIV detection methods in sturgeons cultured in Poland, Germany, and Italy. Materials and methods. A total of 244 samples were collected from 82 sturgeons representing six species: beluga, Huso huso (Linnaeus, 1758); sterlet, Acipenser ruthenus Linnaeus, 1758; Siberian sturgeon, Acipenser baerii Brandt, 1869; Russian sturgeon, A. gueldenstaedtii; Atlantic sturgeon, Acipenser oxyrinchus Mitchill, 1815; and European sea sturgeon, Acipenser sturio Linnaeus, 1758, as well as five sturgeon hybrids: Siberian × Russian, Adriatic (Acipenser naccarii Bonaparte, 1836) × Siberian, Adriatic × beluga, Siberian × sterlet, and beluga × sterlet. The samples were screened for the WSIV using conventional PCR, real-time PCR, and in situ hybridization (ISH) methods. Results. In total, positive results were obtained in 231 (94.67%) out of 244 analysed samples, except for H. huso where DNA of WSIV was not identified. DNA of WSIV was most frequently detected in the kidney (97.92%), intestine (97.50%), skin (94.97%), and gills (93.29%). The most effective method for detecting DNA of WSIV in sturgeons was real-time PCR (92.62% of), PCR (90.98%), and ISH (49.24%). Conclusion. The host range of the WSIV seems to be wider than expected, however, further studies are necessary since no clinical symptoms were observed in sturgeons and their hybrids.",

    "abstract": "Background. In Tunisian waters, there are only two mullet species, the red mullet, Mullus barbatus Linnaeus, 1758, and the striped red mullet, Mullus surmuletus Linnaeus, 1758. They are distributed along the coasts of eastern Atlantic from the North Sea to the northern part of West Africa. Therefore, M. barbatus and M .surmuletus are a valuable component of the commercial fishery in Tunisia. The goal of this study was to investigate the stock structure discrimination and otolith asymmetry for specimens of the mentioned above two species of the family Mullidae from waters of northern Tunisia. Materials and methods. We collected a total of 120 specimens of M. barbatus and M. surmuletus from Lac de Bizerte. The sampling was conducted within three months (March–April–May). The Elliptical Fourier Analysis (EFA) was performed to evaluate the degree of similarity in the otoliths and to determine the asymmetry percentage. Results. The Discriminant Factor Analysis shows significant results that are clearly demonstrated by an asymmetry when comparing otoliths (P < 0.05) within each population and a difference in shape when comparing the same side between the two species: between the two sides (right–right and left–left). Conclusion. The comparison of the otolith morphology of the two species showed a significant difference in shape and a left–right asymmetry of otoliths between and within populations. This result is probably related to genetic and local environmental factors. In fact, this investigation improves the knowledge of the stock discrimination for M. barbatus and M. surmuletus and provides useful information for analyzing fisheries management of these species in Tunisia.",

    "abstract": "Background. Ornamental freshwater fish releases constitute a remarkable proportion of the 100 worst invasive species worldwide. Early detection and knowledge of likely introduction vectors and pathways of potentially invasive fishes into sensitive habitats are key for their proper management, hence rapid and correct identification of their occurrence is crucial. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that a newly-discovered catfish population was that of Clarias batrachus (Linnaeus, 1758), and that this introduction might be of single origin released by aquarium pet fish owners. Materials and methods. In total, 45 specimens of C. batrachus were captured during two electrofishing surveys on 9 and 15 March 2016 by three operators for morphometric and molecular examination. Additionally, 28 specimens were collected for assessing gonadal maturity and sex. They were also measured for standard length and total length and weighed before being dissected. Results. Morphological and molecular analyses indicated that the examined specimens belong to C. batrachus, and that they were likely introduced by aquarium hobbyists. Successful reproduction and establishment of the species are demonstrated by the occurrence of ripe females and their young of the year and juvenile individuals in the catch. Conclusion. Our findings confirmed the presence of C. batrachus in a region with extraordinarily high biodiversity, including the first evidence to indicate the successful establishment of this species in Turkey. An initial first policy and management step would be to ban the importation and keeping of this species in Turkey, thus reducing the risk of further releases. Increased public awareness for the detrimental impacts of non-native fishes would serve to support the policy and field-based management practices to control, and hopefully eradicate this highly invasive species.",

    "abstract": "Background. The paddlefish, Polyodon spathula (Walbaum, 1792), is an important species for commercial and recreational fisheries throughout the central United States. Populations have declined in many areas due to river modification, loss of spawning habitat, pollution, and over-exploitation. Assessing genetic diversity of a species is an important consideration for developing conservation plans. The goal of this research was to perform a broad range survey of paddlefish diversity by evaluating populations from geographically distant major rivers of the United States of America. Materials and methods. Paddlefish samples were collected from four sites including the Alabama River, Red River, Yellowstone/Missouri River, and Ohio River. Eight microsatellite loci (PspD102, PspD111, PspB105, PspD9, PspD8, PspC6, PspH26, and PspC10) that displayed disomic inheritance patterns were used for the amplification of alleles. Results. Average allelic richness of four sites ranged from 7.50 &#177; 1.36 to 5.46 &#177; 0.91. Average expected heterozygosity ranged from 0.717 &#177; 0.085 to 0.591 &#177; 0.093, the average observed heterozygosity assumed the values from 0.711 &#177; 0.115 to 0.585 &#177; 0.087. A moderate level of between population diversity was observed with an overall Fst value of 0.0702. Hardy&#8211;Weinberg equilibrium revealed that seven loci in the four populations were in equilibrium. The four populations were clustered to two categories by cluster analysis (UPGMA) based on Fst and &#948;&#956;2 distance. Conclusion. Four studied paddlefish populations exhibited relatively low levels of genetic diversity and close relative relations, but still had some differentiation among the populations. The genetic distance and Fst revealed that the Ohio River, Red River and Yellowstone/Missouri River populations belong to the same branch, while the Alabama River population from another branch.",

Knowledge of the biology of this species is very scarce. Despite the importance of this species, no research on the population dynamics such as age and growth rates has been conducted. The aim of this study was to determine the age, growth rate, and the relations between the fish size and the otolith size for C. erhani from the Menzelet Reservoir, Turkey. Materials and methods. This study was carried out seasonally in the Menzelet Reservoir, between January and December 2012. Samples were collected using gill nets with mesh sizes ranging from 18 to 30 mm. Results. A total of 134 otoliths obtained from Capoeta erhani that ranged from 15 to 33.8 cm TL were used in the analyses. The overall male : female ratio (M : F = 1.25 : 1.00) was biased in favour of males. The Mann&#8211;Whitney test revealed significant differences between sexes, regarding TL (P &#60; 0.05). The calculated length&#8211;weight relations were TL = 0.0097W3.0015 (r2 = 0.986) for females, TL = 0.0054W3.2011 (r2 = 0.975) for males, and TL = 0.0075W3.0892 (r2 = 0.979) for all specimens combined.

    "abstract": "Background. Seahorses are considered vulnerable and endangered fish species in many parts of the world. We found a conspicuous and stable population of Hippocampus guttulatus Cuvier, 1829 in the Mar Piccolo of Taranto (Ionian Sea), known of its substantial pollution and fluctuations in environmental parameters. The aims of our study were to demonstrate the role of habitat protection in the conservation of this species, the adaptability of the long-snouted seahorse to the water pollution and variable physico-chemical parameters, as well as the habitat preferences of H. guttulatus under particular conditions of this coastal lagoon. Materials and methods. The areas of diving were randomly selected within both parts of the Mar Piccolo of Taranto. Observations were based on snorkelling and scuba diving at different depths from 0 through 4 m. For each dive, in each inlet, all types of environment were explored, divided in four categories based on the nature of the substrate. From the summer of 2011 to the summer of 2013, a total of 23 days of observations were carried, for a total period of 69 h. Results. A total number of 196 sightings of Hippocampus guttulatus were recorded. The data show a clear preference of the fish studied for the artificial hard substrates, piers and wharves in particular. Only 3 specimens were observed on algal meadows. The western part of the lagoon harbours the largest number of the specimens. Concerning both depth and the three years period, no significant differences were found in the abundance. Conclusion. This study highlights the ecological importance of the coastal lagoon of the Mar Piccolo of Taranto. We report quantitative data about this population of seahorses with considerations and discussions about the presence and distribution of the specimens, their preferred substrates, and the peculiar polluted environment that they inhabit. Future studies are necessary to better understand the role of habitat protection for seahorses and to improve protection measures for the management and conservation of the species.",

    "abstract": "Background. Intra cohort cannibalism is one of the main factors that affects the growth and survival of cultured fishes, especially in the larval and juvenile stages. Cannibalism is mainly influenced by extrinsic factors, but intrinsic effects cannot be excluded. As regards the family Percidae, all-female rearing can be advantageous for the fish growth, but does this solution have some impact on cannibalism? The main objective of this study was to investigate potential differences in cannibalism rate and its relation to further growth and survival between mixed-sex and all-female Eurasian perch, Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758, larvae reared in full-siblings and half-siblings groups. The additional purpose of this study was to determine whether there was some maternal influence on the cannibalismâ€“survivalâ€“growth dynamics in cultured Eurasian perch larvae. Materials and methods. Cannibalism, survival, and growth were studied in mixed-sex and all-female progenies of Eurasian perch larvae. Ten-day old larvae (body weight of 20 mg) originating from the crosses of four parents (two females: f1 and f2; one male: ma; and one neomale: mc) were reared over 77 days at 22Â°C under the light regime of 16 : 8 (light : dark) in replicated groups consisting of mixed-sex full siblings (f1ma, f2ma), all-female full siblings (f1mc, f2mc), or mixed-sex half-siblings (f1ma + f2ma) and all-female groups (f1mc + f2mc). Results. At the end of the experiment, there was no sexual growth dimorphism and no sex-biased cannibalism. Neither the effect of sibling versus half-sibling groups, nor effects of normal progeny versus all-female population on survival and cannibalism rate were significant. By contrast, maternal effects on cannibalism were observed, chiefly as regards type I cannibalism (partial and tail-first ingestion), and they impacted on survival, as mortality from other causes (complete cannibalism or others) was independent from maternal origin. Conclusion. There is no particular disadvantage of rearing monosex female progenies in term of cannibalism and survival, whereas this culture-management solution is prone to produce long-term advantages for the perch growth, owing to the faster growth of female fish.",

The Morocco dentex, Dentex maroccanus Valenciennes, 1830, is a sparid species, which has economical value and its population is expanding in a 20–500 m depth range throughout the Mediterranean. Worldwide, there is a lack of information about the biology (age, growth, reproductive season, first maturity length) of this species. This study provides the first data on population parameters of D. maroccanus in the Aegean Sea. Materials and methods. Dentex maroccanus were caught in the Saros Bay (north Aegean Sea) between September 2006 and September 2008. The length–weight relations were determined according to the allometric equation: W = aLb. The spawning season was determined by analyzing the maturity stages and gonadosomatic index, while first maturity length was defined as the size at which 50% of individuals were mature. Growth parameters were estimated using the von Bertalanffy growth equation. Results. The female–male ratio was 4.8 : 1. The total length (weight) of females ranged from 11.4 cm to 25.2 cm (26.2 g to 289.3 g) and of males from 12.8 cm to 24.3 cm (19.8 g to 223.9 g). The growth parameters were calculated as L∞ = 25.31 cm, K = 0.49 year–1, t0 = –0.30 year. The length at first maturity for females and males was 13.0 cm and 15.8 cm, respectively. Monthly values of the gonadosomatic index indicated that spawning occurred mainly between June and September. Conclusion. Results reported in this work will contribute to the knowledge on the biology of D. maroccanus in the north Aegean Sea and also to a better understanding of its role in the marine ecosystem.",

The turbot, Scophthalmus maximus (Linnaeus, 1758), is of high economical value in Turkey and its biological characteristics have hitherto not been studied in the South-western Black Sea. The purpose of this study was to determine the age and growth, length–weight relation, condition factor, sex ratio, age and length at first maturity, and reproduction period of the turbot in the south-western Black Sea coast of Turkey. Materials and methods. Turbots were collected monthly in the south-western Black Sea coast of Turkey using bottom trawl and turbot gillnets. The fish samples were obtained between October 2004 and September 2005. Results. A total of 264 turbots were sampled and the age groups ranged from I to X (no individuals found at age group IX). Total lengths were between 14.0 and 70.0 cm, while weights varied from 34 to 5550 g. The length–weight relation for combined sexes was determined as W = 0.0085L3.1581. The von Bertalanffy growth equation parameters were: L¥ = 73.55 cm, k = 0.17 year–1, t0 = –0.12 year. The observed sex ratio (female : male) was 1 : 0.35. The length at first maturity (L50) of the species was 20.38 cm for females and 24.68 cm for males (both at two years old). Monthly gonadosomatic index (GSI) values suggest the spawning activity extends from 15 April to late June. Conclusion. The legal fishing season of the turbot, imposed in 2012, begins on 15 June. We recommend that this date should be postponed to 30 of June due to turbot's reproduction extending to late June.",

    "abstract": "Unisexual forms of lower vertebrates (fish, amphibians, and reptiles) reproduced by parthenogenesis, gynogenesis, or hybridogenesis are represented by diploids, triploids, or tetraploids, whose origin is associated with interspecific hybridization. Among fish species, the highest variability of unisexual polyploids was found in the genus Cobitis . The structure of their genomes and putative parental species holds great interest for the investigation in association with questions about possible evolutionary success. In particular, it serves to elucidate the possible high colonization properties of a few polyploid forms, in contrast to the local history of rather numerous hybrid forms with a limited distribution. Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe the karyotype structure of two newly discovered triploid forms of the genus Cobitis , to analyze their origin and putative parental species. The karyotype structure of 182 spined loach individuals from the Western Dvina River and 91 individuals from the upper Dnieper River of the Smolensk District of Russia was studied. A total of 121 studied individuals from the Western Dvina comprised triploid females with a chromosome number 74 and karyotype consisting of 13 meta-, 39 submeta-, and 22 subtelo-acrocentric chromosomes. Among loaches collected in the upper Dnieper River, 42 triploid females were found with 74 chromosome number including 23 meta-, 26 submeta-, and 25 subtelo-acrocentric chromosomes. Other individuals from both localities were karyologically identified as Cobitis taenia Linnaeus, 1758 with 2 n = 48. The triploid form of spined loaches of the Western Dvina River most likely arose as a result of the hybridization of Cobitis tanaitica Bǎcescu et Mayer, 1969 and C. taenia . The range of C. tanaitica , whose karyotype is characterized by an evolutionarily fixed Y-autosomal translocation, is limited to the rivers of the northern coast of the Black Sea. Therefore, hybridization probably happened in late Pleistocene in the Dnieper River system, where both parental species occur. The triploid form that arose here is unique for the Baltic Sea basin. Probably, it colonized the Western Dvina through the artificial Berezinskaya water system (Berezina Canal = Daugava–Dnieper Canal), but at the same time it was forced out of its area of origin by other triploid forms which are now widespread there. According to the karyotype structure, the triploid form, common for both the upper and lower reaches of the Dnieper, has a trihybrid origin, with probable hybridization of Cobitis elongatoides Bǎcescu et Mayer, 1969, C. tanaitica , and yet unidentified species Cobitis sp. Both studied triploid forms are parts of unisexual-bisexual complexes, in which their putative diploid maternal species ( C. tanaitica and C. elongatoides ) are absent, and the role of the host species involved in reproduction belongs to C. taenia .",

    "abstract": "The Aegean Sea features an important archipelago in the Eastern Mediterranean, consisting of 60 inhabited islands, more than 1400 uninhabited islands, about 60–70 commercial marine taxa, along many vulnerable species. Fisheries are mainly coastal and are exploited by Greek and Turkish fishers. The multi-species and multi-gear fisheries operate within each country’s 6-nautical mile territorial sea and in the international waters of the Aegean Sea. As the fisheries resources are currently declining in this region, it is clear that current management initiatives are ineffective and would benefit from a new regime aiming to improve the state of the commercial marine resources. This study offers a comparative analysis of certain fishing gear technical measures applied by Greece and Turkey in the Aegean Sea. Identified differences can provide clear and helpful insights for decision-makers for the development of a new and productive management approach in Aegean waters. The fishery regulations were shown to be highly variable, sharing few similarities and stressing many more differences, thus rendering the current management of the shared fish stocks unsustainable. The resources of both states would greatly benefit from the harmonization of management measures focusing on an ecosystem approach to fisheries, and incorporating fishers as stakeholders.",

Here, two new data-limited methods are presented to estimate somatic growth from maximum length combined with either length or age at maturation or with maximum age. A comparison with existing growth parameters of fishes (Actinopterygii and Elasmobranchii) shows that the estimates of the new methods fall within the range of established methods.

The presently reported study aims to further update records of S. aculeata and S. oculata in the basin in order to achieve a clearer picture of their current status and geographical distribution. In this way, we were able to add a contribution to our knowledge about their biological characteristics. Records on the incidental capture and observation of specimens of S. aculeata and S. oculata between 2005 and 2022 were collected through the input of alerted professional fishermen, fisher amateurs, and specialist observers on fishery landings or on board in the context of specific surveying programs as well as of citizens’ science initiatives. Biological characters such as total length, total weight, sex, and maturity were determined whenever possible. A total of 18 S. aculeata and 34 S. oculata specimens were recorded. Data corroborate the current occurrence, which is almost rare, of these two Critically Endangered elasmobranchs from the central to the east part of the basin, revealing furthermore the presence of S. aculeata in Sardinian waters, in the western part of the basin. Data document the important habitats for both species existing in the Strait of Sicily, especially in the area around Malta, and confirm the occurrence of S. aculeata in the southern Aegean Sea. The current presence of both species is also established in Mediterranean Egyptian waters. Our study suggests the urgent need for a wider application and/or reinforcement of existing protection measures for these angelshark species and their habitat, including populations of the southern Mediterranean waters.",

The activity of the enzyme, extracted from the muscle tissue, stored in a buffer solution at -10, -18, and -25°C declined in reverse proportion to the increase of the storage temperature. Salting of herring, until they reached from 9.8 to 18.5% of salt content in their muscle tissue caused a decline in the activity of lipoxygenase, which was in direct proportion to the concentration of salt. Lipoxygenase of roe was catalysed more extensively during the weak salting (9.8% NaCl) than it was during medium- (12.3% NaCl) or strong salting (18.3% NaCl).",

Mixed feeding schedules have been proposed as one of the methods to reduce both of them and successfully tested in many fish species. The aim of the present study was to determine the mixed feeding schedules′ suitability for culture of rainbow trout. Materials and methods. Five different feeding schedules were tried by alternating the presentation of a low-protein (28.1%) diet (A) and a high-protein (49.9%) diet (B). The feeding schedules employed were 1A/1B, 1A/2B, 1A/3B, 2A/2B, and 2A/3B where the numerical values refer to the number of days each diet (A and B) was offered continuously. Fish given diets A and B continuously served as controls. Totally, seven dietary treatments were tested in triplicate for 10 weeks. Results. The fish maintained on the different mixed feeding schedules exhibited lower weight gain than those fed continuously on the high-protein diet (P < 0.05). The fish reared on schedule 1A/3B (1 day diet A alternated with 3 days diet B) had similar specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversation ratio (FCR), and protein efficiency ratio (PER) to those fed diet B continuously and was best among all mixed feeding schedules. However, the most cost-effective treatment was 2A/2B. In addition, this group compared to B resulted in significant increase and reduction of phosphorus retention and discharge, respectively (P < 0.05). The treatments significantly effected body moisture, fat- and ash levels (P < 0.05), but not protein. Conclusion. The study shows that mixed feeding schedules are promising for use in rainbow trout culture as they result in feed cost saving and reduced phosphorus discharge in the effluents.",

It is well known that salt water of intermediate salinity (25&permil;) is suitable for mollies, especially for healthy breeding. Nutrition has been recognized to have a profound effect upon gonadal development and fry production in fish. Hence, the present work was carried out to evaluate the suitability of different practical diets, such as oyster meat, live tubificid worms, and formulated feed, on fry production, gestation period, and growth performance of P. latipinna in salt water. Materials and methods. Materials and Methods. A trial was conducted on P. latipinna in salt water (25&permil; salinity) to evaluate the suitability of oyster meat, live tubificid worms, formulated feed, and a mixture of these three diets, on breeding and growth. Results. Irrespective of diet, the gestation period was consistently 28 days. Maximum fry yield (460 fry) and better growth performance was obtained in brooders and juveniles respectively fed mixed diet. A positive correlation existed between the loss of weight due to spawning in the brooders and fry production in all dietary treatments. Among the dietary treatments there was a significant difference (P < 0.005) in growth performance parameters, such as weight gain [g], food conversion ratio (FCR), and specific growth rate (SGR). Conclusion. Among the four dietary treatments, the mixed diet performed well in both breeding and rearing experiments. Hence in commercial breeding units, mixed feeding regimen could be adopted with mollies in salt water.",

    "abstract": "Background. Copper is a heavy metal, and an aquatic pollutant, known for its bio-accumulative and non-biodegradable properties. In the aquatic ecosystems, acute and sublethal concentrations of copper may be linked to a variety of effects. Recently, hormones, particularly those regulating vital functions, such as osmoregulation, energy metabolism, and reproduction, may be used as potential biomarkers for sublethal toxicity studies. In the present study, the potential effect of a heavy metal&mdash;copper on hormonal changes (cortisol and prolactin) in an economically important fresh-water fish&mdash;common carp, Cyprinus carpio, was examined. Materials and methods. The experimental fish were subjected to two experimental regimes (backed by controls). In the first treatment they were exposed to the acute concentration of copper sulphate, amounting to 0.7 ppm. The second treatment featured copper sulphate concentration of 0.07 ppm, constituting 10% of LC50 (24 h). The acute-toxicity trials were carried out in two, 20-L, circular plastic tubs. Twenty fish from the tank were selected randomly and introduced to each tub. Control was maintained in 2 similar plastic tubs with 20 fish per tub. After 24 h, fish from control- and copper-exposure tubs were taken for analyses. To observe the sublethal toxicity four, 125-L, glass aquaria, filled with clean water were used. 200 fish were randomly selected from the stock and 100 of them were added to two aquaria, 50 fish in each, as experimental fish and 100 in two other aquaria, 50 in each, for as control fish. By the end of the stipulated period, 20 fish from control and 20 fish from experimental group were used for the hormone assay. Results. In both acute- and sublethal treatments, both cortisol- and prolactin levels increased. In sublethal treatment, however, plasma prolactin level decreased after 28-day exposure, showing a minimum percentage point decrease of 3.84 by the end of 35-day trial. Conclusion. The increase of the plasma cortisol was probably caused by release of cortisol from the interrenal tissue, as a mechanism of coping with stress. Significantly lower content of prolactin levels in sublethal treatment could be an indicative of a possible restored hydromineral balance or atrophy of the pituitary prolactin cells leading to inhibited prolactin secretion of the fish. These alterations of the above hormonal changes may be used as stress biomarkers in fish.",

In this study we attempted to assess the process of anaesthesia, caused by 2-phenoxyethanol and Propiscin (0.2% etomidate), based on recording the heartbeat and the respiratory frequency. Materials and methods. The effect of two concentrations of 2-phenoxyethanol (0.4 mL&middot;L&ndash;1 and 0.8 mL&middot;L&ndash;1) and two concentrations of Propiscin (1.0 mL&middot;L&ndash;1 and 2.0 mL&middot;L&ndash;1) on heartbeat and respiratory frequency of common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., were studied using ECG. Concurrently, during general anaesthesia, the fish behaviour was also observed. Results. The anaesthetic potential of 2-phenoxyethanol and Propiscin at the applied concentrations was comparable. The behavioural reactions caused by the agents were not identical. At the beginning of the exposure, 2-phenoxyethanol produced locomotor agitation and an irritation-like reaction of the respiratory system. Propiscin had no such effect. Both agents induced a decrease in the ventilatory and cardiac frequencies. The reductions caused by Propiscin were simultaneous. The inhibitory effect of 2-phenoxyethanol at the concentration of 0.8 mL&middot;L&ndash;1 was much stronger on respiration than on heart rate. Conclusion. The ECG method can be an important and objective tool supplementing data acquired during visual observation of responses to anaesthesia. Its major advantage is the comparativeness of data.",

    "abstract": "Background. A local stock of pikeperch, Sander lucioperca (Linnaeus, 1758), is a valuable fishery resource in Pärnu Bay, northern Gulf of Riga. Due to the late maturity of pikeperch in the bay, the stock is vulnerable to overexploitation, whereas recruitment is highly dependent on climate factors. Because of its high market price, fishing pressure on the stock increased considerably in the 1990s, resulting in stock depression. To assist fishery management in Pärnu Bay we have simulated the effect of several scenarios (such as: fishing mortality, climate, and young-of-the-year food supply) on the pikeperch stock, catches, and revenues generated by the fishery. Materials and methods. A simulation system consisting of an age-structured population model, a recruitment component, and a forcing module of different climate, food supply to young-of-the-year, and fishing mortality scenarios was used to estimate the equilibrium stock size and catches under varying environmental conditions and exploitation strategies. Economic impacts of these scenarios were assessed based on the first selling price of pikeperch. Results. Under present climate and food supply for pikeperch young-of-the-year, the Pärnu Bay pikeperch stock is very sensitive to catches of immature fish. Warmer future climate conditions are likely to be beneficial for the stock, but also prey abundance for young-of-the-year influences potential stock sizes and catches. Compared to targeting its prey species, herring, which has a lower commercial value at current first selling prices, pikeperch acts as a \"biomeliorator\", roughly doubling fisheries revenue in the bay. Conclusion. Flexible adaptive management methods should be used to estimate the yearly allowable pikeperch catch, taking into account food supply to young-of-the-year and climate conditions influencing recruitment.",

    "abstract": "Background. The food and feeding habits of a fish are important for understanding not only the fish biology but also the role played by the species in the ecosystem. The Peruvian moonfish (known also as Pacific moonfish), Selene peruviana (Guichenot, 1866), is a relatively abundant species, with its biology poorly known along the Mexican Pacific zone. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the principal food items of the Peruvian moonfish by using stable isotopes and the stomach content analysis. Materials and methods. We analyzed stomachs of 204 moonfish collected by a shrimp fishing boat along the coast of Nayarit and south of Sinaloa, Mexico from September to March, within 2006â€“2007. We also took 11 muscle samples of moonfish and some organisms being potential prey items for stable isotope analysis. Examining the stomach contents we determined the most important prey species using the geometric index of importance. We also determined the feeding strategy of this predator using Amundsen plots and Levinâ€™s index and finally we calculated the trophic position. We also determined the principal preys using stable isotopes analysis along with mixing models, and based on those values we calculated the trophic position. Results. The stomachs of Selene peruviana contained chiefly engraulid fishes and crustaceans. The stable isotopes analysis (SIA) helped to identify partly digested material as representing crustaceans of the family Portunidae. The trophic position found by both methods was between 3.7 and 3.9 and we also determined that this fish tended to feed near the coast. Conclusion. Selene peruviana is an opportunistic predator that consumes preys that are abundant in the zone. The stable isotopes analysis proved to be an efficient tool supplementing the stomach content analysis and helping to identify also partly digested items.",

    "abstract": "Background. Water temperature is a major factor regulating fish metabolism. It can influence body chemical composition and the incidence of body deformities. The latter often develop in farmed fish and this issue is currently emerging as a serious problem for aquaculture. Determining the effects of water temperature on body chemical composition and fish body deformities is an important subject for research in fish biology and nutrition, and aquaculture. The presently reported study was conducted using juvenile tench, Tinca tinca (Linnaeus, 1758), an important aquaculture species in Europe. Two hypotheses were tested: 1) temperature can significantly influence body chemical composition and the incidence of body deformities in fish; 2) the effects of temperature on fish depend on their diet. Materials and methods. Fish, with an initial total length of 28.4 ± 2.7 mm and body weight of 0.24 ± 0.07 g, were reared at 20, 23, and 26°C and fed dry feed Aller Futura (Aller Aqua, Denmark) only, or a combination of this feed and natural food (frozen larvae of Chironomidae) in a 3 ÷ 2 ratio of dry matter, or the natural food alone. The duration of the experiment and the daily food rations were adjusted to the experimental temperatures based on a correction factor, q, of 1.000, 0.779, or 0.609, respectively. The experiment duration was 92, 72, or 56 days for the respective temperatures. Results. Body deformities occurred in all groups of fish fed solely or partially with the dry diet (21.5%–89.5%). The incidence of deformities was directly proportional to the temperature and the content of dry feed in the diet reaching the maximum in fish fed exclusively the dry diet at 26°C. Water temperature and fish diet influenced body chemical parameters (moisture, protein, lipid, ash, Ca, P, Mg, Ca ÷ P, Mg ÷ P), but water temperature did not have a significant effect on whole-body P content. Conclusion. Water temperature proved to significantly influence fish chemical body composition and the incidence of body deformities in fish fed dry diet. The major factor that caused fish P deficiency, and resulted in low body ash content and body deformities, was insufficient bioavailability of P in the dry diet. Water temperature appeared to only modify P deficiency symptoms in fish.",

    "abstract": "Background. Gillnets of mesh sizes (6.9 to 12.7 cm) are used in individual boats in Sri Lankan reservoirs targeting exotic cichlid species, Oreochromis mossambicus (Peters, 1852) and Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758), which dominate the fisheries. The mesh composition of gillnets varies from boat to boat and from season to season making catch samples in individual boats are under the influence of different selectivity patterns. As such, the conventional procedure of correcting length frequency samples using the overall mean selectivity pattern in the fishery is not precise in estimating growth parameters. The presently reported study aimed at assessing cichlid stocks in three tropical reservoirs accounting for gillnet selectivity of individual sampled boats. Materials and methods. Length frequency data obtained from each boat were corrected for the combined selectivity of the fleet of gillnets of different mesh sizes used in the boat during the sampling occasion. For predicting optimal fishing strategies using a yield-per-recruit approach, probabilities of capture determined from the array of fishing mortality in the length-structured virtual population analysis was incorporated. Results. Length frequency data corrected for overall gillnet selectivity in sampled boats gave reliable estimates of von Bertalanffy growth parameters. Based on these estimates, mortality parameters were determined and the overall gear selection pattern was deduced from the array of fishing mortality in the length-structured virtual population analysis. Optimal fishing strategies were determined incorporating overall probabilities of capture in the relative yield-per-recruit (Y′ × R–1) analysis. Conclusion. The overall gillnet selection pattern of a sampled boat offers a methodology for reliable estimation of growth parameters. Although both cichlid species are caught in gillnets simultaneously, Y′ × R–1 analyses predicted increase of exploitation rate for one species while its decrease for the other species perhaps due to influence of other factors such as fish behaviour and fishers' choice of specific areas for fishing. This analysis provides a methodology of a more precise length-based stock assessment in future research.",

    "abstract": "Background. The silver therapon, Leiopotherapon plumbeus (Kner, 1864), is an endemic and economically important freshwater food fish in the Philippines. The natural populations of this species have been declining during the past years, mainly due to intense fishing pressure, habitat degradation, and introduction of invasive alien species. At present, it is considered a target species for domestication and conservation efforts. Despite several attempts of artificial reproduction and larval rearing, little is known on larval and early juvenile development of silver therapon. The presently reported study was therefore intended to fill this gap in the knowledge by determining the growth and describing body proportions, pigmentation, and fin formation of this fish. Materials and methods. Newly hatched larvae were reared in mesocosm tanks at a mean temperature of 29.5°C. Larvae up to 30 days after hatching were sampled at irregular intervals and preserved in 5% buffered formalin. Early development stages for 245 preserved specimens were described in detail with reference to changes in morphology, growth and body proportions, pigmentation, and fin formation. Results. Five developmental stages of silver therapon were identified: yolk sac larva (1.88 mm TL), preflexion (2.51 mm TL), notochord flexion (4.50–8.27 mm TL), postflexion larva (6.90–12.21 mm TL), and early juvenile (≥13.40 mm TL). Growth was isometric for eye diameter and gape size whereas positive allometry was observed for body depth, head length, and preanal length. Some body proportions showed abrupt changes from preflexion to postflexion larvae before it stabilized during the early juvenile stage. Pigmentation in the form of stellate and punctate melanophores increased with developmental stage, with larvae becoming heavily pigmented from postflexion to early juvenile stage. These morphological changes, together with the full complement of fin rays and squamation observed in specimens larger than 13.4 mm TL, suggest the attainment of the juvenile stage of this species. Conclusion. These morphological changes may explain the food and feeding habits during the early life stages of silver therapon which is critical to their survival and recruitment in the wild and in a mesocosm hatchery environment.",

Five sympatric Luciobarbus species&mdash;Luciobarbus sclateri (G&uuml;nther, 1868), Luciobarbus comizo (Steindachner, 1864), Luciobarbus microcephalus (Alma&ccedil;a, 1967), Luciobarbus guiraonis (Steindachner, 1866), and Luciobarbus steindachneri (Alma&ccedil;a, 1967)&mdash;are commonly identified in field surveys by diagnostic morphological characters. Assuming that i) in loco identification is subjective and observer-dependent, ii) there is previous evidence of interspecific hybridization, and iii) the technical reports usually do not include molecular analyses, our main goal was to assess the concordance between in loco species identification based on phenotypic characters with identifications based on morphometric indices, mtDNA only, and a combination of mito-nuclear markers. Materials and methods. Specimens of Luciobarbus from six Guadiana River sub-basins were collected and sequenced for the cytochrome b and beta-actin genes. For comparative purposes, samples of Luciobarbus from other 12 river basins were also used. Four levels of taxonomical identification were conducted based on: identification made in the field (in loco identification), cytb gene only, beta-actin gene only, and mito-nuclear combined genomes. Results. Results showed that interspecific hybridization seems to be high (around 41%) and likely favoured by non-random mating and the loss of fluvial connectivity. About 34% of the hybrids showed mito-nuclear discordance. Misidentifications were frequent when only phenotypic characters are considered, and the use of a single mitochondrial gene is not sufficient: the use of two mito-nuclear markers showed that around 82% of the in loco identifications based on the phenotype were not correct. Conclusion. Incorrect species assignment likely generated biased results in previous studies on the biology and ecology of Guadiana barbels and in the assignment of conservation status and, consequently, on the establishment of conservation management measures.",

The knowledge of the age, growth, and feeding ecology of fish species is essential for conservation, monitoring, and management activities required for the sustainable use of fish stocks. The objective of this work was to describe the growth and feeding of Pagellus acarne from the Gulf of İzmir, central Aegean Sea. The information provided in this study contributes to the knowledge which is for sustainable management applications. Materials and methods. The study was carried out to investigate the growth and feeding characteristics of axillary seabream, Pagellus acarne (Risso, 1827), in the Gulf of İzmir, the central Aegean Sea, from commercial trawl fishery between October 2012 and September 2013. Age and growth were determined by annuli counts of sagittal otoliths. Length–weight relation and the von Bertalanffy equation were used to evaluate the fish growth. Percentages by number, weight, and frequency of each food category were determined, and the index of relative importance (%IRI) was calculated to define the main food categories. A similarity of diet was also examined according to a season and fish size. Results. A total of 2036 specimens were analysed. The lengths ranged from 7.5 to 22.0 cm and the weights ranged from 4.55 to 138.45 g. For the age determination, a total of 547 left sagittal otoliths were extracted. The age ranged from 0 to 4 years. Von Bertalanffy growth parameters were determined from mean lengths of age groups and the following parameters were obtained: L∞= 27.75 cm, 22.45 cm, and 25.61 cm; k = 0.201 year–1, 0.341 year–1, and 0.249 year–1; t0 = –2.347 years, –1.554 years, and –1.938 years; φ′ = 2.190, 2.235, and 2.213 for females, males, and both sexes combined, respectively. Stomach content analyses revealed that Pagellus acarne was defined as a carnivorous, euryphagous, and zooplanktivorous species, and Copepoda (Harpacticoida), Polychaeta, and Decapoda were the most important prey groups. Conclusion. This study provides the age, growth, and the first detailed information on the feeding composition of axillary seabream from the central Aegean Sea.

To restore the fishery resources in Dongshan Bay and to increase fishing yield, much enhancement and release work has been carried out in Dongshan Bay. The yellowfin seabream, Acanthopagrus latus (Houttuyn, 1782), is an important enhancement species in Dongshan Bay that is also frequently captured. Due to yearly progress in enhancement and release, it is necessary to study the current status of the genetic diversity of yellowfin seabream in Dongshan Bay. The results show that all yellowfin seabream populations have high genetic diversity, which is mainly related to its breeding habits and growth rate, and this ensures a large recruitment stock in the natural seas. The current population has differentiated from the historical population due to a change in genetic structure, and many historical haplotypes have been lost. The results of this study provide a reference for fishery management departments to formulate management measures and conservation policies specifically for yellowfin seabream. In particular, yellowfin seabream is a hermaphroditic and protandrous species. Targeting an older age group as the main fishing subject is not conducive to its breeding protection and resource growth, and therefore, fishing of an older age group should be restricted in fishery production.",

    "abstract": "Background. The landings of sardine, Sardina pilchardus (Walbaum, 1792), captured by purse seiners in the central region of the Algerian coast, Mediterranean Sea have been decreasing over the last decade. The catch was 22&#160;580.28 t in 2001 but fell to 5600 t in 2011. To better understand the above decline, we found it useful to evaluate the impact of the change of the natural mortality (M) on the estimation of the exploitable stock of this species. Material and methods. To study the exploitation of sardine, a total of 4476 individuals of both sexes were sampled monthly in 2010. All sardines were taken from the landings of purse seiners operating in the central region of the Algerian coast between Tenes and Bejaia. The study of biological parameters and mortality were undertaken by the software recommended by FAO (FISAT II 1.2., FISHPARM 3.0 T, and the New VONBIT for Excel). Finally, VIT Software 1.2 was used for the evaluation of virtual population analysis (VPA), yield and biomass per recruit. Results. The analysis of yield and biomass per recruit using two approaches for estimating the natural mortality, namely the method of Pauly and that of Djabali et al., shows that the state of the sardine stock in the central region of the Algerian coast changed totally from a state of not overfished and not overfishing to a state of overfished and overfishing. The choice between these two scenarios, for which is important to advise and guide the management of the fisheries focuses on the case of overfishing and overfished. This choice is motivated by the geographical origin of the biological material used for the equation of natural mortality. Conclusion. The reduction of the current fishing effort factor (FC &#160;= 1) to the factor of fishing mortality rate at which the marginal yield-per-recruit constitutes only 10% of the marginal yield-per-recruit on the unexploited stock (F0.1 = 0.23) would permit in the long term, a maximum sustainable production of sardines of the central region of the Algerian coast which will increase from 5600 to 5999.7 t, while ensuring the renewal of its stock in sea which will rise from 3987 to 12&#160;487.8 t. Finally, it would be interesting to extend this study for all major pelagic species captured along the Algerian coasts.",

    "abstract": "Background. There is need for more information on behavioural rhythms of fishes in relation to their habitat use in few or not previously monitored areas, such as coralligenous habitats. Some studies have compiled inventories of observable fish species in this habitat, but no studies have been performed on the temporal patterning of fish behaviour, especially at the scale of the day. The presently reported study aims at providing knowledge on fine-scale fluctuations of abundances and behaviour of two fish species in coralligenous habitats throughout the diurnal period. Materials and methods. Fish fauna was filmed hourly, for several days, from dusk to dawn, with autonomous, programmable, and rotating video systems. Diurnal variations in abundances per count, considering size classes and behaviour, were studied for two diurnal fish species&#8212; the Mediterranean rainbow wrasse, Coris&#160;julis (Linnaeus, 1758) (Labridae), and the common two-banded seabream, Diplodus&#160;vulgaris (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1817) (Sparidae) in two study areas of coralligenous habitats on the French Riviera. Results. Significant temporal variability at the scale of the hour was revealed for abundances of C. julis in one of the two study areas, with few individuals in crepuscular periods and highest abundances in the morning and in the afternoon. These differences were mainly due to significant diurnal variations in abundances of small and medium C. julis, which were low in crepuscular periods, whereas large-sized individuals were equally abundant during the day. On the other hand, no discernible diurnal rhythmicity of mean abundances of D. vulgaris was observed, regardless of the study area. Crepuscular periods were associated with sudden changes of abundances and behaviour for both species, with a greater percentage of mobile and solitary individuals, and few feeding individuals compared to the rest of the day. Feeding occurred mainly in the morning for C.&#160;julis. In contrast, no dial-time preference for feeding was revealed for D. vulgaris. Conclusion. The study provided preliminary insights into fine-scale diurnal variations of abundances of different life stages and of fish behaviour. Variability in abundances of life stages and of fish behaviours at different times of day should be taken into account for population assessments and spatial comparisons. Moreover, our study confirmed the use of video-imaging as an efficient non-destructive tool for the study of fish fauna in structurally complex, highly valuable habitats.",

    "abstract": "Background. The small red scorpionfish, Scorpaena notata Rafinesque, 1810, appears as a bycatch of Portuguese fisheries. Bycatch species are likely to suffer the same declines as commercial species with which they co-occur but information on those species for Portuguese waters does not exist. In order to increase the knowledge for the Portuguese continental-shelf waters several aspects of the species growth were investigated. Materials and methods. Age and growth of Scorpaena notata from Portuguese continental-shelf waters were studied using 379 otoliths. A subsample of 70 otoliths, covering all length classes, was read by three of the authors to establish a reading and interpretation pattern. The von Bertalanffy growth model was fitted to sex-specific age&#8211;length data. The likelihood ratio tests were used to evaluate the significance of differences on growth parameters between sexes and with the parameters estimated in different areas. Results. Females dominated in smaller length classes while males prevailed in larger ones, although overall sex ratio did not deviate from 1 : 1. Females ranged from 10.5 to 18.8 cm total length (TL) and from 1 to 6 years; males ranged from 11.4 to 20.7 cm TL and from 1 to 7 years. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters estimated for the Portuguese shelf waters showed significant differences between sexes and were: L&#8734; = 18.23 cm TL, k = 0.43yr&#8211;1, t0 = &#8211;0.99 yr for females and L&#8734; = 21.17 cm TL, k = 0.28yr&#8211;1 and t0 = &#8211;1.73 yr for males. The age range found in the Portuguese shelf waters was similar to that found in the Balearic Islands but about half of that found for the Adriatic Sea. Significant differences between growth parameters from the Portuguese coast and those from the Balearic Islands and Adriatic Sea were found. Conclusion. Estimates of L&#8734; in the presently reported study were the highest but rather consistent with the maximum length given for the species.",

    "abstract": "Background. The yellowfin snook, Centropomus robalito Jordan et Gilbert, 1881, is one of the most important species in southwestern Gulf of California fisheries. It is caught in estuarine systems by coastal fishermen and as bycatch on the continental platform, by the industrial shrimp fishery. Dietary analysis are important to understanding the trophic interactions and the position of species within a foodweb and to understand the dynamics of marine communities. In this study, we describe the diet of the yellowfin snook in the southwestern Gulf of California and quantify the effects of sex and size on the species&#8217; diet. Materials and methods. Stomachs of C. robalito were obtained from the shrimp fishery that operates off the southwestern Gulf of California. Percentages by number, weight, and frequency of each food category were determined, and the index of relative importance (%IRI) was calculated to define the main food categories. Diet breadth and diet similarity between sexes and among sizes were also calculated. Results. A total of 401 stomachs were inspected, of which practically all (n = 385; 96%) contained food. According to %IRI, the main prey consumed comprised the shrimp Trachypenaeus pacificus (73%), Xiphopenaeus riveti (10%), and Penaeus spp. (7%). Secondary items included: the stomatopod Squilla mantoidea (4%), Unidentified organic matter (UOM, 3%), and the fish Porichthys sp. (2%). Centropomus robalito is a specialist predator with a low diet Breadth value (Bi = 0.14). While there were no significant differences in diet between the sexes (Analysis of similarities [ANOSIM]; R = 0.014; P = 0.50), there were differences among sizes (ANOSIM, R = 0.361; P = 0.01). Conclusion. Centropomus robalito is a second-order predator that feeds mainly on shrimp, which are abundant throughout its distribution area. The feeding strategy of C. robalito fits the optimal foraging theory. This fish feeds on the most abundant species, obtaining a higher energetic benefit than it would obtain from less available prey, or from more mobile and larger prey that would imply expending more energy in the search, attack, and manipulation of these prey.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the ecological status of fish fauna of Razim Lake under the conditions of the water salinity changing from brackish, almost 70 years ago, into freshwater nowadays. The natural processes of siltation and organic deposits, characteristic of Danube Delta lake complexes, intensified in the last decades and included also Razim Lake. The presently reported study of Razim Lake and the adjacent area was undertaken in 2020 with intention to cover fish fauna collected with three different sampling methods (electrofishing, gillnetting, and seining). For each sampling method, Catch per Unit Effort (CPUE), relative abundance, and biomass were determined, as well as selected ecological parameters to determine ecological status of richness species in the area. Published data included 55 fish species, mainly marine and euryhaline, but in 2020 only 43 species were reported. Also, the species composition shifted from marine ones to freshwater or euryhaline ones. Of those 43 species captured in 2020 from Razim Lake and neighboring areas, 39 were native and four were non-native, including a newcomer, the Chinese sleeper, Perccottus glenii Dybowski, 1877. Few species were migratory, reophilous, or reophilous-stagnophilous which rarely enter Razim Lake, but the majority were limnophilous or stagnophilous-reophilous species. Four species were dominant in terms of the abundance; Blicca bjoerkna (Linnaeus, 1758); Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758); Alburnus alburnus (Linnaeus, 1758); and Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782). In terms of the biomass the dominants were: Cyprinus carpio Linnaeus, 1758; Carassius gibelio ; Sander lucioperca (Linnaeus, 1758); Pelecus cultratus (Linnaeus, 1758); and Blicca bjoerkna . Some differences between sampling methods used were observed. Eudominant, euconstant, and main species were Blicca bjoerkna and the majority of fish species were accessories, with differences amongst sampling methods used. Fish diversity parameters indicate a stable ichthyocoenosis, more stable along the lake shoreline. Ecological indicators of fish fauna from Razim Lake in 2020 grade the water lake quality as a moderate ecological class according to the Water Framework Directive of the European Union.",

The aim of this study was to determine the composition of the parasite fauna of young Baltic cod, the relevant infection parameters and to relate those data to published records on the diet of cod. Materials and methods. This survey was carried out on 154 young cod, caught in May and June 2002 in the Gulf of Puck, the Baltic Sea, Poland. The fish were examined using standard methods applied in parasitology. Results. No external parasites were found. In the digestive tracts of 58 cod, 3 species of parasites belonging to 2 higher taxa (Nematoda and Acanthocephala) were found. The dominant parasite was Echinorhynchus gadi Zoega in Müller, 1776. The mean abundance ranged from 0.15 to 2.75. The prevalence ranged from 14.6%, in the smallest fish, to 66.7% in the larger ones. Only two acanthocephalan specimens of Pomphorhynchus laevis (Zoega in Müller, 1776) and five nematode larvae of Hysterothylacium aduncum (Rudolphi, 1802) were found. Conclusion. The parasite fauna of young Baltic cod is significantly sparser than in larger fish examined by other authors. It is suggested that the occurrence of the species found, can be related to the composition of diet available.",

    "abstract": "Background. Periophthalmus chrysospilos and Favonigobius reichei are most abundant gobies species (Family: Gobiidae) inhabiting estuaries in the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Thirty-six goby species are amphibious: the rest remain in water, like other teleosts. However, information on the fine structure of gills and skins of these gobies species that may help to understand their functions in air breathing is still lacking. This study was aimed at describing fine structure of the gills and skins of these two co-existing species of gobies living in the terrestrial and aquatic environment. Materials and methods. Fifty-six specimens of amphibious (Periophthalmus chrysospilos) and 67 specimens of nonamphibious gobies (Favonigobius reichei) were collected from estuary. Gills and skins were dissected out and samples were treated following the standard electron microscopy sample preparation. Samples were affixed onto specimen stubs with silver paint and then coated with a thin layer of gold using a BIO-RAD-SC500 ion sputter. All samples were viewed using SEM Series XL 30, Philips. Results. P. chrysospilos possesses short, thick, bent and twisted gill filaments whereas the F. reichei has long, thin, and straight filaments. There were differences in shapes and numbers of the secondary lamellae attached to the filaments in P. chrysospilos and F. reichei. The skin of F. reichei also has a significant difference in architectural build-up compared to P. chrysospilos. The functional adaptation on the use of gills and skins in P. chrysospilos and F. reichei in natural environment are discussed. Conclusion. The gills of P. chrysospilos show some unique features (i.e. low density of secondary lamellae and smaller gill rakers) that can be used to explain the animal′s ability to successfully live out of water in comparison to F. reichei that are more adapted to aquatic life like other teleosts. Special architectural plan of gills and skins of both goby species may have contributed to their existence in the estuary area.",

    "abstract": "Background.Achtheres percarum is an important copepod parasite (Crustacea: Copepoda) of European perch.Adult females permanently attach to the gill arches, roof of the mouth, tongue, and gill filaments.Attachment, at the latter site, may result in necrosis and epithelial hypertrophy, both compromising fish respiration during oxygen deficiencies.Adult males can move freely on gills of perch.To date there has been no published record of the complete set of developmental stages of this fish parasite.Provision of such may have practical implications for freshwater ichthyopathology, for example helping to monitor the dynamics of the parasite's populations.It may also provide useful information regarding copepod phylogenetics.Materials and Methods.Early developmental stages (nauplius and copepodid) of A. percarum were acquired through incubation of eggs within egg sacs of females collected from European perch, Perca fluviatilis L., caught commercially in 1994 in Lake Dąbie, Szczecin, Poland.All subsequent larval stages were collected from gills of perch caught in the same lake, in 1990.All copepods were fixed and preserved in 75% ethanol.A modified \"wooden slide\" method was used to observe the collected developmental stages in a suspended drop of lactic acid, using a compound microscope.Specimens were stained in lignin pink and morphologic details of were drawn using a drawing tube.Results.The life cycle of A. percarum consists of 7 developmental stages, separated by moults (nauplius, copepodid, chalimus I, chalimus II, chalimus III, chalimus IV, and adult).The nauplius hatches from the egg and quickly moults into the copepodid.Both stages are free swimming and the copepodid is the infective stage, attaching to the host's gill filaments, through the frontal filament.The subsequent chalimus stages (I through IV) \"inherit\" the copepodid's frontal filament, modifying its proximal end, such that the structure of the proximal end of the frontal filament explicitly identifies the stage of a chalimus.Two adult males were found attaching, by means of claws of its maxillipeds, to the frontal filament, left over by previous stages. Conclusion.The number of developmental stages of A. percarum determined within the presently reported study is consistent with that hitherto found in the life cycles of other lernaeopodids.",

    "abstract": "Background. The deep-water longline fishery of the blackspot seabream, Pagellus bogaraveo, is an economically important fishery in the Strait of Gibraltar, which is a very complex transition ecosystem between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean with an extreme spatial and temporal variability. This paper presents a series of morphometric relations for the four most important species in this fishery. Some ecological considerations about the results are also discussed. Materials and methods. The data were collected during a gear selectivity study, using different sizes of hooks baited with sardine. Relations for weight–length, length–length, and mouth dimensions for blackspot seabream, Pagellus bogaraveo (Brünnich, 1768); Atlantic pomfret, Brama brama (Bonnaterre, 1788); blackbelly rosefish, Helicolenus dactylopterus (Delaroche, 1809); and Mediterranean horse mackerel, Trachurus mediterraneus (Steindachner, 1868) were estimated and compared with the ones reported for the same species from other areas. Results. The sample size varied from 89 for T. mediterraneus to 2180 for P. bogaraveo. The fitted L–W relations explained more than 81% of the variance. For P. bogaraveo and T. mediterraneus, the estimated allometric coefficient was higher than those reported for other areas, showing a faster increase in weight, in contrast to H. dactylopterus and B. brama that showed a slower increase in weight. Moreover, linear and highly significant relations between mouth size and fish length were found for P. bogaraveo, H. dactylopterus, and T. mediterraneus. Conclusion. In this study, the first record for total length–standard length relation for H. dactylopterus is reported based on real measurements. There has been no previous studies on the relation between the different mouth size dimensions for the studied species as well as for mouth size and body length relations for P. bogaraveo and H. dactylopterus. The difference between estimated and reported coefficients might be attributed to different environmental adaptations and to the size ranges used due to the gear-size selectivity.",

    "abstract": "Background. Understanding of reproduction of the Egyptian sole, Solea aegyptiaca, has been considered a major step toward understanding its population dynamics, especially in the eastern Mediterranean Sea. In Egypt this species has highly commercial value and it has recently been successfully bred in aquaculture, but more data on the reproductive biology is still needed. So, the present work aimed to study the population structure and the reproductive dynamics of S. aegyptiaca over an annual reproductive cycle. Materials and methods. A total of 594 specimens of S. aegyptiaca were obtained from October 2004 to September 2005 in a monthly basis from the commercial catch. Sex ratio, age, and length at first maturity, gonado-somatic index, maturity stage, oocyte diameter, and fecundity were analysed in order to increase our knowledge on the reproductive dynamics of S. aegyptiaca. Results. The overall ratio between males and females was 1.0 : 1.15 and showed no significant deviation from the expected 1 : 1 ratio, males are dominant among small size, while females are dominant among larger size. Females attained their maturity at the length of about 15.0 cm. The reproductive activity of S. aegyptiaca took place between January and June with a peak on January, when the majority of oocyte growth (> 400 μm in diameter) occurred. Hydrated oocytes reach 1000 μm immediately before spawning. Absolute fecundity ranged from 9898 to 38505 and can be expressed as a function of total length. Conclusion. S. aegyptiacais a winter spawner, and the female attains its maturity at 15.0 cm of total length. So, fishing should be prohibited during the period from January to June to conserve the existing stock of the target species. Regulations should also be directed to reduce the fishing potential of 18.0 cm total length. It is important to give each fish the chance to reproduce at least once in its lifetime.",

    "abstract": "Background. Fish are often used as indicators of pollution levels in water environments. The omnivorous chub inhabiting rivers of Europe, including their more polluted parts, is a potentially suitable indicator. The information published, however, on the metal accumulation in the tissues of chub living in varyingly polluted waters (both polluted and unpolluted environments) is scarce. The presently reported study was conducted to examine the metal concentrations in selected tissues of chub living in a natural submontane river. Materials and methods. Sediment samples (0&ndash;5 cm layer) and chub, Leuciscus cephalus (L.), were collected from the upper (stations 1&ndash;4) and lower (stations 5&ndash;8) sections of the BiaĹ‚a Tarnowska River in summer 2003. Fish age was determined from the otoliths. The AAS method was used to determine metal concentrations (Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn) in sediment and chub tissues (spleen, liver, and muscle). Results. According to the values of the geochemical index (Igeo), the river sediments were not polluted by Pb, Cu, and Zn, while in various degrees polluted by Cd. Despite the low metal concentrations, the mean Cd and Cu concentrations were higher (c. 2&times; and 4&times;, respectively) in the upper part of the river compared to the lower section, while concentration of Pb and Zn were similar in the two areas. Chub accumulated the greatest amount of Cu in the liver, while the bulk of Cd, Pb, and Zn was found in the spleen. In the upper part of the river, elevated concentrations of trace elements in selected tissues of chub were found: Cu (spleen, muscle), Cd (spleen), Zn (muscle). The pollution status of the river, on the basis of trace element contents in the sediment, was also determined. Conclusion. The obtained results indicated tissue-specific metal accumulation in chub. Selected chub tissues are sensitive to Cd and Cu contents in the river sediment.",

Xeno-oestrogens have negative effects on the endocrine systems of wildlife including freshwater fish.&#160; Pendimethalin is a herbicide found in the environment which exerts some oestrogenic action in vivo. Dwarf medaka (known also as Thai medaka), Oryzias minutillus Smith, 1945, inhabit the natural aquatic environments.&#160; Dorsal fin of this species is a secondary sex character controlled by sex hormones and assumes as a sensitive bioindicator for testing of oestrogenic chemicals.&#160; In this study, we aimed to examine the pendimethalin effects on hormone receptor expressions and dorsal fin biometrics in adult Thai medaka. Materials and methods. Pendimethalin effects on the androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER) &#946; expressions in dorsal fins were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR.&#160; The fin biometry was presented as the values (%) of the dorsal fin length (DFL) divided by the standard length (SL). Results. In males, AR levels decreased when the fish were exposed to 0.1 &#181;g &#183; mL&#8211;1 pendimethalin for 60 days and were exposed to 1 &#181;g &#183; mL&#8211;1 for 30 and 60 days.&#160; In females, a 60-day treatment with 1 &#181;g &#183; mL&#8211;1 caused AR levels to decrease.&#160; Conversely, in males, ER&#946; levels increased after 30 and 60 days of treatment with 1 &#181;g &#183; mL&#8211;1. &#160;In females, ER&#946; levels increased after 30 days of treatment with 1 &#181;g &#183; mL&#8211;1 and 60 days of treatment with 0.1 &#181;g &#183; mL&#8211;1.&#160; In males, values of DFL/SL% decreased after exposure to 1 &#181;g &#183; mL&#8211;1 for 60 days.&#160; Additionally, we observed 4 testis-ova among 30 gonads from males treated with 1 &#181;g &#183; mL&#8211;1 for 60 days.

    "abstract": "Background. Probiotics are known as immunostimulants as well as growth and survival promoters in fish, but despite the plethora of studies on the effect of probiotics on the fish non-specific immune responses, very few information is available for ornemental fish. Thus, this study was carried out to investigate the effects of short-term dietary administration of Bacillus probiotics (B. subtilis and B. licheniformis) on the immune responses of tinfoil barb, Barbonymus schwanenfeldii (Bleeker, 1854). Materials and methods. Three experimental diets were prepared by supplementing the diets with different concentrations of probiotics including 0 (Control), 1 &#215; 104 (T1) and 1 &#215; 13306 (T2) CFU &#183; g&#8211;1 diet. Tinfoil barb weighing 16.20 &#177; 0.13 g were fed with the different diets for 15 days. At the end of the experiment, blood samples were collected in order to estimate the hematological (total protein, albumin, and globulin) and immune (total antiprotease, plasma peroxidase, and bactericidal activities ) parameters. Results. The plasma total protein, albumin, and globulin of fish were not affected by dietary probiotics. A six-fold increase in the plasma total antiprotease activity of fish fed 1 &#215; 106 CFU &#183; g&#8211;1 diet was observed. Moreover, the plasma peroxidase and bactericidal activities of fish significantly increased in T2 treatment compared to control. On the other hand, plasma natural haemolytic complement and lysozyme activities did not significantly vary between diets although the highest level of these parameters was observed in the probiotic treatments. Conclusion. This study showed the ability of dietary probiotics to enhance some innate immune responses of tinfoil barb especially after a 2-week administration of 1 &#215; 106 CFU &#183; g&#8211;1 diet (T2). Further study should focus on the effect of this dietary bacterial concentration on the fish response to bacterial and parasitical challenges in order to test its potential protective effect against the common pathogens of tinfoil barb.",

    "abstract": "Background. The shortnose greeneye, Chlorophthalmus agassizi Bonaparte, 1840, is a species with a circumglobal distribution and is among the most abundant commercial fishes in some Mediterranean areas. The knowledge of the biology and ecology of this species is poor and geographically limited, then the aim of this study is to provide a contribution to the knowledge on the reproductive biology of this monoecious deep-sea fishin Sardinian waters. Materials and methods. In this paper the morphology and the development of the gonads, the mean size at maturity, the monthly evolution in the percent frequency of the maturity stages, and of the indices related to reproduction of the shortnose greeneye were examined. Individuals were caught by trawls, between 270 and 504 m of depth in the Sardinian seas. Results. The ovarian pattern is of an asynchronous type, characterized by releasing of eggs in successive batches. Seven stages of development for the ovary and four for the testis were identified on the basis of macroscopic and histological features. The female portion is the most evident component and shows a later maturation than the male portion. The spawning period is unique and takes place from May to September. Conclusion. The identification of spawning period and the adopted reproductive strategy is essential to obtain a better understanding of its biology and a good management of its fisheries.",

    "abstract": "Background. Substantial declines in biomass of Atlantic cod, Gadus morhua L., one of the most valuable commercial fish species in the north Atlantic (including the Baltic Sea), has been observed in recent decades. A comprehensive understanding of the population structure contributes to proper management and conservation of genetic resources. We attempted to answer the question whether there exists differentiation among localized samples, and if so, whether this separation is large enough to warrant the recognition of distinct clades in cod as well as whether these distinct clades correspond to traditionally described regions of spawning and nursery areas or even stocks. Materials and methods. Six microsatellites were used for finding differentiation between four sampling areas of G. morhua) from the Baltic Sea (Puck Bay, Bay of GdaĹ„sk, Pomeranian Bay, and Ăresund) and two from the north-eastern Atlantic (North Sea and Barents Sea). Genetic differences among localities were estimated with FST using Weir and Cockerhamâ€™s estimator Î¸. Genetic distances among samples were calculated and visualized by multidimensional scaling using XLStat (Addinsoft). Results. There is a statistically supported structure pattern among sampling localities from the Baltic Sea. One of them is related to the population from the Barents Sea, second is mixing with cod migrating from the North Sea. Conclusion. The level of heterozygosity and slight heterozygote deficiency suggest that, in case of all samples, we observed an isolation processes that could be an effect of withering or weakening the migrations between separate breeding stocks. This effect is most apparent for the most eastern populations from the Puck Bay and the Gulf of GdaĹ„sk.",

    "abstract": "Background. The spotcheek emperor, Lethrinus rubrioperculatus Sato 1978, is an important component of the mesophotoic coral reef community in the Indo-Pacific Region, where it is a target of commercial fisheries. A diet composition study was undertaken as part of a broader investigation towards elucidation of the biological characteristics of this species in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Micronesia. Materials and methods. A total of 395 spotcheek emperor stomachs were examined between September 2000 and February 2002 based on a commercial fishery and research cruises.&#160; Feeding activity was estimated using indices of vacuity and repletion, diet composition was defined using the Main Food Item (MFI) index, and trophic level was determined using Trophlab. All indices were calculated to observe for patterns demographically, seasonally, ontogenetically and by sex. Results. Total vacuity index (VI) for fish was 45.8% while inclusion of bait in stomach (BIS) raised VI to 60.5%. The highest VI came from Farallon de Medinilla, with 63% and 73% including BIS. Lowest VI was at Marpi Reef, while Sonome Reef had the largest separation between VI and VI BIS. Repletion indices were greatest in Saipan and Tinian, lowest at Sonome Reef. First quarter year had the highest vacuity and lowest repletion. Repletion increased from the first to fourth quarter while VI did not reveal a pattern. Repletion decreased with size, and VI was highest in the smallest size group. Repletion and VI values were greater in females. MFI results showed fish were the primary prey item at all locations, seasons, and sizes, and in both sexes. Fish increased in diet seasonally. The smallest size group had the highest fish MFI, and the largest size group the lowest. Crustaceans and mollusks were secondary prey items varying by location, season and size. Saipan and Tinian uniquely displayed five prey categories. Overall trophic values were estimated at 4.23 &#177; 0.73, with a range from 3.96 to 4.46 as estimated by location, season size and sex. Conclusion. Results differed from New Caledonia that reported fish as a secondary food item to crustaceans for spotcheek emperor. In this study mollusks then crustaceans were present as accessory prey items. Demography, ontogeny, and size influenced diet. Estimated trophic levels were indicative of a piscivorous diet, in contrast to the value provided by FishBase. Future work in elucidating observed trends in diet preference for the spotcheek emperor should focus on obtaining a much larger sample size that is more evenly distributed across location, season, size class and sex.",

Knowledge of spawning pattern and season are important for the management of S. lysan. The biology of S. lysan is poorly known, however, and no specific management regime is available for this species in Sri Lanka. The presently reported study is the first attempt to understand the reproductive characteristics of S. lysan with implications for its management. Materials and methods. Weekly samples, totalling 1429 specimens, were collected from Sri Lankan marine waters from January 2010 to December 2011, analyzed macroscopically, and their maturity stages identified. Sex ratio, size at maturity, length-class distribution, monthly distribution of maturity stages, fecundity, and the indices related to reproduction were examined. Statistical analyses were performed to determine relations between gonad weight, total length, fork length, and fecundity. Results. Females were categorized macroscopically into five maturity stages, males into four (males mature slightly earlier than females). Spawning and spent stages of females were only available during June and September and significant peaks in the gonadosomatic index of males and females were also noted from these two months. Conclusion. The spawning period of Scomberoides lysan in Sri Lankan waters shows two peaks, one in June and another in September. The present knowledge could be used in the formulation of management strategies intended to maintain the S. lysan stock at sustainable level. Such management measures could be limit the catches of S. lysan during spawning season, allowing limited number of boats, closure of spawning area during spawning months, and harvesting small fish under 55 cm of low consumer demand should be discouraged.",

    "abstract": "Background. The Amur sleeper, Perccottus glenii Dybowski, 1877, is the most invasive alien fish species in the native aquatic communities in central Europe. Although the accelerated invasion of P. glenii has been well documented, there is little information on the ecological and growth parameters of non-native populations in this region. The aim of this study was to describe the growth features of the population of P. glenii in a shallow oxbow lake in the Carpathian Basin. Materials and methods. Our study sample consisted of 1239 individuals (628 ♂ + 611 ♀) collected from an oxbow lake near the Tisza River in the same month for three years (2013–2015). The length, weight, age structure, sex-dependent growth rate, and the condition factor of the collected specimens were determined. Results. The sex ratio was 0.49 (♀ ÷ (♀ + ♂)). The standard length and weight of the collected P. glenii specimens ranged from 20.7 to 127.7 mm and from 0.3 to 75.8 g, respectively. The length–weight relations (SL–W) were allometrically negative for the males (W = 3.2 × 10–5SL2.960), females (W = 3.8 × 10–5SL2.921), and both sexes (W = 3.5 × 10–5SL2.940), without significant differences between males and females. According to the length-frequency analysis, five age groups were differentiated. The von Bertalanffy growth models were L∞ = 138.87 mm, k = 0.21, t0 = –0.54 (♂), L∞ = 174.21 mm, k = 0.17, t0 = –0.33 (♀), L∞ = 154.01 mm, k = 0.19, t0 = –0.45 (♂ + ♀). The growth performance parameters were Ф′ = 3.61 (♂), Ф′ = 3.71 (♀), Ф′ = 3.65 (♂ + ♀), respectively. Conclusion. Due to unequal investment in reproduction, there was a significant difference in the growth rate between males and females. The literature data showed that invasive gobies and odontobutids (e.g., P. glenii) exhibit more opportunistic reproduction strategy in newly colonized areas, which may contribute to the invasion success. This strategy (e.g., earlier maturation, longer spawning period, etc.) results in slower growth rate due to energetic trade-off between reproduction and somatic growth. The observed growth rate of invasive Amur sleeper population (especially in the older age groups) was slower than that of native and more established naturalized populations in Eurasia.",

Since this specimen was not made available to us besides photographs and a muscle sample, a genetic study approach was necessary in order to accurately describe and discuss this somewhat unexpected occurrence. The main objective of this paper was to explain and discuss the presence of this single specimen in this part of the north-eastern Atlantic. Materials and methods. The specimen was caught by spear fishers on 30 July 2014 off Flores Island. We analysed all available photographs and a sample of muscle tissue that was taken and preserved frozen to be used for DNA barcoding. Results. The specimen was a reproductively mature female with a total length of 108.7 cm and weighing 14.84 kg. The body depth of the specimen from the Azores was 2.9 in SL and the analyses conducted showed no divergence from the Canary Islands specimen reported by García-Mederos and Tuset (2014) as Lutjanus dentatus (Duméril, 1861) with the body depth of 2.5 in SL, which demonstrates that this character is highly variable and not useful for species identification. Conclusion. The snapper specimen from the Island of Flores is a Lutjanus cyanopterus (Cuvier, 1828) and confirmed as first record for this part of the north-eastern Atlantic. Comparisons with a L. dentatus from the Canary Islands point towards synonymy although the available molecular evidence is too scarce and by no means conclusive.",

    "abstract": "Background. Purse seining with the use of light is among the most common fishing practices around the world, but there is lack of studies on the effect of light on the feeding of the target species in this kind of fishery and the possible consequences for other prey species. The presently reported investigation intended to provide indications on this issue by studying the diet of Atherina boyeri Risso, 1810, which is the target species of professional purse seine fishery, conducted using light in Lake Trichonis (Greece), and by comparing the acquired results with those of previous studies where the samples were taken without using light. Materials and methods. A seven-month (June through December 2014) purse seining fishing was conducted at night around two lamp rafts: 1) a traditional lamp raft producing white LED light and 2) an autonomous photovoltaic-battery-LED lamp raft producing green LED light. Stomach content analysis was conducted on 100 randomly selected specimens from each sample and the relative prey abundance and frequency of occurrence for each prey category was estimated. Calculations of predation pressure of A. boyeri upon the fish larvae of a goby, Economidichthys trichonis Economidis et Miller, 1990, were performed. Results. The study revealed the intense effect of light on the attraction and capture of prey species rarely found in previous studies, such as the larvae of the native and endangered fish E. trichonis, amphipods, and copepod nauplii. No significant differences were observed between the two light colours. A preference shift to larger prey with the increase of ontogenetic stage of A. boyeri was observed. Several thousands of pre-recruited E. trichonis larvae may be preyed upon each night around a single lamp especially during summer. Conclusion. Fishing with light may alter the dietary preference of the target fish species and even of the entire fish community. This may have serious consequences on the younger ontogenetic stages of other fish populations, especially when it coincides with their reproductive period. Considering the lack of similar field studies, the present results may stimulate analogous investigations on the effects of fishing lights in other marine and freshwater ecosystems worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Background. The power function W = a&nbsp; &middot; Lb is commonly used to describe the weight&ndash;length (W&ndash;L) relation (WLR) of fish. Smaller/younger specimens may present different WLR from larger/older ones, introducing errors in the derivation of WLR of the total population. This difference appears through a breakpoint in the log&ndash;log plot of W&ndash;L data and can be justified due to biological factors or due to errors in the sampling procedure. The aim of the study is to propose a bilinear model (LinBiExp) that identifies the specific coordinates of the breakpoint in the log-transformed W&ndash;L measurements. Materials and methods. The analysis was performed using 2627 W&ndash;L measurements of European eel, Anguilla anguilla (Linnaeus, 1758), from the Comacchio Lagoon (Italy). The bilinearity produced by LinBiExp model was verified through comparison of slopes and intercepts (ANOVA) of the two linear segments and through the 95% intervals of the highest posterior density (HPD) distribution of breakpoint coordinates estimated by bootstrap regression of LinBiExp. Additionally, gut content analysis was performed in order to detect any diet shift in order to justify the existence of the breakpoint. Results. The LinBiExp function identified the breakpoint coordinates (Lt, Wt) = (28.9 cm, 35.9 g). The ANOVA showed that there was a statistically significant difference between the slopes and between the intercepts of the two linear segments at 99.9% confidence level. The 95% HPD intervals of Lt and Wt were 28.4&ndash;29.4 cm and 34.5&ndash;38.0 g, respectively, based on 10 000 bootstrap estimates. The gut content analysis showed inclusion of other fish preys in the diet of eels when their weight and length exceeded the coordinates of the breakpoint in W&ndash;L data. Conclusion. The estimated breakpoint for the specific dataset was justified by the possible interrelation of ontogenetic diet shift with other metabolic processes (e.g., beginning of sexual maturation). The study showed that the LinBiExp function can be a valuable tool for detecting the absolute coordinates of a breakpoint in log-transformed W&ndash;L data, while the presented methodology can increase the robustness of weight&ndash;length analysis of fishes using the typical power function.",

    "abstract": "Background. Overexploitation of fishery resources has led to the capture of alternative species of a lower trophic level, considered previously unprofitable or unfit for human consumption. The southern pufferfish, Sphoeroides nephelus (Goode et Bean, 1882), is a bycatch species of the recreational fishery in the USA and Mexico. Unlike other species of the genus Sphoeroides, there is no background on their reproductive cycle. Therefore, this study aimed to describe several reproductive traits (sex ratio, gonadal development, annual reproductive cycle, and fecundity) of specimens from the northern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. This kind of information might serve as a point of reference for its potential use either in the pharmaceutical industry, aquarium trade, as well as in aquaculture. Materials and methods. The reproductive biology of the southern pufferfish was described based on 189 females and 223 males, caught off the northern coast off the Yucatan, Mexico, during an annual cycle. Several reproductive traits, such as the annual cycle of gonad development, sex ratio, and the batch fecundity were determined. Results. The sex ratio showed no significant difference from 1 &divide; 1 ratio. Male&rsquo;s reproductive season lasted from August to May, although females were spawning from August to April. The size at 50% maturity was estimated at 14.93 cm TL for females. Batch fecundity ranged between 59 087 and 367 022 oocytes (mean 176 456) per spawning batch, and it was significantly fitted to both female size and weight based on power and linear regression models, respectively. The relative batch fecundity was estimated at 828 &plusmn; 182 oocytes per gram of eviscerated weight, and 11 989 &plusmn; 4774 oocytes per gram of gonad weight. Conclusion. It was determined that S. nephelus exhibited 1 &divide; 1 sex ratio, an asynchronous development of oocytes and indeterminate fecundity with batch spawning. The species has a protracted reproductive season that lasted almost all year round with peaks in February&ndash;March (before of the dry season) and a brief inactive period in June&ndash;July (before of the wet season). This latter information should be helpful to obtain a broodstock that would be the base to produce fingerlings to be raised, instead of collecting individuals from the wild.",

The presently-reported study aimed to fill this gap in the existing knowledge of spatial and temporal variation in the distribution and abundance of ichthyoplankton in the south-eastern Black Sea. Materials and methods. Bimonthly surveys were carried out from January through November 2009 at inshore and offshore sites (>38°E, >40°N). The samples were collected by horizontal tows with Manta nets. The mouth of the net was equipped with flowmeters to measure the amount of water passing through the net during each tow. Results. The horizontal tows returned a total of 13 556 eggs and 1304 larvae representing 26 species (from 22 families): Engraulis encrasicolus, Sprattus sprattus, Merlangius merlangus, Gaidropsarus mediterraneus, Atherina boyeri, Scorpaena porcus, Chelidonichthys lucerna, Dicentrarchus labrax, Trachurus mediterraneus, Diplodus annularis, Sciaena umbra, Mullus barbatus, Gymnammodytes cicerelus, Ctenolabrus rupestris, Symphodus ocellatus, Trachinus draco, Uranoscopus scaber, Parablennius sanguinolentus, Parablennius tentacularis, Blennius sp., Ophidion rochei, Callionymus pusillus, Gobius sp., Arnoglossus kessleri, Buglossidium luteum, Pegusa lascaris. Overall, the dominant species were E. encrasicolus with 89.8% of all collected eggs, followed by G. mediterraneus (7.0%). Similarly, 47.4% of the total larvae were represented by E. encrasicolus, followed by P. sanguinolentus (22.8%) and S. sprattus (13.2%). The colder months (January, March, and November) presented a total of four species: S. sprattus, B. luteum, Gymnammodytes cicerelus, and Gaidropsarus mediterraneus. The warmer months had a greater variety of different species than colder months. Of these, E. encrasicolus was the most dominant species, providing the maximum abundance of fish eggs and larvae in September. The abundance of E. encrasicolus eggs and larvae decreased from offshore toward inshore sites highlighting the preference of this species to deeper waters for spawning as well as for nursery purposes in Giresun Bay. Conclusion. The results of this study suggest that the length of the closed fishing season in the Black Sea should be reconsidered. We suggest that it should be extended to include also the last week of September in order to provide more time for pelagic fish (e.g., E. encrasicolus) to complete their spawning period. This could result in a healthier and more sustainable stock of E. encrasicolus in the Black Sea.",

    "abstract": "Background. Information on the age, growth, and abundance fluctuation is important for fisheries conservation and management because stock assessment models rely on these biological parameters. However, the limited biological information makes it difficult to develop the proper and effective management for Jordan&rsquo;s damsel, Teixeirichthys jordani (Rutter, 1897), which is a part of commercial fisheries, exploited by trawl fishery in the southern Taiwan Strait. Therefore, this study would intend to provide the necessary information about the age, growth, and abundance fluctuation for this species to fill the gap in the current knowledge. Materials and methods. Age and growth of Jordan&rsquo;s damsel were assessed based on 407 individuals collected in March&ndash;November 2006 from the southern Taiwan Strait. Sagittal otoliths were used for the age determination and growth parameters were estimated by three growth functions. According to the Akaike&rsquo;s Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc), the best fitting model was selected. To explore drivers of the Jordan&rsquo;s damsel abundance in the southern Taiwan Strait, the Spearman rank correlation was used to discuss linkages between a time series (1994~2010) of catch per unit effort (CPUE) of Jordan&rsquo;s damsel and several forcing factors: fishing, sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA), the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and chlorophyll-a (CHL). Results. The fish age ranged from 0 to 3 years; and the estimated growth parameters of the von Bertalanffy model (the best fitting model) were L&infin; = 122.19 mm (standard length), k = 0.316 year&minus;1, and t0 = &minus;2.5477. Spearman rank correlation indicated fishing effort (P &lt; 0.000, &rho; = &minus;0.826), CHL (P &lt; 0.001, &rho; = &minus;0.780), and PDO (P &lt; 0.000, &rho; = 0.876) were significant predictors of CPUE between 1994 and 2010, however SSTA was not a significant predictor of CPUE (P = 0.294 &gt; 0.05). Conclusion. Teixeirichthys jordani displayed positively allometric growth and this study providing population structure (size and age distribution) and growth parameters would be beneficial for population assessment and fishery management for Jordan&rsquo;s damsel. For Jordan&rsquo;s damsel in the southern Taiwan Strait, fishing may cause abundance fluctuations by affecting population dynamics, and biophysical conditions associated with PDO and El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) may be not adequate to affect the stock fluctuation though CHL and PDO were significant predictors of CPUE.",

    "abstract": "Background. Roach, Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758), is an omnivorous fish species that is able to utilise a range of food resources. Both juvenile and older roach can negatively affect zooplankton abundance in freshwater bodies of water; hence populations are often reduced (biomanipulated) in order to increase zooplankton populations. The aim of this study was to assess the roach diet after large-scale removal of cyprinids (bream, roach) from a reservoir. The study was done to clarify the roach diet after three years of intensive reduction of cyprinid fish and also to find out how the roach feeding behaviour impacts the quantity of filtering zooplankton. As such, this study may help to explain more general relations within the aquatic food web and specify the roach diet during the vegetative season (from spring to autumn). Materials and methods. This study was undertaken at the Hamry water supply reservoir in the Czech Republic. Samples of macrozoobenthos, periphyton, and zooplankton were collected as representative food resources. Fish were caught using a 100-m littoral beach seine during the April to October growing season in 2011. Supplementary fish were caught using a pelagic Nordic gillnet in August and September 2012 and a 15-m beach seine in June and August 2012. Gut contents were preserved in 4% formaldehyde for later laboratory analysis (frequency of occurrence, index of preponderance, index of gut fullness). Results. 'Detritus' was the major component found in roach guts, with no difference observed in age category or locality (littoral vs. open water areas). Significant differences were observed, however, between younger (0+ and 1+, 36–92 mm) and older (>3 years, >92 mm) fish. The 0+ and 1+ age groups also fed on zooplankton (P < 0.008), accompanied by Chironomidae (1+), while diet of older roach (3–4+; 6–8+) included macrophytes and periphyton, together with Cladocera (fish from open water; P < 0.008). Conclusion. The results demonstrate that detritus was the main 'dietary' component of roach during the growing season, with macrophytes and periphyton as complementary dietary items. Zooplankton was an important dietary component of mainly younger roach age classes. Roach appear to be an important component in ichthyo-eutrophication of the Hamry Reservoir, mainly through transfer of phosphorous from plants to water.",

The feeding behaviour of Mediterranean moray, Muraena helena Linnaeus, 1758, from the coast of Tunisia (central Mediterranean) is poorly know and this study is a first step in determining prey consumption by M. helena as main information for improving fishery monitoring and management in the study area. Materials and methods. Of the 411 sampled Mediterranean morays, 237 were males and 174 females. The stomach contents were removed, sorted, identified to the lowest possible taxon, counted, and weighed. For diet description, we calculated vacuity index (VI), abundance (mean number of preys) (NM), frequency of occurrence (F%), relative abundance (N%), and frequency by weight (W%). The contribution of each prey in the diet was also estimated with Index of Relative Importance (IRI) and its standardized value (%IRI). The trophic level (TROPH) was calculated for total sample to determine the diet of the species, but it was also related to the sex, size, and seasons. Results. The relation between the total length and the total body weight showed a positive allometry for both males and females. VI presented high values, for total sample, sex, size, and season. Muraena helena under study consumed a variety of prey items including 3 higher taxa, 13 families, and 20 species. Osteichthyans were the dominant preys with 15 taxa, representing 96.84% of weight, 78.83% of number, 84.21%, of frequency, and %IRI = 98.51. Crustaceans and cephalopods and sea grass were also ingested by M. helena, with lower %IRI (0.65, 0.66), and no ontogenetic changes in the diet were recorded related to sex, size, and seasons. The most common prey species were Diplodus annularis (Linnaeus, 1758) and D. vulgaris (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1817) with %IRI = 28.52 and 7.45, respectively while Serranus cabrilla (Linnaeus, 1758) was also consumed with %IRI = 1.84. The calculated TROPH was 4.27 (SE = 0.74); changes were recorded with seasons but not significantly different. Conclusion. Muraena helena is a carnivorous species feeding on prey items representing three higher taxa, osteichthyans being the most common in stomach contents and such findings suggest that it should be considered as a piscivorous species. The high value of trophic level pointed out that M. helena is a top predator.",

Phytate (myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakis-dihydrogen phosphate) is the main storage form of phosphorus (P) and up to 80% of the total P content in plants remains unavailable to fish due to lack of intestinal phytases for efficient phytate hydrolysis. The inclusion of microbial phytase in the feed is an approach to increase phytate phosphorus bioavailability. In the presently reported study, a comparison of the efficacy of phytase produced by fish gut bacterial strain, Bacillus licheniformis LF1 and a commercially available phytase, Biophos-TS in improving the nutritive value of sesame (Sesamum indicum) oilseed meal (SOM) was evaluated in the diet for fingerlings of rohu, Labeo rohita (Hamilton, 1822). Materials and methods. Eleven isonitrogenous (approximately 35% crude protein) and isocaloric (17.58 kJ · g–1 gross energy) experimental diets were formulated with the same basal diet containing raw sesame oilseed meal (D1) or oilseed meal pretreated with phytase from the fish gut bacterial strain, B. licheniformis LF1 (D2–D6) and commercially available phytase, Biophos-TS (D7–D11) at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 FTU · kg–1 and fed to rohu fingerlings (mean initial weight 1.85 ± 0.52 g) for 80 days. Results. Fermentation of oilseed meal significantly reduced the crude fibre content and anti-nutritional factors tannins and phytic acid, and enhanced mineral concentration. In terms of growth, feed conversion ratio, and protein efficiency ratio, diets containing sesame oilseed meal pretreated with Biophos-TS at a concentration of 30 FTU · kg–1 and with strain LF1 at a concentration of 40 FTU · kg–1 resulted in a significantly (P < 0.05) better performance of rohu fingerlings. The apparent digestibility of protein, lipid, ash and minerals was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in fish fed diets D9 and D5 in comparison to those fed reference diet (RD). The crude protein, crude lipid, and ash contents of fish carcass were highest in fish fed diet D9, which was not significantly (P < 0.05) different from those in the group of fish fed diet D5. Pretreatment of diets with phytase reduced faecal P levels. Conclusion. Comparison of the efficacy of phytase produced by fish gut bacteria with commercially available phytase indicated no significant difference in performance of rohu fingerlings in terms of growth and nutrient and mineral utilization.",

    "abstract": "Background. Life stage transitions (e.g., settlement and recruitment), characterized by high mortality rates, act as selective bottlenecks for fishes with a bipartite life cycle. Mortality at these stages is usually selective and potentially affected by larval history. This process is reflected in an inconsistency in larval traits&#8217; distribution between subsequent life stages (e.g., settlers and recruits) originating from the same reproductive season. Despite the importance of this issue only very scarce information is available about this aspect of Mediterranean fishes life histories. Materials and methods. Here we described settlement and investigated the match/mismatch of larval traits between settlers and recruits coming from the same reproductive season, using the white seabream, Diplodus sargus sargus (Linnaeus, 1758), as a model species along ~ 200 km of the Apulian Adriatic coast (south-western Adriatic Sea, Italy). Both microstructure and chemistry analyses were carried out on otoliths of settlers (n = 140) and recruits (n = 113). Results. We highlighted a mismatch in two life traits, i.e., PLD (pelagic larval duration) and natal origin, between settlers and recruits. Recruits showed PLD longer than the maximum recorded for settlers, and a higher number of natal sources compared to settlers. Mismatch in PLD could suggest selective juvenile mortality related to PLD, and recruits with higher PLD potentially originated from the settlement tail (i.e., settled after the settlement peak). Conclusion. Our findings can support hypotheses suggesting that 1) a fraction of juveniles are selectively eliminated; 2) settlement tail could play a relevant role in replenishing local populations of white seabream.",

    "abstract": "Background. Salmonid spermatozoa are characterised by a very short time of activity in the water, therefore sudden water pollution in the form of increased salinity on the spawning grounds may have a negative effect on the sperm motility parameters, thus affecting the subsequent egg fertilisation and, consequently, the number of hatched individuals of the species. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of water salinity on the motility parameters of spermatozoa of brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis (Mitchill, 1814). Materials and methods. Sperm motility was monitored with a camera (Basler A312fc) coupled with Nikon Eclipse 50i light microscope from the moment of their activation (contact with water) until the cessation of movement. The following water-salinity treatments were tested: 1.0‰, 3.0‰, 5.0‰, and 10.0‰. The motility parameters: VCL, VSL, VAP, ALH, BCF, LIN, STR, WOB, and MOT, were analysed with Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA). Results. The mean values of the studied motility parameters of the brook trout spermatozoa (obtained within 30 s), whose activation took place in the water of 0.35‰ salinity and in water of 1.0‰ and 3.0‰ salinity, did not differ significantly. The highest mean values of motility parameters were recorded for the water of 5.0‰ salinity. The 10.0‰ treatment caused a distinct decrease in the values of all the studied parameters. The percentage of MOT was the highest (37.5%) in the sample activated in the water used for fish rearing (0.35‰). In the remaining samples the MOT was lower, and in the water of 10.0‰ salinity it was only 9.1%. No spermatozoa movement of any kind was recorded in the 35th second of the experiment. Conclusion. The values of the motility parameters as well as the percentage of motile spermatozoa (MOT) in the semen decrease with increasing salinity of the water used for activation, and with increasing time of exposure.",

    "abstract": "Background. Temporal variability in fish reproductive features is influenced by environmental and spatial variations. Given the wide distribution of northern pike, Esox lucius Linnaeus, 1758, in the northern hemisphere, important reproductive features such as the initiation of the spawning activity are likely to vary with latitudinal gradients. The overall goal of the presently reported study was to answer basic questions regarding the reproductive biology of the pike and to discuss changes in the timing of the onset of spawning activity in relation to geographical locations and the water temperature in the Anzali Wetland compared to higher latitudes. Materials and methods. Monthly samples (537 specimens in total) were collected from the Anzali Wetland (southwest of the Caspian Sea) from July 2012 through July 2013. Samples were macro- and microscopically examined, and their maturity stages were identified, so that spawning season, monthly distribution of maturity stages, oocytes development, spawning strategy, length at 50% maturity, and fecundity were estimated. Results. The gonadosomatic index, oocyte size-frequency distribution, and histological examination suggested a relatively short spawning season, from February through March. The short annual spawning period and the oocyte size-frequency distribution demonstrated that pike is a total spawner with group synchronous oocyte development. The length at 50% maturity was 28.5 and 33.9 cm FL for males and females, respectively. Absolute fecundity values ranged from 4423 to 48471 oocytes, with mean (± standard error) of 16481 ± 2705 oocytes and the relative fecundity was estimated as 26.9 ± 1.6 oocytes per gram of mature female. Conclusion. The most important findings of this study are: the earlier initiation and relatively shorter duration of the reproductive activities of pike in the south Caspian region compared to northern geographical regions. The results emphasize the need for specific management strategies based on seasonal measures for pike such as: fish size limits, limitation of catches during the spawning season, limitation of the boat number, and closure of the spawning area during spawning months.",

    "abstract": "Background. Due to their location between the continent and the sea and their shallow depths, lagoons play an important ecological role in coastal ecosystems by providing a selection of habitat types for many species, functioning as nursery areas and feeding grounds for marine opportunistic fishes. The fish fauna of the Nador Lagoon (NE Morocco), as in the majority of southern Mediterranean lagoons, has been insufficiently studied, even though the lagoon itself supports important commercial fisheries. The presently reported study investigated the spatial and seasonal uses of shallow habitats for fish fauna in the Nador Lagoon. Materials and methods. Sampling was done using a beach seine net at six stations covering almost entire lagoon and representing habitats differing in many parameters such as the distance from the inlet, bottom sediment characteristics, presence of macroalgae, etc. The fish abundance was standardized as catch per unit effort (CPUE) and the fish community was analysed both in terms of its taxonomic and functional composition (by making use of both ecological and dietary preference guilds). Results. A total of 2872 individuals, representing 15 species from 12 families, was collected during the four seasons. Only six species were always present in all seasons. Fish abundance peaked in spring and the species diversity was higher in spring and summer. The fish assemblage was largely dominated in terms of ecological guild by the resident and benthivorous species. Spatial and seasonal fish assemblages differed both in terms of fish abundance and diversity and also in terms of functional guilds composition. In autumn, the fish assemblage was dominated by the marine juvenile migrants whereas in winter, spring, and summer, resident species were the most abundant. Conclusion. The combination of taxonomic and functional characteristics of the fish assemblages, determined in the presently reported study, may contribute to a better understanding of the ecological networks of the Nador Lagoon, thus providing useful data for its conservation and management.",

    "abstract": "Comparative biological and morphometric studies were carried out on vendace from lakes Drawsko and PeĹ‚cz in two seasons of the year. The summer sample covered 106 specimens of this fish from Drawsko Lake and 120 specimens from Pełcz Lake, while the autumn sample consisted of 110 and 104 specimens, respectively. This survey demonstrated a number of significant differences in the individual weights, the condition of the fish, as well as in the mensural and meristic characters. Out of a total of 28 analysed linear parameters, such differences were recorded in 15 characters in summer and in as many as 19-in autumn. Also 3 out of 11 meristic parameters showed differences. Vendace of Pełcz Lake, among other things, had larger (related to fork length, FL) linear dimensions of individual body parts and they had smaller maximal body depth. The reasons behind the above-mentioned differences may be different environmental conditions of both lakes.",

Total abundance of nanoflagellates at the inshore station ranged from 0.2 to 6.1&#1468;103 ind./ml (mean of 2.1&#1468;103 ind./ml), while the biomass varied from 10 to 604 &#956;g/dm3 (mean of 149 &#956;g/dm3). The values were lower in offshore waters. The Dinophyceae, constituting-on the average-30% of the total biomass, Prymnesiophyceae (32% of the total abundance) and Cryptophyceae were dominants at all the stations. The Choanoflagellida as well as the other heterotrophic nanoflagellates contributed significantly to the abundance (11 and 18%, respectively). A succession of the dominant taxa is discussed.",

Histological examinations of gonads of 4-5 year old rudd and carp bream hybrids were carried out in experimental environments during the pre-spawning and spawning seasons of the parental species.Results. In development of oocytes the female hybrids of rudd and carp bream reached the stage of migrating nucleus and deterioration of the morphological structure of the nucleus. In case of male hybrids the presence of spermatids was confirmed. The stage of spermatozoa was not observed in case of hybrids of rudd and bream. In case of the control species (rudd) that stage was also not observed. It is possible that the lack of that stage was affected by the parameters of the culture environment. Nevertheless, the sexual products of male hybrids of rudd and bream as well as rudd were deposited.Conclusion. The studies show that the hybrids of rudd and carp bream may reach sexual maturity in the natural environments.",

The aim of this study was to examine the histological structure of skin in both sexes, in the body parts which are particularly exposed to mechanical damage during spawning. Materials and methods. Based on material representing three forms (anadromous, land-locked (lake), and dwarf/riverine), collected in the pre-spawning and spawning periods, histological structure of the skin was analysed for three body areas: dorsum (back), side, and venter (belly). Results. In females of all the forms the skin in analysed body areas was thicker and contained more mucous cells, compared to males. In the ventral region it was the thickest, on the dorsum-the thinnest. A comparison of the skin structure in the three forms showed that, in the land-locked form (both sexes), the skin in all the body parts was thicker and richer in mucous cells, compared to the anadromous form. Conclusion. The skin of Arctic charr females plays a protective role, preventing mechanical damage during nest digging and egg burying, because of its substantial thickness and the abundance of mucous cells especially in the ventral region.",

The African bagrid catfish, Chrysichthys nigrodigitatus (Lacepède, 1803), is an omnivorous species cultured in both fresh and brackish waters because of its good growth rate, excellent taste, and high market demand. There has been little nutritional work on this economically important species. This study was designed to determine the effects of varying dietary crude protein levels on growth, nutrient utilization and body composition of juvenile C. nigrodigitatus. Materials and methods. One hundred and twenty fish with an initial mean weight of 21.33 ± 0.48 g were divided randomly among 12 tanks for triplicate groups that were fed diets containing 20%, 25%, 30%, and 35% crude protein (CP). Feed consumption and fish weight were measured biweekly for eight weeks, after which proximate composition of the fish was determined. Results. Fish fed the 35% CP diet had the best growth performance and nutrient utilization (P < 0.05), with a mean weight gain of 88.3% ± 0.2%, feed conversion ratio (FCR) of 2.60 ± 0.12, and protein efficiency ratio (PER) of 1.10 ± 0.05. The least weight gain (32.1% ± 0.9%) and poorest FCR and PER (5.70 ± 0.06 and 0.87 ± 0.01, respectively) were observed in fish fed the 20% CP diet. Body protein content was not affected by diet, but body lipid increased significantly (P < 0.05) with increasing dietary protein levels. Conclusion. C. nigrodigitatus juveniles will grow best when fed diets containing at least 35% CP.",

However, the small size of some fishes makes it difficult to measure stress using these physiological and immunological indicators. In this study, we investigated the possibility of obtaining macrophages from zebrafish via whole body extractions by assessing the respiratory burst activity and phagocytic capacity of extracted cells and we studied the effects of temperature stress on zebrafish using the extracted macrophages. Materials and methods. One hundred and fifty genetically pure zebrafish, Danio rerio (Hamilton, 1822), were randomly divided into three groups and placed in three different environments: optimal (28&deg;C), warm (32&deg;C), and cool (23&deg;C). Using the newly developed extraction method described in this article macrophages were extracted from whole fish bodies and the phagocytic activity of these cells were assessed. Results. The method yielded enough macrophages to examine their respiratory burst activity and phagocytic capacity. Values obtained for experimental replicates were similar and the assessment measures were sensitive enough to detect differences in these parameters among fish maintained at three different temperatures for 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks. These results suggest that macrophages can be successfully extracted using the whole body method and the extracted macrophages are useful for studying stress. Conclusion. The method of macrophage extraction described in this article is simple and rapid, and will enable researchers to study the effects of any stressors, environmental or pathogenic, on the non-specific immune response of fish.",

The species C. venezuelae, C. dicrus, C. eidolon, and C. thrix have been found to have a similar ecology, but details about their reproduction are still unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate if egg morphology, mode of attachment, and development differ between the species; which could be attributed to use of different microhabitats and/or resources. Materials and methods. Fish were kept in aquaria and their eggs were collected every 6&nbsp;h. Embryonic development in the eggs was documented under a dissecting microscope. Additionally egg morphology and mode of egg attachment were studied by a scanning electron microscope. Results. The time of embryonic development was 66 h in all species. Egg dimensions were 0.7&ndash;1.1 mm in length and 0.3&ndash;0.5 mm in width. The eggs were attached to the substrate by an adhesive apparatus typical for gobiids, a net like structure around the micropylar pole, and composed of filaments, 1.5&ndash;2.2 &mu;m in diameter. The zona radiata was of 0.5&ndash;0.8-&mu;m thick. Conclusion. No differences in the period of embryonic development, egg shape or means of attachment could be found between the species studied, but variations in egg dimensions and their attaching structures were noted. The zona radiata is very thin in comparison to other fish eggs, though comparative data of fish with a similar ecology are needed.",

Spinous dorsal fin base almost straight. Soft dorsal fin base not raised and spinous dorsal fin membranes vaguely red. Sequences of both species were submitted to the GenBank and Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) publication database which displayed 99%–100% similarity value S. tiereoides from GenBank and BOLD databases but, S. spinosissimum has not any deposited sequences from GenBank or BOLD. DNA barcoding based on COI gene was demonstrated as a powerful and useful molecular marker in the identification and differentiation of S. spinosissimum and S. tiereoides fish species.",

    "abstract": "The population structure of the bluefish, Pomatomus saltatrix (Linnaeus, 1766), in Turkish waters is scarcely described in the literature. To identify any distinct population units of bluefish, and reaffirm the findings of a previous study, four areas were selected: the Aegean Sea, western Black Sea, eastern Black Sea, and the Sea of Marmara. In this study, truss network morphometrics, meristics, and otolith shape analyses were successfully applied for different population identification of the bluefish. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) revealed no differences for truss network morphometrics, meristic, and otolith shape characters between males and females. Hence, both sexes were combined for the discriminant function (DFA) and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Using univariate ANOVA based on the stepwise method revealed a highly significant difference among different locations for each truss-morphometrics and otolith shape characters. Furthermore, six out of seven meristic characters also showed significant differences between different areas. Based on PCA, 25 out of 27 truss-morphometric characters had a loading value above 0.70, which was considered significant in this study. The results of DFA show clear patterns of truss-morphometric character variations, forming four distinct clusters that were well separated from each other, indicating the existence of four morphologically differentiated populations of the bluefish. The proportion of the correctly classified Aegean Sea, western Black Sea, and eastern Black Sea bluefish samples to their original groups were 100%, demonstrating clear separation of these stocks from each other. Whereas up to 5% of the total samples of the Sea of Marmara were incorrectly classified, assigning to the eastern Black Sea. These findings were supported by meristic and otolith shape characters that also indicated four morphologically differentiated populations of the bluefish. However, their overall proportion of correct classification was relatively lower than the truss-morphometric traits method. The findings suggest the requirement of strategic assessment and management of each bluefish stock separately to use them sustainably in the future.",

    "abstract": "Small-scale fisheries (SSF) is a local and community-based activity that can be traced back to ancient times, and thus, closely related to the history of humankind. However, large-scale fisheries have grown tremendously, approaching an industrial sector in the last century, due to their socio-economic and political properties, including both national and international aspects. This progress towards industrial-scale fisheries led to the involvement of scientific research, first aiming to improve production efficiency, and then, to protect ecosystems as resources exploited for fisheries activity, by mitigating their adverse impacts. During this evolutionary progress, SSF was usually neglected because of their limited production ability, and thus minimal economic contribution, until the later phase when the protection of ecosystem resources gained sufficient importance. As a result of this, many countries lack data on SSF, undermining efforts for the creation of proper policies for this type of fisheries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the productivity and the effects of some demographic characteristics, boat structures, and some cost (input) items on the net profit of SSF in the Black Sea. The eligible sample for this study consisted of 5575 small-scale fishing boats in the Black Sea. The number of fishers to be surveyed was determined as 315 using the “Simple Random Sampling” method, based on operators of boats &amp;lt; 12 m, i.e., boats in the SSF. Questionnaires were conducted face-to-face with fishers. In this study, it was tested if six parameters were investigated to determine whether they had a significant effect on net profit in SSF. These parameters were: (1) engine power; (2) number of fishing days; (3) boat length; (4) consumption of fuel in fishing; (5) education level of fishers; and (6) overall professional experience of fishers. To do so, Simple Linear Regression Analysis was performed to determine the effect of the data considered as independent variables when the net profit was set as the dependent variable. Atlantic bonito, Sarda sarda (Bloch, 1793); whiting, Merlangius merlangus (Linnaeus, 1758); rapa whelk, Rapana venosa (Valenciennes, 1846); and turbot, Scophthalmus maximus (Linnaeus, 1758) were the most important commercial fish species for small scale fishing. When catch per boat in SSF was evaluated, Kırklareli province ranked first with 97 007 kg, with Atlantic bonito (44 778 kg) being the most common species caught. Samsun had the second-largest catch per boat with 91 761 kg. The total net profit of 303 boats was calculated as €1 794 938 and the mean net profit per boat was €5924. The highest per boat mean net profit (€25 909) was in Kırklareli. According to the results of the study, the number of days at the sea, boat length, engine power, and fuel cost had a significant effect on the net profit while education level and professional experience were not important in productivity. The economically-fragile SSF sector may need some kind of supporting subsidy. It would be beneficial to provide support to the majority of fishers active in the SSF in terms of complementary alternative employment opportunities in the regions where they are located.",

Out of the 76 sharks and rays inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea, the length–weight relations (LWR) are available for 28 (37%) of them, usually for common small-sized species that are not protected and may be marketed. The aim of the presently reported study was to fill in the knowledge gap through the estimation of LWR of rare and uncommon sharks and rays in the Mediterranean Sea using the information from single records or few individuals. The analysis was based on a Bayesian hierarchical method for estimating length–weight relations in fishes that has been recently proposed for data-deficient species or museum collections and uses the prior knowledge and existing LWR studies to derive species-specific LWR parameters by body form. The use of this method was applied to single records of rare and uncommon species and here we report the LWR of 46 uncommon sharks and ray species, 14 of which are first reported LWR at a global scale and 21 are the first reported LWR for the Mediterranean Sea; the remaining 11 species are first time records for the western or eastern Mediterranean regions. Museum collections and sporadic catch records of rare emblematic species may provide useful biological information with the use of appropriate Bayesian methods.",

If a link exists between somatic and otolith growth, otolith size and microstructure analysis can be a useful tool in studies of larval fish growth and condition—methods like growth back-calculation or marginal increment width analysis can be employed. Because significance of that link may vary among species and can be additionally modified by temperature, the aim of the present paper is to evaluate how sagittal otoliths of Atlantic menhaden responded to somatic growth and temperature. Materials and methods. Larval Atlantic menhaden, Brevoortia tyrannus (Latrobe, 1802) (age range: 20–120 days; length range: 14–35 mm SL), collected during 3 years were evaluated for length-at-age and groups of the shortest and longest-at-age individuals (8% of sampled population in each group) were used in the analyses. Similarly, otolith size-at-age estimated from sagittae length was evaluated and then compared with the earlier estimated growth indices of larvae. Results. Otolith growth rate (OGR) indicated growth differences among analysed larvae. Additionally, temperature effect on OGR independent of somatic growth was detected for larvae that were short-at-age (i.e., the slow growth group). For the fast grow group, temperature effect on OGR was insignificant. Conclusion. Back-calculation of growth from otoliths of larval and early juvenile Atlanticmenhaden is justified but less accurate estimates can be expected for the slowest growing individuals due to the independent temperature effect on otolith growth.",

    "abstract": "Background. The topmouth gudgeon, Pseudorasbora parva (Temminck et Schlegel, 1846) (known also as stone moroko), is an alien species of the fish fauna of many European freshwater ecosystems. In large quantities, its may affect negatively the fish fauna and the functioning of ecosystems. It competes for food with native fish species and they occupy their habitat. The knowledge about the invasion dynamics may help to find suitable control measures. The aim of this study was to find and observe the population of P. parva in a small river. Materials and methods. Inventory fishing on three sampling sites at the CiemiÄ™ga River was carried out from 2003 to 2007. The abundance and density of P. parva in the river were calculated. The size distribution of P. parva and its length–weight relation were determined. Abundance, density, length, and mass of the fish from all study sites were analyzed statistically. Results. P. parva was first recorded in the CiemiÄ™ga River in the autumn of 2005. The abundance of P. parva in relation to the structure of the local ichthyofauna was the smallest in the spring and the highest in autumn. The total length of P. parva ranged from 15 to 104 mm, and the mass from 0.2 to 10.4 g. Taking into account the number of the specimens, P. parva constituted between 0.9% and 57.2% of the local ichthyofauna, while its mass ranged from 0.0% to 35.1% depending on the study site and the season. The density of P. parva ranged from 72.9 to 6.5 CPUEN, while the mean value for the river was 30.6 CPUEN. Conclusion. In Polish waters P. parva is an alien species and there is still little information about its occurrence in the flowing waters. Since 2005, this species was present almost in all inventory catches in the CiemiÄ™ga River. Its presence was dependent on the kind of the habitat and the presence of predatory fish species (eg brown trout). P. parva occurring numerous may be a lot of competition for native fish species, and therefore an important problem is to understand his habitat preferences and interactions with native fish species.",

Conclusion.The terrestrial-aquatic ecotone is important in fish growth of seasonal floodplains.Energy uptake is optimised through cannibalism to ensure species survival.Furthermore, species inter-relations are dynamic due to variations in food availability driven by seasonal flooding, which shortens and lengthens the food chain periodically.This dynamic relation is pronounced at low floods when predation and competition increases within the fish community.The evidence from this study has shown that predation, cannibalism, inter-and intra-specific competition are regulating factors in floodplain fish communities, driven by seasonal flooding.",

    "abstract": "Background. The abundance of club cells in epidermal tissue of fishes in the superorder Ostariophysi is a poorly understood phenomenon. Previous results have suggested that epidermal club cells have a generic role in response to injury and that they display intense phagocytotic activity, having an anti-parasitic function in the host. Earlier works suggested that club cells are usually located in the middle of the epidermis and that they do not communicate with the epidermal surface or do it only when the epidermis has been ruptured by predation. The presently reported study focused on the alterations of club cell activity in carp epidermis induced by ectoparasite, Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. We hoped that our observations would help to understand the function(s) of these cells. Materials and methods. This study was based on 200 four-month old common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., with mean body weight of 65 &plusmn; 5 g. The fish were experimentally infected with theronts of Ichthyophthirius multifiliis. In sequential days post infection, samples of fins and body skin were collected for histological and histochemical examination. The correlation between club cell densities and mucous cell densities was analysed using Pearson correlation analyses. Results. A local reduction of mucous cells occurred after theront invasion-induced proliferation, and increased club cell density around the parasite during the growth of trophonts. After parasites left the skin due to salt-water treatment, a decrease in the number of club cells was detected. During reinvasion the decrease in parasite activity in areas of club cells proliferation was not noted. It was found that giant mature club cells were opened on the surface. Conclusion. Club cells have no anti-parasitic function against I. multifiliis and these mature cells released their viscous secretion into water. The high density of club cells in the epidermis compensates an overall low density or absence of mucous cells. As it can be hardly concluded that the function of club cells is phagocytic removal of cell debris, an integrated research on mucosal immune mechanisms, as well as studies on epidermal tissue responses on product(s) released by club cells (&ldquo;alarm substance cells&rdquo;) should be carried out in the future.",

    "abstract": "Background. Many of Cobitis subpopulations exist as diploid–polyploid hybrid complexes where polyploid gynogenetic females act as \"sperm parasites\" of diploid individuals. In addition to sexual strategy, the life history of such individuals is also affected by their growth performance. In order to elucidate unknown aspects of the Cobitis hybrid complexes we decided to identify differences in the annual size increments between individuals representing different ploidy and sex, and to compare the condition factor expressed by length–weight (L–W) relation within the same ploidy and sex groups. Materials and methods. In total, 158 specimens representing Cobitis elongatoides (Băcescu et Mayer, 1969) × Cobitis tanaitica (Băcescu et Mayer, 1969) hybrid complex were caught in August and September 2014, of which 132 were analysed. The fish were caught in the Okna River (Danube River basin), Slovakia. Sex was determined based on externally visible morphological features or based on microscopic observation of the gonads. Ploidy level was determined by means of flow cytometry on fin clips taken from each specimen. Age was estimated based on the total number of annuli visible on vertebrae. All statistical models were performed in the R statistical environment. Results. Sex ratio varied within age classes, with 3+ fish primarily composed of females and, 4+ fish mostly triploid. Maximum back-calculated lengths for diploid females were obtained up to 3+, and for the 4+ age group for triploid. L–W relations for adult males and females also differed significantly, but did not vary between diploid and triploid females. There were differences in at specific body lengths for Cobitis with different ploidy level. Diploid males were characterised by short annual age and length increments during the first two years of life. Annual increments in diploid females were highest overall though their frequency decreased after the reaching the fourth year of life (3+). On the contrary, annual increments in triploid females were the lowest within all groups until their fourth year, thought their frequency in the oldest age group (4+). Conclusion. In our study, we first confirmed that yearly increments and maximal age of Cobitis individuals are affected by different ploidy. Contrary, the L–W relations of gutted diploid and triploid females did not differ and they were affected only by sex. We suggest that the intensity of growth is more affected by ploidy, while the L–W of Cobitis is determined by intensity of feeding and stage of gonad development at the local conditions during season. Therefore, in the future studies of Cobitis growth and condition parameters the ploidy level of individuals should also be considered.",

    "abstract": "Background. Gymnocypris firmispinatus Wu et Wu, 1988 is a small fish with the maximum total length of 242 mm, which occurs only in the Jinsha River and its tributaries (China), at altitudes above 2000 m. Nowadays, G. firmispinatus had been placed in a dangerous situation, due to hydropower station and excessive fishing. However, attempts to develop an effective population management strategy have been obstructed by lack of basic biological information, especially for age estimation. As we known, sectioned otoliths provide the most precise age estimates of many Schizothoracinae fishes, vertebrae and opercular bones were also used for age determination of some fish species. This work aimed to assess the suitability of three calcified structures (otolith, vertebra, and opercular bone) for age estimation of G. firmispinatus. Materials and methods. The annulus characteristics of otolith, vertebra, and opercular bone were described. Annual periodicity was verified by marginal increment ratio (MIR) analysis in otoliths and edge analysis in vertebrae and opercular bones. Otoliths, vertebrae, and opercular bones were examined to determine which structure produced the most precise and accurate age estimates in G. firmispinatus, mainly by scoring for readability on a five-point scale and calculating the index of the mean percentage error (IMPE). Results. Microscopically, otoliths and vertebrae showed a typical pattern of opaque-and translucent-zones, attributed to slow and fast growth periods. Annuli formed between March and May once a year in otoliths and vertebrae. Forty-four percent of the opercular bones were scored as unreadable. The value of IMPE between the two counts was lowest for otoliths (4.25%), followed by vertebrae (6.21%) and opercular bones (11.58%). The IMPE value of vertebra vs. otolith was 11.05%, while that of opercular bone vs. otolith was 23.03%. Vertebrae and otoliths matched closely only for the first 4 years of life, while opercular bones appeared to underestimate the age of G. firmispinatus. Conclusion. Annuli in the otoliths and vertebrae both formed once a year up to age 8, and otoliths would be the most precise structure for age determination in G. firmispinatus. Vertebrae and otoliths matched closely up to age 4, while opercular bones could not be used for age estimation for the species.",

    "abstract": "Background. The Nassau grouper, Epinephelus striatus (Bloch, 1792), is an endangered species that has been historically overexploited in numerous fisheries throughout its range in the Caribbean and tropical West Atlantic. Data relating fishery exploitation levels to stock abundance of the species are deficient, and protective regulations for the Nassau grouper are yet to be implemented in the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI). The goal of this study was to conduct a stock assessment and evaluate the exploitation status of the Nassau grouper in the TCI. Materials and methods. Calibrated length cohort analysis was applied to published fisheries data on Nassau grouper landings in the TCI. The total lengths of Nassau groupers among the catches of spearfishers, lobster trappers, and deep sea fishers on the island of South Caicos during 2006 and 2008 were used with estimates of growth, natural mortality, and total annual landings to derive exploitation benchmarks. Results. The TCI stock experienced low to moderate fishing mortality (0.28, 0.18) and exploitation rates (0.49, 0.38) during the period of the study (2006, 2008). However, 21.2%&#8211;64.4% of all landings were reproductively immature. Spearfishing appeared to contribute most to fishing mortality relative to the use of lobster traps or hydraulic reels along bank drop-offs. Conclusion. In comparison with available fisheries data for the wider Caribbean, the results reveal the TCI as one of the remaining sites, in addition to the Bahamas, with a substantial Nassau grouper stock. In light of increasing development and tourism in the TCI, continued monitoring is essential to maintain sustainable harvesting practices.",

Genetic traceability of seafood as well as population identification using molecular methods provide useful information about the fish origin and are important for protection of overfished populations, as well as for monitoring illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fisheries. The presently reported study focused on Indian mackerel, Rastrelliger kanagurta (Cuvier, 1816)&#8212;a pelagic species with a wide range of distribution&#8212;especially important for many tropical countries, such as India, Philippines, and Thailand. This paper is the first part of a larger project: &#8221;Development of a genetic-based system for identification of food products from fisheries and aquaculture introduced to the European Union customs area&#8221;. Materials and methods. Samples consisting of fin fragments of Indian mackerel were obtained from local markets in Thailand (MTH), Vietnam (SVN), Cambodia (SKH), and Madagascar (SMG) within 2012&#8211;2013. Two genes were analysed: nuclear rhodopsin gene (RH1) and mitochondrial D-loop (D-loop) region through RFLP analysis simulation and sequencing. Additionally, the samples from Cambodia and Madagascar were analysed with eight microsatellite loci (SSR). The data processing was aided by GenAlEx 6.5 and GeneClass2 software. Results. A comparison of the RH1 gene section revealed a total homology among the studied samples. A comparative analysis of D-loop sequences in the studied groups revealed intrapopulational diversity for MTH-, SKH-, SMG-, and SVN samples, at the level of 1, 1, 0.5, and 0.6 percentage points, respectively. Furthermore, the D-loop sequences identified a characteristic restriction site for SMG population. Based on the allele frequencies, we randomly assigned selected individuals to their original populations. GeneClass2 software correctly assigned only 16 out of 21 individuals to either the Cambodian or the Madagascar population, which jointly constituted 76% of all samples. We demonstrated, using AMOVA and GenAlEx 6.5, that the highest level of variability occurred among individuals within the respective populations, while the lowest interpopulation diversity was between the SMG and SKH populations. Conclusion. Our results may help the relevant authorities in the countries of the European Union to identify Indian mackerel and especially its products and trace them to the respective locality. Our findings may also be used for species-specific conservation measures hopefully undertaken by fisheries authorities of the countries where we took our samples.&#160; Results on other fish species, prepared in the frames of the same project, will be presented in other papers that will follow soon.&#160",

    "abstract": "Background. Red gurnard, Chelidonichthys cuculus (Linnaeus, 1758), is distributed in the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, and in the eastern Atlantic Ocean from Norway to Mauritania, although it is rarely found in the North Sea and on the Norwegian shelf. The aim of this work was to conduct a comprehensive study of red gurnard in the Adriatic Sea on selected aspects the population biology and some of its environmental implications. Materials and methods. The sampling covered the entire subdivision GSA17 (north-central Adriatic Sea) and it was based on several bottom trawl surveys of MEDITS and GRUND projects from 2000 through 2009. Biometric parameters, as well as the spatial- and depth distributions were analyzed. The parameters such as the length–weight relation, sex, gonad maturity stage, and the stomach content were determined on a subsample of 539 specimens collected seasonally (summer and autumn–winter) within 2007–2009. The data were processed statistically. Results. Chelidonichthys cuculus was mainly distributed in the central Adriatic. Juveniles showed a distribution in shallower waters while adults tended to migrate towards the Croatian coast at greater depths. The total length of the fish sampled ranged from 40 to 303 mm (TL). We assumed the length of 100 mm as a threshold separating juveniles from adults and the length range of 170–190 mm as the maturity size for females and males. Isometric- and allometric growth patterns were showed for the juveniles and the adults, respectively. The diet was based almost exclusively on crustaceans (IRI% > 98%) and it did not change upon reaching the sexual maturity. Chelidonichthys cuculus should be considered a specialist predator feeding mostly on necto-benthic lophogastrids (IRI% > 72%). Conclusion. This work constitutes an attempt to summarize some environmental and biology aspects of the red gurnard in Adriatic population: differences in depth distribution and growth were found between juveniles and adults but not in diet. Males and females showed differences in growth parameters. Extending the studied area and collecting data of red gurnard in the main areas of production should help in better understanding the biology and dynamics of this species.",

    "abstract": "Background. The pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbosus (Linnaeus, 1758), known also as pumpkinseed sunfish, is native to eastern and central North America. Its introduction to Europe has resulted in fast spreading of the species over the continent. In Poland, the pumpkinseed has found favourable conditions for living and reproduction in water bodies artificially heated by thermal power plants. The aim of this study was to determine the annual cycle of gonad development of the pumpkinseed population inhabiting the warm-water canal of the Dolna Odra power plant (NW Poland), which has not been studied before at this location. Materials and methods. The pumpkinseed individuals were caught in the heated-water discharge canal of the Dolna Odra power plant. The average water temperature in the canal was by 6–8ºC higher than that of the river. The analysis of the annual cycle of gonad development was performed in both sexes using histological methods. The fish were aged 3+ to 6+. A standard paraffin technique and Heidenhain's iron hematoxylin staining were used. Results. In the site surveyed, the spawning season for females lasted from the beginning of May through August, i.e., was longer than in the native range of this fish species. In one female caught in September, the ovaries contained oocytes in the stage of vitellogenesis. The oocytes in the stage of atresia were found rarely in the fish caught from April through June. Mature testes in males were found between late April and September, i.e., throughout the spawning period of the females. Few male anomalies of the sexual cycle were observed, e.g., in October, they were found to engage in another cycle of spermatogenesis and spermatozoa production. Moreover, the presence of large groups of degenerating cells in the seminal tubules was observed throughout the year, but was particularly evident between September and February. Conclusion. The results have confirmed the high colonisation abilities of the pumpkinseed. As a consequence of global warming, the studied canal with post-cooling water may become a starting point of expansion of this species to other bodies of water. Upon a considerable climate warming, this species could threaten the native species.",

The greater forkbeard, Phycis blennoides (Brünnich, 1768), is a gadiform species, which has economical value and its population is dwelling in a 60–800 m depth range throughout the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Along African north coast, there is a lack of information about the biology (age, growth, sex-ratio) of this species. This study provides the first data on population parameters of P. blennoides in Tunisia. Materials and methods. Specimens of Phycis blennoides were collected from the landings of the artisanal fisheries between September 2007 and June 2010. The length–weight relations were determined according to the allometric equation: W = aTLb. Growth parameters were estimated using the von Bertalanffy growth equation. Results. Length (TL)–Weight (W) relations were allometrically positive for the females (W = 22.10–4TL3.409), males (W = 13.10–4TL3.674), and both sexes (W = 19.10–4TL3.460), without significant differences between males and females. The relation between otolith weight and age showed a significant difference between males and females. The growth parameters were calculated as TL∞ = 57.17 cm, K = 0.193 · year–1, t0 = –1.578 · year for the females, and 44.74 cm, 0.313 · year–1, and –1.210 · year for the males, respectively. The females grew faster than the males which did not exceed 45 cm. The growth performance index Ф' calculated for the females (2.80 cm· year –1) and males (2.79 cm· year –1) yielded similar results.

    "abstract": "Background. Fish have photoperiod-dependent rhythms (circadian cycle of about 24 h), including the enzymatic secretion cycles, and this information has not been available for Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus (Linnaeus, 1758). The knowledge on the digestive enzymes in Nile tilapia may have practical implications in fish nutrition. The aim of the presently reported study was to determine the circadian cycle of digestive enzyme production of Nile tilapia, in fasting and feeding regimes, in hope to receive information that might improve feeding schedules of this fish in aquaculture. Materials and methods. In juvenile Nile tilapia the circadian cycle of concentrations of total soluble protein, protease, pepsin-like, trypsin, chymotrypsin, amylase, and lipase were determined. The baseline (fasting) and feeding conditions (ad libitum) were sampled and monitoring every hour for 24 h. Results. The basal peak of enzyme activity in the intestine occurred at 18:44 h for amylase, at 19:57 h for proteases, and 20:29 for trypsin. The minimal activity for most enzymes, appeared between 4:51 h (amylase) and 10:13 h (lipases). In the feeding treatment (ad libitum), stomach activity (pepsin-like) had maximal activity at 20:06 h and minimal activity 05:46 h. Intestinal amylase activity covered an extended period of low enzymatic activity beginning at the 05:46 h and ending at 12:59 h. The peak of digestive enzyme activity occurred within 18:44–20:29 h. In general, secretion of digestive enzymes was positively stimulated by food, for all enzymes assayed. Conclusion. Nile tilapia has a higher digestive enzyme activity at night than during the day. Knowledge of the circadian cycle of digestive enzymes, and modifications initiated by food, is useful to establish feeding times. If feeding schedules are adjusted to coincide with maximum natural peaks, feed efficiency will increase, which will be reflected in weight gain of the fish and provide more profitable yields for aquaculture.",

One of the species subjected to intensive exploitation is the yellowstripe scad, Selaroides leptolepis (Cuvier, 1833), commonly occurring in the coastal waters of Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Indonesia. This paper is the third part of a larger project: \"Development of a genetic-based system for identification of food products from fisheries and aquaculture introduced to the European Union customs area\". Materials and methods. Fin fragments of the yellowstripe scad, Selaroides leptolepis, were obtained in 2012 and 2013 from local markets in Vietnam (SVN), Cambodia (SKH), Malaysia (MMY), and Indonesia (MID). The analyses focused on the amplification and sequencing of a fragment of the nuclear rhodopsin gene which utilized as identification label. Subsequently, in the obtained SVN, SKH, MMY, and MID samples, 11 microsatellite regions (SRR) were analysed. Sequence analyses were performed using the BioEdit and BLAST software, while the analysis of the obtained SRR data was conducted using the GenAlEx software. Results. The analysis of the obtained loci variants divided the investigated populations into two genetically homogeneous groups: the Vietnamese–Indonesian group and the Malaysian–Cambodian group. The analysis of genetic diversity revealed statistically significant deviations from the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in the investigated populations and indicated the Vietnamese population as the most stable, while the Malaysian population as the least stable. Conclusion. The study provides information on the genetic diversity of the investigated populations and allows assignment of the captured fish to the geographical regions specified. Moreover, indicate that among analysed populations the safest populations were those caught in the local fisheries (continental shelf) of Vietnam and Cambodia due to their high mean genetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "On July 2018, one specimen of Ichthyococcus ovatus (Cocco, 1838) was caught in the Strait of Sicily during the International Bottom Trawl Survey in the Mediterranean (MEDITS). The adult I. ovatus measured 49 mm in total length and weighed 1.44 g. In this context, the presently reported study constitutes the first and deepest record of an adult of I. ovatus as well as the morphometric description of its sagittal otoliths. In addition, we provide an age estimation as well as an update of the geographical distribution of this bathypelagic species around the Mediterranean Sea. Based on the growth increments of sagittal otoliths, the estimated age was five years. Specifically, the otolith from the presently reported specimen of I. ovatus tended to be elliptic in shape related to aspect ratio and high rectangularity while circularity showed high complexity of otolith contour complexity. The absence of economic value of rarely reported species may underestimate their abundance. Therefore, more studies and research surveys would be necessary to fill the information gap on the biology of these deep-water species.",

Hence, this study is focused on the suckermouth armored catfish ( Pterygoplichthys spp.) under the hypothesis that, due to its detritivorous habits and demersal distribution, it may show evidence of the presence of microplastics in the sediments of a lake located in the Metropolitan Area of Villahermosa. A total of 21 organisms contained plastic microfibers throughout their digestive systems. These were treated with three solutions (hydrogen peroxide, potassium hydroxide, and sodium hypochlorite) to separate the microplastics. A total of 147 plastic particles of two categories were collected: microfibers (92%) and fragments (8%). Considering these results, as well as evidence in the literature, these species may constitute a global indicator of the incorporation into the trophic chain of microfibers deposited in the sediments of freshwater ecosystems.",

One specimen (31.6 mm standard length) of a tropical fish, Chromis weberi Fowler et Bean, 1928, representing the family Pomacentridae, was first recorded from Jeju Island, Korea, on 8 December 2021. It was characterized by black posterior margins of the preopercle and opercle and black upper and lower lobes of the caudal fin. A specimen of this species collected from Munseom was distinguished from Chromis xanthura (Bleeker, 1854) based on distinct differences in the tips of the upper and lower caudal fin lobes, which are not black in C. xanthura . In addition, C. weberi was easily distinguished from the other four species in the genus Chromis , by the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene sequence (345 bp), with genetic distances ranging from 0.130 to 0.252. This study documents the first record of C. weberi in temperate Korean waters, implying a poleward range expansion for this species. The Korean name ‘geom-eun-jeom-ggo-ri-ja-ri-dom’ has been proposed for C. weberi .",

The parasitological survey was carried at five different localities, including one marine site, two deltaic zones, and two localities in the middle Dnipro basin. The study provides comprehensive new data on parasites of the black-striped pipefish in Ukraine, with supporting data on its newly acquired freshwater range. A total of 21 parasite species (taxa) were revealed. Several parasite species were recorded for the first time on this host, i.e., Trichodinella epizootica (Raabe, 1950); Trypanosoma sp.; Bothriocephalus scorpii (Müller, 1776); Progrillotia dasyatidis Beveridge, Neifar et Euzet, 2004; Ophiotaenia europaea Odening, 1963; Cryptocotyle jejuna (Nicoll, 1907); Metorchis xanthosomus (Creplin, 1846); Tylodelphys clavata (von Nordmann, 1832); Holostephanus luehei Szidat, 1936; Contracaecum rudolphii Hartwich, 1964; Mothocya epimerica Costa in Hope, 1851; and Unionidae gen. sp. Formation of the species’ parasite component community depends entirely on environmental factors, with local parasite community features forming due to 1) presence of “marine” unicellular parasite species (ciliates) in marine localities (10‰–17‰ salinity) only, the community forming as a refraction of relative stenohalinity ( Trichodina rectuncinata Raabe, 1958), findings of “marine” ciliate species in freshwater locations representing examples of successful osmoconformation ( Trichodina partidisci Lom, 1962); or 2) presence of multicellular parasites in localities with abiotic/biotic conditions that allow completion of complex life cycles, such as those of trematodes (freshwater/marine mollusks as obligate first hosts) or cestodes (freshwater/marine invertebrates as intermediate hosts or marine/freshwater vertebrates as definitive hosts).",

Although this species is categorized as LC according to the IUCN Red List, it is rarely reported in fish inventories, with few specimens sampled. Moreover, data on the geographic distribution, population size, and other population details of M. notophthalmus are scarce and insufficient to predict possible threats and propose appropriate conservation measures and policies. A single specimen of Mastacembelus was collected using a fish trap on 20 February 2023, in a swamp, located in the middle course of the Lenggang River, Belitung Island, Indonesia. This specimen was identified as M. notophthalmus and this finding constitutes the southernmost record for this species, expanding its geographic range. In addition, the new record site is about 700 km south-east of the nearest locality in Peninsular Malaysia, about 250 km south-east of the nearest locality in Bangka Island, about 600 km south-east of the nearest locality in Sumatra, and about 500 km south-west from the nearest locality in Borneo. Better ecological and biological data concerning distribution, habitat, and stressors is crucial to reassess the conservation status of M. notophthalmus , and possible future conservation measures and policies. Therefore, we emphasize here the urgency for more comprehensive and accurate data to facilitate conservation assessments and management in Indonesia.",

Parasitological examination on the bigeye scad, Selar crumenophthalmus (Bloch, 1793), a potential aquaculture species, in the waters of the Sibuyan Sea, Philippines was done on fish specimens collected on 21 April 2021. Out of the 88 specimens, a total of 13 big eye scads were infected with cymothoid isopod Norileca indica (Milne Edwards, 1840), found in the branchial cavities of the fish, resulting in a prevalence of 14.77%. A total of 20 individual isopods (13 females and seven males) were recovered, with a mean intensity of 1.53. Based on the morphological characteristics and as confirmed by the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 ( CO1 ) sequence, one host fish was also infected with Ceratothoa carinata (Bianconi, 1869). This appears to be the first record of C. carinata from the Philippines. To fully understand the implications of cymothoid parasites on the bigeye scad, further studies are recommended to account for the impacts of seasonality, reproductive stages of the host fish, and effects of abiotic factors such as water movement and depth.",

Morphological variability related to sex, size, ecological characters, and geographical distribution are well documented in the literature. Apart from the only few data on the karyotype, chromosome banding patterns of this species have not been studied. Cytogenetic features are very useful tools in taxonomic descriptions of cyprinid species. The aim of this study was to describe and characterise the banding patterns of the gudgeon karyotype. Materials and methods. Cytogenetic examinations of 15 specimens of gudgeon from the upper part of the Odra River, Poland, were carried out. Different chromosome banding techniques: Giemsa staining, C-banding, silver nitrate, chromomycin A3 and DAPI staining were used. Results. The karyotype of gudgeon consisted of 2n = 50 chromosomes, and NF = 98 chromosome arms. Ag-NORs were located on one submeta-subtelocentric chromosome pair and the size polymorphism of NORs was detected. The chromosome sites with G-C rich DNA on one submeta-subtelocentric chromosome pair and heterochromatin block in the centromeric regions were found. Low accumulation of A-T pair rich regions were indicated by DAPI staining. Conclusion. The presently described new chromosomal features of Gobio gobio substantially enhance our knowledge on the taxonomy of this species at cytogenetic level. Jointly with data on morphological- and genetic variability they could be used to determine the phylogeny of the genus Gobio and related species.",

    "abstract": "Background. Dietary carbohydrate use is a priority in aquaculture because of its low cost and high availability, especially for herbivorous and omnivorous fish. Gelatinization is a process that improves carbohydrate use. However, excess dietary carbohydrate may cause metabolic stress and cellular changes as fish inherently use low carbohydrate. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of three sources of gelatinized carbohydrate (GC) on haematology and hepatic structure of Catla catla fingerlings. Materials and methods. Six isocaloric (17.1-17.5 kJ*g&#8211;1) semi-purified diets were prepared from rice, corn, or tapioca, each at 40 or 50% GC. Crude protein (CP) level was fixed at 35 and 25% for the low GC (40%) and high GC (50%) levels, respectively. Ninety Catla catla fingerlings were distributed in 6 treatments, each with three replicates, for a 60-day feeding trial. At termination, blood haemoglobin, RBC, WBC, and liver histology were studied. Results. Significant differences (P &lt; 0.01) in haemoglobin, RBC, and WBC were observed among the different carbohydrate-fed groups at 40% GC level. With increased dietary GC level, hepatocyte hypertrophy and vacuolation was intensified. Maximum hypertrophy was noticed in the fish fed tapioca at 50% GC, with extensive cytoplasmic vacuolation. No mortality was found in any group at any GC level. Conclusion. No mortality of Catla catla fingerlings was observed due to feeding of high GC levels from corn, rice, or tapioca. However, hepatocyte hypertrophy was observed. Long-term feeding beyond 60 days may cause adverse hepatic cellular changes, but needs further research.",

Bassan barbel is a fish species of commercial value. The aim of this study was to provide necessary biological features of bassan population from Kemer Reservoir. Materials and methods. Biological aspects of Bassan barbel were studied based on a total of 206 specimens collected from Kemer Reservoir, during the period December 2004&#8211;November 2005. The fish age was determined from scales. Length&#8211;weight relation and Fulton&#8217;s condition factor were used to evaluate fish condition. Results. The fish were from 1 to 6 year-old. Fork length (FL)&#8211;weight (W) relations were estimated as W = 0.011 &#183; FL2.980 for all specimens studied. The estimated growth parameters of the von Bertalanffy equation were: L&#8734; = 34.8 cm, W&#8734; = 549.58 g, K = 0.168 &#183; year-1 and t0 = -1.590 year for all specimens examined. Conclusion. The fish from Kemer Reservoir were characterized by an average growth rate and it was observed that the specimen grew fast during the first two years of life. The reason why bassan barbel had low condition values is probably because the environmental conditions in the reservoir were poor.",

    "abstract": "Background. Eel recruitment and catches have decreased drastically throughout Europe since the beginning of the 1960s (recruitment) and the 1980s (catches). Until the end of the 1990s, European eel, Anguilla anguilla, the highest priced fish, was the basis of the fishery in the Polish part of the Vistula Lagoon. The lagoon was stocked with glass eel from 1970 to 1994 with the aim of enhancing the stock of this species. Due to political and economical changes after 1989, national stocking funds were stopped. The aim of the presently reported study was to estimate the effectiveness of stocking glass eel in the Vistula Lagoon, with regard to the limited reliability of official landings data. Materials and methods. Eel catches in the Polish part of the Vistula Lagoon were reconstructed from landings statistics. Corrections of Polish landings were only based on grey literature request; political and socio-economical changes were explained in personal reviews with fishermen and fishery inspectors. The effectiveness of the stocking was estimated with the simplified method of calculating the accumulated biomass of fish from stocking with the assumed, constant coefficients F and M (fishery and natural mortality, respectively). The sensitivity analysis of F and M was estimated using the input of different parameters. Results. Changes in human history resulted in different biases in official landings statistics. The change in fishermen cooperative organisation and the martial law in Poland, during the period of 1981&ndash;1984, resulted in significant changes of the eel official landings. The reconstructed catches in this period (1980&ndash;1985) do not exceed 30% of the total exploitable biomass of the reserve for silver eel escapement, even under intensive exploitation. With assumed M and F, the exploitable stock biomass increased sharply to the peak value during the 10 years of stocking. Uncertainty concerning M for the first year of stocked eel results in a difference in the estimated biomass as high as 700 t. Conclusion. Under great uncertainties and lack of &ldquo;hard data&rdquo;, social science methodologies could help to estimate basic parameters for assessment models. Glass eel stocking at the Vistula Lagoon was effective both for the enhancement of the eel population and maintenance of an intensive eel fishery.",

Umbra krameri is subject to human pressure in both areas, but this pressure is more severe in Banat, where the agriculture is more intensive. The rare findings of the species in southern Romania are probably due to unsuitable searching methods often used in surveys, i.e., conducted only in large, but unsuitable aquatic habitats, and using classical ichthyological methods, such as electrofishing.",

    "abstract": "Background. Reproductive aspects of fishes are very useful in the development of management and conservation strategies of stocks. The information available on this subject, however, is very limited for tropical species, especially for those with low economic value, such as the barred grunt, Conodon nobilis (Linnaeus, 1758). This species is a common member of the family Haemulidae off the coasts of Brazil and it plays an important ecological role in coastal areas acting as a biological vector of organic matter. Thus, this study was intended to provide data on the reproductive parameters of C. nobilis to fill the gap in the existing knowledge. Materials and methods. Reproductive traits of C. nobilis were estimated from 410 fish collected in the coast of Alagoas, during fishery surveys carried out between December 2009 and June 2012. Length–weight relations (LWRs) for males and females were calculated from the observed length and weight by regression analysis. Data on the maturity status were used to estimate the size at first maturity for females, males, and pooled sexes. The fecundity was assessed by the volumetric method, and information on the reproductive period was retrieved from the gonadosomatic and the reproductive activity indices. Results. Sex ratio differed between sexes with mature females being more abundant than males. Although no evidence of sexual dimorphism was found in the length distribution, LWRs showed that males have a negative asymptotic growth and females present a positive asymptotic growth. The first sexual maturity for females, males, and pooled sexes was attained at 20.78, 20.57, and 20.72 cm of the total length (TL), respectively. Gonadosomatic and reproductive activity indices indicated that C. nobilis may be capable of spawning all year round with a more intense activity occurring between the rainy season in the region studied. The batch fecundity fluctuated between 1640 and 105 471 oocytes with a mean of 45 384 ± 16 737 eggs per female and was positively correlated to female size. Conclusion. Overall, C. nobilis showed an intermediate fecundity rate with reproductive activity throughout all year round. No evidence of sexual dimorphism in maturity and size distribution was found for the species. We hope that our findings may be helpful for fishery biologists in the design of effective management strategies for this ecologically important species.",

    "abstract": "Background. Guanabara Bay is a species-rich estuary in the South-western Atlantic and its shores are among the most densely populated urban areas in the world. The biology of clupeiform fishes from Guanabara Bay is currently poorly known. The most extensively exploited species is a small pelagic Atlantic anchoveta or toothless anchovy, Cetengraulis edentulus (Cuvier, 1829). The significant knowledge gap concerning the local fish biodiversity hinders the development of the fisheries management tools for this significantly impacted body of water. Materials and methods. The population biology of Cetengraulis edentulus was analyzed based on samples taken from Guanabara Bay twice a month by an otter-trawl. Five sites were selected, representing the upper, middle, and lower estuary. They were sampled between 2005 and 2007, and a second phase was conducted between 2013 and 2015 at two of the original sites to evaluate the middle and lower estuary.&nbsp; Furthermore, the relative abundance, spatial distribution, and the length&ndash;weight relation of the local Clupeiformes were also assessed. Results. A total of 6053 fish individuals collected represented 15 species and three families: Anchoa januaria; Anchoa lyolepis; Anchoa marinii; Anchoa tricolor; Brevoortia aurea; Cetengraulis edentulus; Chirocentrodon bleekerianus; Engraulis anchoita; Harengula clupeola; Odontognathus mucronatus; Opisthonema oglinum; Pellona harroweri; Sardinella brasiliensis. The most abundant was the family Engraulidae (7), followed by Clupeidae (4), and Pristigasteridae (3). While Cetengraulis edentulus was predominant during the first phase, a higher presence of Brevoortia aurea (Spix et Agassiz, 1829) characterized the second phase. Furthermore, C. edentulus was mainly restricted to the upper estuary, with no seasonal pattern. Estimated values for this species comprised growth (L&infin; = 19.3 cm, k = 0.54 yr&ndash;1), mortality (Z = 1.62 yr&ndash;1, M = 1.32 yr&ndash;1 (T = 26.6&deg;C), F = 0.3 yr&ndash;1, E = 0.19 yr&ndash;1), longevity (5.6 yr), survival (19.8% yr&ndash;1) and capture probability (L25 = 9.95 cm, L50 = 10.87 cm, L75 = 11.79 cm). Conclusion. The exploitation rates of Cetengraulis edentulus indicate that this species is underfished, although these results may be due to the fishing gear used herein, which may have underestimated fishing mortality rates. A high Clupeiformes richness was verified, corroborating other bay ichthyofauna components. In addition, the occurrence of monospecific peaks identified for other trophic groups was also observed for C. edentulus.",

    "abstract": "Background. Biomarker indices (protein, lipid, carbohydrate, mineral, enzymatic, and antioxidant enzymes) are used for the evaluation of health in fish blood. No studies conducted to date have provided standard values of various biomarkers in the blood plasma of Hucho hucho (Linnaeus, 1758). Therefore, we evaluated the physiological status and seasonal variation in metabolic profiles of this species. Significant seasonal changes were observed in all blood biomarkers, with the exception of red blood cells, hemoglobin, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin. Using these data, the physiological status and seasonal variation in the metabolic profiles of H. hucho were evaluated. Generally, the goal of this study was to characterize the variation in the blood biomarkers of huchen between different seasons. Materials and methods. Fish were raised in captivity to obtain a breeding group to repopulate submontane rivers. Blood samples were collected by puncture of the caudal vein in a vacutainer with Li-Heparin to determine the seasonal values of hematological, biochemical parameters, and oxidative stress. Blood was collected from a random sample of 10 huchen in all four seasons. Results. We found significant seasonal variation in several parameters: packed cell volume (PCV), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), total protein (TP), albumin (ALB), γ-globulins (GG), urea (UREA), creatinine (CRN), triglycerides (TG), cholesterol (CHOL), glucose (GLC), calcium (Ca2+), phosphorus (PO43–), iron (Fe3+), sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl aminotransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), α-Amylase (α-Amy), lipase (LIP), total bilirubin (TB), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Conclusion. This is the first study to provide standard values of proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and minerals and the enzyme profile in huchen in all seasons, which may be a benchmark for future investigation that would favor the bioconservation and increase the spread of huchen.",

    "abstract": "Background. Gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), is a primary lymphoid tissue and a part of the mucosal lymphoid system. Depending on the location, it present as aggregations of lymphoid cells. There are several reports of structural differences in the lymphoid tissue attached to the gastrointestinal tract between different species of fish, as well as different areas of the gastrointestinal tract of a fish in the cold and warm seasons. Identifying and expressing these differences in terms of tissue structure, in addition to diagnosing aquatic diseases, is also of particular importance for vaccination and disease control. Materials and methods. For this purpose, after collecting the desired samples routine histological procedure was performed and 4&ndash;6 &micro;m sections were obtained and were subsequently stained with hematoxylin-eosin, periodic acid&ndash;Schiff, and TUNEL immunohistochemical staining method. Results. The results showed that four main layers, i.e., tunica mucosa, tunica submucosa, tunica muscularis, and tunica serosa, were observed in the wall of the gut of Arabibarbus grypus (Heckel, 1843), as had been observed in other teleosts. GALT was seen in two different shapes in two areas. The former consisted of intra-epithelial scattered cells, which were arranged in the pillar structures and extended to the upper regions of the epithelium, but were more concentrated in the mid bases. The latter was found in lamina propria and submucosa regions. In the lamina propria, they had a strip-shaped arrangement and were placed in several rows below the base membrane, but in the submucosa, they were scattered and less densely packed. Micrometric results showed that not only the distribution of the lymphocytic cells in the intestine of both male and female specimens varied in different areas but also in some areas, the difference was statistically significant in both cold and warm seasons (P &lt; 0.05). TUNEL immunohistochemical staining revealed that the number of apoptotic cells in both sexes was more in the anterior part of the intestinal bulb and in the posterior part of the proper intestine in the warm season compared to the cold season. Conclusion.

It was an adult female measuring 990 mm total length and weighing 4500 g. The capture occurred off Ras Jebel located in north-eastern Tunisia at a depth of 120 m. The specimen is herein described including morphological measurements, color, and dental formula. Due to a lack of records, the real status of the species in the Mediterranean Sea remains questionable. Somniosus rostratus is rarely caught in this sea because it lives in deep bottoms poorly exploited by commercial vessels. However, recent captures of specimens and occurrence of nursery grounds suggest that a viable population of S. rostratus is probably established in this sea.",

    "abstract": "Information source preferences of small-scale fishers can play a role in decision-making processes and affect the sustainability of small-scale fisheries. In this respect, determining useful communication tools to eliminate the information gaps and lack of information of fishers is important for sustainable and effective fisheries management. The purpose of this study was the determination of the preferred source of information and priorities of the small-scale fishers who operate along the Aegean Sea coast of Turkey. Data were collected from a random sample of 278 small-scale Turkish fishers located along the Aegean coastline via face-to-face interviews. Information source preferences of fishers were determined by Repertory Grid Technique. In the analysis, obtaining information about fisheries focused on three criteria such as marine ecology, fisheries technology, and fisheries policies. The level of importance given by fishers for each criterion was determined. Fishers prefer to get information from other fishers, followed by fishery cooperatives, and their own experiences ( χ 2 (11, n = 278) = 1305.920, P &amp;lt; 0.001). Fishery cooperatives are the closest organizations to fishers. The use of cooperatives as a source of information can be interpreted as an element that can facilitate access to information when evaluated through the “availability” of behavioral economics. Fishery cooperatives, which stand out in fishers’ information source preferences, have the potential to be a valuable source of information in all aspects. The results of the research are thought to benefit researchers from non-governmental organizations, research institutes, and universities that carry out national and international projects with fishers.",

    "abstract": "The maraena whitefish, Coregonus maraena (Bloch, 1779), is often considered a suitable candidate for intensive aquaculture diversification in the EU. However, only a few such farms in Europe are in operation. Rearing this species in recirculating aquaculture systems is a recent innovation, and optimisation is necessary to standardise aspects of larviculture. This 30-day study investigated the effect of stocking densities of 25/L, 50/L, 100/L, and 200/L on the survival and growth of maraena whitefish larvae in a recirculating aquaculture system. The four groups of larvae (initial weight = 7.4 ± 0.1 mg; initial total length = 13.0 ± 0.1 mm) in three repetitions were reared in a recirculating system. Larvae were fed fresh live brine shrimp metanauplii every 3 h at a rate converted to larval stocking density. After the experiment, 10 larvae from each tank (30 of each density group) were weighed on a digital microbalance (ABJ 220-4M KERN, Germany, readout = 0.1 mg) and measured manually on images taken with Leica MZ16 A stereomicroscope and a digital colour camera with 5-megapixel resolution for Leica DFC420 Image Analysis. No significant differences in final body weight, total length, size heterogeneity, condition factor, or survival were found among treatments ( P &amp;gt; 0.05). The highest non-significant survival rate and growth parameters were observed in larvae reared at 25/L. On the contrary, it is possible to rear maraena whitefish larvae at high stocking density without any subsequent negative consequences for growth and survival. As no significant differences in any evaluated parameter were observed between groups of larvae at the highest and lowest stocking density, we conclude that it is possible to rear maraena whitefish larvae at high stocking density (and 200/L) without any subsequent negative consequences for growth and survival.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the use of anabolic steroids in the coloration and growth of fishes, especially ornamental ones, has attracted great interest. In the ornamental fish industry, it is economically advantageous to produce some species with high commercial value and higher demand, depending on size, color, and sex. Therefore, the most commonly used steroids in this study—i.e., 17α-MT and 17β-Es (E 2 )—were added to the diet of emperor red cichlid, Aulonocara nyassae Regan, 1922, which has not been previously hormone-treated and has high economic value amongst ornamental fishes. A 60-day study was conducted in a closed system, where the juveniles of the emperor red cichlid were acclimatized with the control/basal diet for 15 days. After which, 15 fish with a similar shade of color and about 5 months old were weighed individually (0.71 ± 0.01 g). All fish were placed into aquaria (30 L) in five different groups, in triplicate. Five different groups consisted of control (without hormone), 50 mg · kg –1 17α-MT, 100 mg · kg –1 17α-MT, 50 mg · kg –1 E 2 , and 100 mg · kg –1 E 2 . The fish were fed a diet twice a day (10:00 h, 17:00 h) for 60 days till satiation. During the entire trial period, a 12 h light–12 h dark photoperiod was maintained. Water temperature was measured daily and recorded. Growth parameters of experimental fish were calculated. The color measurement of fish skin ( L * , a * , b * values) from around the dorsal section was performed using a colorimeter (Konica Minolta CR 400). Significant differences were determined in the following parameters: weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR), feed conversion rate (FCR), survival rate (SR), condition factor (CF), and sex reversal. The fish group fed with 17α-MT displayed brighter coloration as compared to other groups. Color analysis (instrumental) in terms of L * , a * , and b * , values showed that the group fed with 17α-MT displayed brighter coloration compared to other groups ( P &amp;lt; 0.05). In terms of sex reversal, the fish in the 17α-MT groups exhibited 100% masculinization, whereas in E 2 supplemented fish groups (50 and 100 mg · kg –1 ), the feminization rates were 88.88% and 93.33%, respectively. In conclusion, both hormones were found to have positive and negative effects for this fish species, but the 17α-MT hormone was found to be more effective in reversing skin pigmentation, growth, and sexing, which is the main driver in the ornamental fish trade.",

Population dynamics studies and stock assessments of this species have focused on marine stocks, but not those from fresh water. In this study, the age and growth of A. maculatus were, therefore, investigated for the inland stock in Songkhla Lake, Thailand. A total of 213 individuals ranging between 35 and 238 mm TL were used. The length–weight relation indicated positive allometry of this population. Three hard parts (otolith, dorsal- and pectoral-fin spines) were used for aging. The marginal increment ratio confirmed that an annulus was deposited once a year in all three hard parts. All of the samples were aged between 0+ and 6+ years. Verification of age estimates from three readers showed that the otolith was the most suitable part for age estimation. Three growth models (von Bertalanffy, Gompertz, and logistic) were applied in the study. The von Bertalanffy model best described the growth of this fish in Songkhla Lake. The obtained asymptotic length was 290.87 mm TL and the relative growth rate parameter was 0.166 year –1 . Our results will be applied as inputs for fish stock assessment models. The obtained growth parameters also can serve as a reference for A. maculatus stocks elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "Background. The influx of foreign fishing vessels in the Arabian Sea, during the mid 1990&rsquo;s, has sparked some conflicts between artisanal and industrial fleets and raised concerns related to the resource management implications of fish stocks in the region.&nbsp; To address the lack of management data on the basic biology and stock assessment for targeted species, the Ministry of Fisheries Wealth in Oman initiated this study with a view to contributing towards the development of a management plan for the sustainable exploitation of the living resources of the sea in this region. Materials and methods. A database including biological parameters, length-frequency distributions and catches of king soldier bream, Argyrops spinifer(Forssk&aring;l, 1775), in Oman according to fleet (gear/technique) and region was compiled by monthly sampling in 2001 to 2002. In this study, length cohort&nbsp; and yield per recruit analyses were examined after simulating changes in fishing effort, in length at first capture and introducing a closed season for trawlers. Results. The results showed that: (i) the status of the stock is healthy, the average fishing mortality rate is moderate (0.1) and acts in general on the adult fraction of the stock. The fishing pattern differs, however, among fleets with some fleet components fishing, in part, for immature king soldier bream. (ii) An increase in total fishing effort would not lead to any long-term substantial increase of the catch (according the uncertainty of M value); however, the spawning stock biomass would decrease significantly.&nbsp; This measure affects negatively fleets that target the larger specimens. (iii) A moderate (&plusmn;20%) modification of minimum length limit in catches would not affect, substantially, the sustainable yield and the spawning stock biomass. (iv) Any regulation of trawler fishing by closed season (i.e. restricted trawler activities during some seasons) would not have a significant effect on the long-term yield. Conclusion. The current pattern of exploitation and fishing effort acting on the A. spinifer stock are optimal and no changes to global fishing or length at first capture are recommended. Also, with the actual fishing effort of trawlers, no closed season is suggested. However, fleet components whose catches include some juvenile fraction should adopt more selective gear as used by the hand line fishery in the Al-Wusta region.&nbsp",

    "abstract": "Background. The ichthyofauna of the Phu Quoc Island (Vietnam), situated in the Gulf of Thailand in the proximity of the coastline of Cambodia, has not been sufficiently studied. The isolation of the island combined with the knowledge on its geological history could yield conclusions on the evolutionary trends and speculations on how individual faunistic groups were formed. The aims of this study were to investigate the recent ichthyofauna of the Phu Quoc Island and to analyze the major evolutionary trends in its history by a comparison with recent faunas of the neighbouring mainland. Materials and methods. A total of about 4000 fishes representing 97 different teleostean species were collected at 46 sampled sites in the Phu Quoc Island from 6 December 2011 to 12 January 2012 by using different kinds of sampling equipment and collection methods as well as through exploring different habitats. Verification of field species identification and further morphological studies were based on 1290 specimens. Results. The list of fishes collected in inland waters of the Phu Quoc Island includes 97 species representing 13 orders and 39 families of teleostean species. The majority of these species correspond to the main diagnostic characters of known valid taxa. Two species (Kryptopterus bicirrhis and Brachygobius doriae) demonstrate some differences from their previously recorded diagnostic features, and two cypriniform species significantly differ from their valid congeners and should be described as new taxa. Conclusion. The major trends in the history of the ichthyofauna of Phu Quoc Island were the elimination of true freshwater stenobiontic species and the progressive development of euryhaline and eurytropic species which replaced former species in seasonally variable biotopes of relatively small tropic island. These eurytropic species are characterized by rather wide morphometric variability and do not demonstrate significant differences in their diagnostic characters comparing the island- and the mainland populations. Two species evolved into separate new taxa during the about 10 000 year time interval of the fauna&#8217; isolation are characterized by the only common feature&#8212;belonging to small short-lived species. As such they were more prone to faster evolutionary changes and the pace of the speciation process. The evolutionary process in fish of the Phu Quoc Island was characterized by weak founder effect and weakly pronounced disruptive selection&#8212;producing a low number of evolved species.",

    "abstract": "Background. Fish embryos and larvae are frequently subject to chronic- and damaging exposure of cyanotoxins released by live and decomposing cyanobacteria Whereas the majority of former studies dealt with the embryotoxicological effects of pure toxins and extracts, we focused on the evaluation of toxic effects of crude cyanobacterial biomass in our study. Materials and methods. Samples of crude cyanobacterial biomass—intended for embryotoxicological tests with eggs of Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes (strain Q2d-rR.YHNI)—were collected from natural bodies of water in the Czech Republic. Those samples consisted predominantly of: Microcystis aeruginosa, M. flos-aquae, Woronichinia naegeliana, Anabaena sigmoidea, and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae. In the preliminary optimization experiments, various numbers of fertilized medaka eggs (from 1 to 6 per one 10-mL well on a six well polypropylene plate) were hatched under standard conditions. Because of the highest hatching rates, 4 eggs per 10 mL well were selected as an optimal treatment. The embryotoxicological tests were performed according to the OECD 212 guideline in two concentrations (extracts of crude cyanobacterial biomass: 40 and 200 mg · L–1dry weight). Fertilized eggs in stage 6 to 8 (some 2–3 h after fertilization) were introduced into test wells, and hatching performance, duration of embryonic development as well as lethal and sublethal effects were monitored. Results. The hatching rates (treatment with 4 eggs per 10 mL well), achieved in the majority of experimental treatments with cyanobacterial biomass, were significantly different from the control group. Also hatching onset was considerably delayed due the presence of cyanobacterial biomass. The embryotoxicological impacts were more pronounced in higher concentrations of cyanobacterial biomass (200 mg · L–1) compared to lower concentrations (40 mg · L–1). Whilst deformities were not recorded in the control, their highest incidence amounted to 11.8% and 40.9% in 40 and 200 mg · L–1 of cyanobacterial biomass, respectively. Conclusion. Cyanotoxicity significantly affected examined parameters (hatching rates, duration of embryonic development, and morphological deformities occurrence) in medaka embryos. The study proved significant embryotoxic effects upon Japanese medaka at environmentally relevant levels of cyanobacteria commonly occurring in surface waters in Europe.",

    "abstract": "Background. Bushymouth catfish, Ancistrus dolichopterus Kner, 1854 has raised interest among ornamental fish keepers. Its natural populations are seriously threatened by fishing pressure. The reproduction of this species is difficult to perform (in captivity) and to observe because it occurs at night in shaded areas—most frequently in hiding spots. This study was intended to describe the eggs and their membranes of bushymouth catfish known to provide a parental care during egg development. A special focus of this study was directed towards the microstructure of membranes protecting life cells, and known to be impacted by the environmental conditions the egg morphometric analysis, as well as embryonic development. Materials and methods. The material for the study consisted of the eggs of 3 pairs of bushymouth catfish obtained as a result of their spawning in an aquarium culture. The fertilised eggs were incubated at a constant temperature of 24 ± 0.2°C in water of hardness 17°n, pH 6.5. The utrastructural details of egg membranes were viewed under scanning electron microscope (SEM). Also egg membrane resistance and egg diameters were determined. Images of eggs and newly hatched larvae were measured and analysed. Results. Average egg diameter was 2.98 mm and surface-to-volume ratio (S/V) was 2.01. Internal and external layers of egg membranes showed various structure peculiarities in the surface microstructure of studied eggs. We found that in comparison to other fish the thickness of egg membrane in the bushymouth catfish was high (26.05 µm). External layer had no pores leading to external radial zone (zona radiata externa), however, some specific honeycomb-like formations were visible. The resistance of the egg membrane was 54 ± 1.7 g and the egg mass was 0.017 ± 0.0001 g. The correlation between the resistance and the thickness of the egg membranes was not high, but the correlation between the mass and the resistance was significant. Conclusion. The presently reported study constitutes a contribution to the knowledge of the eggs and embryonic development of bushymouth catfish, and its biological sense, emphasizing the morphophysiological differences between this species—living under, specific, diversified ecological conditions. Such knowledge on early developmental stages may be prove helpful in the fish culturist's practice of this threatened and interesting species.",

The catch of the demersal German Baltic Sea trawl fleet between 2006 and 2009 was sampled by on-board observers to investigate the temporal and spatial patterns in catch composition. Results. There was a general increment in tow duration, landing weights, and discard weights from west to east. The most important species by catch weight was cod, for which highest catches were obtained during spring in ICES subdivision 25. Single hauls exceeded 25 h and caught more than 9900 kg of cod. On average, about 5%, 13%, and 20% and of the captured cod, flounder, and dab, respectively, were discarded. Conclusion. The presently reported study provides a benchmark for the German Baltic Fisheries that can be used for assessment of new management regulations and/or new marine policies. A comprehensive documentation of the spatial and temporal catch distribution of the German Baltic demersal trawl fleet, prior to the implementation of marine spatial planning measures such as marine protected areas or offshore wind farms, should help to evaluate the implications of intensifying spatial use on the fishing industry.",

    "abstract": "Background. In Turkey, the Mediterranean scaldfish, Arnoglossus laterna (Walbaum, 1792), is a discard fish species and it has a 'least concern' status on the IUCN Red List which indicates a low extinction risk. Although there are some studies investigating biology of this species, the knowledge of the mortality rates, spawning period, first maturity size, and age are not available for the study area. This paper, for the first time, provides some data on unknown population parameters for the east-central Aegean Sea. The aim of the presently reported study was to expand our knowledge on the biology of A. laterna. Materials and methods. Specimens of A. laterna were collected at monthly intervals by bottom trawl hauls between July 2004 and June 2007 from İzmir Bay (Turkey). The total length (L, cm), total weight (W, g), gonad weight (WG, g), and the sex were determined and the sagittal otolith pairs were removed for age reading. The length–weight relations were estimated by linear regression analysis on log-transformed data by equation: W = aLb. The growth was analysed by fitting the VBGF to size-at-age data using standard nonlinear optimization methods. Spawning period was established with monthly variations of the GSI values. Length at first maturity was estimating by the logit function. Results. A total of 2469 A. laterna individuals were sampled and the sex ratio was calculated as 1 ÷ 1.57 (F ÷ M). The length range of the sample was from 4.4 to 19.8 cm and the mean length was calculated as 9.4 ± 0.05 cm. For all samples, the length–weight relation was (W = 0.0074L3.04) and the growth type was determined as positive allometric. The age distribution of individuals varied from the ages of 1 to 8 years and the growth equation was determined as Lt = 20.62[1 – e–0.245(t + 1.071)]. The first maturity lengths were estimated as 11.88 cm for females and 11.41 cm for males. Conclusion. The presently reported study provides the age, growth, and reproduction parameters for A. laterna and the first information on the mortality rates, spawning period, first maturity size, and age parameters for the east-central Aegean Sea. These parameters can be useful for managers in the management and conservation of the stock.",

    "abstract": "The blackchin, Neoscopelus macrolepidotus Johnson, 1863 (known also as large-scaled lanternfish), originally discovered at Madeira, is a globally distributed benthopelagic fish species that inhabits depths between 300 and 1100 m in the tropical and subtropical regions. Despite the sampling site of the original description, the species seems to be very rare in the eastern Atlantic, particularly at northern latitudes. The worldwide distribution of the species seems to be restricted to latitudes lower than 45Âş either in the Southern and Northern Hemisphere. During the Porcupine 2016 bottom trawl survey a specimen of N. macrolepidotus was collected at a depth of 628 m and latitude 51ÂşN in the Porcupine Bank, situated in the north-eastern Atlantic, approximately 204 km off the west coast of Ireland. This is the first record of the species in the Porcupine Bank. It significantly extends the distribution range of N. macrolepidotus and represents the highest latitude reported for this species either in the Northern or Southern Hemisphere. This extended distribution may have been facilitated by the course of the Mediterranean Outflow Water, which on its way to the north-eastern Atlantic reaches the slope of the Bank at depths where N. macrolepidotus is usually distributed.",

    "abstract": "Background. There is a current global consensus that to achieve a sustainable use of fisheries resources, management of every organism subject to exploitation is required rather than only those targeted directly by the fisheries. Further understanding the feeding habits of the species in the ecosystem as well as the predator–prey relationships and their trophic levels is crucial. Batoids occupy an important ecological niche as benthic predators in estuaries and bays. There is no directed fishery for the blotched stingray, Urotrygon chilensis (Günther, 1872), but it is commonly caught incidentally by trawl and bottom gillnets fisheries subsequently diminishing its population. Recently, artisanal fisheries in Mexico have become focused on batoid species due to the depletion of shark catches, although there are few studies on its biology and ecology. Materials and methods. We analysed the trophic ecology of the blotched stingray in two main areas from the Mexican Central Pacific to understand the species' diet and detect possible differences throughout fishing areas using stomach content analysis. We analysed the overlap in diets between areas and the trophic level at each area. Results. We analysed 423 specimens and found 15 prey groups. Representatives of the two crustacean higher taxa—Cladocera and Peracarida were the most important food items in the north area, while the crustacean family Penaeidae was the most important in the south area, having no significant overlap between areas (Cλ = 0.33). The estimated trophic position for the blotched stingray was 3.51–3.56 in both areas, and according to the Levin's index, the range of the trophic niche breadth for the blotched stingray was 0.059 and 0.039, which indicates that it is a specialist predator. Conclusion. The blotched stingray is a specialist predator that can adapt to different prey depending on which organisms are present in the ecosystem. It is necessary to continue with these types of studies for the other species inhabiting the area, in addition to monitoring fisheries landings, fishing effort, and variations in biotic and abiotic factors in the area over a long period. However, this study outlines an approach for reaching the ultimate goal of sustainable exploitation of marine resources on an ecosystem level.",

    "abstract": "Background. The coral reefs and deep water ecosystems of Gulf of Mannar support diverse assemblages of marine fishes vulnerable to indiscriminate mechanized fishing. However, lack of comprehensive information on the fish diversity of these ecosystems is aggravated by the habitat complexity of the fishing grounds, inadequate faunistic surveys and insufficient taxonomic expertise. In view of this, the present paper aims to document rare fishes and supplement the existing species inventory from this region. Materials and methods. Sampling surveys included 23 hauls on-board commercial single-day otter trawlers operating bottom trawls at 15&ndash;100 m depths, and mid-water trawls at 100&ndash;153 m depths in the Gulf of Mannar. In addition, by-catch landings of commercial trawlers were surveyed at Tuticorin fishing harbour. Specimens were subjected to morphometric and meristic examination and deposited at the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, Kochi. Results. he presently reported survey of rare fishes revealed one elasmobranch, Hypogaleus hyugaensis (Miyosi, 1939). In addition, 12 species of teleosts belonging to four orders, 10 families, and 11 genera were identified as Uropterygius micropterus (Bleeker, 1852); Dendrochirus bellus (Jordan et Hubbs, 1925); Snyderina guentheri (Boulenger, 1889); Acropoma japonicum G&uuml;nther, 1859; Gymnocranius elongatus Senta, 1973; Pomacentrus similis Allen, 1991; Pristotis cyanostigma R&uuml;ppell, 1838; Leptojulis cyanopleura (Bleeker, 1853); Naso annulatus (Quoy et Gaimard, 1825); Naso thynnoides (Cuvier, 1829); Pseudalutarius nasicornis (Temminck et Schlegel, 1850); and Lagocephalus suezensis Clark et Gohar, 1953. The present paper provides descriptions of each species supplemented with meristic counts and morphometric measurements. An identification key to these species is provided. Conclusion. Hypogaleus hyugaensis, U. micropterus, D. bellus, P. cyanostigma, N. thynnoides, P. nasicornis, and L. suezensis represent the first records in Indian waters. Additionally, G. elongatus, P. similis, and N. annulatus represent the first records off the Indian mainland, and S. guentheri, A. japonicum, and L. cyanopleura represent the first records off the East coast of India. Among these, D. bellus, S. guentheri, and P. cyanostigma represent the first records outside their known zoogeographical ranges. Patchy zoogeographical distribution and extension of known geographical ranges are attributed to recurrence of vicariance events in the geological past.",

This species has a &#8216;critically endangered&#8217; status on the IUCN Red List. The objective of this study was to determine the age and growth rates of C. pestai, and to evaluate whether otolith morphometrics could be used as an age predictor. Materials and methods. Fish were collected from a small river entering Lake E&#287;irdir between January and December 2012. Fish samples were obtained from shallow parts of the river (30&#8211;40 cm depth) seasonally in a single station by using an electrofishing devise. Results. Annual growth increments were counted on the otoliths of 154 specimens, ranging from 6.2 to 26.8 cm total lengths. Estimated ages ranged from 0+ to 7+ years old. The von Bertalanffy growth curve was fitted to the age/total length data as follows: L&#8734; = 47.83 cm (TL), K = 0.081, t0 = &#8211;1.840, for females; L&#8734; = 41.25 cm (TL), K = 0.086, t0 = &#8211;1.99 for males; L&#8734; = 52.45 cm (TL), K = 0.067, t0 = &#8211;1.84 for all specimens. No significant differences in morphometric measures (length, width, and mass) were found between left and right otoliths (paired t-test, P &#62; 0.05). Otolith length and width showed significant linear relations with the total length while otolith mass represented by power model. Conclusion. This study provides the first information on age, growth and otolith morphometric parameters of C. pestai. In addition, otolith morphometric measurements could possibly be used in future as an age predictor for C. pestai.",

Prior to incorporation into diets, the meal was fermented with lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus) in order to reduce / eliminate the anti-nutritional factors, tanin and phytic acid present in it. Twelve experimental diets (D1 to D12) were formulated replacing the FM protein from a reference diet with copra meal protein at different levels (four sets of diets, of which each set of three diets contained 30, 40, and 50% replacement of FM protein by copra meal protein respectively). Diets D1 to D3 were not supplemented with any amino acid. Lysine was added to diets D4 to D6. Diets D7 to D9 were supplemented with methionine-cystine (together) and diets D10 to D12 contained lysine and methionine-cystine (together). Lysine and methionine-cystine (together) were added to the diets at 5.7% and 3.1% of dietary protein respectively. The groups of fish fed diets without any supplemental amino-acids had significantly lower percentage weight gain, SGR and high FCR than the groups of fish fed other experimental diets. The addition of lysine and methionine-cystine to the diet in which 50% of FM protein was replaced by copra protein (diet D12) significantly improved fish weight gain and FCR. The percentage live weight gain and SGR values differed significantly (P &lt; 0.01) from each other in the fish fed diets D10 to D12 which were supplemented with all three amino acids. The results of the present study suggest that rohu fingerlings can effectively utilise the supplemented amino acids and that copra meal protein can replace up to 50% of FM protein in the diets for rohu if the meal is properly fermented and supplemented with deficient amino acids.",

However, number of trophoplasmatic cells was sufficient to form the oocytes which could be spawned in the given season.

The main aim of this study was to define the effects of acute salinity- and water quality changes on the blood characteristics and the gill structure of the greenback flounder. Materials and methods. Juvenile greenback flounder (Rhombosolea tapirina) cultured in sea water (33&permil;) were transferred directly to salinities of 0, 3, 7, 15, and 40&permil;. Results. Fish responded similarly following transfer to 3, 7, and 15&permil;. In these salinities significant decreases in plasma osmolality occurred during the first four hours, after which effective osmoregulation began stabilising osmolality within 24 hours. Plasma sodium and magnesium concentrations mirrored plasma osmolality, while succinate dehydrogenase activity increased up to three-fold 24 hours after transfer. Fish failed to regulate plasma osmolality following direct transfer to fresh water (pH = 6.5; total hardness 20 mg &#1468; l-1). Plasma osmolality decreased rapidly for the first 10 hours post transfer at which time plasma osmolality temporarily increased before resuming its decline. Low water pH (6.2-6.5) was an important contributor to the mortality observed following transfer to fresh water. Conclusion. Results of this study confirm the greenback flounder to be very tolerant of direct transfer to low- or high salinity and are directly applicable to aquaculture of this species, in particular freshwater treatments against parasites, including trichodinids.",

Five semipurified diets containing 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50% carbohydrate (diets D1 to D5) were formulated and fed to triplicate groups of fish. All the diets were isonitrogenous (35% protein) and almost isocaloric. Fish performance in terms of average live weight gain (%), SGR (%/day) and FCR was best with 40% carbohydrate level. Significantly (P < 0.05) poor growth of fish also was noticed in the groups reared on diets with 30 and 35% levels of dietary carbohydrate, however, no significant difference in PER and ANPU (%) was obtained with diets D2 and D3. Although no significant difference in apparent protein digestibility was recorded up to 45% dietary carbohydrate level, lipid, ash, dry matter, and energy digestibilities were found to be significantly (P < 0.05) higher for the diets D2 and D3. These two dietary treatments also resulted in higher deposition of protein and lipid and lower moisture and ash contents in the fish muscle. Amylolytic and proteolytic enzyme activities also were estimated to be higher in the groups of fish fed 35% and 40% carbohydrate diets. The study indicated that a minimum level of 40% dietary carbohydrate is required (protein content being 35%) for optimum growth, feed conversion and nutrient utilisation in rohu, Labeo rohita, fingerlings.",

    "abstract": "Background. Ruffe, Gymnocephalus cernuus is a small fish inhabiting vast areas of Europe, Asia, and also North America. Its substantial geographical dispersal range in different climatic zones, in waters of different parameters indicates that this is a particularly plastic species. Recent implementation of new fish-processing machinery has increased dramatically the economical importance of ruffe, which is now treated as a gourmet food. In the wake of the increased interest in this fish we decided to study aspects of its developmental biology. Methods. Fertilised eggs and the developing embryos of ruffe were incubated under five different temperature regimes. They were monitored in two planes, horizontal and vertical, using a light microscope fitted with a digital camera and connected to a computer with a monitor and a VCR. The data collected were processed using MultiScan software.Materials and methods.Results. Perivitelline space in ruffe constitutes as much 65% of the egg volume. This facilitates movements of an embryo and enhances processes of gas exchange through mixing of perivitelline fluid. It finally contributes to the distribution of the hatching enzyme on the inner surface of the egg shell. Similarly as in the other percid fish, the lack of integration between the \"lipid raft\" and the embryonic disc, causes the fall of the disc on the lateral side of the vitelline sphere. This lateral position persists throughout all sequential stages of the embryogenesis. The diversified thermal regimes of the development affect the timing of the embryogenesis, as well as the condition, weight, and the size of newly-hatched ruffe larvae. The highest rate of specimens hatched in good condition-marked by the highest weight and body length-was observed at the optimal temperature range of 16-18oC. Newly-hatched larva is small (5 mm body length, 0.10 mm3 of yolk sac volume), active, and fully prepared for independent life in the water. Under the optimal temperature range, determined in the present study, the duration of embryonic development of ruffe (from fertilisation to hatching) was 2122 dh (accumulated degree-hours).Conclusion. The present study constitutes a contribution to the knowledge of the embryonic development of ruffe and its biological sense, emphasizing the morpho-physiological differences between this species-living under, specific, diversified ecological conditions-and other fish.",

    "abstract": "Background. Recent research showed a particularly pronounced genetic diversity for the Atlantic herring, Clupea harengus, living in the transition zone from the Baltic Sea to the North Sea. Conserving genetic diversity is of high priority in fishery management. This requires, firstly, that we recognize life histories, not only of the major spawning components, but also of the smaller ones, and secondly, that we improve our knowledge on how genetic diversity is maintained also on smaller geographical scale. Materials and methods. Prevalence of the widely used tag parasite Anisakis sp. was applied to investigate whether the various spawning components, living in the Baltic Sea-North Sea transition zone, display any common features with respect to feeding migration patterns. Results. It is strongly suggested that spawning components in the transition zone migrate to feeding areas in Skagerrak or the North Sea. This implies that herring utilizing spawning grounds in the Limfjord and inner Danish waters engage in a northward feeding migration like their nearby neighbour, the R&uuml;gen Herring, instead of feeding locally or in the Baltic Sea. Conclusion. Firstly, these results support the validity of the present division of management areas, where the Western Baltic Sea is managed under ICES Division IIIa (Kattegat and Skagerrak), even when the newly discovered population complexity is considered. Secondly, it contributes to the debate on how population complexes can be sustained despite temporary mixing, where it support the idea that genetic divergence in herring population complexes can arise from colonization of unused spawning grounds and be sustained despite extensive temporal mixing by natal homing.",

The aim of the presently reported study was to investigate reproductive parameters of the tubenose goby population from the Vistula River, as one of the biological traits that might facilitate its successful invasion. Materials and methods. Fish were sampled monthly from March through October and the following parameters were determined: sex ratio, gonadosomatic index (GSI), fecundity (absolute, relative, batch), oocyte size distribution, and body condition (Fulton&rsquo;s and Clark&rsquo;s indices). Results. GSI varied considerably between sexes and between individual spring months. The increase of GSI and oocyte diameter distributions indicated that spawning of P. semilunaris in the Vistula River lasted from the end of April till July. Multimodal oocytes distribution during reproductive season suggested at least two or three spawning events. The absolute fecundity ranged from 504 to 1250. The mean batch fecundity (&plusmn; standard deviation) was 338.35 &plusmn; 89.22. Both, the absolute and batch fecundity, but not the mean oocyte diameter in the batch, were related to the female standard length. The highest values of Fulton condition index were observed in the reproductive period compared to pre- and post-spawning, while Clark condition index showed a different pattern. Conclusion. The western tubenose goby displays reproductive strategy typical for other fish invaders that successfully naturalized in central Europe.",

As a consequence, metacercariae, especially small ones, are routinely overlooked, despite their serious epidemiological and epizootic potential. Therefore, the existing distribution data are patchy and the biogeographic knowledge is far from being complete. We were not able to trace any papers focusing on the depth of penetration of digenean metacercariae in fish tissues. In this study, we were trying to determine the spatial distribution of metacercariae in the muscles of two freshwater cyprinid fishes, the roach, Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758) and the bleak, Alburnus alburnus (Linnaeus, 1758). The study area was Lake D&#261;bie, a large and shallow lake of the Oder (Odra) River estuary, Poland. We studied a total of 40 roach (12.0&ndash;21.5 cm TL 30&ndash;120 g TW) and 15 bleak (10.5&ndash;14.5 cm TL). The fishes were filleted and each filet was divided into four parts. All muscle tissues were examined for the presence of metacercariae using a trichinoscope and a dissecting microscope. Dorsal muscles of an additional 12 roach were sliced and the depth of metacercariae penetration was assessed. The dominant muscle parasite was Paracoenogonimus ovatus. Metacercariae of other species (Posthodiplostomum cuticula and Apophallus muehlingi) were only sporadically found in muscles roach and bleak (with a preference to the shin). The prevalence of Paracoenogonimus ovatus in roach ranged from 66.7% to 100% and the highest infection intensity was 1973 metacercariae in one fish.

    "abstract": "Background. The Gulf of Gab&egrave;s supports an important fishery which is characterized by a great diversity of fish species. Despite this importance, there has been no attempt to examine the whole larval fish assemblage in this area. The aim of this study was to investigate the larval fish communities during summer and winter seasons in the Gulf of Gab&egrave;s. Materials and methods. Two multidisciplinary surveys were carried out aboard the R/V Hannibal in 2009. A total of 80 and 70 stations were sampled during winter and summer surveys, respectively. Stations were arranged in a regular sampling grid of 10 &times; 10 nautical miles. Ichthyoplankton was sampled by oblique tows with a Bongo net of 60 cm mouth diameter, fitted with 335 &micro;m mesh nets. Zooplankton dry weight was obtained by drying aliquots of the zooplankton sample in an oven at 60&ordm;C, for 72 hours. Results. In summer 34 taxa representing 24 families, were collected, whereas in winter 35 taxa, representing 16 families, were collected. Larval fish communities were dominated by small pelagic species: sardinella and anchovy in summer and sardine in winter. The results also highlight the Gulf of Gab&egrave;s as an important spawning ground for many large and medium pelagic fishes, both highly migratory (Thunnus thynnus) and resident species (Auxis rochei, Euthynnus alletteratus). The summer/winter differences observed in species composition and abundance of the larval fish communities reflected the seasonality in fish species spawning in the Mediterranean Sea, likely influenced by the highly contrasting environmental conditions between seasons. Thus, the seasonal changes in the hydrographic conditions of the Gulf of Gab&egrave;s result in different scenarios that provide suitable spawning environments for a variety of fishes, allowing them to share the Gulf as spawning habitat. Conclusion. The Gulf of Gab&egrave;s is an important fish spawning area for demersal, small pelagic, medium pelagic, and large pelagic (tunas). Larval species composition differed considerably between summer and winter surveys.",

These fish species have a global economic value because of the high quality of their flesh and caviar. This study provides new data on the age, growth, and reproduction parameters of commercially exploited grey mullets from the Köyceğiz Lagoon, Turkey, namely golden grey mullet, Chelon auratus (Risso, 1810), leaping mullet, Chelon saliens (Risso, 1810), thicklip grey mullet, Chelon labrosus (Risso, 1827), and flathead grey mullet, and Mugil cephalus Linnaeus, 1758. The obtained results are intended for fisheries management of golden mullets in the area. Materials and methods. A total of 1195 fish specimens were collected from the Köyceğiz Lagoon (south-western Anatolia). The mullets were caught monthly, between January 2017 and December 2017, using fish barrier, trammel net, beach seine, and cast-net. The fish age was determined from sagittal otoliths. Growth parameters were determined by applying the von Bertalanffy growth function. Reproduction period, mortality and exploitation, relative yield per recruit (Y′/R), and biomass per recruit (B′/R) were determined. Results. The most frequent mullet age groups were 3+ and 4+ (for M. cephalus and C. labrosus) and 4+ (for C. auratus and C. saliens). The following von Bertalanffy's growth models were calculated: Lt = 58.78(1 – e–0.163(t + 0.0195)) for C. auratus, Lt = 59.99(11 – e–0.169(t + 0.0132)) for M. cephalus, Lt = 49.77(111 – e–0.193(t + 0.0293)) for C. labrosus, and Lt = 46.41(111 – e–0.232(t + 0.0283)) for C. saliens. The growth performance index (Ø′) for C. auratus, M. cephalus, C. labrosus, and C. saliens was calculated as 2.750, 2.772, 2.679, and 2.698, respectively. The reproduction periods of C. auratus, M. cephalus, C. labrosus, and C. saliens were found as October–January, June–September, December–March, and April–July, respectively. The exploitation rate E was determined for C. auratus, M. cephalus, C. labrosus, and C. saliens as 0.68, 0.80, 0.66, and 0.62 year–1, respectively. Conclusion.

Sand steenbras, Lithognathus mormyrus (Linnaeus, 1758), has high commercial value and constitute an important catch for the coastal and lagoon fisheries in the Mediterranean. The information about the biology of this species in the lagoons of Turkey is very limited. This study provides updated data about age, growth, length&ndash;weight relation, and reproduction period for sand steenbras. Materials and methods. A total of 319 samples were caught from the K&ouml;yce&#287;iz Lagoon, Turkey, in monthly intervals, from January to December 2017, using a fish barrier, trammel net, beach seine, and cast-net. The fish age was determined from sagittal otoliths. Growth parameters were investigated by applying the von Bertalanffy growth function. Results. The total length of females ranged from 12.5 to 24.1 cm, total length of males ranged from 11.7 to 23.4 cm, total length of intersexuals ranged from 15.5 to 22.3 cm, total length of immature ranged from 2.5 to 12.4 cm, and total length of all individuals ranged from 2.5 to 24.1 cm. The female &divide; male ratio was estimated at 1 &divide; 0.79. The age of the sand steenbras individuals ranged from 0 to 5 years for all individuals. The growth parameters of the von Bertalanffy equation were: L&infin; = 30.2 cm, K = 0.234 year&ndash;1, and t0 = &ndash;1.30 year for females, L&infin; = 29.7 cm, K = 0.238 year&ndash;1, and t0 = &ndash;1.28 year for males and L&infin; = 28.6 cm, K = 0.284 year&ndash;1, and t0 = &ndash;0.86 year for all individuals.

    "abstract": "Background. Automated processing of the fish caught on board a ship can potentially lead to a quality control breach. Specimens visibly infected with parasites are processed, frozen, and directed to the market. On the other hand, the removal of the body elements of taxonomic importance (e.g., fins, head, skin) opens gates to variously motivated seafood frauds. We had been alerted by local veterinary authorities about a fish consignment from the Falklands with a substantial volume of muscles with black contents. Materials and methods. The material for the presently reported study were decapitated, finless, and gutted fish delivered to our lab by the County Veterinarian of Szczecin (Purchased by a local importer from a Spanish fish wholesaler). The fish were labeled as \"Pseudophycis bachus (Forster, 1801)\", and allegedly came from the Falklands. After thawing, the fish muscles were dissected, focusing on the distinctly black areas, examined following methods commonly used in parasitology, and observed under a dissecting and a compound microscope. Samples were collected also for molecular studies aiming to disclose the fish taxonomic identity. DNA barcoding gene (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, COX1) was used to perform the genetic characterization for the collected fish specimens. The degree of similarity between the new records (MT318699 and MT318700) and the other records of Moridae species in the GenBank was assessed by building COX1 gene phylogeny. Results. The muscles contained large galls filled with black fluid. The fluid stained the adjacent muscles. Inside each gall, we found a single female of Sarcotaces sp., several \"dwarf\" males, eggs, and newly hatched nauplius stages. Using the molecular methods, the fish were identified as Mora moro (Risso, 1810). Conclusion. A preliminary veterinary inspection of the catch on board of fishing vessels may help to avoid huge financial losses when a parasitized fish consignment is rejected by veterinary authorities on land. It is evident that the European regulation regarding fish parasites requires an urgent revision. Mora moro does not occur off the Falklands as declared by the wholesaler. This seafood fraud was probably motivated by the urge to conceal a catch from European waters and thus avoid exceeding national fishing quotas. Species of the genus Sarcotaces require a revision backed by molecular methods.",

The decline of the populations of the three Critically Endangered species Squatina aculeata Cuvier, 1829, Squatina oculata Bonaparte, 1840, and Squatina squatina (Linnaeus, 1758) in the Mediterranean basin is mainly attributed to overexploitation by demersal fisheries, in particular bottom trawls, but also artisanal and recreational. The survey of their occurrence in the basin in parallel with the collection of biological information are essential in order to develop or improve conservation strategies. For that reason, the presently reported study aimed to enrich knowledge on today's distribution and biology of one of the above-mentioned endangered species, S. aculeata. Materials and methods. Information on the incidental capture of twenty specimens of S. aculeata in various Mediterranean regions was provided between 2011 and 2020 by professional fishermen and citizen scientists. Thirteen specimens were identified through examination of photos taken directly on board, or at the fish market while seven specimens were deposited at scientific collections and studied in the laboratory. Sex, total length, and total weight were determined, whenever possible. The TW–TL relation was calculated and the stomach content of one specimen was examined. Results. The findings document the presence of this rare and endangered angelshark in the deep waters of a wide area of the Mediterranean covering six Geographical Subareas (GSAs) of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), from the west to the central and eastern sectors of the basin. The total length in 17 individuals ranged from 54 cm to 190 cm, the total weight in 12 individuals from 2100 g to 49 000 g. Fifteen specimens were caught by bottom trawlers, four by trammel nets, one with longline. Conclusion. The reported recent findings document the occurrence of S. aculeata in various Mediterranean areas, some of which lacked records for many years. A continuous survey on the occurrence of this endangered species is recommended in order to assess the actual status of its population, but also of huge importance is the improvement of fishermen education and awareness aimed at the protection of the species as well as the inflexible application of international recommendations and regulations both for the professional and non-professional or recreational fishery.",

The difficulties associated with measuring many grenadier species, due to the fragility of their tails, are discussed.

    "abstract": "Background. The aquaculture industry is driven by the need to develop novel interspecific hybrids with improved culture characteristics, however currently no molecular markers are available for the validation of F1 hybrids in the case of groupers. The presently reported study was directed toward the development of molecular markers for F1 hybrids obtained by artificial spawning of eggs derived from orange-spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides (Hamilton, 1822), with sperm from giant grouper, E. lanceolatus (Bloch, 1790). Materials and methods. DNA was extracted and purified from the fin clip of a single F1 hybrid of E. coioides &#215; E. lanceolatus. Small insert shotgun genomics libraries were constructed, 40 positive transformants were sequenced, and the sequences deposited at the GenBank. Thirty locus-specific primer pairs were designed and tested across 64 F1 hybrid specimens as well as DNA samples extracted from coral grouper, Epinephelus corallicola (Valenciennes, 1828), and brown-marbled grouper, E. fuscoguttatus (Forssk&#229;l, 1775). Results. A panel of thirty molecular markers was developed to verify parentage, of these eleven and six of the markers were inherited from the sire and dam respectively. Two markers were specific to the F1 hybrid and none of the markers could be assigned to the closely related groupers E. corallicola and E. fuscoguttatus. Conclusion. The markers developed can be applied to assign parentage and determine the degree of introgression in interspecific grouper hybrids developed from E. coioides and E. lanceolatus. The methods developed in this study can be extended to characterize Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) and to identify interspecific F1 hybrids in the wild.",

They are part of an &#8220;Area Natural Protegida&#8221; and &#8220;Area Prioritaria Marina&#8221;; however, studies on the composition and diversity of their marine floral and faunal communities are limited. To provide information vital for management and conservation of these islands, a check-list of the ichthyofauna was compiled based on original data and the data extracted from other sources. Materials and methods. Field methodology involved direct collecting of the specimens using a gill net&#160; or a charalera net and/or visual censuses. Records of fish present near the islands were either directly solicited from museum curators of national and international scientific collections or obtained by using online database collections. Additionally, an exhaustive literature search for fish records was carried out, including scientific articles, books, and theses. Finally, the preferential habitat and zoogeographic affinity of fishes were analyzed. Results. The data yielded 298 species representing 201 genera and assigned to 86 families, 36 orders, and two fish classes. The most numerous families in terms of the species number were Serranidae (23 species), Gobiidae (15 species), and Carangidae (14 species). The most numerous genera were Lutjanus and Halichoeres, with eight and six species, respectively. On average, there were 3.5 species per family. The fish community was dominated by tropical eurythermal species with wide distribution in the Eastern Pacific. An important component of endemic Cortez Province species was found, represented by 24 species from the families Chaenopsidae, Gobiidae, Labrisomidae, Tripterygiidae, Gobiesocidae, Dactyloscopidae, Kyphosidae, Opistognathidae, and Ophidiidae. Conclusion. The fish richness of the San Jose and San Francisquito Islands and El Pardito Islet represents 32% of the ichthyofauna recorded for the Gulf of California and includes 24 endemic species.",

    "abstract": "Background. The Lacandon mojarra, Eugerres castroaguirrei González-Acosta et Rodiles-Hernández, 2013, was described from the Grijalva–Usumacinta River basin (Mexico). According to the diagnosis E. castroaguirrei differs from the only other freshwater Gerreidae, the Mexican mojarra, Eugerres mexicanus (Steindachner, 1863) by the combination of certain morphological characters. However, a comparison of materials obtained in the Usumacinta River, besides of type materials and other preserved specimens, yielded contradictory results. Therefore, the objective of this paper was to clearly determine if E. mexicanus and E. castroaguirrei are subjective synonyms applying morphological and molecular analyses. Materials and methods. A total of 44 specimens were included in this study including the specimens collected specifically for this study, the type and non-type materials of Eugerres castroaguirrei from Colección de Peces de El Colegio de la Frontera Sur, Unidad San Cristóbal, Chiapas, México, and the types of Eugerres mexicanus, belonging to the Museum of Natural History, Wien, Austria. The morphological comparison also included data from the 42 specimens of E. castroaguirrei reported in the new species description. Biometric data were analysed as body proportions. We used Friedman's test to compare our biological materials with those used in the new species description. Molecular genetics comparisons on both putative freshwater gerreid species were made based on three mitochondrial gene fragments: 12SrRNA, 16SrRNA, and Cytochrome Oxidase subunit I (COI), and the nuclear gene: Recombination-Activating protein 1 (RAG1). Results. Neither the non-parametric Friedman's test nor the Nemenyi's procedure showed differences among individuals for both putative species in multiple pair-wise comparisons of body proportions. Moreover, the genetic divergence from all genes indicated that all individuals exhibited almost identical sequences, with inter-specific pair-wise genetic distances that ranged from 0.00% to 0.100% in all of the fragments. Conclusion. Our morphological and molecular genetics analyses demonstrated that E. mexicanus and E. castroaguirrei are subjective synonyms, therefore, Eugerres mexicanus (Steindachner, 1863) must be considered a valid species name, and Eugerres castroaguirrei González-Acosta et Rodiles-Hernández, 2013 a junior synonym.",

    "abstract": "Background. The life-history traits of non-native species are believed to change in a predictable manner in relation to time since introduction, with populations in the early stages of establishment predicted to invest more energy into reproduction than long-established populations, mainly due to lower intraspecific competition for resources. In Europe, the range of non-native pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbosus (Linnaeus, 1758), continues to increase. Despite this, the majority of hitherto conducted studies have investigated long-established populations only, very few focusing on newly established populations (<10 years old) or comparisons of life-history traits of new and older populations. Materials and methods. In this study, we compared the fecundity, condition, and population structure of a new and a long-established pumpkinseed population (two- and 14-years after introduction, respectively) in two small central European lakes in order to identify any differences in life-history traits. Results. We confirmed that the established population displayed lower fecundity and poorer overall condition than the new population. Unexpectedly, there was no significant difference in size-at-maturity. Conclusion. While this study confirmed that life-history traits of introduced species appear to change with time since introduction, it also emphasises the possible effect of other factors such as temperature, size of body of water, and relative predator pressure in shaping such traits.",

We used histology-based reproductive analyses to estimate size at maturity, per capita egg production, and the number and biomass of immature individuals in the catch for three common coral reef fishes in Fiji market surveys during 2010–2019. We studied Lutjanus gibbus (Forsskål, 1775), Parupeneus indicus (Shaw, 1803), and Chlorurus microrhinos (Bleeker, 1854), which represent three families: Lutjanidae, Mullidae, and Scaridae, respectively. Fork length comprising 50% mature individuals for females of L. gibbus was 22.7 cm, that of P. indicus was 25.9 cm, attaining 38.0 cm for C. microrhinos . Females were rare or absent in the largest size classes of all three species. Immature fish represented up to 50% by number and 41% by biomass of the catch in market surveys, with P. indicus having the greatest immature number (8%‒50%) and biomass (6%‒41%), followed by C. microrhinos (20%‒30% by count, 11%‒18% by biomass) and L. gibbus (9%‒28% by count, 5%‒14% by biomass). Individuals ≤ 30 cm for L. gibbus and P. indicus and ≤ 45 cm for C. microrhinos were responsible for ≥ 90% of egg production per spawning. Skewed size-specific sex ratios suggested that exploitation of the largest size classes had minimal effect on overall egg production. Decreased catches of immature fishes would increase the reproductive population sizes for these species.",

Native brown trout, Salmo cf. trutta Linnaeus, 1758, and Macedonian trout, Salmo macedonicus (Karaman, 1924), reveal remarkable diversity assessed using the mtDNA molecular markers, with the eight exclusive and several more widely spread haplotypes found in them. Four alien trout species and strains and one strain of Macedonian trout were introduced into the home areas of the native wild trout stocks in Serbia. In addition to them, wild trout stocks were also affected by farmed rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792), and brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis (Mitchill, 1815), that regularly escape to streams, and from Ohrid trout, Salmo letnica (Karaman, 1924), and Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (Linnaeus, 1758), stocked into streams and reservoirs. Risk of invasiveness that wild trout stocks are exposed to and their restoration were driving forces for this study. Materials and methods. Trout specimens from the Jerma River sampled in 2013 were additionally analysed for their mtDNA haplotype. The invasiveness potential of eleven alien trout species and strains introduced by stocking into wild brown- and Macedonian trout stocks in Serbia were assessed with the Fish Invasiveness Screening Kit (FISK). Results. Five of introduced trout species and strains were classified as having a high risk (sensu lato) and two of them as having a high risk (sensu stricto) of being (or becoming) invasive. Conclusion. Progressively rising and insufficiently controlled fishing and management with stocking of non-indigenous trout in wild brown trout stocks are the main current threats to the original diversity. Alien brown trout strains cross breed with native brown trout and incorporate into their stocks. Currently, feral rainbow-, brook-, and Ohrid trout reveal great invasive potential by naturalization in waters heavily stocked with them. The fisheries measures aiming to control and/or to eradicate alien strains of brown trout involve the restriction of stocking, landing of trout suspected as of alien strain or species, as well as the stringent control of stocking material used for the restorative stocking. They are mandatory, regarding the conservational dependence of wild brown trout stocks.",

Eleven species were studied, namely: Atrina pectinata (Linnaeus, 1767), Atrina inflata (Dillwyn, 1817), Atrina vexillum (Born, 1778), Atrina seminuda (Lamarck, 1819), Atrina rigida ([Lightfoot], 1786), Pinna bicolor Gmelin, 1791, Pinna atropurpurea Sowerby, 1825, Pinna deltodes Menke, 1843, Pinna muricata Linnaeus, 1758, Pinna incurva Gmelin, 1791, and Pinna nobilis Linnaeus, 1758. The species were identified based on the nine characteristics of the valve for the genus Pinna and eight for the genus Atrina . These characteristics were then correlated with their adductor muscles’ morphology. Analysis of variance revealed that the three most dominant species investigated under genus Atrina , namely Atrina pectinata , Atrina inflata , and Atrina vexillum , were found to be significantly different in the eight characters of the valve ( P &amp;lt; 0.05). Moreover, three representative Pinna species, Pinna bicolor , Pinna atropurpurea , and Pinna deltodes , were significantly ( P &amp;lt; 0.05) different based on shell width, dorsal posterior shell margin, sulcus width, and dorsal posterior margin to dorsal nacreous margin. The observed high correlation ( P &amp;lt; 0.05) between adductor muscle properties and different shell length characteristics for five dominant species can be used as a predictor of growth and suggests that the increase in the size of adductor muscle correlates to the increase in the size of the mentioned shell characteristics. No previous study of this kind was conducted in the Philippines. This work provides relevant information for related biological research on other pen shell species and for the management of pen shell resources in northern Iloilo and, possibly, other regions in the world.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the Yeosu Coast, a critical ecological and economic zone on the Korean Peninsula. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of fish data obtained from daily set nets for the period of 2008–2022 (excluding 2017) to investigate variations in fish composition and community structure over a 15-year period. The catches were characterized by a prevalence of warm-water fish species, reflecting the temperate and subtropical character of the Yeosu Coast. The total catch during the study period was 3210.8 tonnes, with 2010 and 2016 registering the highest and lowest catches, respectively. Our analysis identified sea surface temperature as a primary factor correlated with these changes in species composition. The two dominant species, Scomberomorus niphonius (Cuvier, 1832) and Engraulis japonicus Temminck et Schlegel, 1846 together accounted for a remarkable 78.9% of the total catch. Notably, the Shannon–Weaver diversity index values were lower in 2015 than in 2008, indicating potential shifts in the community structure. Our analysis identified sea surface temperature as the most dominant factor that influenced these changes in species composition. Furthermore, we highlight the significant threats posed by climate change and the increasing number of jellyfish challenging fisheries on the Yeosu Coast. These threats have the potential to result in diminished set-net catches and declining biodiversity within this valuable ecosystem. Our findings underscore the importance of monitoring and addressing these ecological shifts to ensure the long-term sustainability of Yeosu Coast fisheries.",

This paper reports the first records of suckermouth armored catfishes in the Candelaria River, thereby expanding its distribution within the Yucatan Peninsula. Fifteen individuals were collected from three sites in the upper and middle parts of the basin. They represented two phenotypically distinct species of catfishes: (vermiculate) Pterygoplichthys disjunctivus (Weber, 1991) and (spotted) Pterygoplichthys pardalis (Castelnau, 1855). Adults and juveniles were caught in lotic ecosystems in 2023 during the dry and rainy seasons. Results suggest that the invasive process of the Candelaria River is linked to the San Pedro River upper basin, in El Petén, Guatemala, through floodings enhanced by hurricanes, allowing these species to disperse. These records highlight the importance of connectivity between adjacent watersheds for the dispersal and expansion of these invasive fishes, mainly from rivers neighboring Guatemala. However, further research is necessary to explore the dynamics and connectivity between aquatic ecosystems and the possible mechanisms that promote the invasion of these fishes in this region.",

    "abstract": "Species of the genus Lethrinus , commonly referred to as emperor fishes, mainly distributed in the Indo–West Pacific, including the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman are poorly known. It is difficult to characterize them morphologically, as there are no distinguishing meristic features for the majority of species. We studied the morphological features of 65 specimens representing the genus Lethrinus to define and identify the species involved. Among the morphological characters commonly considered in this type of study, we also included new, previously undescribed characters. The results of Tukey’s post hoc HSD test for metric and meristic variables, which showed significant differences between species in ANOVA, indicate that most metric traits and the number of scale rows above the lateral line differ significantly among the five morphotypes distinguished. Principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant function analysis (DFA) effectively showed the morphometric variation between these morphotypes. The characteristics of body depth, head length, pectoral fin length, and caudal fin length are the most distinguishing diagnostic at the species level. We determined that the collected fish specimens represented: Lethrinus borbonicus Valenciennes, 1830, Lethrinus crocineus Smith, 1959, Lethrinus lentjan (Lacepède, 1802), Lethrinus microdon Valenciennes, 1830, and Lethrinus nebulosus (Forsskål, 1775). We also confirmed their validity as distinct species. Notably, L. crocineus , previously known only from the western Indian Ocean (Africa and Socotra), is now reported for the first time from the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. Lastly, a distribution map for the Lethrinus species is included.",

Ten sharks caught as bycatch between 2009 and 2019 in the northern sectors of the Strait of Sicily, the south Tyrrhenian Sea, the northwestern Ionian Sea, and the south Adriatic Sea using drifting longlines, as well as five retrieved from the Tripoli (Libya) marketplace, were morphologically confirmed to represent S. rostratus. The sharks exhibited typical characteristics for this species and were all caught from deep waters, indicating a potential mesopelagic habit. The study also utilized literature reviews and global databases for a comprehensive mapping of S. rostratus distribution in the Mediterranean Sea, which revealed sporadic occurrences in the eastern Mediterranean and an absence in the north Adriatic Sea. Morphometric data provided insights into the reproductive characteristics of S. rostratus . The study highlights the ecological significance of the Strait of Sicily (Central Mediterranean Sea) for the species, indicating it as a likely spawning area, and underscores the impact of the interactions between sharks and pelagic drifting swordfish fisheries in the Mediterranean, which result in increased mortality rates for threatened shark and ray species.

The two dolphins swam close to Terceira Island. No specimens have yet been collected. The shape, and size of the wounds observed suggest that they were inflicted by a cookiecutter shark.

This species is distinguished from congeners by the following combination of characters: pectoral fin: I, 15; pelvic fin: I, 8; lateral line scales 77–83; the distance from the anus to the posterior insertion of the pelvic fin being greater than from the anus to the anal fin origin; a lateral black stripe from the gill opening to the caudal fin base; a black spot at the caudal fin origin equal to the eye diameter; and a lower lip with three large papillae, with the middle one being larger. The new species differs from Vanmanenia caldwelli (Nichols, 1925) by its mouth soft-tissue structures and lower morphometric values and from Vanmanenia ventrosquamata (Mai, 1978) and Vanmanenia caobangensis Nguyen, 2005 by having more lateral line scales and lower body depth. Additionally, Vanmanenia duci sp. nov. has a larger eye and wider interorbital space compared to other species in Vietnam.

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic structure and diversity of marine fish is crucial for a sustainable management program. We examined the genetic diversity and historical demographics of the yellowfin snapper, Lutjanus xanthopinnis Iwatsuki, Tanaka et Allen, 2015, in the coastal waters of east Peninsular Malaysia which is bordered by the southern part of the South China Sea using the mitochondrial genes (mtDNA) D-loop and Cytochrome b ( Cyt-b ). A total of 99 (D-loop) and 78 ( Cyt-b ) specimens of L. xanthopinnis were successfully sequenced from six locations within the range of species distribution along the Malaysian South China Sea. In the presently reported study, the lack of genetic differentiation among populations can be attributed to historical demographic events, eggs and planktonic larvae’ ability to disperse, spawning patterns, and the absence of physical barriers in the geographical landscape. Maximum likelihood gene trees demonstrated that the populations under study had limited structuring and formed a panmictic population that lacks support for internal clades. The AMOVA (Analysis of Molecular Variance) and population pairwise Ф ST values indicated high genetic exchange between the study areas. A high level of haplotype diversity (D-loop: 0.948–1.000; Cyt-b : 0.542–0.928), low nucleotide diversity (D-loop: 0.0095–0.0159; Cyt-b : 0.0022–0.0049) and starlike haplotype network indicates a recent expansion of L. xanthopinnis populations in Malaysian South China Sea. However, neutrality and goodness of fit tests revealed non-significant values. Furthermore, the BSP (Bayesian skyline plot) analysis estimated population expansion events during the late Pleistocene. During this epoch, the fluctuation in sea level may have led to an increase in the abundance of resources and favorable habitats for the yellowfin snapper. The presently reported findings could initiate efficient management strategies for L. xanthopinnis along the coastal areas of the Malaysian South China Sea and other nearby nations that share the same waterways.",

Underutilized bycatch species often lack biological information, hindering the assessment of their stock status and the implementation of appropriate management strategies. This study investigated the length–weight relations (LWRs) of 9 of 14 underutilized bycatch fish species collected from set-net fisheries in Nishiki, Mie Prefecture, Japan, during the 2018–2020 fishing seasons. The following fish species were studied: Hyperoglyphe japonica (Döderlein, 1884); Labracoglossa argenteiventris Peters, 1866; Macroramphosus sagifue Jordan et Starks, 1902; Microcanthus strigatus (Cuvier, 1831); Ostorhinchus semilineatus (Temminck et Schlegel, 1843); Parapriacanthus ransonneti Steindachner, 1870; Rexea prometheoides (Bleeker, 1856); Siganus fuscescens (Houttuyn, 1782); Upeneus japonicus (Houttuyn, 1782). A total of 251 fishing operations were conducted, and the collected fish specimens were measured for length (fork length) and wet weight. Simple regression analysis was performed on the logarithm of length and weight data to estimate the LWR parameters ( a , b , and R 2 ) for each species. The estimated values of the relative growth coefficient ( b ) ranged from 2.862 to 3.311, and the coefficients of determination ( R 2 ) were above 0.8 for all species, indicating robust LWR estimations. Notably, five species were not previously listed or credibly described in FishBase, and four were new records for the Japanese coast. This study provides new biological information on LWRs for underutilized bycatch fish species, contributing to our understanding of their population dynamics and supporting future management efforts for sustainable fisheries and biodiversity conservation.",

The sludge contains a significant amount of nutrients that can be utilized by hydroponically grown crops in an integrated system called aquaponics. While this system has promising results, techniques to maximize nutrient recovery still need to be developed. African catfish, Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822), can be stocked at very high densities, therefore it produces a substantial amount of sludge. In this study, sludge from African catfish RAS was subjected to different mineralization treatments (T1: anaerobic, T2: aerobic, and T3: aerobic with carbon addition) for nutrient recovery. The supernatant in T3 after mineralization had a statistically significant difference ( P &amp;gt; 0.05) in their concentrations of N (2700 mg ∙ L –1 ), P (100 mg ∙ L –1 ), K (720 mg ∙ L –1 ), Ca (12 115.6 mg ∙ L –1 ), and Mg (3391.9 mg ∙ L –1 ) after 15 days, among the other mineralization methods and untreated sludge. It was then followed by the nutrient recovery performance of T2 and lastly, T1. Moreover, the low pH and warm temperature were observed to improve the solubilization of the nutrients, resulting in a higher nutrient recovery in T3. Hence, among the three mineralization treatments, T3 had the most potential to recover maximum nutrients from African catfish sludge to be used as organic fertilizer for hydroponically grown crops.",

This excessive growth on the bottom of the lagoon plays a significant role in eliminating nutrients from the water, limiting the vernal development of plankton, and considerably increasing water transparency, but strongly affecting living conditions of the original benthic macrophytes. In late summer, the brown algae biomass undergoes rapid decomposition and enriches the sediment with organic matter. Sediment analyses revealed no excessive concentration of heavy metals or organic contaminants, their concentrations being usually proportional to the organic matter content. Experimental seeding- of vascular plants and observations on assemblages of sessile fauna and flora indicate that reintroduction of original species and deployment of artificial reefs is feasible and purposeful.",

Some of them can protect lipids, containing essential unsaturated fatty acids. The aim of the present study was to determine antioxidant properties of aqueous extracts of rosemary and sage, compared with the activity of BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) and Endox in lipids of fresh Baltic fishes (herring, sprat, flounder) and those subjected to frozen storage at -25°C for 6 months. Materials and methods. Antioxidant activity of the additives was determined based on β-carotene changes in fish lipids after 10, 20, 40, and 60 min of heating at 50°C. Results. The plant-origin extracts and the synthetic antioxidants used, inhibited most extensively β-carotene changes in the lipids of non-frozen herring. They were the least effective in non-frozen sprat lipids. The frozen storage lowered the antioxidant action of the additives in relation to β-carotene in lipids of herring and flounder, whereas in sprat lipids the antioxidants used, continued their protective action for β-carotene, during heating. Elongation of the heating time from 10 to 60 min increased the β-carotene losses and their pace followed the logarithmic scale. The activity of the antioxidants in fish lipids decreased along with the increase of polyunsaturated fatty acids (C20 : 5, C22 : 5, and C22 : 6) contents Conclusion. The antioxidant properties of plant-origin additives and synthetic antioxidants decreased along with the increased content on unsaturated fatty acids of fish lipids. Six-month-long frozen storage of the fish raw materials resulted in a decrease of the protective properties of the additives used, in relation to the lipids of Baltic herring and flounder. The best protective properties for lipids of flounder and sprat exhibited Endox, while aqueous extract of rosemary was the most effective in relation to sprat lipids.",

    "abstract": "Background. It is a common perception that growth rates of many commercially-exploited fish species have been well known. It is evident, however, that in certain cases, especially in brackish water environments those growth rates may be diversified. Therefore, determination of growth patterns of various stocks of the same fish, living in different salinity regimes may be important for efficient fisheries management, especially fish-quotas negotiations. The aim of the presently reported study was to estimate the growth rates of length and weight of flounder Platichthys flesus (L.) from the Gulf of Gdańsk and to compare them with those from the Pomeranian Bay and Słupsk Furrow areas. Materials and methods. A total of 200 fish, collected in the coastal waters of Hel in 1997, was analysed. The fish were caught using flatfish gill nets. The age of flounder was determined from otoliths, whereas measurements of the annual ring increments were made using a dissecting microscope with reflected light over a dark background. The microscope was outfitted with a camera and linked to computer. The images were processed using an image-processing software &#8220;Multiscan&#8221;. The method of Vovk was employed to study the growth rate of flounder, both for the whole sample and in relation to both sexes. The calculation of the growth rates of length and weight were aided by the equations of von Bertalanffy. Results. The total length of the flounder studied ranged from 4.3 to 46.0 cm for ages from one through ten. The mean length reached 23.7 cm, while the mean age was 4.6 years. The prevalent age classes were III, IV, and V. The growth rates of length were different in males and females. Until the third year of life males grew slightly faster, while from the fourth year, the females grew more rapidly. The von Bertalanffy equations that describe theoretical growth (length and weight) of flounder, from the Gulf of Gdańsk were calculated. Conclusion. The differences found in the morphometric and biological characters between the samples collected in three different locations of the southern Baltic (Pomeranian Bay, Słupsk Furrow, and Gulf of Gdańsk) may indicate that they represent separate stocks (populations).",

Copepods collected from trawl-caught fishes were studied using light microscopy and standard staining, manipulation, and measuring techniques.

Driocephalus cerebrinoxius is reported for the first time from the Pacific Ocean and from the star-spotted smooth hound, Mustelus manazo (Triakidae, Carcharhiniformes). The cladistic analysis of sphyriid taxa resulted in 12 shortest trees, each with a length of 16 and consistency index of 0.875. Strict and majority rule consensus trees are presented. Conclusion. Due to the paucity of morphological characters available for analysis, a robust phylogenetic hypothesis for taxa comprising Sphyriidae is best sought using molecular tools. Without a robust phylogeny it is premature to undertake associated analyses regarding historical ecology within Sphyriidae.",

    "abstract": "Background. Vendace, Coregonus albula (L.), is one of the most valuable components of Polish lake ichthyofauna. The vendace from different lakes differ in their principal vital characteristics (such as growth rate etc.) and it is therefore crucial to determine those characteristics from different throphic types of lakes in order to implement proper measures of fisheries management for those coregonids. The aim of the present paper was therefore to learn principal biological features of vendace populations representing three different Pomeranian lakes. Materials and methods. Comparative biological studies were carried out on 136 vendace from PeĹ'cz Wielki Lake, 304 from BytyĹ\" Wielki Lake, and 62 from WeĹ'tyĹ\" Lake (Pomerania Lakeland) collected within 2002-2003. The age and growth rate of the fish were determined from scales. Fulton′s condition factor and the total length-weight relation were used to determine fish condition. Results. Gillnet selectivity influenced fish age structure and size. For example, among 502 vendace obtained, in total, from the three lakes, 75.7% (380 specimens) were 2+. The results of back-calculations and the parameters of von Bertalanffy′s growth equation revealed distinct disproportions in the total length in individual age groups (PeĹ'cz Wielki Lake: Lt = 213.22[1 - e-0.49576(1 + 1.055013)]; BytyĹ\" Wielki Lake: Lt = 219.17[1 - e-0.733553(1 + 0.040147)]; WeĹ'tyĹ\" Lake: Lt = 255.08[1 - e-0.571108(1 + 0.023036)]) Slower length- and weight growth rates were observed in the fish from PeĹ'cz Wielki Lake. Conclusion. The growth rates, determined using back-calculations, were different for the vendace populations representing lakes PeĹ'cz Wielki, BytyĹ\" Wielki, and WeĹ'tyĹ\" in the sequential years of fish lives. The fish from WeĹ'tyĹ\" Lake were characterized by average growth, whilst the fish from the remaining reservoirs were characterized by slow or very slow growth. The lower condition values and growth rates from PeĹ'cz Wielki Lake were probably the result of poor environmental conditions in this body of water.",

    "abstract": "Background.The small sandeel, Ammodytes tobianus L., is a fish species of no commercial value, which is probably why its biology and, particularly, taxonomic status has not attracted much interest.However, the ecological importance of this species outweighs its economic value.It has been regarded a \"vulnerable\" fish species and therefore its taxonomic status urgently needs more detailed studies.The presently reported study was intended to be a contribution to the knowledge on poorly known morphology of this fish, from a single location in the southern Baltic Sea. Materials and methods.The fish (130 specimens, 9.2-16.3cm TL) were collected in June 1995 from the area between the Puck Bay and open waters of the Gulf of Gdańsk, at the depth of 8 m.Taxonomic analysis involved both meristic and morphometric characters.The lengths were expressed as percentage of the standard length (SL) of the fish while the fish head characters-as percentage of the head length (HL).In addition, the coefficients of correlation and determination (r and r 2 , respectively) were calculated for the relations between all characters studied and standard length (SL) and for the relations between the characters pertinent to head and the head length (HL) in the sample examined.The fish age was determined from the otoliths.Results.The age of fish examined ranged from 1+ to 4+, and the sandeels aged 2+ were the distinctly dominant age group.The most abundant size group was the 13.0-13.99cm length class.The coefficients of variation in the meristic characters were relatively low.The vertebral count and the number of plicae were the most stable characters in the sample studied, while the anal-and pectoral fin ray counts proved to be the most variable ones.Meristic characters can be described by the formula: D (47-49) 50-55, P (10) 11-12 (13), A (24, 25) 26-30 (31), sp.br.( 21) 22-27 (28), vt.61-67 (68).The morphometric relations showed a tendency to allometry, only the postdorsal and postorbital distances showed almost the isometric pattern of growth.The head characters expressed as proportion of the head length showed a very low variability.The strongest negative relations, on the course of exponential curve, were recorded in the following characters: (first) depth of head, eye diameters, jaws length, interorbital distance (associated with the head length); (second) predorsal distance (associated with the fin arrangement), minimum and maximum body depths and length of caudal fin (the features associated with the body shape). Conclusion.The mean vertebral count obtained in the present study indicates the sampled sandeel from the Gulf of Gdańsk to belong to the autumn-spawning component of the stock.The sandeel is a species of relatively short lifespan, the age group IV was the oldest one and the least numerous in the sample (3.38% of the all specimens).The head length and pectoral fin rays count may be regarded as the characters differentiating the Baltic and Atlantic populations, however more detailed study from different areas of the Baltic Sea is urgently needed to confirm this assumption.",

Wels catfish, Silurus glanis L. (known also as the European catfish), because of its breeding and consumption values, becomes an increasingly common object of breeding. The objective of the presented work was the evaluation of selected feeds differing in dietary lipids levels applied in rearing the wels catfish fry under controlled conditions. Materials and methods. The feeding trial (60 days) was carried out with the wels catfish fry, weighing on average 55 g. The experiment was conducted under controlled conditions in an aquarium hall in 60-L flow-through tanks. During the growth test, the fish were given four commercial feeds of the same protein amount (45%) and graded fat levels (15%, 20%, 25%, and 30%). In the final evaluation of the feeding tests, the following rearing effectiveness indices were used: food conversion ratio (FCR), specific growth rate (SGR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), protein retention (PR), lipid retention (LR), and survival rate (SR). Conclusions were drawn on the basis of statistical analysis using Statistica computer software. Results. The wels catfish fed 20%-fat-content feed attained the highest individual weights. The other treatments yielded statistically significantly lower (P < 0.05) body weights. No statistically significant differences were found between the mean values of the specific growth rate (SGR). The values of feed conversion ratio (FCR) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) were approximately equal in the individual groups. The protein retention attained values from 28.2% to 33.0%, while fat retention ranged from 11.8% to 24.2%. No mortalities were recorded. The amount of fat in all groups increased significantly after the termination of the growth. The increase of fat amount in the feed was not correlated with the growth of fat amount in the fish body. The levels of the other body components increased, but no differences between the groups were found. Conclusion. Differentiated amounts of dietary lipids in the diet did not exert any effect on the rate of fish growth or on the proper utilization of the nutritive components in feeds.",

    "abstract": "Otolith chemical signatures are sufficiently stable across time to allow for accurate stock classification. The classification of the southern Yellow Sea population for Larimichthys polyactis (Bleeker, 1877) and its connectivity with others from 1962 is controversial. The study aimed to study the inter-annual variation in otolith strontium:calcium (Sr:Ca) ratios of L. polyactis to determine whether otolith natural tags are representative over long periods and can then be used for population structure classification. Spawning L. polyactis individuals were captured by stow nets in the same site of the southern Yellow Sea coastal waters during April–May in 2003, 2012, and 2013. EPMA (electron probe microanalysis) was used to determine the Sr:Ca ratios of a total of 25 otolith samples. Mann–Whitney U -test was used to test the differences of otolith Sr:Ca ratios from the core to edge for each otolith. One-way ANOVA was performed to compare the mean otolith Sr:Ca values among 2003, 2012, and 2013. Otoliths from 2003, 2012, and 2013 showed similar patterns of Sr:Ca ratios and Sr:Ca ratios could be divided into higher and lower phases in the core and remaining regions, respectively. Inter-annual significant differences for each high or low Sr:Ca phase of otoliths were not observed over short- (between 2012 and 2013) or long-time (between 2003 and 2012, and between 2003 and 2013) scales. Univariate contrasts across the adjacent year and decade classes were statistically similar. The Sr:Ca ratio signatures in the otolith were relatively stable across years and can be used as a reliable natural tag for connectivity assessments and stock identification with little or no genetic differentiation among L. polyactis populations. The short- and long-term temporal stability of otolith Sr:Ca ratios also revealed, the existence of stable L. polyactis stocks in the southern Yellow Sea, consistent with a previous finding of capture survey.",

    "abstract": "Fishing closures, commonly used to manage fisheries’ catch, involve temporarily closing a body of water to particular fishing gears to control fishing effort and protect feeding and spawning areas. In recent years in Qiantang River of China, with the socio-economic development, protection of fish stock has become increasingly urgent. The year 2019 was the first year that Qiantang River was included in the unified fishing ban system for the south of Yangtze River basin. Here, fish captures and hydroacoustic surveys were carried out in the research area of Qiantang River in order to present comparative descriptions of the dominant fish species, the temporal changes of fish size, density, biomass, and distribution affected by the four-month fishing closure in 2019. The results showed that Pseudobrama simoni (Bleeker, 1864) was the most dominant species both before and after the closure by using the traditional capture method. The mean target strength (TS) of overall fish after closure was –50.28 ± 0.19 dB, which was lower than that before, resulting in a significantly shorter derived mean length (13.42 ± 0.74 cm). The mean fish density and calculated biomass after closure were both significantly higher than that before it. More than 50% of fish species were distributed in the water of 5–20 m depth after the closure, which likely occurred in water deeper than 20 m before. Meanwhile, fewer outliers were found in different depth categories after closure. It is concluded that the four-month closure in 2019 had a positive effect on fish size, density, and biomass, leading to protection of pelagic fishes and a more even distribution of fish.",

A total of 208 specimens belonging to 10 species of the Theraps – Paraneetroplus clade were examined. The left side of each specimen was photographed; in each photograph, 27 fixed landmarks were placed to identify patterns in body shape variation. Images were processed by using geometric morphometrics, followed by a phylogenetic principal component analysis. The phylogenetic signal for body shape was then calculated. To determine the relations in morphological similarity, a dendrogram was created using the unweighted pair group method and arithmetic mean values, while a Procrustes ANOVA and post-hoc test were used to evaluate significant differences between species and habitats. We found three morphological groups that differed in body length and depth, head size, and the position of the mouth and eyes. The body shape analysis recovered the morphotypes of seven species, and statistical differences were demonstrated in eight species. Based on traits associated with cranial morphology, Wajpamheros nourissati (Allgayer, 1989) differed the most among the species examined. No phylogenetic signal was found for body shape; this trait shows independence from ancestral relatedness, indicating that there is little congruence between morphological and genetic interspecific patterns. As evidenced by the consistently convergent morphology of the species in the Theraps – Paraneetroplus clade, the diversification of the group is related to an ecological opportunity for habitat use and the exploitation of food resources. Although no phylogenetic signal was detected for body shape, there appears to be an order associated with cranial morphology-based phylogeny. However, it is important to evaluate the intraspecific morphologic plasticity produced by ecological segregation or partitioning of resources. Therefore, future morphological evolutionary studies should consider cranial structures related to the capture and processing of food.",

Once considered abundant in all the Mediterranean basins, nowadays the species represents an appreciable by-catch of bottom trawlers only in limited areas. The aim of the present was to perform a synthetic analysis of the distribution, abundance, and biological traits of this poorly investigated species. Materials and methods. This paper is based on theinformation recovered from the available &ldquo;grey&rdquo; data sources as well as on new original data gathered in 13 experimental bottom trawl surveys carried out off the southern coasts of Sicily from 1994 to 2005. &nbsp;Data recovering and processing regarded distribution, abundance, sex ratio, maturity condition, length structure, and its evolution in time, and growth estimation. Results. Thespecimens of P. cataphractum were present in all investigated areas, with highest abundance in the eastern grounds, between 50 and 800 m, showing a preference for the upper slope (201&ndash;500 m). Sexed specimens were almost equally distributed between females and males (overall sex ratio, Sr, between 0.49 and 0.54). Recruits (80&ndash;130 mm total length, TL) occurred continuously from September to March, with a peak from late December thru March. The size at onset of sexual maturity (Lm at 50%) was achieved at 191 and 212 mm for females and males, respectively. Growth was evaluated (sex combined) by applying length based methods (LBMs); up five significant modal components were evidenced, the first 2&ndash;3 well distinguished.

    "abstract": "Background. In this study, the relation between the biological reference points (BRPs) associated with Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) and the relevant biological, fisheries, and environmental factors were investigated. This knowledge is crucial to build the capacity for timely adaptation of management to the changes in an ecosystem. The research highlights the considerations that need to be taken into account when estimating and using BRPs in practice, and can thus lead to avoidance of overfishing. The BRPs were represented by MSY and the related spawning stock biomass (BMSY), fishing mortality (FMSY), and FMSY proxies. Materials and methods. To obtain the BRPs, the method of Horbowy and LuzeĹ„czyk (2012)â€”that combines yield-per-recruit and spawning stock-per-recruit analyses with stock-recruitment relation models (Beverton and Holt (B&H) 1957, Ricker 1975)â€”was used. Data from the three biggest Baltic Sea stocks were used to test the sensitivity of BRPs to the model input data, and the influence of regime shifts or dynamics of the biological and fisheries variables on the BRPs. Results. The analyses show that an increase in maturity and weight at age generally led to an increase in BRPs. The opposite effect is observed in the case of natural mortality (stronger when the Ricker stockâ€“recruitment (Sâ€“R) relation was used) and selectivity (proportion of the F of partially recruited age groups to the mean F of fully recruited age groups). An increase in the steepness of Sâ€“R models increases FMSY and its proxies as well as MSY, and had a decreasing influence on BMSY. Furthermore, the BRPs are very sensitive to the different data range divisions of the input data. Conclusion. When estimating BRPs, the time period of the input data should be selected with caution, and the appropriate time period should be based on strong biological, ecological, and environmental knowledge as, according to this study, all of these factors influence estimates of BRPs.",

Although bastard grunt has rapidly expanded its area of distribution in the Mediterranean, there is no information about its age and growth. The aim of this study was to provide data about growth, condition, and first sexual maturity of the species in order to contribute to a better management of its fishery. Materials and methods. A total of 515 specimens of bastard grunt were caught in the Gulf of Tunis. The age was determined from otoliths. Length&#8211;weight relation, von Bertalanffy equation, and growth rate were employed to evaluate the fish growth. Also the condition factor and length at first sexual maturity were calculated. Results. In the Gulf of Tunis population, females were significantly predominant and the overall sex ratio (M : F) reached the value of&#160; 1 : 2.17. The two sexes showed a positive allometric growth. The marginal increment analysis validated the annual deposition of one single annulus in the winter. Growth in (total) length (TL) was approximately 65% during the first year of life. The von Bertalanffy growth equation was TL = 23.9 &#215; (1 &#8211; e&#8211;0.186 &#215; (t + 4.62)). The somatic condition of fish increased markedly during the late spring and summer.

Secondary items included: the stomatopod Squilla mantoidea (4%), Unidentified organic matter (UOM, 3%), and the fish Porichthys sp. (2%). Centropomus robalito is a specialist predator with a low diet Breadth value (Bi = 0.14). While there were no significant differences in diet between the sexes (Analysis of similarities [ANOSIM]; R = 0.014; P = 0.50), there were differences among sizes (ANOSIM, R = 0.361; P = 0.01). Conclusion. Centropomus robalito is a second-order predator that feeds mainly on shrimp, which are abundant throughout its distribution area. The feeding strategy of C. robalito fits the optimal foraging theory. This fish feeds on the most abundant species, obtaining a higher energetic benefit than it would obtain from less available prey, or from more mobile and larger prey that would imply expending more energy in the search, attack, and manipulation of these prey.",

Bycatch species are likely to suffer the same declines as commercial species with which they co-occur but information on those species for Portuguese waters does not exist. In order to increase the knowledge for the Portuguese continental-shelf waters several aspects of the species growth were investigated. Materials and methods. Age and growth of Scorpaena notata from Portuguese continental-shelf waters were studied using 379 otoliths. A subsample of 70 otoliths, covering all length classes, was read by three of the authors to establish a reading and interpretation pattern. The von Bertalanffy growth model was fitted to sex-specific age–length data. The likelihood ratio tests were used to evaluate the significance of differences on growth parameters between sexes and with the parameters estimated in different areas. Results. Females dominated in smaller length classes while males prevailed in larger ones, although overall sex ratio did not deviate from 1 : 1. Females ranged from 10.5 to 18.8 cm total length (TL) and from 1 to 6 years; males ranged from 11.4 to 20.7 cm TL and from 1 to 7 years. The von Bertalanffy growth parameters estimated for the Portuguese shelf waters showed significant differences between sexes and were: L∞ = 18.23 cm TL, k = 0.43yr–1, t0 = –0.99 yr for females and L∞ = 21.17 cm TL, k = 0.28yr–1 and t0 = –1.73 yr for males. The age range found in the Portuguese shelf waters was similar to that found in the Balearic Islands but about half of that found for the Adriatic Sea. Significant differences between growth parameters from the Portuguese coast and those from the Balearic Islands and Adriatic Sea were found. Conclusion. Estimates of L∞ in the presently reported study were the highest but rather consistent with the maximum length given for the species.",

    "abstract": "Background. The concept of name-bearing specimens is pivotal for nomenclatural stability. Hence, correctly listing the type specimens and designating lecto- and neotypes are crucial elements in taxonomic revisions. While reviewing the Labeo Cuvier, 1816 taxa of the Congo basin, we encountered several differences between the lists of type specimens provided in the various revisions of the genus. The majority of problems were encountered with six nominal species of Labeo that were described by Boulenger in 1898: Labeo barbatus Boulenger, 1898; Labeo falcifer Boulenger, 1898 (later replaced by Labeo falcipinnis Boulenger, 1903); Labeo lineatus Boulenger, 1898; Labeo longipinnis Boulenger, 1898; Labeo macrostoma Boulenger, 1898; and Labeo velifer Boulenger, 1898. For four of these species: L. barbatus, L. lineatus, L. macrostoma, and L. velifer, different specimens appear in the literature as name-bearing types. Also for Labeo lividus Roberts et Stewart, 1975, previously a junior synonym of L. barbatus, and for Labeo altivelis Peters, 1852, a species described from the lower Zambezi but also present in the Congo basin, alternative lists of type specimens were mentioned in the literature. Materials and methods. The correct list of type specimens was compiled based on museum archives and on an examination of the type specimens. The validity of the lectotype designations was checked. When a lectotype designation proved to be ambiguous, the actions of the subsequent revisers were investigated. Results. We found that the correct lectotypes of L. barbatus, L. falcipinnis, L. lineatus, L. longipinnis, L. macrostoma, and L. velifer are: BMNH 1898.12.28:7, MRAC 17, BMNH 1897.9.30:27, MRAC 113, MRAC 35, and BMNH 1898.12.28:1, respectively. Also for L. lividus and L. altivelis, confusion existed on the type series and a corrected list of type specimens is presented. Conclusion. Especially in older species descriptions, a detailed list of studied specimens is often lacking. In such cases, providing a correct list of type specimens is often not a trivial task. This study shows that inaccurate lists of type specimens can lead to invalid taxonomic acts, which could have nomenclatural implications. We hope that increased efforts in the dissemination of basic taxonomic information will reduce such errors in the future.",

This study aimed to determine the selectivity of 40 mm square- (40S) and 90&#186; turned-mesh (40T90) codend for the deepwater rose shrimp, Parapenaeus longirostris, and greater forkbeard, Phycis blennoides (Br&#252;nnich, 1768). Materials and methods. Fishing experiments were conducted on the international waters of the Aegean Sea by using a commercial vessel between 24 August and 13 September 2012. The hooped covered codend technique was employed for the estimated codend selectivity. The selectivity parameters were estimated by using CC 2000 software. Results. Nineteen successful hauls, 11 with 40S, and 8 with 40T90 codends, were performed. The mean L50 values (50% retention length) of 40S and 40T90 were found to be a 15.5 &#177; 0.1 mm and 14.8 &#177; 0.1 mm carapace lengths for the rose shrimp, and 15.3 &#177; 0.1 cm and 12.2 &#177; 0.1 cm total lengths for the greater forkbeard, respectively. Conclusion. In conclusion, 165 square meshes in a codend circumference with 40 mm mesh sizes provided higher L50 values than the 40 mm turned meshes, and 330 meshes around the codend circumference.&#160; Halving the number of meshes in the codend with larger turned mesh and different modifications should be investigated for further studies in order to appropriate the L50 values.",

    "abstract": "A pool of data already existing about D-loop, i.e., the Control Region (CR) haplotypes of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of brown trout, Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758, tentative Adriatic trout Salmo farioides Karaman, 1938, and tentative Macedonian trout, Salmo macedonicus (Karaman, 1924), and their reconstructed phylogeography makes a good starting point for resolving their evolutionary history. That includes the dating of particular events in it. The events have hitherto been dated using the method of a molecular clock. Various calibrations were applied for the mutation rate, owing to the incongruence between the time of divergence that various authors notified and general knowledge about events in geological history and the periods in which they occurred in the Mediterranean region. Since geological history events were mandatory for setting the scene for the evolutionary history of brown trout, the incongruence between them has questioned the molecular clock calibration’s validity. From results about both the phylogeography and phylogenetic relations between native haplotypes (both partial and whole CR sequences) and the population genetics that characterized particular populations, we calculated the time of divergence between haplotypes in the regions of the western part of the Balkans: Iron Gate broader area in eastern Serbia, continental Montenegro and south-eastern Serbia. The distinct status of adjacent populations was verified by frequencies of microsatellites’ alleles and the STRUCTURE analysis that examined the significance of differences between them. In particular, we examined the populations that were clearly separated either by physical barriers, such as a waterfall in eastern Serbia (e.g., the upper and lower River Rečka supplemented by nearby rivers Vratna and Zamna), or by underground drops in Montenegro (e.g., upper and lower River Zeta, and rivers Nožica and lower River Mrtvica as isolated counterparts). We used the so far most common substitution rate of 1% in a million years’ (MY) period. The divergence times we obtained were compared to the events known for the region from available geological history data. There was a fairly good congruence between the dating obtained by the molecular clock method and that by geological history where the advanced, i.e., modern haplotypes, were concerned. In contrast, the congruence was worse for dating of divergence when more ancient haplotypes were in question, being much better if the mutational rate would be decreased to lower rates. That supported results both from the Rate Correlation Test about the independence of evolutionary rates in different lineages of brown trout, and from the Molecular Clock Test, which revealed that the evolutionary rate throughout the phylogenetic tree is not equal. That implies a difference in the speed of evolution in them, which was likely slower and faster, in the ancient, pre-Pleistocene haplotypes and the advanced, Pleistocene ones, respectively. The setting of the variable, or non-linear (i.e., logarithmic) speed of evolving seems helpful, since the early cladogenesis with the dominance of mutations was most likely combined afterwards with the acting of other evolutionary mechanisms, especially of genetic drift in populations that passed through the bottleneck episodes of the abrupt decrease in population size during the unfavourable periods of their evolutionary history.",

According to the length–weight relation (LWR), the growth type of U. krameri was positive allometric based on the determined equation: BW = 0.0068TL 3.277 . The mean value determined for the relative condition factor ( K n ) was 1.0056486. The growth condition of 46% of the specimens was poor ( K n &amp;lt; 1; n = 19), while the other 54% were in good condition ( K n ≥ 1; n = 22). The presently reported study provides information about the presence of U. krameri in the Jieț River (Dolj County, Romania), a location where the species has not been previously reported. The LWRs show an allometric positive growth. The relative condition factor shows that 46% of the specimens had poor growth, while the rest were in good condition. Minnow traps were an efficient tool for small fish capture.",

    "abstract": "An eight-week feeding trial was conducted in a static indoor rearing system to examine the effects of partial substitution of fish meal (FM) protein with deoiled salseed meal protein with and without supplemental amino acids in diets for rohu, Labeo rohita fingerlings (average weight 5.50 &plusmn;O.19 g). Prior to incorporation into diets, deoiled sal (Shorea robusta) seed meal was fermented with lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus) in order to reduce/eliminate the antinutritional factors, tannin and phytic acid present in it. Twelve experimental diets (diets D1 to D12) were formulated repalcing the FM protein from a reference diet with salseed meat protein at different levels (four sets of diets, of which each set ofthree diets contained 25%, 50%, and 75% replacement of FM protein by salseed meal protein respectively). Diets D1 to D3 were not supplemented with any amino acid. Lysine was supplemented to diets D4 to D6. Diets D7 to D9 were supplemented with methionine-cystine (together) and diets D10 to D12 contained lysine and methionine-cystine (together). Lysine and methionine-cystine (together) were added to the diets at 5.7% and 3.1% of dietary protein respectively. The groups of fish fed diets without any supplemental amino acids bad significantly lower percentage weight gain, SGR and higher FCR than the groups of fish fed other experimental diets. The addition of lysine and methionine-cystine to the diet in which 50% of FM protein was rep1aced by salseed meal protein (diet D11) significant1y improved fish weight gain and FCR. The percentage live weight gain and SGR values differed significantly (P &lt; 0.01) from each other in the fish fed diets D10 to D12 which were supplemented with all three amino acids. The results of the present study suggest that rohu fingerlings can effectively uti1ise the supplemented amino acids and that deoiled salseed meal protein can replace up to 50% of FM protein in the diets for rohu if the salseed meal is properly processed (fermented) and supplemented with deficient amino acids.",

Stomach contents were tested for the frequency of individual food item components, their quantity and volume. Invertebrates and fish were present in the diet of yellowfin and blackfin tuna almost equally (85% and 77%). The majority of invertebrates in terms of incidence are cephalopods (62%) and crustaceans (52%). Fish were represented mainly by representatives of the families: Scombridae – 12%, Balistidae – 11.2%, and Syngnathidae – 8.2%. Moreover, especially the yellowfin tuna ate various floating materials, such as plastic, feathers, floating algae, and lumps of mazut. Invertebrates occurring in 82% of the blackfin tuna (Th. atlanticus) accounted for 77% of the number of diatery items and 31% of the volume of the food mass. Fish were present in 67% of the specimens and constituted 26% of the number of food items and 68% of the volume. Of the invertebrates, crustaceans were the most common (67.4% and cephalopods 36.0%). Fish were represented mainly by the following families: Balistidae – 10.1%, Trichiuridae – 5.6%, and Carangidae – 4.5%. Blackfin tuna also ate randomly floating materials, such as plastics, sea algae. A statistical comparison of the diets of both species did not show a significant correlation. In general, the diet of yellowfin and blackfin tuna is that of strong aggressive predators, and such as fish food, which is strained through a filter apparatus, will gill tiny objects near the water's surface. The fish, occurring in 77% of yellowfin and 67% of blackfin tuna, were mainly younger or older larvae found among the floating Sargassum clumps. In general, they represented 23 families. Adult Exocoetidae, Scombridae, and Syngnathidae have occasionally occurred in yellowfin tuna, as have Serranidae, Sciaenidae, and Stromateidae in blackfin tuna. Among yellowfin tuna of various ages, the most common were: Scombridae (12.2%), Balistidae (11.2%), Syngnathidae (8.2%), and Diodontidae (5.1%). 53 stomachs contained fish that were difficult to identify. The most common fish of blackfin tuna were: Balistidae (10.1%), Trichiuridae (5.6%), Carangidae (4.5%), and Syngnathidae (4.5%). 44.9% of stomachs contained remains difficult to identify. Of the mollusks, they were found almost exclusively in both species of cephalopods. Two of their groups were represented, Teuthidida and Octopodida. Squids were more common, quantitatively like by volume, 50.5% and 40.0% in yellowfin and 31.5% and 21.5% in blackfin (quantitative and volumetric)._x000D_[...] […][...] […][...] _x000D_In summary, yellowfin and blackfin tuna are predators capable of capturing fast, relatively large prey, but on the other hand, they use their straining gill apparatus to take up much less food from the surface. The main food is fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans. In general, it can be assumed that their diet does not show high selectivity, which probably also affects their wide range of occurrence.",

A total of 531 scuds (G. salinus, G. zaddachi, and G. duebeni) were collected from the Gulf of GdaĹ„sk and the Pomeranian Bay, respectively to determine the infection rate of those amphipods in the natural environment. Under experimental condition the scuds were exposed to infection with P. laevis in two different arrangements. In treatment one, the amphipods were kept, from May to July, in the same tank with infected flounder. In treatment two, 197 scuds were exposed to eggs of P. laevis, taken from dissected female acanthocephalans. Results. Scuds sampled from two areas of the Baltic Sea were not infected with P. laevis. Out of three Gammarus species cohabiting with infected flounders only G. zaddachi became infected. None of the scuds exposed directly to the eggs of the parasites became intermediate host of the acanthocephalan studied. Conclusion. Gammarus zaddachi is probably an intermediate host for Pomphorhynchus laevis in the Baltic Sea.",

This study was aimed to investigate the prevalence and impact of helminth infection on the health of cultured hybrid tilapia, Oreochromis sp.Materials and methods. Prevalence and intensity of helminth infection and histopathological response of infected organs were studied. Changes of biochemical composition, and protein electrophoritic pattern, and heavy metals levels of liver and muscle tissues were determined.Results. Helminth infection was restricted to the liver of 60% of the examined fish. Of this number 33% were infected by undifferentiated nematode larvae and heterophyid metacercariae while 67% showed the metacercarial infection only. Infection caused a noticeable alternation in histological architecture of the liver that was accompanied by depletion in hepatic glycogen, total lipids, and total protein. Moreover, biochemical components of the muscle tissues were significantly decreased along with intensity of infection. Protein fractions of the liver and muscle tissues were highly variable. Intensity of the parasitic infection was directly correlated with Fe and Mn levels in both liver and muscle.Conclusion. s. Cultured fish also suffered from helminth infection that significantly impaired the health and condition of fish as shown by histopathological, biochemical, and protein fractions changes recorded in this study. In additions, intensity of helminth infection might increase the capacity of infected organs in accumulation of heavy metals.",

The study was carried out in the shallow, eutrophic Oświn Lake, in the area of the Seven Islands ornithological reserve (north-eastern Poland) to determine the infection of fish with digeneans maturing in piscivorous birds. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the occurrence of Posthodiplostomum cuticola in fish from two parts of the reservoir differing in environmental conditions. The effect of fish size and season of sampling on the infection level was analysed.Materials and methods. Within 1998 and 1999, a total of 1091 fishes of 8 species dominating in the lake were examined. Samples were collected four times a year (in May, July, August, and October) simultaneously from the two examined parts of the lake.Results. Metacercariae of P. cuticola occurred with a high prevalence and intensity of infection in roach, rudd, white bream, and carp bream, and sporadically in crucian carp and European perch. The intensity of infection of fish from the western part of the lake was significantly higher compared with the eastern part; roach from the western pool were much more infected than in the other reservoirs of north Poland. The infection of roach, white bream and carp bream increased with total body length (TL), such a relationship was not reported for rudd. The infection of roach, white bream and carp bream varied significantly in different experimental periods while differences in the infection of rudd in samples were incidental.Conclusion. Location-dependent occurrence of P. cuticola in fishes indicates that interchange between fish groups from the eastern and western pool of Oświn Lake is limited. Infection of rudd was of a more incidental character then the infection of roach, white bream, and carp bream.",

    "abstract": "Background. Stability and high bioaccumulation coefficients of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in aqueous organisms may constitute a health hazard for their consumers (it is really the potential toxicity of PCBs that determine their hazard&mdash;not stability). As the fish are mostly eaten in the form of processed products, the influence of technological processes and different methods of cooking on changes in the levels of toxic compounds in final products is of great importance and may be helpful for appropriate processing. Since smoked fish products are in great demand in Poland, the goal of this study was to determine changes in total PCB content in herring fillets during hot smoking and in hot and cold smoked mackerel fillets. Materials and methods. Herring fillets were hot smoked under industrial conditions, whereas mackerel fillets were cold- and hot smoked. Analyses were carried out using a capillary gas chromatograph coupled with a mass spectrometer GC-MS (HP 6890/5973) with a HP-5 column. Results. The hot smoking process affected the loss of total PCB content in mackerel and herring fillets, with its highest value in the first hour of partial drying. The main factor determining the changes in the content of these compounds in wet matter and lipids was their escape in co-distillation with water vapour. The increase of their content, in the final stage of hot smoking and during the whole cold smoking process, was caused by contamination of fish fillets with polychlorinated biphenyls present in the curing smoke. Conclusion. From the toxicological point of view the process of hot smoking, is much healthier for people because it causes the reduction of total PCB content in final smoked products. Cold smoked mackerel is much more popular on the Polish market for its stronger taste and aromatic smell. However, lengthy exposure to smoke in low temperature increased the total PCB content in cold smoked fish. The consumption of these products should be limited based on these results.",

The highest content of fat was found at the silver eels; lower content was noted at eels living in bays and still lower content, at eels living in lakes. The lowest rate of fat increase was observed at eels from inland lakes.

    "abstract": "Background. To date, numerous studies of the impact of snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum (Gray, 1843) on invaded ecosystems have been conducted. However, the majority of such studies intended to assess changes induced in macroinvertebrate assemblages, while the possible effects of P. antipodarum on higher trophic levels have not hitherto been studied. Of particular interest from the point of view of fisheries management is the elucidation of how this invasive snail can alter the energy flow towards higher trophic levels. When abundant, P. antipodarum consumes a substantial part of the primary production, but it is poorly consumed by native fishes. Consequently, part of its assimilated energy may become locked in lower trophic levels and fail to reach higher levels directly. Therefore, invasion of this snail may decrease fish production. Materials and methods. Several years after establishment of P. antipodarum in a temperate mesotrophic Lake Dusia, we assessed: (1) changes in the biomass of littoral macroinvertebrates (proxy to secondary production), (2) assimilation of P. antipodarum by benthivorous fish (energy flow), and (3) changes in growth and catches of littoral benthivorous fish (fish production). All the analyses were based on a merger of &ldquo;grey&rdquo; literature and original data during the pre- and post-invasion periods. Results. There was an evident increase in the biomass of littoral macroinvertebrates, and the assemblage changed from crustacean- to gastropod-dominated due to over-domination of P. antipodarum. However, P. antipodarum did not replace the native prey of fish. Moreover, a marked decrease was recorded in littoral fish growth and catches after the invasion of P. antipodarum. Conclusion. Dense populations of P. antipodarum may reduce the channelling of primary production towards higher trophic levels and, consequently, the invasion may threaten fisheries of temperate mesotrophic lakes.",

The distribution range of the species is poorly known, as very few individuals have been recorded from Italy, Greece, and Turkey in the Mediterranean, and from the Azores in the north eastern Atlantic. The aim of this study was to report the presence of M. coccoi from the Balearic Islands (western Mediterranean). The history of species&rsquo; known records is compiled and its presence in the Atlantic is discussed. Materials and methods. A specimen of M. coccoi was collected from a bottom trawl sampling, carried out at 591 m depth in the south of Mallorca (Balearic Islands) during the survey MEDITS_ES05_17 in June 2017. The fish (a female) was subjected to standard descriptive procedures and subsequently deposited in the collection of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Results. Microichthys coccoi is recorded for the first time from the Balearic Islands, which expands its distributional range inside the Mediterranean more than 1000 km westwards. Conclusion. Like the other known specimens, except for those collected in the Strait of Messina, the presently described individual was caught on the slope, confirming that M. coccoi is a deep-water species. The comparison of this fish with Azorean specimens indicated differences in the number of pectoral-fin rays, the most important character distinguishing the species of Microichthys. Hence, further work is necessary to classify the Azorean population, which if confirmed as M. coccoi, would make necessary a modification of the species&rsquo; description and if rejected, an additional Atlantic species should be described.",

    "abstract": "Background. The swordfish, Xiphias gladius Linnaeus, 1758, is a pelagic and highly migratory species distributed in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans as well as in the Mediterranean Sea. Swordfish fishing has been carried out in the Mediterranean with longlines, gillnets, harpoons, and traps since the Roman times. Although information is available on the influence of the lunar phase on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) for the swordfish longline fishery in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, the data concerning the Mediterranean is rather limited. The aim of this study was to examine the relation between the lunar phase and the swordfish CPUE, based on data from Turkish longline fisheries, targeting swordfish in the eastern Mediterranean during the 2008–2016 fishing seasons. Materials and methods. We monitored randomly the daily fishing activity of longliners based at the ports of Fethiye and Özdere during 2008–2016. A total of 86 surveying operations were carried out, including 79 in the area between Fethiye and Alanya, the remaining ones were in Özdere in the southern Aegean coasts along the eastern Mediterranean Sea. The effect of the lunar phase on the swordfish catch rates, expressed in terms of kg · 1000 hooks–1, was examined by means of the Generalized Additive Modelling (GAMs) techniques. Results. The observed CPUE rates ranged from 0 to 700 kg · 1000 hooks–1. The mean swordfish CPUEs in the dark and light periods of the lunar cycle were equal to 178.10 ± 19.01 and 175.27 ± 19.56 kg · 1000 hooks–1, respectively. Although no significant differences among phases of the Moon were found (P > 0.05), CPUEs differed significantly between years (P < 0.05). Conclusion. It seems that the mechanism linking swordfish CPUE variations with the lunar cycle involves several factors, making difficult the identification of direct relations. Further studies are needed to better clarify the impact of the lunar phase on the longline gear, considering also additional parameters, such as light transition, prey abundance, physico-chemical characteristics of the marine environment, and the soak time of the gear.",

    "abstract": "Background. The diversity of wild trout stocks in Montenegro is compromised by insufficiently controlled stocking. Adriatic and Mediterranean areas show a high degree of endemism of the salmonid species, with numerous native Salmo taxa described. The invasive effect of brown trout, Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758, of the Atlantic haplogroup on the endemic Adriatic trout, Salmo farioides Karaman, 1938, in the drainage area of the Adriatic Sea basin is lower compared to the effect inflicted by S. trutta has on Salmo labrax Pallas, 1814 of the Danubian haplogroup. The presently reported study was intended to describe the genetic structure of the population of Adriatic trout, Salmo farioides, from the Mrtvica River, a right tributary of the Morača River, Montenegro, in order to get an insight into the spread of non-native strains and their introgression into the native Adriatic trout gene pool. Materials and methods. Trout specimens sampled from the lower section of the Mrtvica River from 2004 to 2007, and from its upper section in the spring of 2014, were analysed for their mtDNA haplotypes. Nuclear DNA markers (microsatellites, LDH-C1* gene) were also included in genetic analyses since mtDNA is inherited only maternally. After statistical analyses, relations between individuals from the upper and lower Mrtvica River were reconstructed. Results. Using both LDH-C1* and seven microsatellite loci with several alleles exclusive to S. trutta, an introgression was detected only in the upper reaches of the Mrtvica River, where only stream-dwelling trout form occurs. In the lower reaches no introgression was detected at all, as revealed by the absence of both the Atlantic mitochondrial haplotype and microsatellite alleles exclusive to S. trutta. Conclusion. The allelic frequency at seven microsatellite loci of Salmo spp. from the two river sections revealed very different population structure, as a consequence of a low rate of gene flow between them. In addition to the physical barrier that prevents Salmo sp. from the lower Mrtvica River to migrate to the upper river section, it seems that the opportunity to mate with the large pool of conspecifics, including lake-dwelling S. farioides (i.e., Salmo cf. dentex), prevents Salmo trutta from surviving at the lower stretch and spread to the rest of the Morača River and Lake Skadar systems.",

    "abstract": "Background. Striped seabream, Lithognathus mormyrus (Linnaeus, 1758), is a bony fish, which has a high economic value on the Algerian coast. Because of the increasing fishing pressure, however, a close monitoring is recommended. The information about the biology of this species, occurring in the south-western Mediterranean Sea and especially in the north African coast, is very limited. The presently reported study provides new estimated data on age and growth parameters of striped seabream in Algeria. Materials and methods. A total of 449 specimens of L. mormyrus were sampled for 2 years (January 2013 to December 2014) from the commercial fishery in the central part of the Algerian coast. The samples were collected monthly. The fish ranged in size from 11.5 cm to 34.5 cm and weighed between 21.6 g and 540.3 g. We analysed the sagittal otolith morphology and morphometry to determine a relation with the fish ontogeny. Fish age was determined from the sagittal otoliths to identify growth structures based on digitally processed otolith images aided by the TNPC software. Results. No significant difference between the two otoliths (left and right) was detected (ANCOVA, P &#707; 0.05). The correlation between each biometric parameter of the otolith (length and width) and fish length (TL) was significant (ANCOVA, P &lt; 0.05). The evolution of marginal increment analysis (MI) showed that the annual periodicity of the growth ring was between July and December. The growth parameters of the von Bertalanffy model were estimated for each sex separately. In females they assumed the following values:&nbsp; TL&infin; = 35.44 cm, K = 0.27 yr&ndash;1, and t0 = &minus;1.25 yr, while in males&mdash;TL&infin; = 26.94 cm and K = 0.6 yr&ndash;1, t0 = &minus;0.45 yr. The asymptotic length was higher in females than in males. Males were represented only by small specimens and less than or equal to four years of age. Conclusion. The presently reported results are the first ones on the age and growth of L. mormyrus off the Algerian coast. They will hopefully improve future stock management to get a sustainable fishery.",

In this study, we present the results concerning the growth, reproduction, and trophic activities of bleak, Alburnus alburnus (Linnaeus, 1758), a cyprinid fish recently introduced to Algeria. We need to show that this species is adapted to local conditions. We have also characterized the biological activity of the bleak and the impact of environmental parameters on this activity. Materials and methods. The fish sampling was carried out monthly from May 2008 through February 2012 in Keddara Dam Lake, from a single sampling station located in the proximity of the dam. We studied the biometric parameters of the fish, their length–weight relation, growth parameters, the reproductive and trophic activities, as well as the physical and chemical properties of the water. The data collected were processed and interpreted using selected biological indices. The climatic data were obtained from the Algerian National Office of Meteorology. The statistical analysis was performed using the R program. Results. The length–weight relation of bleak represented positive allometry. The females grew less rapidly than males between 2–3 years of age. Beyond this age, females grew faster. The condition factor of females and males indicated that environmental conditions were unstable and varied between poor and good. The sex ratio was in favour of females. The reproduction activity was relatively spread over time. During the year there were many phases of sexual maturation and several spawning periods (3–4), which started from the end of January and lasted until the end of July. The last late spawning was between November and December. The sexual rest period was observed between August and September. The hepatosomatic index, in both sexes, showed no great differences. Also, the viscerosomatic index was stable. However, the repletion index was steadily increasing throughout the year. The RDA analysis analysis allows characterizing the biological activity of the bleak and the impact of environmental parameters. Conclusion. We have characterized the biological and ecological variability of Alburnus alburnus in its new biotope and the relation of this species to the environmental parameters. This study brings new evidence for the adaptive potential of exotic species introduced in North Africa.",

    "abstract": "Background. Lake Tumba with a surface area of 830 km2 is very humic (pH = 3.6–4.6). The fishery is important for the riparian population but there are concerns about overfishing. The objective of this study was to assess changes in the fish species composition by comparing the presently reported survey (2005–2010) with earlier studies carried out in 1938–1939, 1955–1956, and 1959 Our hypothesis was that Lake Tumba had been overfished. Materials and methods. Fishing was done in the pelagial with gillnet (25 and 30 mm) and line with hooks at three sites within 166 days in 2005–2006 and 2009–2010. Results. A total of 40 species were identified. Five species were caught all years and at all sites, namely Chrysichthys cranchii (Leach, 1818), Chrysichthys ornatus Boulenger, 1902, Chrysichthys punctatus Boulenger, 1899, Mormyrops anguilloides (Linnaeus, 1758), and Tylochromis lateralis (Boulenger, 1898). Twelve species were only caught once. Weight Per Unit Effort (WPUE) differed with site and season: ranging from 0 to 4200 g · day–1 and the Number of fish Per Unit Effort (NPUE) varied from 0 to 27 fishes · day–1. Conclusion. Out of 49 pelagic species caught by Matthes in 1959, we considered five as diminished in numbers or even missing. This may be attributed to high fishing pressure. The protected site Mabali hosted the majority of previously reported species of which two were noted in Matthes's list but not caught by him. Many parameters demonstrated a \"positive\" difference between Mabali (which is protected from fishing) and the other sites. This site should be a reference area for future monitoring if its status can be maintained. A trend in the fishery based on interviews with fishers indicated a change from larger species to smaller. This was deemed a result of fishing pressure and nine species were identified as diminishing. The presently reported survey introduced quantitative aspects while earlier studies were qualitative. This impairs the ability to draw strong conclusions about overfishing and other anthropogenic activities. The threat of overfishing calls for the need for consistent quantitative monitoring of the fish population, including monitoring of waters in the drainage area, to enable assessment of impact of anthropogenic pressure.",

In this paper, we employed two distinct analytical methods to evaluate the stock status of Prochilodus nigricans Spix et Agassiz, 1829, the most important fish in the Amazonian freshwater landings. In this study, we intended to test the sustainability of small-scale fisheries comparing two different methods. Materials and methods. The population dynamic of P. nigricans was studied using length and weight data for fish caught in Manacapuru Lake and the lower stretch of the Solim&otilde;es River. Estimates of maximum sustainable yield and corresponding fishing mortality for 2012 and 2013, using Beverton&ndash;Holt curve, indicated an overfishing status for both years. At the same region, fishers were interviewed and their knowledge on the P. nigricans stock status was assessed using a stock assessment methodology based on fishers&rsquo; knowledge, known as ParFish. Results. Both yield per recruit curves employed to assess the stock status of P. nigricans in 2012 and 2013 and ParFish approach indicate an overfishing status, but ParFish also found a high uncertainty level around 47%. Conclusion. The use of ParFish algorithm and traditional knowledge can provide qualitatively similar results to conventional models, such as the Beverton&ndash;Holt approach. The ParFish approach shows the advantage including confidence intervals to its estimates.",

In addition, molecular barcoding Cox1 DNA sequences of subarctic Atlantic lophiiform taxa are included, where the material was available, many being produced as part of the Greenland fishes barcoding program, a continuous effort to register and barcode all Greenland fish species. The program has currently barcoded 220 taxa of approximately 300 known fish species observed in Greenland waters, with the ceratioid anglerfishes constituting one of the most problematic fish groups in the region in terms of sampling, identification, and taxonomic assignments using integrative taxonomy. Taxonomic issues based on molecular OTUs* are reported for the genera Caulophryne, Cryptopsaras, and Dolopichthys based on Cox1 data. Finally, a relatively large copepod parasite in the family Pennellidae was found on L. gracilispinis and constitutes one of only two copepod parasites recorded on ceratioid anglerfishes.",

A reliable taxonomic framework is a prerequisite for implementing effective stock management and conservation measures, but phylogeny and taxonomy of the Sciaenidae remain poorly resolved. As traditionally used morphological and single gene-based molecular markers carry a too limited phylogenetic signal for the task, mitochondrial phylogenomics may be a more suitable tool. The freshwater drum, Aplodinotus grunniens Rafinesque, 1819, is one of the few Sciaenidae species that live in freshwater habitats, which makes it an important model for studying the phylogeny and evolution of Sciaenidae. Materials and methods. We sequenced and characterized its mitogenome, and reconstructed the phylogeny of Sciaenidae using mitogenomes of 28 species. Results. The architecture of the mitogenome (16487 bp in length) is standard for this family, and three typical elements were identified in the control region: extended termination associated sequences, central conserved region, and conserved sequence block. Poor availability of sciaenid mitogenomes (especially those belonging to different lineages) prevented us from resolving the phylogeny of this family with confidence. Notably, our results indicate that Larimichthys and Collichthys species may belong to a single genus, and we suspect that the mitogenome of Chrysochir aureus (Richardson, 1846) has been misidentified taxonomically, and urge its resequencing. Conclusion. The sequencing of additional mitogenomes belonging to non-represented and poorly represented lineages is needed to facilitate the understanding of phylogeny and taxonomy of Sciaenidae.",

For that reason the integration of conventional (official data from fisheries landings) and unconventional (fishermen knowledge) sources of data, accompanied with the use of historical archives will outline the framework of the monitoring of freshwater resources.The presently reported study integrated local ecological knowledge of fishers, historical data, field surveys and scientific data to present better management options for a Mediterranean lentic system (Volvi Lake, northern Greece). Materials and methods. On-the-spot interviews were conducted with the professional fishers of Volvi Lake (northern Greece) in parallel with field surveys of environmental parameters during 2014–2015 and complemented with archival freshwater-related information. Results. The results of the presently reported study point to commercial fisheries as a declining activity, with little scope for a future, due to internal and external threats. This diagnostic can probably be generalized beyond the case study to other freshwater ecosystems in Europe, where decreasing fisheries productivity due to overfishing, habitat loss, and pollution, coupled with low economic productivity has led to an increased marginalisation of freshwater fisheries. Conclusion. The reported difficulties of freshwater fisheries could be bypassed through creation of fishers' typology regarding their dependence on fisheries. Upgrading the methodological approach followed by the official reporting system in freshwaters might also facilitate the fulfilment of the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive.",

    "abstract": "Background. The population of Lagocephalus spadiceus (Richardson, 1845), one of the Lessepsian species that migrated from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea through the Suez Canal, has been growing rapidly in Turkey in recent years. This situation poses a serious danger to fisheries and human health. There is little information about the biology of this species. The presently reported study permits a greater understanding of the age and growth characteristics of the pufferfish L. spadiceus from the Gulf of Iskenderun, north-eastern Mediterranean. Materials and methods. Samples were captured by commercial bottom trawlers at depths of 24&ndash;50 m during 9 trawling operations conducted during the fishing seasons between 2012 and 2013 in the Gulf of Iskenderun, north-eastern Mediterranean. Age determinations were carried out using vertebrae. Images of vertebrae suitable for age determination were obtained with a dissecting microscope. The index of the mean percentage error (IMPE) was calculated to assess the precision of the age determinations between two independent readers. Growth parameters for all individuals were then determined by fitting observed and length-at-age data using the von Bertalanffy growth equation. In addition, the condition factor (CF) was determined. Results. A total of 1116 specimens (529 females and 587 males) were sampled, ranging from 6.7 to 34.0 cm in total length and from 4.30 to 557.64 g in weight. The female-to-male ratio was 1:1.1. Age determination was conducted using vertebral band counts. The age of the examined specimens ranged from 0 to 10 years. One female individual was determined to be 17 years of age (45.6 cm and 1269.0 g). The von Bertalanffy growth equations were Lt = 47.21[1 &ndash; e&ndash;0.116(t + 2.04)] and Wt = 1296.18 [1 &ndash; e&ndash;0.116(t + 2.04)]2.846 for females, Lt = 46.36 [1 &ndash; e&ndash;0.133(t + 1.76)] and Wt = 1381.86 [1 &ndash; e&ndash;0.133(t + 1.76)]2.817 for males and Lt = 46.90 [1 &ndash; e&ndash;0.120(t + 1.97)] and Wt = 1345.67 [1 &ndash; e&ndash;0.120(t + 1.97)]2.831 for all individuals. The growth performance index (&#1060;&#39;) value was calculated as 2.421 for all individuals. The condition factor ranged from 0.890 to 2.768 for females and from 0.899 to 2.767 for males. Conclusion. It is very important to investigate L. spadiceus, an invasive species, in order to prevent its harmful effects on fisheries and human health. As this study is the first study on the age and growth of L. spadiceus in the north-eastern Mediterranean, it will significantly contribute to future ecosystem conservation and management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Background. The presently reported study was initiated in order to increase the available information on this species of commercial and sporting importance, thus the study aimed to identify possible differences in the shape of the sagitta otolith during the ontogenetic development of the common snook, Centropomus undecimalis (Bloch, 1792), sampled between May 2017 and April 2018 at the mouth of the São Francisco River along its estuary stretch (approximately 10 km). Morphometric study of otoliths is important as a support for future studies on the trophic ecology of ichthyophagous fishes and studies on fishing stocks using the contour of otoliths of this species. Materials and methods. The fish were sampled monthly at five sampling sites distributed between the mouth of the São Francisco River and the municipality of Brejo Grande. For the collection, a beach seine (30 m long, 2.8 m high, and 5 mm mesh between opposite knots) was used. In the laboratory, the otoliths were extracted, photographed, described morphologically, and the possible differences in their contour were analyzed using the wavelets. Results. We analyzed 148 otoliths grouped into six class intervals. Otolith shape varied from rounded to trapezoidal during the ontogenetic growth and showed a gradual decrease in the percentage of presence of the excisura ostii (absent in the largest specimens). PERMANOVA evidenced significant differences in the contour between the smallest size class and the others. For wavelet 4, the LDA correctly reclassified 47.97% otoliths in the size classes, with the best reclassifications occurring in the 5.0–10.0 (43.33%) and 10.1–15.0 cm (65.52%) intervals. While for wavelet 5, the LDA correctly reclassified 59.46% otoliths according to the size class, with the best reclassifications occurring in the length classes 5.0–10.0 (46.67%), 10.1–15.0 (75.86%), 15.1–20.0 (66.67%), and 20.1–25.0 cm (59.38%). Conclusion. The ontogenetic differences found both in the shape and in the otolith structures are important for the enhancement of knowledge on fish biology and indicate the need for further studies. The lack of such information on estuarine species makes it difficult to conduct studies on the trophic ecology and the management of these species.",

Questions on the health of aquatic habitats, on the potential effects of planned and accidental changes to the environment, and on the utility of adding sport and other fishes to a water body are best answered by an analysis which is known to be sensitive to changes. Materials and methods. As an initial test study I examined 107 fish species in and around the National Capital Region of Canada (50 km radius of the Peace Tower at the Parliament Buildings) in terms of 56 parameters.&nbsp; The parameters include life history characteristics such as size, lifespan, breeding season, egg numbers, and feeding, as well as zoogeographic origins, distribution, and risk status. Non-parametric tests and a logistic regression were used to analyze the data. Results. A test case comparison of sport versus non-sport fishes confirmed the empirical observation that sport fishes are predominately large piscivores. Critical parameters for threatened versus non-threatened species included piscivory and egg production, for present versus absent species feeding habits and refugial origin, and for refugial origin parameters associated with spawning. Conclusion. The parameter database can be of potential use to determine which species are at risk and which parameters are critical, why certain species are absent, and what parameters characterize sport fishes.&nbsp; The analysis forms a preliminary basis for more detailed field studies which can then be directed to specific life history traits and environmental variables.",

Fishes were caught in five sampling points during an annual cycle (1998) and in November of 2000, were measured with a digital calliper and weighed with a digital balance to obtain the standard length (SL) and weight (W). The LWR were obtained with two estimation methods: standardized major axis (SMA) and ordinary least squares (OLS). A total of 678 specimens were suitable for analysis. The estimates of LWR for Bathygobius soporator (Valenciennes, 1837) and Cyprinodon artifrons Hubbs, 1936 are presented here for first time, and for four species statistical differences with previous estimations of LWR were found (considering one or both estimation methods). With these results, the knowledge of LWR for tropical fish species is increasing and the importance of considering the estimation of LWR parameters using the standardized major axis method is discussed.",

MAJOR RIVERS AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICSThe Garhwal hills of the Central Himalaya are drained by many streams and rivulets {Figure 1).Almost all the valleys and glaciers individually are the sources of one or many streams of minor or major dimension.But, three major drainage systems emerge out of the southeren boundary of Garhwal Division and these follow their own courses the districts Saharanpur, Hardwar and Bijnore further to the Gangetic plains.These drainage systems are -1.The Yamuna River System -It drains the western parts of Garhwal hills (Uttar kashi, Tehri and Dehradun districts) and also the eastern Himachal Pradesh.The river Yamuna owes its origin from the Yamunotri glacier (3300 m) in Uttarkashi district and collects streams on the left and right side while proceeding through Purola, Barkot, Kalsi, Lakhwar, Dakpatthar tm it reaches to Paonta Sahib after covering a distance of over 150 km through deep gorges and valleys.The river Tons is the major tributary on side which contributes more water than the Yamuna itself, besides, it also receives many smaller streams through out entire sojourn.2. The Ganga River System -It is, in fact, the combination of two sub-systems -A.The river Bhagirathi tickles down from the Gomukh in Gangotri glaciers (within the physical boundaries of Uttarkashi district).Before coming down to Uttarkashi town (1158 m), it receives the Jarganga, Asiganga, other glacial -as well as non-glacial-fed streams and rivulets.During its further course, the Bhilangna (glacial-fed, originating from the Khatling glacier 3590 m in Tehri district) merges with it at Tehri (630 m) till further downwards at Deoparyag (472 m), Table 1Comparative values of physico-chemical parameters of the Godawari (tropical river)* and the Bhagirathi (hillstream)** s.",

    "abstract": "Background. Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (L.), are known to harbour significantly more sea lice, Caligus elongatus von Nordmann, 1832, than do Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar L. This research investigated whether this is due to differences in initial infection or to resettlement/loss of mobile adults. Skin mucus protein profiles and epidermal histology were also studied as two characteristics that might help explain interspecific differences in host susceptibility. Materials and methods. Atlantic salmon and Arctic charr were sampled from the sea-pen after 12 weeks of exposure to natural infection. Fishes were examined for sea lice counts and mucus was analysed for protein profiles using standard methods of poly-acrylamide gel electrophoresis. Epidermal tissue of fishes around chalimus attachment sites was also examined by transmission electron microscopy. Results. Interspecific differences in host susceptibility were determined not to be due to differences in initial infection rate, as charr and salmon had similar numbers of attached chalimi. Adult parasites were significantly more numerous on charr as a result of resettlement of adults lost by other fishes in the area. Gel electrophoresis indicated that salmon had a greater abundance of skin mucus proteins than charr, particularly in the 30-42 and 67-94 kDa range. Ultrastructural analysis of epidermal tissue indicated that charr had more mucous cells and showed evidence of possible osmotic stress. Interspecific differences also existed in intercellular adhesion characteristics. Salmon and charr showed a similar absence of inflammation around chalimus attachment sites. Conclusion. Artic charr had a more intense infection with Caligus elongatus than did salmon corresponding to fewer potentially antagonistic proteins in the mucus. Perhaps also, the epidermis of charr provides more easily accessible food for the sea lice. Higher levels of stress in charr in sea water may also have predisposed them to higher sea lice infections.",

Conclusion.The presently reported study shows that the sample analysed did not differ significantly from the population of the Dniepr River, although it differed significantly (in body proportions) from those of Lake Dàbie.The majority of values of meristic features did not differ significantly from those found in literature.However, there is still too little comparative material regarding internal meristic features and especially its osteology.",

The genus and the species need a thorough revision to identify specific characters of taxonomic importance as the descriptive information regarding the species in the genus Pycnocraspedum is limited to the holotypes and syntypes. Fifteen fresh specimens of P. squamipinne were collected from the Chennai coast, Tamil Nadu, Bay of Bengal region.

The morphometric and meristic characters of P. squamipinne were compared with those of syntypes and other species of the genus. Molecular analysis was carried out using partial mtDNA cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI). The specimen is deposited in the national fish repository of the ICAR, National Bureau of Fish Genetic Resources, Lucknow, India. A detailed redescription of P. squamipinne based on the syntypes and fifteen recently collected specimens are provided. A detailed comparison with other species of the genus is also provided which helps in establishing the taxonomic identity of P. squamipinne . Molecular information was generated which would help in the species identification of this rare deep-sea species. This study provides morphological and molecular information of the rare cusk eel, P. squamipinne , which would help in the precise identification of the species.

    "abstract": "Fishing with light is an old and common practice yielding a substantial catch volume globally. Despite the popularity of the method and the efforts to improve it, there is a lack of field studies on the effects of light on the feeding preferences of the attracted fishes. A previous report suggested that purse seine fishing lights can differentiate the feeding preferences of the approaching fishes, such as Atherina boyeri Risso, 1810 in Lake Trichonis (Greece). The presently reported study aims to verify these findings by investigating the diet of the endemic Scardinius acarnanicus Economidis, 1991. The feeding behavior of S. acarnanicus was studied from 2016 to 2019 through gut content analysis, in specimens from Lake Trichonis that came from purse seining with light and specimens caught without light. The same investigation was carried out comparatively in specimens taken by gillnets from two nearby lakes (lakes Ozeros and Amvrakia), where S. acarnanicus is present, but no fishing with light is exercised. The stomach content analysis conducted on 699 S. acarnanicus specimens revealed the intense effect of light on its diet resulting in the alteration of its feeding habits towards fish predation and especially Atherina boyeri . On the contrary, the specimens taken with the use of gillnets, from the three lakes, showed a typical omnivorous feeding behavior. The findings of the presently reported study support the assumption that the elevated concentration of fish close to fishing lights alters the feeding behavior of certain species making them predators. Considering that fishing with light is practiced worldwide, this could be of great ecological significance to the ichthyofauna not only of inland waters but also of marine areas, affecting perhaps several commercial species.",

Out of the 76 sharks and rays inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea, the length–weight relations (LWR) are available for 28 (37%) of them, usually for common small-sized species that are not protected and may be marketed. The aim of the presently reported study was to fill in the knowledge gap through the estimation of LWR of rare and uncommon sharks and rays in the Mediterranean Sea using the information from single records or few individuals. The analysis was based on a Bayesian hierarchical method for estimating length–weight relations in fishes that has been recently proposed for data-deficient species or museum collections and uses the prior knowledge and existing LWR studies to derive species-specific LWR parameters by body form. The use of this method was applied to single records of rare and uncommon species and here we report the LWR of 46 uncommon sharks and ray species, 14 of which are first reported LWR at a global scale and 21 are the first reported LWR for the Mediterranean Sea; the remaining 11 species are first time records for the western or eastern Mediterranean regions. Museum collections and sporadic catch records of rare emblematic species may provide useful biological information with the use of appropriate Bayesian methods.",

    "abstract": "The Indian butter catfish, Ompok bimaculatus (Bloch, 1794), is a high-value catfish that has gained immense consumer preference in South-East Asia. However, information on the nutritional requirements of this species is scanty. Hence, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of varying dietary lipid levels on growth, body composition, and activities of digestive and metabolic enzymes in larvae. Three isonitrogenous (40% crude protein) diets were formulated by supplementing fish and vegetable oil (1:1) at 4.5% (D1), 7% (D2), and 9.5% (D3) levels (containing crude lipid 5.7%, 8.0%, and 10.45%, respectively in diets D1–D3) to a fish meal- and oilcake-based formulated diet. Experimental diets were fed to butter catfish larvae (0.15 ± 0.01 g) in triplicate groups for a period of 42 days. Proximate compositions of the experimental diets, as well as fish carcass, were analyzed using standard procedures (AOAC 2005). Digestive and metabolic enzyme activities were analyzed at the completion of the experiment by standard methodology. Butter catfish larvae fed the diet D2 (8% crude lipid) resulted in the best performance in terms of weight gain (final weight 1.40 ± 0.07 g), net weight gain (1.31 ± 0.06 g), specific growth rate (5.50 ± 0.05% · day −1 ), and protein efficiency ratio (2.39 ± 0.17). The highest lipid deposition (2.90 ± 0.12%) in the carcass was also recorded in fish reared on diet D2. The final weight, net weight gain, protein efficiency ratio, and specific growth rate were significantly ( P &amp;lt; 0.05) higher in D2 having 8% lipid. Moisture and lipid contents of the whole body were significantly ( P &amp;lt; 0.05) higher in larvae fed diet D2. Amylase activity in fish significantly ( P &amp;lt; 0.05) decreased with increasing dietary lipid levels. The maximum alkaline protease, pepsin, and lipase activities were noticed in the larvae fed diet D2. Progressive decrease in liver glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities and significant increase ( P &amp;lt; 0.05) in the activities of neoglucogenic enzymes (glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bis phosphatase) were noticed with an increase in dietary lipid levels. Significantly lower ( P &amp;lt; 0.05) activities of LDH, ALT, and AST were recorded in the group fed diet D2. Results of the study indicated that 8% crude lipid in the diet could assure optimum growth and survival of butter catfish larvae during early development. An appraisal on growth, body composition, and digestive as well as metabolic function in the butter catfish larvae recorded in the study might provide some important information to consider application of formulated diets for the larviculture of Ompok bimaculatus .",

    "abstract": "Background. Tadpole codling, Salilota australis (G&uuml;nther, 1878), (known also as red cod) and southern blue whiting, Micromesistius australis Norman, 1937, are two commercially important species, which spawning grounds are situated in the Falkland waters. Nothing is known about duration of the embryonic development in these fish, whereas these data are necessary to study life cycle strategies as well as for stock management. Because of this, experiments with artificial egg fertilisation were carried out onboard a research boat that was the only way to obtain such an information. Materials and methods. Eggs from each species were taken from running females captured on their spawning grounds and then fertilised. Egg samples were collected every 6 hours and stage of embryonic development was assigned using a dissecting microscope. Results. Tadpole codling eggs are of 1.20&ndash;1.55 mm, with an oil globule of 0.29&ndash;0.33 mm, incubation takes between 140&ndash;150 h at 6&ndash;8.5&ordm;C, 40&ndash;45 degree-days. Larval size at hatching is ca 2.9 mm TL. Blue whiting eggs are of 1.40&ndash;1.55 mm with no oil globule. Development takes from 150 h at a mean temperature of 7.15&ordm;C to 200 h at between 5.5 and 6&ordm;C, 45&ndash;50 degree-days. Larval size at hatching is 2.8&ndash;3.0 mm. Conclusion. Duration of embryonic development for commercial southwest Atlantic gadiform fish, tadpole codling, Salilota australis, and southern blue whiting, Micromesistius australis, is documented for the first time. It allows to draw some conclusions about possible mortality during this ontogenetic stage (assuming that daily rates are similar to those in other similar species) and to hypothesise about possible egg transport by currents and interannual spawning grounds&rsquo; variability.",

Animals acquire new skills due to conditioned responses resulting from a sequence of neutral and unconditioned stimuli affecting their bodies; there is a constant time interval between the stimuli. Both stimuli become associated after a number of repetitions and animal bodies start to respond to the initially neutral stimulus as to the unconditioned one. The aim of this study was to determine whether exposure of fish to a pyrethroid&mdash;deltamethrin (an active ingredient in Decis 2.5 EC pesticide that disturbs the proper operation of the nervous system) affects the ability to learn in common carp. Materials and methods. Production of new types of behaviour was triggered in fish by using the unconditioned stimulus (an irritating electric impulse) and the conditioned stimulus (light). The experiment was performed in a tank divided into two compartments where fish could swim freely from one compartment to another. The ability to learn was assessed on the basis of the following types of behaviour evoked in response to the conditioned stimulus:&nbsp; locomotor agitation, preference to occupy or avoid certain areas in the tank, an escape response, etc. Results. In fish exposed to 0.35 &mu;g&middot; L&ndash;1 deltamethrin (for common carp concentration 10 times lower than lethal) for 35 minthe ability to produce and remember the conditioned defence response was reduced and time interval since presenting the conditioned stimulus till occurring the initial signs of the conditioned response was prolonged. Conclusion. The classical conditioning method revealed that sublethal concentration of deltamethrin restricted ability to learn and retain information in common carp, despite absence of observable intoxication symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Background. The reticulated dragonet, Callionymus reticulatus, was originally described based on a single specimen, the holotype from Malaga, Spain, south-western Mediterranean, probably collected before 1831. The holotype is now disintegrated; the specific characteristics are no longer discernible. The species was subsequently recorded from several north-eastern Atlantic localities (Western Sahara to central Norway), but missing in the Mediterranean. Materials and methods. Specimens of C. reticulatus were observed and collected during two cruises in 2014 and 2016 in the Balearic Islands off Mallorca and Menorca. The collected specimens (8 females) have been deposited in the collection of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJ). All individuals of C. reticulatus were collected from beam trawl samples carried out during the DRAGONSAL0914 in September 2014, and during the MEDITS_ES05_16 bottom trawl survey in June 2016, on shelf and slope bottoms around the Balearic Islands. Both surveys used a &lsquo;Jennings&rsquo; beam trawl to sample the epi-benthic communities, which was the main objective of the DRAGONSAL0914 and a complementary objective in the MEDITS_ES05_16. The &lsquo;Jennings&rsquo; beam trawl has a 2 m horizontal opening, 0.5 m vertical opening and a 5 mm diamond mesh in the codend. Trawls had duration of 1 to 3 min of effective sampling (bottom time) at a speed of 2 knots. Catches were sorted out to species and standardized abundances of callionymid species (individuals per 500 m2) were obtained by calculating the sampled surface (distance covered &times; beam trawl horizontal opening). Results. Callionymus reticulatus is recorded from the Balearic Islands for the first time; the specimens are described and illustrated. Conclusion. The new record confirms that the species is still extant in the Mediterranean. A key to Mediterranean callionymid fishes is provided to distinguish C. reticulatus from other species of the family in the area. The callionymid fish fauna of the Mediterranean now comprises 11 species, including three Lessepsian migrants originating from the Red Sea.",

    "abstract": "Background. Oxidative stress poses a serious threat to farmed fish, exemplified by depressed growth, decreased disease resistance, and reduced flesh quality. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine differences in activity of antioxidant enzymes and concentration of selected biochemical parameters between blood plasma of both sexes of three species important for sustainable development of aquaculture: tench, Tinca tinca (Linnaeus, 1758); wels catfish, Silurus glanis Linnaeus, 1758; and sterlet, Acipenser ruthenus Linnaeus, 1758. Materials and methods. Experimental fishes were fed ad libitum for 60 days with a formulated diet (45% proteins, 20% fat, 16% carbohydrates, 8% ash and 2% fibre). At the end of the study venous blood samples were collected and 11 biochemical parameters were assessed: superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), total antioxidant capacity (FRAP), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin, albumin, and uric acid. Results. Comparison between species revealed that the most significant differences were observed for tench and sterlet (in FRAP, GPx, CAT, GST LDH, ALT, bilirubin, and uric acid), less significant&mdash;for sterlet and wels (in FRAP, GST, LDH, AST, bilirubin, uric acid), followed by tench and wels catfish (in FRAP, GPx, GST, AST, and uric acid). Moreover, significant variations in the level of biochemical markers were also detected between sexes within each species, where the highest number was observed for tench (in FRAP, GPx, albumin, and uric acid), next wells catfish (in SOD, albumin, and bilirubin), and the lowest in sterlet (in ALA). Additionally, numerous differences in antioxidant potential (FRAP), antioxidant defence indices, as well as in markers of liver function, heart dysfunction, and markers of nutritional status were observed as species-specific and sex-specific. Conclusion. Results obtained in this study for the first time demonstrated species- and sex-related differences in plasma activity of antioxidant enzymes and concentration of selected biochemical parameters between tench, wels catfish, and sterlet reared in cage culture. The presented findings provide significant contribution not only to the existing knowledge of fish physiology but will also help to design optimal feeding practices to achieve sustainable cage aquaculture.",

The morphological and preserved coloration characters were compared with the data from the limited type material and the alternative preserved coloration diagnostic character was suggested. The first data on alive and freshly dead coloration are reported. The phylogenetic analysis was performed on sequenced COI , cytochrome b, and rhodopsin genes.

    "abstract": "European perch, Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758 and roach, Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758) are the most common species present in mesotrophic and eutrophic lakes throughout Europe. Their biomass, especially in juvenile stages, contributes the most to the fish production of these ecosystems. In Bovan Reservoir, these two species constitute the bulk of the juvenile fish biomass. This study aimed to investigate the feeding composition of these two species in order to evaluate their niche overlap due to the availability of resources during different seasons. Traditional diet analysis indices and Kohonen artificial neural network (i.e., a self-organizing map, SOM) were used to investigate the diet of 158 individuals of both species and evaluate their food niche overlap. The indicator value (IndVal) was applied to identify indicator food categories based on which the contents of their alimentary tracts were grouped first into neurons and then into clusters on the SOM. Our results showed that juvenile fish used zooplankton and benthic prey in their diet. Roach often fed on nonanimal prey, while perch of age 0+ used fishes in the diet. Additionally, four clusters of neurons were isolated on the SOM output network. The distribution of perch and roach alimentary tracts in neurons indicated no high degree of competition between them. While diet analyses indices show which food category is generally important in specimensʼ diet, the SOM recognizes those specimens and arranges them together into the same or adjacent neurons based on dominant prey. Understanding fish feeding habits is critical for the development of conservation and management plans. Since Bovan is a eutrophic reservoir, our knowledge of fish feeding habits needs to be considered for stocking strategies in the future.",

As oocyte counting is labour-intensive, little attention is generally paid to changes in oocyte numbers in oogenesis analysis. Materials and methods. Anterior, middle, and posterior ovarian segments from three pre-spawning female roach, Rutilus rutilus (L.) were fixed in buffered formalin, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin. Serial 10-&micro;m sections were cut with a microtome and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. This paper compares two methods for determining the frequency distribution of oocytes at different maturity phases and their occurrence in particular segments of the ovaries in roach, Rutilus rutilus: counting oocytes in serial microtome sections and the use of Abercrombie&prime;s formula. Results. Differences between frequency distributions determined by the two methods were statistically insignificant (P &gt; 0.05), as were the frequency distributions of oocytes in different ovarian segments. Conclusion. Determination of frequency distribution of oocytes at different maturity phases can therefore be achieved with the less time- and labour-intensive method of using Abercrombie&prime;s formula.",

    "abstract": "Background. Proteolytic enzymes may serve multiple functions: they may inhibit the host′s blood clotting, protect the parasite from the host ′s immune response, facilitate parasite′s migration within a tissue by decomposing the tissue barrier, enhance the hatching and moulting of larvae, and play an important role in their feeding. Learning their identity leads to a better understanding of a host-parasite system. The objective of this study was to check, using biochemical methods, if, in addition to proteases, ES products and extracts of 3rd and 4th larval stages of Anisakis simplex (Rudolphi, 1809) contain other hydrolases. Materials and methods. Stage-3 larvae (L 3 ) of A.simplex were removed from Baltic herring, Clupea harengus membras Linnaeus, 1761 caught in the Baltic Sea. Stage-4 larvae (L 4) were obtained from an L 3 stage culture kept in Eagle ′s medium. The solutions containing ES products were collected and dialysed at 4°C against distilled water for 24 h. Larval extracts were obtained by homogenising the larvae in a physiological saline (0.9 % NaCl) solution in a glass homogeniser. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 G. The supernatant was used in enzyme activity assays. Enzymatic activity of ES products and homogenates of L 3 and L 4 larvae of A. simplex was determined with the API ZYM test. Results. The excretion-secretion product of L 3 and L 4 larvae of A. simplex revealed activities of 10-and 11 hydrolases, respectively. Activity of esterase, esterase lipase, valine arylamidase, and N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase in the L 4 larvae extracts was higher than the activity of a corresponding enzyme assayed in the L 3 extracts. Only in the case of acid phosphatase, its activity in L 3 ES products was twice that of the activity found in ES products of L 4 larvae. Enzymes such as trypsin, chymotrypsin, and β-glucosidase were not detected in extracts from L 3 larvae. Conclusion. Activities of most hydrolases in the L 4 extracts were higher than the activities of corresponding enzymes assayed in the L 3 extracts. The high activity of these enzymes found in L 4 larval extracts could be related to a different feeding mechanism of stage-4 larvae.",

Conclusion.The temperature-related regulation of the ventilation volume in carp is a two-step process.At 10-15°C the increased water volume pumped through the gills was achieved by an increased breathing depth (stroke volume).A further increase of the ventilation volume at 15-25°C resulted from acceleration of the breathing rate.",

We intended to compare the occurrence of eyeflukes in fish from two, distinctly demarcated pools of the lake, differing in environmental conditions. The effect of fish size and sampling season on the infection parameters was analysed and the present state of the parasite faunas was compared to the literature data. Materials and methods. Within 1998 and 1999, a total of 1091 fishes representing 8 dominant species was examined. Samples were collected four times a year (in May, July, August, and October) simultaneously from the eastern- and western parts of the lake. Results. Diplostomum spp. occurred in all the fish examined, numerously in roach, rudd, white bream, and carp bream. The parasite was less abundant in northern pike, crucian carp, and European perch. Tylodelphys clavata was found in roach and it sporadically occurred in northern pike, rudd, white bream, carp bream, and European perch. The infection rates of rudd and white bream in the eastern part of the lake were significantly higher than the respective values from the western part. The infection with both eyeflukes did not correlate with the fish length. The infection of roach, rudd, white bream, and carp bream with Diplostomum spp. and roach with T. clavata varied significantly in different experimental periods. Conclusion. The eyeflukes as well as P. cuticola were sensitive indicators, reflecting the environmental pressure-both, spatial differences in ecological conditions within the same water body and long-term alterations. Diplostomum spp. did not accumulate with the age of fish. No seasonality was found for Diplostomum spp. or Tylodelphys clavata. Locationdependent occurrence of Diplostomum spp. in rudd and white bream indicated a limited fish interchange between the two pools of the lake.",

Most abundant were remains of carp bream (Abramis brama), zander (Sander lucioperca), roach (Rutilus rutilus), tench (Tinca tinca), wels catfish (Silurus glanis), European perch (Perca fluviatilis), northern pike (Esox lucius), and sturgeon (Acipenser sturio).Conclusion. The majority of fish species targeted by early-mediaeval fishermen are also very important in the present-day fisheries in the area. It can be presumed that intensive sturgeon fishery in early Middle Ages markedly contributed to the species&prime; extinction from the area.",

    "abstract": "Background. The gudgeon is a small fish of limited economic importance. Species of the genus Gobio bear a strong superficial resemblance to one each other, what has led to the misidentification of Central European gudgeons for many years. Consequently, accurate information about Polish populations of gudgeon is still scarce and more studies are needed to fill this gap. The purpose of the presently reported study is to describe the gudgeon on the basis of its morphological characters and to compare the results published by other authors. Materials and methods. A total of 46 specimens of the gudgeon, Gobio gobio, were caught in the Zimnik Stream, the SkĂłra system, the Odra River drainage, western Poland, in October 2002. For each fish, 24 biometric features of the body and 20 features of the skull were measured. Selected meristic features (external and internal) were determined. Cephalic sensory canals were studied and their pores were counted. Results. The coefficient of variation for the body proportions of the sample of gudgeon from the Odra River drainage ranges from 1.7% to 7.2% and its principal features are as follows: D III 7&ndash;9; A III 6&ndash;7; P I 11&ndash;15; V I 6&ndash;8; l.l. 37&ndash;41. Two rows of pharyngeal teeth are present, most frequently, in 2.5&ndash;5.2 pattern. The total number of vertebrae ranges from 46 to 48 (mean 47.38). Conclusion. This study shows that the sample analyzed has the shortest head length in relation to other measurements and the body length, as compared to other populations from Polish rivers. The majority of values of meristic features do not differ significantly from those found in literature. The presently provided internal meristic and osteological features of gudgeon are among very few such data available.",

    "abstract": "Background. The usage of common carp pituitaries has been associated with very high costs, resulting from sacrificing the valuable broodstock. A close taxonomic proximity between the Common carp, Cyprinus carpio L., and Prussian carp, Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782), reflected in the presence of high levels of the homologous carp LH hormone in Prussian carp pituitaries, was recently demonstrated. This prompted the present authors to evaluate the Prussian carp pituitaries as a less expensive alternative to carp pituitaries, for inducing spawning in common carp. Materials and methods. Prussian carp were fished in Lake Pamvotis (NW Greece) on April 4, 2007 and 204 pituitaries were extracted and processed. Accordingly, the prepared pituitary liquid extract was injected in 30 female common carp (experimental group) in the State Carp Hatchery in Psathotopi, (western Greece). Common carp pituitary extract was used for the hypophysation of female common carp in the control group (n = 30). In both groups, standard hatchery procedures were followed concerning broodstock handling during the artificial propagation of common carp. Fertilized eggs were incubated in 7-L Zugar jars after removing the sticky substrate and hatching percentage was calculated. Results. Spawning success was 73.3%, total egg yield was 5.94 kg, total relative fecundity was 112.5 g &#183; kg-1 of body weight (150.0 g &#183; kg-1 of body weight based on fertile broodstock), and hatching percentage reached 85.2%. Statistically, all the above performance values were not significantly different compared to the controls. Conclusion. Taking advantage of a natural resource practically unexploited, the use of Prussian carp pituitaries in the artificial propagation of common carp was equally effective to common carp pituitaries, contributing to lower running costs in the hatchery.",

This report confirms the occurrence of Chinese fanray, Platyrhina sinensis (Bloch et Schneider, 1801), in the seawaters of Zhoushan by analysing nine specimens of the Chinese fanray obtained in Zhujiajian from May 2017 to December 2017. The morphometric measurements and meristic counts were taken. The principal characters that are conclusive for the species were consistent with P. sinensis and were sufficient for separation of the examined specimens from other Platyrhina species. In addition, the fragment of 12S rRNA was also sequenced for the purpose of classification. The mean genetic distance within P. sinensis group was 0.71%, group mean distance between P. sinensis and other Platyrhina species ranged from 6.01% to 7.71%. Species were also separated from each other at the genetic level. Given the Chinese fanray has not been reported to exist in this region, our findings represent the first record from Zhoushan and extend the distribution range of this species into the north of the East China Sea. The reason behind the observed northward migration of some P. sinensis individuals from their southern habitat might be global warming. Collection of many additional specimens is needed to better define the geographic limits of the Chinese fanray.",

The fish collected were Barbus barbus (Linnaeus, 1758), Salvelinus fontinalis (Mitchill, 1814), and Scophthalmus rhombus (Linnaeus, 1758). Their taxonomic identity was confirmed through genetic analyses using DNA extracted from fin clips. The stomach contents were examined, and age was determined by otolith or scale readings. Parasitological examinations focused on the skin, vitreous humour, eye lenses, mouth and nasal cavities, gills, gonads, viscera, and muscles. Furthermore, the changes of fish species composition over 20 years in Pomeranian Bay were analysed. The sequence comparisons against GenBank records revealed that sequences obtained for B. barbus and S. rhombus from Pomeranian Bay represent new rhodopsin barcodes. Record of the juvenile B. barbus in this study is the first in the Baltic Sea. Scophthalmus rhombus is a new host for the ciliate Trichodina jadranica, while Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814) is a new food item in the diet of S. rhombus in the Baltic Sea. Acanthocephalan Pomphorhynchus laevis found in the adult specimen of B. barbus and myxozoan Myxobolus musculi, noted in the juvenile specimen, have not been recorded previously in this fish species in Polish waters. Species collected as bycatch can potentially be used for monitoring potential changes in the overall fish community structure and biodiversity.",

Diets, feeding ecology, and feeding strategies of several mangrove fish species have not been studied off the coast of Maranh&atilde;o, which is exposed to a significant tidal regime. This includes also the largescale foureyed fish, Anableps anableps (Linnaeus, 1758). The aim of the presently reported study was to characterize diet, feeding strategies and seasonal patterns of the diet of A. anableps. Materials and methods. The sampling was carried out in S&atilde;o Marcos Bay between May 2007 and April 2008 using block nets. The stomach fullness index was used for stomach content analysis. Dietary items were identified and parameters such as the prey-specific abundance and the frequency of occurrence were calculated. The feeding strategy was analysed with the aid of the Costello diagram. Seasonal patterns in the feeding behaviour and similarity in diet composition were also analysed. Results. Diet composition did not differ between seasons but stomach fullness was greater in wet season months. The diet of A. anableps consisted of a mixture of epiphytic microalgae and macroalgae, insects, crustaceans, molluscs, fishes, and digested material such as mud and detritus. Insects represented the greatest richness among the food items. The Costello diagram revealed that A. anableps had a generalist feeding strategy, with a dominance of macroalgae, insect, and fishes. A broad niche was also found, as indicated by a strong association with interphenotypical components. Conclusion. This study presents data that confirm the forage characteristic of A. anableps and the influence of seasonality on its feeding behavior, in which the species takes advantage of the greater availability of food due to runoff and the larger flooded area, during the wet season. Further studies should be carried out to determine the energy needs of this species in satisfying its reproductive demands as well as the abundance of food resources in the surrounding environment and the confirmation of the generalist feeding strategy.",

This two-year study investigated the fertility, size at first maturity (L50), sex ratio, gonad maturity stage, and gonadosomatic index of three native livebearer fish species, Goodea atripinnis Jordan, 1880; Ameca splendens Miller et Fitzsimons, 1971; and Zoogoneticus purhepechus Domínguez-Domínguez, Pérez-Rodríguez et Doadrio, 2008. Environmental variables were evaluated, with respect to the reproductive variables, using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis. Results. Three hundred and eighty-three specimens of G. atripinnis, 319 of A. splendens, and 170 of Z. purhepechus were examined. Goodea atripinnis was widely distributed along the river, presenting a complete size structure. The endemic species (A. splendens and Z. purhepechus) showed lower abundance downstream. The native species presented two reproductive periods: January through March and July through September. The sex ratio is 1 ÷ 1 (female ÷ male) and the fertility was lower compared to other species in other river basins. The NMDS analysis showed that the native species are associated with clean, deeper waters that present higher dissolved oxygen and a neutral pH. Conclusion. The lower population abundance of native species downstream in the river is due to the fact that the goodeid species are less tolerant to pollution and cannot reproduce successfully in polluted water. These species have to adapt to the anthropogenic activities that have modified the river, affecting their habitat. In spite of this perturbation, there are no specific conservation actions underway to maintain biological diversity in the Teuchitlán River.",

    "abstract": "Background. Fisheries activities are rarely documented in the marine and coastal protected areas in Turkey. This study aimed to determine the catch composition of set longline fishery in the Fo&ccedil;a Special Environmental Protection Area (Turkey), and to understand the effects of factors (e.g., bait type, hook size, and soak time) on the catch per unit effort (CPUE) and the size of species caught. Materials and methods. Samples were collected by small-scale fishing boats in 2007 at depths ranging from 1 to 50 m. Kruskal&ndash;Wallis test was used to understand if the CPUE changes depended on the fishery specific factors (hook size and bait type). Mann&ndash;Whitney U test was used to test if CPUE changes depended on sampling seasons (autumn and summer). Chi-square test was used to determine whether hook size influenced the body size of two commonly caught species. Results. The following 25 fish species were caught, Diplodus sargus, Sparus aurata, Diplodus vulgaris, Boops boops, Lithognathus mormyrus, Oblada melanura, Conger conger, Trachurus sp., Spondyliosoma cantharus, Pagellus erythrinus, Pagrus pagrus, Dentex dentex, Sciaena umbra, Scorpaena scrofa, Belone belone, Serranus sp., Myliobatidae gen. sp., Muraena helena, Sarpa salpa, Diplodus annularis, Coryphaena hippurus, Diplodus puntazzo, Chelidonichthys lucerna, Scomber japonicus, and Dicentrarchus labrax. The most commonly caught species were white seabream, Diplodus sargus and gilthead seabream Sparus aurata. The hook size and bait type were important factors that influenced the CPUE. Moreover, the hook size significantly influenced the body size of caught white seabream and gilthead sea bream. Conclusion. The discard level was low in the set longline fishery in the Fo&ccedil;a Special Environmental Protection Area. We recommend using 12 sized hooks rather than 13 to reduce the discards of the main target species in the Fo&ccedil;a SEPA. Nevertheless, this also needs an economic assessment, and also identification and use any incentives to promote the shift in the use of larger size hooks. Minimum size limits to be set in the fisheries legislation and alternative bait use studies were also recommended.",

This study was initiated to see the effect l-carnitine on the growth, feed utilization, and survival rates of goldfish, Carassius auratus (Linnaeus, 1758), one of the most cultivated aquarium fish species in the world. This experiment was carried out since there was no previous study on the effect of the l-carnitine on goldfish. Materials and methods. In this study, five isonitrogenous, isolipidic, and isoenergetic diets (40% protein, 6% lipid, and 14.82 MJ &middot; kg&ndash;1 digestible energy, respectively) were formulated. The diets were supplemented with l-carnitine at the dose of 250, 500, 750, and 1000 mg &middot; kg&ndash;1 with a non-supplemented diet as control. Goldfish fry was reared in a 65 L glass tank containing aged water. Each dietary treatment was tested in triplicate groups of 20 fish per glass tank. Experimental fish (0.311 &plusmn; 0.01 g initial weight) were fed the diets twice daily to apparent satiation for 84 days. In the experiment, diets were evaluated based on growth performance and diets utilization. Results. Supplemental dietary l-carnitine has beneficial effects on improving growth performance, feed conversion ratio, specific growth rate, and protein efficiency ratio in goldfish fry. Conclusion. This study provides first data on the effect of l-carnitine on growth, feed utilization, and survival rates of goldfish. Future research should focus on the growth performance, and feed utilization parameters of other ornamental fish of different conditions of l-carnitine supplemented diets.",

    "abstract": "Background. Two North American fish species have been particularly successful in Iberian reservoirs, the largemouth black bass, Micropterus salmoides (Lacep&#232;de, 1802) and the pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbosus (Linnaeus, 1758), but information on their ecology is still scarce, limiting their effective management and control. To increase the knowledge about the ecological mechanisms underlying bass and pumpkinseed invasion of freshwater systems, their feeding ecology and population descriptors are contrasted in two Iberian reservoirs differing in available resources. Materials and methods. The studied reservoirs, situated in tributary streams of the Guadiana River, were sampled during the same months for a total of eight times, spanning two years. Fish samples were made by using electrofishing from a boat in the littoral area and trammel nets. Zooplankton and littoral benthic invertebrates were sampled concurrently with fish sampling. Fish diet was studied by examining individual stomach contents. The dominance of the different items in the diet of each species size-class was determined using the modified Costello diagram, diet overlap was estimated with Pianka&#8217;s index and prey selection was assessed with the Manly-Chesson&#8217;s alpha. Back-calculated length-at-age and body condition were also assessed for each fish. Results. Invertebrates were dominant in the diet of pumpkinseed whereas invertebrates and pumpkinseed dominated the diet of bass. Both species demonstrated an overall dietary opportunism and a considerable food spectrum, with pumpkinseed eating fish and macrophytes. Feeding selectivity was observed that varied with species, size-class, reservoir and sampling period. Fish became the main prey for larger bass and the shift to piscivory was related to pumpkinseed availability. The dietary changes associated with pumpkinseed growth in native environments were not observed in the reservoirs. Dietary overlaps varied with sampling period, being frequently high. Differences in abundance, growth and body condition of bass and pumpkinseed were evident between reservoirs. Conclusion. The ability to use several food items and to feed opportunistically likely facilitated the widespread success of the centrarchids in variable Iberian reservoirs. Moreover, our results seem to support the occurrence of resource competition between pumpkinseed size classes and between smaller bass and pumpkinseed.",

    "abstract": "Background. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), among them polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are able to change the hormonal regulation of reproduction at the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in many vertebrates. The aim of the presently reported study was to determine the effects of highly chlorinated PCBs mixture—Delor 106—on the in vivo and in vitro luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion from the pituitary gland of female Prussian carp, Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782), at the time of natural spawning. Materials and methods. In the in vivo experiment we tested exposure to Delor 106: acute (one week at the concentration of 700 ng · L–1) and chronic (5 weeks at increasing weekly concentrations, from 140 through 700 ng · L–1). Blood samples from all females were taken before intoxication (0 week) and subsequently every week (week 1 through 5) till the end of the experiment. In the in vitro experiment enzymatically dispersed pituitary cells obtained from sexually mature Prussian carp females were incubated for 5 or 24 h in the presence of Delor 106 at the concentrations of: 1, 5, 10, 50, or 100 ng · mL–1 of medium. LH levels in the incubation medium as well as in blood plasma were measured using ELISA method. Results. Long-term (3 and 4 weeks) exposure to the Delor 106, gradually added to the water, caused a significant elevation of spontaneous LH secretion. Pituitary cells incubation with Delor 106 at the concentration range from 10 through 100 ng · mL–1 of medium resulted in the significant increase of spontaneous LH secretion after 5 and 24 h. Conclusion. The results obtained in this study show that highly chlorinated biphenyl—Delor 106—changes the secretion of luteinizing hormone in Prussian carp in the spawning season, acting, at least in part, directly at the pituitary level.",

    "abstract": "Background. Dawkinsia tambraparniei (Silas, 1954) is confined to an area not exceeding 100 km2 within a single watershed&#8212;the Tamiraparani River, southern Western Ghats, India. Its populations have recently declined, earning the fish the endangered status. For effective conservation efforts it is important to determine the levels of genetic variation between different populations. Therefore we attempted to quantify the cytochrome b (Cyt b) and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequence similarity between different populations of D. tambraparniei, as well as to study the phylogenetic relation with the closely related species D. arulius and D. filamentosa. Materials and methods. Samples were collected from 9 locations and 10 individuals from each were preserved for DNA analysis. The partial sequence of Cyt b and COI genes were amplified and sequenced. The sequences were aligned by the visual method using BioEdit version 7.1.3.0 and edited using Sequencer 4.7. The Bayesian consensus tree was constructed using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method by BEAST v1.7.5. Results. The partial sequences of Cyt b and COI from 90 specimens of Dawkinsia tambraparniei representing nine populations were examined. The Cyt b gene sequences showed that all populations belong to a single haplotype and no nucleotide variation was observed between populations. In the case of COI gene sequences, two haplotypes were revealed: an additional haplotype with a clear transition of C to T at the nucleotide 58 position was detected within the Thalayanai Stream population. The phylogenetic analysis of COI gene demonstrated that the pair wise genetic distance between D. tambraparniei and D. arulius was low (0.004 &#177; SE 0.003) when compared with the distance between D. tambraparniei and D. filamentosa (0.061 &#177; SE 0.012). Conclusion. The mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed very low diversity among investigated populations of D. tambraparniei for studied genes, with the only local population from the Thalayanai Stream demonstrating certain divergence. The phylogenetic analysis confirms the concept on the validity of D. tambraparniei as a separate species. This phylogenetic study also demonstrated that D. tambraparniei is closer to D. arulius, followed by D. filamentosa.",

Results. The establishment of partial reserves in both MPAs, with different regulations imposed on professional and recreational fishing has not proven successful in achieving benefits for a sedentary, relatively long-lived target species such as Phycis phycis. Results of multi-annual research indicate no significant difference in the abundance, mean size, or age of P. phycis between the fishing zones of different protection levels in either of the studied MPAs.

In this study, we examined the mRNA expression of three globins in tongue sole under short-term hypoxia. Materials and methods. Using bioinformatics analysis, three globin genes including hemoglobin-&alpha;1 (Hb-&alpha;1), myoglobin (Mb), and cytoglobin (Cygb) were first obtained from tongue sole EST database. Then, their expression levels in different tissues of tongue sole under short-term hypoxia were detected using quantitative real-time PCR method. Results. Under short-term hypoxia, Hb-&alpha;1 significantly increased in all the tissues except intestine and stomach. The Cygb expression level was up-regulated from 5 min to 120 min, whilst changed to normal level at 36 h. Mb was only up-regulated in blood and heart at 120 min. But, as the hypoxia prolonged, there was a mild increase of Mb in blood, heart, spleen, and liver. Conclusion. The three globins of tongue sole were up-regulated in some tissues, but their role may be different in different stage of hypoxia. Hb and Cygb might play role in the earlier stage, while Mb might play role in the late stage of hypoxia.",

    "abstract": "Background. Turkey is one of the major European seed producers of European sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax (Linnaeus, 1758), and gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata Linnaeus, 1758.&#160; Determination of susceptibility to viral haemorrhagic septicaemia (VHS), a notifiable disease in Europe, is crucial particularly for sea bass and sea bream seed production to develop control measures and to take necessary actions in case of a VHS outbreak.&#160; We hypothesized that VHS virus does not replicate at 16&#176;C and above&#8212;the temperature range typical for hatcheries in the Aegean region. Materials and methods. To assess the seasonal occurrence and virulence of viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus genogroup Ie (VHSV-Ie), a virological survey was conducted in cultured sea bass in the Black Sea. Thirty-five sea bass were sampled monthly from a local marine farm, and examined virologically.&#160; Triplicate groups of juvenile of sea bass (n = 30 per replicate or n = 40 per replicate) and gilthead sea bream (n = 20 per replicate) were challenged by immersion with VHSV-Ie at 12&#176;C and 16&#176;C to determine the occurrence of pathogen transfer and viral replication.&#160; Results. VHSV-Ie, or any other viral pathogen able to infect BF-2 and CHSE-214 cells, did not occur in cultured sea bass of the Turkish Black Sea region. It was impossible to infect sea bass at 16&#176;C but moderate levels of mortality occurred at 12&#176;C. Sea bream, however, were susceptible to VHSV-Ie, presenting low levels of mortality (15%). Conclusion. VHSV-Ie poses no risk to the production of sea bass seed carried out at 16&#176;C and above, but sea bass and sea bream should be monitored for VHSV-Ie where ambient water temperature is below 16&#176;C since the risk of introduction is present.&#160",

    "abstract": "Background. Karyological studies of acipenserid fishes are of great importance because they present the only direct method to evaluate their ploidy levels for further research on polyploid evolution in these fishes. They are also important for prediction of the results of interspecific hybridizations in sturgeon aquaculture. None of the species of the genus Pseudoscaphirhynchus has hitherto been studied karyologically. The aim of this paper was to present the first data on the karyotype of the dwarf form of Pseudoscaphirhynchus kaufmanni (Kessler, 1877). Materials and methods. Three females of the dwarf form of Pseudoscaphirhynchus kaufmanni of the total body length 19&#8211;23 cm were caught in the Vakhsh River (Amu Darya River drainage), Tadzhikistan, in 2012. The chromosome slides were prepared by using previously published karyological method of Vasil&#8217;ev and Sokolov. Totally, 14 metaphase plates were analyzed. Results. The karyotype of Pseudoscaphirhynchus kaufmanni consists of 118&#8211;120 chromosomes and includes about 18&#8211;20 large bi-armed chromosomes, about 32&#8211;34 small bi-armed chromosomes, from one to two pairs of large acrocentrics, and about 64 small acrocentrics or microchromosomes. Conclusion. The karyological study revealed that Pseudoscaphirhynchus kaufmanni belongs to low-chromosome acipenserid group with about 120 chromosomes. Its karyotype demonstrates noticeable differences from the karyotype of the shovelnose sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus platorhynchus (Rafinesque, 1820), in the number of large acrocentrics, thereby, karyological data confirms polyphyletic origin of the subfamily Scaphirhynchinae (or tribe Scaphirhynchini).",

    "abstract": "Background. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#945; (HIF-1&#945;), a subunit of the HIF-1 protein, plays a key role in the regulation of genes involved in hypoxia physiological response. Tongue sole, Cynoglossus semilaevis G&#252;nther, 1873, a marine teleost, had been proved to be a hypoxia-tolerant species. In this study, the HIF-1&#945; in tongue sole was cloned and its expression under acute hypoxia was examined to provide further basis for understanding the molecular response of tongue sole under hypoxia. Materials and methods. The full length of HIF-1&#945; cDNA sequence was cloned from the liver of tongue sole by RT-PCR and RACE-PCR method. Then, the expression pattern of tongue sole HIF-1&#945; under acute hypoxic conditions were detected using quantitative real-time PCR method. Results. The open reading frame of tongue sole HIF-1&#945; is 2208 bp, encoding 735 amino acids. The amino acid sequence of tongue sole HIF-1&#945; shared high identities (52.7%&#8211;81.8%) with HIF-1&#945; from other vertebrates, and possessed six typical domains of the HIF-1 family (bHLH, PAS-A, PAS-B, PAC, N-TAD, and C-TAD). In adult fish, HIF-1&#945; mRNAs were highly expressed in the liver, moderately in the heart, spleen, kidney, stomach, blood and gills, and low in intestine. Under acute hypoxia stress, expression of HIF-1&#945; mRNAs were significantly up-regulated in many tissues, including the liver, spleen, stomach, blood, heart and gills. Conclusion. Tongue sole HIF-1&#945; possessed the similar sequence length, shared higher identities and clustered well with other known HIF-1&#945;, thus revealing a high degree conservation of HIF-1&#945; during evolution. Tongue sole HIF-1&#945; began to be up-regulated from 5 min to 120 min after hypoxia, indicating that it might play a significant role at the early stage of hypoxia.",

    "abstract": "Background. The stocks of cod, Gadus morhua Linnaeus, 1758, have been declining within recent decades and the Baltic Sea is one of the most affected areas. The latter body of water with its low salinity, pollution, and vast areas of demersal hypoxia is particularly vulnerable. Areas of natural spawning are scarce and the reproductive output of cod has been irregular and more and more limited. One of the proposed solutions for this problem might be an artificial reproduction. Â One of such areas has been the GdaĹ„sk Deep, but the number of potential brood fish is relatively low, which makes the eggs and sperm poorly accessible. The aim of the presently reported study was to conduct spawning and egg incubation under controlled conditions to obtain viable hatchlings and to monitor the embryonic development of cod originating from the area of the GdaĹ„sk Deep. Materials and methods. The parental fish specimens were obtained during commercial trawl catches. The eggs were fertilized artificially at the field laboratory using filtered brackish sea water with salinity of 15â€°, and then were incubated at a constant temperature of 8 Â± 0.5Â°C. Eggs and larvae development, and larvae beginning exogenous feeding were observed under a stereo microscope, and photographed regularly to determine the sizes of the eggs and larvae and to document the results of the experiment. Results. The mean percentage of fertilization of eggs was 70%. Hatching began 236 h after fertilization, and the newly hatched larvae comprised 30% of the initial stocking density. The mean length of the larvae was 3.95 mm. The cod larvae began exogenous feeding before the yolk sac was fully absorbed. Conclusion. Artificial reproduction with gametes obtained from cod spawning in the GdaĹ„sk Deep is possible, and the fertilization rates obtained were similar to those achieved with cod from the Bornholm and Gotland basins. Therefore, our results also show that cod spawning in the GdaĹ„sk Deep can be suggested as a model species for further research.",

    "abstract": "Background. The red bandfish, Cepola macrophthalma (Linnaeus, 1758), is a benthic fish usually not exceeding 450 cm in length. It occurs in the eastern Atlantic from the British Isles to the north of Senegal and is also common throughout the Mediterranean Sea. The red bandfish has no commercial value and is often represented in the discarded catch. The knowledge of the feeding ecology, of non-commercial as well as commercial species, is essential for implementing a multispecies approach to fishery management. Studies on red bandfish feeding biology have been rather scarce and the majority of them lacked taxonomical approach.&#160;The presently reported study constitutes the first report on the diet of Cepola macrophthalma from two bays on the Turkish coast. Materials and methods. The study was based on the specimens of Cepola macrophthalma collected in &#304;zmir Bay and S&#305;&#287;ac&#305;k Bay from May 2005 to June 2006. The following basic parameters were calculated, based on the data collected during the analysis of red bandfish diet: relative number of food items in the gut content, frequency of occurrence, and relative weight of total gut content. Principal food items were determined using the index of relative importance (%IRI). The differences in the diet composition were tested for length groups and seasons by using the Bray&#8211;Curtis similarity index for both areas studied. Results. A total of 380 stomachs were examined in two bays. According to the analyses a total of 18 different prey species belonging to nine major systematic groups were found, i.e., Anthomedusae, Siphonophora, Polychaeta, Crustacea, Mollusca, Chaetognatha, Appendicularia, Thaliacea, and Actinopterygii. Concerning overall diet composition, crustaceans (especially copepods) were the most important prey in terms of %IRI, %N, %F, and %W in all seasons. In this study, a total of 80 taxa were found and identified. According to the Bray&#8211;Curtis similarity index, the diet of the red bandfish was similar within all seasons for both areas. Conclusion. Stomach content analysis of red bandfish showed that it is a zooplanktophagous species. In addition to bottom species it feeds also on pelagic organisms. This fact indicates ontogenetically based food preferences of the species.",

In 2014 a number of specimens representing this genus were collected in northern Iran. The detailed morphological and karyological study of those gobies collected revealed significant differences between them and their known congeners. The aim of this study was to describe these fish as a new species from the Caspian Sea basin. Materials and methods. The fish specimens were collected in August 2014 at two localities of the Sefid-Rud River drainage, and in the Gisum River, Guilan Province, northern Iran. In total, 18 specimens were used for karyological study following a previously described method. Both karyotyped and intact specimens were then morphologically investigated using characters developed for study on gobiids, and particular for freshwater Caucasian gobies. The comparative materials were specimens from museum collections, as well as published descriptions, illustrations, and measurements of other species. Results. Ponticola iranicus sp. nov. differs from its congeners in a set of the following features: D1 VI, D2 I/(14½) 15½ – 17½, A I/10½ – 13½; nape scaled completely, scales cycloid; cycloid scales covering upper part of opercle; lateral line system with posterior sub-orbital row d2 continuous; predorsal area uniform, dark grey; first dorsal fin with oblique black stripe between first two or three rays; short dark grey strip on upper part of pectoral fin base; karyotype consisting of 46 acrocentric chromosomes. Conclusion. All known Ponto–Caspian gobies demonstrate mosaic pattern of morphological and karyological features that presumes their polyphyletic origins. Further phylogenetic studies by molecular genetic methods are necessary for identification of their marine ancestors and clarifying of common trends in the evolution of the Ponto–Caspian goby group.",

The bogue, Boops boops (Linnaeus, 1758); large-eye dentex, Dentex macrophthalmus (Bloch, 1791); common two-banded seabream, Diplodus vulgaris (Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, 1817); and axillary seabream, Pagellus acarne (Risso, 1827) are four commercially important sparid species which are distributed in the Mediterranean. Although they are very common in the Mediterranean, information regarding; growth, length at first maturity, and age are scarce and variable. This study provides some of the first data on the above-mentioned biological parameters of these four sparid species for the Turkish coasts of the Aegean Sea (Mediterranean). The aim of the present study is to expand our knowledge on the biology of these commercial sparid species from the Aegean Sea. Materials and methods. Fish samples were collected between July 2004 and June 2007 by R/V Eges&#252;f from &#304;zmir Bay. Demersal trawl samplings were carried out by a traditional trawl net with a 5 m codend (600 mesh circumference at the codend) and made of knotted polyethylene material with 40 mm mesh size netting. Results. The length&#8211;weight relations determined in the course of this study were: W = 0.005L3.25 (bogue), W = 0.005L3.03 (large-eye dentex), W = 0.007L3.31 (common two-banded seabream), and W = 0.009L3.14 (axillary seabream). The respective L&#165; and k parameters of von Bertalanffy growth equation were: 29.58 and 0.266 for bogue; 24.3 and 0.399 for large-eye dentex; 28.0 and 0.253 for common two-banded seabream; and 22.7 and 0.315 for axillary seabream. Furthermore, lengths at first maturity were determined as: 12.96 (&#9792;) and 9.35 (&#9794;) cm for bogue; 10.83 (&#9792;) and 11.77 (&#9794;) cm for large-eye dentex; 12.87 (&#9792;) and 13.37 (&#9794;) cm for common two-banded seabream; and 14.45 (&#9792;) and 13.91 (&#9794;) cm for axillary seabream. Conclusion.

    "abstract": "Background. The ability to distinguish between stocks in mixed fisheries is a prerequisite for a sustainable fisheries management. In the Gulf of Bothnia the relative contribution of endangered river-spawning and sea-spawning whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus (Linnaeus, 1758), to fisheries catches are currently not well known. This also applies to the southern &#197;land Islands, a major feeding ground for river-spawning whitefish from northern rivers. River- and sea-spawning whitefish are mixed while away from the breeding grounds and off the spawning season, and cannot be distinguished based on external features. Materials and methods. Analysis on gill raker numbers of river-spawning (n = 480) and sea-spawning (n = 456) whitefish from twelve locations at the Finnish west coast and the &#197;land Islands was performed. In whitefish sampled from feeding grounds at the &#197;land Islands the strontium concentration was analysed in otoliths from fish (n = 20) with low (27) and high (30) number of gill rakers. Results. A marked difference in the mean gill raker number of the river- and sea-spawning whitefish stocks was observed. The weighted mean of gill rakers of whitefish caught at spawning locations showed that the number of gill rakers of fish from rivers and the sea were 29.9 &#177; 2.14&#160; (n = 480) and 26.7 &#177; 2.21&#160; (n = 456), respectively. The difference between the two groups was highly significant (t = 22.50, df = 934, P &#60; 0.0001). The means differed by 3.20 (2.92&#8211;3.48, 95% CL) indicating the groups are well separated.&#160; In whitefish sampled at feeding grounds at the &#197;land Islands, otolith strontium concentration was higher (t = 2.09, df = 18, P = 0.04) in fish having 27 gill rakers (3.86 &#177; 0.30 mg &#183; g&#8211;1, n = 10), compared to those having 30 gill rakers (3.54 &#177; 0.35 mg &#183; g&#8211;1, n = 10).&#160; Otolith strontium analysis thereby supported the utility of gill raker counting data for estimating the proportion of river- and sea-spawning whitefish in mixed populations. As expected, the gill raker counting method successfully indicated temporal alterations in the proportions of river- and sea-spawning whitefish on feeding grounds. Conclusion. Gill raker counting is an easy, fast, and inexpensive method that can be used to estimate the spatiotemporal occurrence and migratory patterns of river- and sea-spawning whitefish at the southern feeding grounds in the Gulf of Bothnia, and thereby aid in a sustainable management of whitefish stocks.",

The anti-nutritional factor, phytic acid, from raw sesame seed meal, could be reduced below detection limit by fermentation with lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus acidophilus). Fermentation of the oilseed meal resulted in reduction of tannin content from 2 to l %. The dry matter digestibility from the fermented sesame seed meal was highest at 20 % inclusion level. The protein digestibility at all levels of inclusion was high in comparison with that from the raw sesame seed meal diet. A similar trend was noticed with regard to fat digestibility. The results indicate that the digestibility of nutrients largely depend on the nature and level of incorporation of the ingredients. It further shows that sesame seed meal can be incorporated at a higher level (up to 40 %) in the diet of rohu fingerlings, after suitable processing (fermentation).",

    "abstract": "Background. The pumpkinseed, Lepomis gibbosus (L.), is one of 23 introduced fish species in Bulgarian freshwaters. With this study we attempt to contribute to clarifying the factors that effect pumpkinseed abundance and demographic structure in water bodies differing in macro- and microhabitat parameters. Materials and methods. Fish were collected during the breeding period of pumpkinseed (May&#8211;June 2010) by minnow traps arranged in 31 sites in the littoral zone of 13 fresh water bodies (former- and active sand-pit lakes, reservoirs, adaptive ponds of refineries). Demographic structure (length and age) and abundance (Catch Per Unit Effort; CPUEN; fish per trap per hour) of pumpkinseeds from different sites were compared to provide information about ecological requirements of this species. Results. L. gibbosus dominated at 24 sites and comprised 86.7% of all fish caught. The mean pumpkinseed abundance was 6.35 &#177; 7.2 fish per trap per hour (mean &#177; SD). Pumpkinseeds were most numerous in the littoral zones of the former sand-pit lakes, where pumpkinseed&#8217;s CPUEN achieved values of 20 fish per trap per hour. Water body use had a significant effect on pumpkinseed abundance and the statistical analyses revealed that the littoral zones in the active sand-pit lakes were characterized by the lowest number of pumpkinseeds than the other types. Microhabitat parameters such as silt and sand bottom substrate also significantly affected pumpkinseeds abundance, size, and age, while gravel significantly affected body length but not abundance and age. Aquatic vegetation also had a significant impact on the abundance and at sites with dense vegetation pumpkinseeds were more abundant than at the sites with sparse vegetation. At the sites where piscivore fish occurred, the mean length and mean age of pumpkinseed were lower. Conclusion. Human activities facilitate establishment of the pumpkinseed population, mainly by extending suitable breeding places for pumpkinseed and eliminating its natural competitors and predators. Some parameters as sand or silt bottoms in littoral area and dense submerged vegetation may use as indicator of suitable conditions for pumpkinseed.",

In comparison with autumn populations, the lampreys that start their spawning migration as late as spring differ more considerably with respect body proportions. Besides, they are characterised by more marked sexual dimorphism, which can be related to more advanced development of gonads.",

Since 1977, the positive trend coefficient of phosphates has been also decreasing in the oxic intermediate layer below the permanent halocline in the central Baltic Sea, whereas nitrate accumulation was continuing nearly unchanged in the whole period under investigation. In connection with the absence of major inflows of highly saline water masses into the Baltic proper, the salinity and oxygen content have been decreasing in the stagnant deep layer of its central part since 1977, whereas phosphate contents increased mainly due to the release from sediments in the presence of hydrogen sulphide. Very high peaks of nutrient concentrations were observed in shallow coastal waters (Pomeranian Bay) not only in the period of low biological activity, but also in late spring and summer. Consequences of the recent nutrient conditions are discussed with respect to eutrophication of the Baltic Sea.",

Sea lice (Copepoda: Caligidae) are important pathogens in aquaculture, and because more fish species are being intensively cultured, more species of sea lice are recognized as pathogens. The aim of the present study was to gather baseline data regarding the effects of sea lice on a valuable sciaenid (Sciaenidae), the black drum, Pogonias cromis, by describing lesions associated with naturally occurring infections of Sciaenophilus tenuis van Beneden, 1855. Materials and methods. Gross and histological examinations of copepods and lesions were made using light and scanning electron microscopy from samples collected from eight infected black drum captured in Mississippi Sound, northern Gulf of Mexico. Results. Adult females of S. tenuis were associated with a mucosal lesion on interopercula. Female copepods attached to folds of mucosa on the posterior half of interopercula with cephalothoraces directed anteriorly in parallel with the longitudinal axis of fish. All attached male copepods grasped the abdomen or genital complex of females and were not in contact with the host. Maxillipeds of female copepods were embedded in epithelium or subepithelial connective tissue and functioned as the primary attachment appendages. Epithelial hyperplasia, fibrosis of subepithelial connective tissue, and chronic inflammatory infiltrates including presumed eosinophilic granular cells surrounded maxillipeds, indicative of long-term, focal, parasite-host interaction. Conclusion. Aquaculture managers should regard S. tenuis as a potentially serious pathogen if fish develop intense S. tenuis infections associated with extensive gross lesions.",

    "abstract": "The validity of four gudgeon species known for the ichthyofauna of North Macedonia has been a matter of different taxonomic disputes (except for Gobio ohridanus Karaman, 1924). Recently, a restoration of the species status was proposed for Gobio balcanicus Dimovski et Grupče, 1977 and Romanogobio banarescui (Dimovski et Grupče, 1974). So far, Romanogobio stankoi (Karaman, 1974), has not been a part of any recent investigation and it is still considered as a junior synonym of Romanogobio elimeius (Kattoulas, Stephanidis et Economidis, 1973) or R. banarescui due to the lack of distinctive morphological characters. The osteological characters in the structure of the vertebral column, have significance to the systematics of the gudgeons, especially in elevation of Romanogobio at the level of genus. To contribute to resolving the taxonomic status in these gudgeon species, the goal of this paper is to identify distinctive characters by presenting and analyzing the structure of their vertebral column. Samples were inspected from the fish collections in the Institute of Biology ( G. ohridanus ), the Institute of Animal Science ( G. balcanicus ), and the Macedonian Museum of Natural History (both Romanogobio species). Fish samples were X-rayed as well as cleared and double-stained. Obtained data on the number of vertebrae were presented through the vertebral formula following Naseka (1996). Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) was used to check the interrelation between taxa and the number of vertebrae in all units of the vertebral column. G. balcanicus is distinguished from G. ohridanus mainly in the predorsal and preanal subregion (10 vs. 11 vertebrae and 1 vs. 0 vertebrae, respectively), while R. stankoi distinguishes from R. banarescui by the number of vertebrae in the preanal and postanal subregion (2 vs. 4 vertebrae and 19 vs. 17 vertebrae, respectively). The structure of vertebral column offers distinctive morphological characters for the four gudgeon species from Ohird Lake and the Vardar River basin.",

    "abstract": "Studying fish communities in extreme habitats is important to better understand the variation in their ranges under climatic scenarios or anthropogenic pressure. In particular, the mangroves in Baja California Sur occupy the northernmost distribution range under two extreme conditions (temperate waters and arid weather). In this context, the aim of the presently reported study was to analyze the functional characteristics of ichthyofauna in two localities, La Paz Bay (BP) and Almejas Bay (BA), which are also located in different ecoregions. For both bays, the composition and frequency values were compiled from monthly samples and the literature. Eleven functional traits were assessed from the morphology of every fish species. Functional indices (Richness, Evenness, Divergence, and Originality) were used to evaluate different aspects of the community structure. A total of 83 species were found at both sites, with 54 in BP and 50 in BA. In BP, six species were residents, eight were temporal visitors, and 36 were occasional visitors. In BA, six species were residents, 15 species were temporal visitors, and 33 were occasional visitors. At both sites, 12% of the species were permanent residents; BA had a higher percentage of temporal residents (27%), while BP had a higher percentage of occasional visitors (72%). The functional analysis detected communities with specialized traits, but in comparison to BP, BA had higher evenness in the community structure. Although greater structural complexity was expected in the community during the warm months, because of the increase in richness and attributes, BA had higher values during the cold months, which was probably because the area is a transition zone and the fish communities are adapted to colder climates. In comparison to BA, BP had higher originality values, and colder months presented higher values than warmer months. Although the mangrove sites had the same northernmost latitudinal limits and both had extreme conditions compared to those in mangroves in tropical environments, the fish communities differed in their composition, frequency, and functionality with more extreme functional traits in colder weather than in warmer weather.",

The parameters of von Bertalanffy growth function, total mortality ( Z ), natural mortality ( M ), fishing mortality ( F ), and exploitation rate ( E ) were determined and compared with those for Lutjanidae fishes elsewhere. The age structure of male fishes was between 1 and 14 years for males while the age of females ranged from 1 to 18 years. Growth rate ( K ) was 0.21 y –1 and 0.16 y –1 for males and females, respectively. The hypothetical length of female ( L ∞ = 46 cm) was relatively higher than that of male ( L ∞ = 42 cm). The natural mortality ( M ) was 0.296, total mortality ( Z ) was 0.372, fishing mortality was 0.076, and exploitation rate ( E ) was estimated as 0.2.

    "abstract": "Fishing with light is an old and common practice yielding a substantial catch volume globally. Despite the popularity of the method and the efforts to improve it, there is a lack of field studies on the effects of light on the feeding preferences of the attracted fishes. A previous report suggested that purse seine fishing lights can differentiate the feeding preferences of the approaching fishes, such as Atherina boyeri Risso, 1810 in Lake Trichonis (Greece). The presently reported study aims to verify these findings by investigating the diet of the endemic Scardinius acarnanicus Economidis, 1991. The feeding behavior of S. acarnanicus was studied from 2016 to 2019 through gut content analysis, in specimens from Lake Trichonis that came from purse seining with light and specimens caught without light. The same investigation was carried out comparatively in specimens taken by gillnets from two nearby lakes (lakes Ozeros and Amvrakia), where S. acarnanicus is present, but no fishing with light is exercised. The stomach content analysis conducted on 699 S. acarnanicus specimens revealed the intense effect of light on its diet resulting in the alteration of its feeding habits towards fish predation and especially Atherina boyeri . On the contrary, the specimens taken with the use of gillnets, from the three lakes, showed a typical omnivorous feeding behavior. The findings of the presently reported study support the assumption that the elevated concentration of fish close to fishing lights alters the feeding behavior of certain species making them predators. Considering that fishing with light is practiced worldwide, this could be of great ecological significance to the ichthyofauna not only of inland waters but also of marine areas, affecting perhaps several commercial species.",

The longnose seahorse, Hippocampus trimaculatus Leach, 1814, included in the Red List of Threatened Species is the most common and least studied seahorse species along the south-west coast of India. Practically no information is available on numerical taxonomy and sexual dimorphism of H. trimaculatus from India. The purpose of the reported study is to describe the morphometry and meristics of H. trimaculatus occurring along Kerala, south-west coast of India. Materials and methods. A total of 45 specimens of H. trimaculatus, represented by 25 males and 20 females, obtained from trawl by-catch, were studied following standard morphometric and meristics procedures. Statistical data analyses include Student's t-test, Mann–Whitney U test, and Principal Component Analysis to describe the sexual dimorphism of the species. Results. Male H. trimaculatus are longer than females, with relatively longer tails. The mean values of head depth, snout depth, trunk depth, trunk width, dorsal fin base length, and pectoral fin base length are higher in males, while head length, snout length, coronet height, and trunk length are higher in females. Trunk length and snout depth are the two principal components that determine sexual dimorphism in H. trimaculatus. Conclusion. The numerical taxonomy of H. trimaculatus from Indian coastal waters is reported for the first time. The study shows that sexual dimorphism in H. trimaculatus is reflected in differing morphometric characters between the sexes.",

During the last decade, this ichthyofauna has been considerably enriched, either by Suez Canal or&nbsp;Strait of Gibraltar migrations or simply by mariculture escapees. This study is intended to discussed morphology of one of such non-indigenous fish species and its distribution. Materials and methods. Three specimens of elongate lanternfish, Notoscopelus elongatus (Costa, 1844), were captured during a commercial lift net operation in Ece Limani, Aegean Sea, Turkey.

The described meristic and morphometric features of elongate lanternfish, Notoscopelus elongatus, are consistent with the data provided by descriptors of its previous findings (with minor exceptions). The most interesting morphological feature of the presently described material is the presence in the smaller specimen (TL 103 mm) of 4 precaudal photophores (Prc) on the left body side (in contrast to 3 usual ones). Conclusion. This work will undoubtedly enhance our knowledge on newly introduced species on lanterfishes in the Mediterranean and in Aegean Sea in particular.",

    "abstract": "Background. The current topics in fish fatty acid (FA) research include qualitative comparisons, trophic transfer as nutritive sources of FA, evolutionary comparison of synthesis pathways, and potential application of most efficient fish desaturases and elongases. FA are scarcely investigated in Elopomorpha and Anguilliformes, except for common- and Japanese eels. In this study determines the differences in lipid composition of FA between species of the order Anguilliformes, representing three families, Mediterranean moray, Muraena helena Linnaeus, 1758; European conger, Conger conger (Linnaeus, 1758); and European eel Anguilla anguilla (Linnaeus, 1758) (thereafter moray, conger, and eel, respectively). These are the first results on FA for the moray. Materials and methods. The fishes were collected in September 2011 on the Croatian coast of the Adriatic Sea, including the Neretva River estuary. Total lipids were extracted and the fatty acid profile in total lipid isolates were determined by gas chromatography of the corresponding methyl esters, obtained by acid methanolysis. A Hewlett Packard HP 5890A capillary gas chromatograph equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) was used. Results. Both moray and conger were less fatty than eel but had higher Ď‰ FA content, especially Ď‰-3. Moray and conger, contained more proteins than lipids, while in eel, lipids exceeded the crude protein content. Conger was the leanest fish among the three. The qualitative SFA, MUFA, and PUFA were species specific (myristic FA characteristic for moray). PUFA were higher in moray and conger, due primarily to DHA. Moray showed the most favourable qualitative lipid content and profile and best ratio of Ď‰-3 to Ď‰-6 FA. Moray had 7.6- and conger 11-fold more DHA than eel. Approximate ratios along Ď‰-3 biosynthesis pathway, show that there was 6-fold more EPA than Î±-LNA in moray and conger, and only 1.64- in eel, 5.63-fold, and 11.27-fold more DHA than DPA in Mediterranean moray and conger, respectively, and only 1.03-fold more in eel Approximate ratios along Ď‰-3 biosynthesis pathway, show that there was 6-fold more EPA than Î±-LNA in moray and conger, and only 1.64-fold in eel. DHA was 5.63-fold, and 11.27-fold more abundant than DPA in moray and conger, respectively. In comparison, eel had only 1.03-fold more DHA than DPA. Conclusion. Although trophic status and environment are the most determined, the differences in individual FA ratios might indirectly suggest different physiological utilization of elongation pathways in each species. Presently reported results draw focus on Muraena helena and Conger conger to be included in the studies elongase and desaturase pathways in teleost fish.",

    "abstract": "Background. During ice storage of fish a series of biochemical changes occur at a relatively rapid pace. The changes involve both nitrogen compounds and the lipid fraction. Lipid damage, through hydrolysis and oxidation reactions, can lead to important losses in nutritive value and quality during chilled storage. Oxidised lipids are a source of free radical compounds and highly reactive peroxides. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of two economically valuable species of Baltic fish, especially the quality of lipids, during storage in ice. Materials and methods. The analysis involved two Baltic fish: cod, Gadus morhua Linnaeus, 1758—a lean fish (about 1% of fat in flesh) and flounder, Platichthys flesus (Linnaeus, 1758)—an average-fat fish (about 4% of fat in flesh). Descriptive testing was used for quality determination of fish and the chemical changes of nitrogen compounds (TVB-N)(Total volatile bases nitrogen) and lipids (PV—peroxide value and AsV—anisidine value) were analysed. Changes of FA (fatty acids) were based on the qualitative interpretation of chromatograms. Results. In cod, peroxide value reached after 10 days a value of 45.47 mg O* ∙ 100 g–1 of lipids. In flounder peroxide value reached the maximum of 26.98 mg O* ∙ 100 g–1 after 12 days. The initial anisidine values did not differ significantly and remained at a similar level during storage. It was found that the most significant changes involved loss of EPA. After fifteen days flounder lost approximately 6.81 mg of EPA ∙ g–1 of fat (about 10% of initial amount), whereas cod about 9 mg EPA ∙ g–1 of fat (about 26.5% of initial amount). The observed loss of DHA was much lower, in particular in flounder. Conclusion. Different dynamics of oxidative changes were observed. In cod primary oxidation products increased linearly but in flounder such dynamic growth occurred after 12 days of storage still being almost twice as low as that of cod. No significant differences were observed in the secondary oxidation products between the fish. The level of PUFA and especially the level of EPA and DHA decreased. The loss of PUFA were higher in the lipid fraction of cod than flounder and were respectively about 2 pp and about 0.4 pp for each day of storage. Moreover, the dynamics of loss of EPA was greater than DHA.",

This species was previously considered to be endemic to Alboran Island. A surprising new record of this rare species from the Balearic Islands is reported here. Materials and methods. A specimen of P. alboranensis was collected from a bottom trawl sampling carried out at 159 m depth in the north of Mallorca, Balearic Islands, during the survey MEDITS_ES05_17 in June 2017. The specimen (a male) has been deposited in the collection of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJ). Results. Protogrammus alboranensis is recorded from the Balearic Islands for the first time; the specimen is examined, described and illustrated. Conclusion. The new record confirms that the species is more widely distributed in the western Mediterranean than previously expected. This type of study is needed to know about the distribution and habitats of this rare species, to support possible conservation measures. The depth of collection and the benthic habitat in the sampling location were similar to those in the location of the original description of the species (Alboran Island): deep shelf bottoms with biogenic coarse sand and presence of abundant dead shells in both locations. The colouration of the species is highly mimetic with that type of sediments indicating that this is probably the ideal habitat for the species.",

The only available data on the age and growth of argentine, Argentina sphyraena Linnaeus, 1758, a non-commercially exploited species of the family Argentinidae, was published almost half a century ago. More recent reports are limited to general biological characteristics of A. sphyraena so the main goal of our study was to fill a gap by investigating age and growth of the eastern Adriatic population of this fish. Materials and methods. Samples of the argentine were collected in the eastern Adriatic Sea, during March 2011, using a bottom trawl. We analysed sagittal otolith morphology and morphometry; the age of each fish was determined from the number of growth zones on otoliths and relations between the observed otolith age and otolith morphometrics were constructed using a power model. Mean length-at-age was described using the von Bertalanffy growth model. Results. Sagittal otoliths of Argentina sphyraena displayed alternating opaque and translucent zones. The maximum observed age was 3 years for both females and males. Females that were 2+ and 3+ years old were the most numerous in the sampled population. The estimated values of the von Bertalanffy growth model parameters were: L&infin; = 17.57 cm; k = 0.40 year&ndash;1; t0 = &ndash;1.39 years. The age of the argentine can be best predicted from the otolith thickness. Conclusion. The maximum lengths and ages recorded in this study confirmed that in warmer southern latitudes, Argentina sphyraena attains a smaller maximum size. It should be emphasized that the presented model described the growth of fish ages 1&ndash;3 and therefore is probably representative only for younger age groups of argentine.",

    "abstract": "Background. The beam trawl fisheries of veined rapa whelk, Rapana venosa (Valenciennes, 1846), cause small benthic organisms to be captured and also damage the other species living on the seafloor. To solve this problem, a proper modification that minimise the by-catch should be designed and put into practice. This study aims to compare 72 mm commercial diamond-mesh codend with 72 mm square-mesh codend to reduce the benthic by-catch in this fishery. Materials and methods. Totally 15 hauls were carried out in south-eastern Black Sea Region within 10–14 August 2017. A commercial diamond-mesh and square-mesh beam trawls were towed simultaneously behind a commercial fishing vessel to compare the by-catch compositions. Paired t-test was used to compare the catch amount of two codends based on species. GLMM (Generalised Linear Mixed Models) was used to compare the length of captured veined rapa whelk, mussel, and crab species. Results. There was a 77-percentage-point reduction in the mean number of the captured individuals as by-catch in square-mesh codend when compared with commercial diamond-mesh codend and this difference was found statistically significant (P < 0.05). A total of 17 species was captured as by-catch in both codends. Comparing to diamond-mesh codend, the catch amount of the 13 by-catch species had decreased in square-mesh codend. Conclusion. In conclusion, the square-mesh codend was found successful in decreasing the by-catch amount of many benthic species except for flatfish species and large crabs. In addition to this, the veined rapa whelk amount fell by half and this means a 25-percentage-point profit decrease for fishermen.",

Because of the rarity of the records in the basin, there could be doubts whether to consider or not such species as established in the area.

For example, the stomach of the specimen was nearly full, with rests of one crustacean decapod, one fish, and some cephalopods, which are commonly reported prey items for the species. Macroscopic observation and histological analysis of the gonads revealed that the specimen was a male in an advanced stage of gonadal development.

The estuary is a known hub for invasive alien species and other neobionts due to the presence of the marine port. The new population of pumpkinseed, a North American invasive species, in the estuary represents the next stage in the species’ ongoing expansion along the Ukrainian Black Sea coast. Likewise, the appearance of the peacock blenny represents the latest stage in the “Mediterranization” of the Black Sea, a process that has been ongoing over the last several thousand years.",

Particular cohorts of the two fish species were characterised by considerable differences of the diet composition, both in the phonologic season and in particular years. White bream females fed more intensively than bream females and males of the same size. Statistically significant differences were found as to the consumption of chironomids by bream and white bream, size and length of the larvae consumed and intensity of feeding. Consumption of chironomids by the two euryphages increased with water temperature, reaching an optimum at 21&deg;C. Prey density determined the food spectrum of bream and white bream. Both species grazed in the same areas but differed as to the intensity of sediment penetration and size of the chironomids consumed.",

The carp were fed with the \"Ewos\" larvstart C-10 pellets, intended for cyprinids, and the grass carp with pellets intended for trout. The carp at the age of 4 days emptied more than 50% of the intestine length in 1 hour after the discontinuation of feeding. In older larvae (10 days) the process was slower: the intestine was emptied 50% between 3 and 5 hours. For the first 2 hours of emptying, the feed remained in the intestine. In the case of white grass, food was found to remain in the intestine for 10 hours after the cessation of feeding. This indicates a lack of intestinal transit. what were the reasons for the negligible increase in cyprinids fed with fodder intended for salmonids.",

The aim of this paper is report a new host and locality for Absonifibula bychowskyi, a monogenean confined to fish living in estuarine areas. Some ecological considerations about the host-parasite relationship are also discussed. Materials and methods. Parasites collected from whitemouth croaker, Micropogonias furnieri (Desmarest, 1823) (Actinopterygii: Sciaenidae), were studied from fixed- and live specimens, with standard procedures used in parasitology. Prevalence, mean intensity, and abundance of parasites were calculated and related to the host body size. Spearman&prime;s rank correlation coefficient was calculated to determine possible correlations between host length, parasite intensity, and prevalence. Results. Absonifibula bychowskyi (Monogenea: Diclidophoridae) Lawler et Overstreet, 1976 is reported for the first time from the gills of whitemouth croaker, at the SamborombĂłn Bay, a mixohaline area in the Buenos Aires Province, Southwest Atlantic Ocean. The parasite was found only in juveniles of M. furnieri that use the SamborombĂłn Bay as the main estuarine nursery ground area. When the croaker migrated seawards, A. bychowskyi disappeared from the gills may be related to the increased salinity. Conclusion. This is the first record for Absonifibula bychowskyi in the Southwest Atlantic and M. furnieri. (It constitutes a new host record.) The presence of A. bychowskyi in M. furnieri could be indicative of the origin of the fish.",

The Neretva nase, Chondrostoma knerii Heckel, 1843, is an endemic cyprinid species distributed in the Neretva River basin in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, designated in the EU Habitats Directive as a species requiring conservation within member states. According to the IUCN, the species is catalogued as vulnerable (VU). Available scientific data indicate that significant aspects of its biological and ecological characteristics, as well as conservation requirements, are scarce and largely composed of outdated records. This paper provides a summary of the main life history traits, particularly those related to the conservation challenges and a detailed list of the current state of knowledge. Materials and methods. This review was based on published literature in the form of research articles, monographs, books and technical reports, as well as unpublished data Results. All available data were organized, critically analysed and presented in a comprehensive form. Issues related to species conservation were highlighted with respect to the impact of development activities. The long-term monitoring data of reproduction activity in the Hutovo Blato wetland were presented, showing the lowering of spring inflow capacity as the major factors for spawning success. Conclusion. This review will, hopefully, serve as foundation and indicative example for future research aimed at better understanding the origin and status of this fish species in order to assure effective management and conservation programs.",

The following species were studied: Curimatella lepidura (Eigenmann et Eigenmann, 1889); Prochilodus brevis Steindachner, 1875; Leporinus piau Fowler, 1941; Leporinus taeniatus L&uuml;tken 1875; Triportheus signatus&nbsp; (Garman, 1890); Hoplias malabaricus (Bloch, 1794); Hypostomus pusarum (Starks, 1913); Loricariichthys derbyi Fowler, 1915; Trachelyopterus galeatus (Linnaeus, 1766); Crenicichla menezesi Ploeg, 1991. The captured individuals were identified, separated by species, measured for total length (TL), and categorized as reproductive or immature after dissection. The L50 values for both sexes were estimated via a logistic regression for each species. Significant differences between values were tested for the species that occurred in both reservoirs (ANCOVA). The estimated L50 value varied between 7.37 cm (C. lepidura, female) and 19.40 cm (H. malabaricus, female). Only the L50 value of the males of the species C. lepidura and P. brevis differed between the two reservoirs. This study is the first report of the L50 for seven species and the first report for tropical semiarid river basins for two species.

This provided an infrequent opportunity for the estimation of the species-specific morphological diversification not determined by environmental conditions dissimilarity. This study aimed to compare the seismosensory systems of two species of Amur grayling, the lower Amur grayling, Thymallus tugarinae Knizhin, Antonov, Safronov et Weiss, 2007, and yellow-spotted grayling, Thymallus flavomaculatus Knizhin, Antonov et Weiss, 2006, collected in sympatric habitats with the inclusion of the published data on other northeast Asia grayling species. Materials and methods. The comparative study was based on samples of T. tugarinae and T. flavomaculatus specimens collected at species sympatric habitats in the middle stretch of the Anyuy River, one of the biggest tributaries of the Amur River. The lateral line system was stained, the topology was examined, and seismosensory system canal pores were counted. Differences in canal pore numbers between examined species were estimated with Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Also, cluster analysis was carried out. Results. Examined sympatric species were found to differ in the number of pores and secondary canaliculi topology but were similar to geographically distant grayling species. Conclusion. The results revealed sympatric morphological divergence of studied species and demonstrated parallelism of interspecies variability of examined features which are likely determined by conditions of species ecological optima. Comparative morphological analysis of the species and forms with questionable taxonomic status should be carried out using material that is collected in different parts of the habitation areal, paying special attention to the sympatry zones, if there are any such cohabitation regions, because the environmental factors have similar effects on all of the analysed species within such zones.",

    "abstract": "Background. A sampling of stomach and intestine content is usually performed by dissection of the gastrointestinal tract of fish. To avoid fish sacrificing, various non-lethal techniques have been developed and tested. Such sampling methods are very useful, especially for small populations and protected species. In this study, a modified syringe stomach flushing was applied on Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum, 1792), and Salmo trutta Linnaeus, 1758, to test its efficiency in retrieving stomach content. Materials and methods. Water was injected repeatedly by a syringe through a silicone tube directly into the stomach of live fish to flush the content out. Afterwards, fish were dissected to collect residual stomach content. The efficiency of the method was assessed as the percentage of flushed content by weight and as the percentage of the number of flushed prey items, both in respect to the whole stomach content (100%). The relation between the fish body size (length and weight) and efficiency of flushing (expressed as the weight and number of flushed prey) was tested by linear regression. The sensitivity of the method was tested with respect to 25 designated prey types. The share of each prey type was compared in the pooled sample of flushed and residual content. Results. Collected stomach content was well preserved for identification of ingested organisms. From 25 designated prey types, 17 were 100% flushed, 4 over 90%, one over 80%, 2 were 44% effectively flushed (gastropods and caddisflies in stone cases), and 1 prey type was present only in the residual sample (Gordius sp.). The efficiency of the method assessed as the mean percentage of flushed content by weight was found to be 78.78%, while 91.99% of prey items were effectively flushed. Conclusion. The applied modification of syringe stomach flushing was found to be effective for investigation of stomach content of salmonid fish since (1) collected prey items were well preserved and easily identified; (2) the percentage of flushed prey items was high (91.99%); and (3) the method is easily applicable and inexpensive.",

    "abstract": "Background. Peipsi whitefish, Coregonus maraenoides Polyakov, 1874, is an endemic species of Lake Peipsi (Chudskoe) in Estonia and Russia. In the mid-1970s, it was introduced into the biggest Bulgarian artificial body of water&mdash;the Iskar Reservoir (Danube River basin). A recent survey confirmed the existence of a self-sustaining population of the Peipsi whitefish in the dam lake. Establishing a suitable method for determining Peipsi whitefish age would allow fishery managers and biologists to extract valuable information on various population parameters. Therefore, the aim of the presently reported study was to test the suitability of scales, pectoral fin rays, and otoliths for the most reliable age determining of Peipsi whitefish. Materials and methods. Age estimates were obtained from transverse sections of sagittal otoliths and pectoral fins, and scales from 54 Peipsi whitefish, collected between October and March 2016&ndash;2017. Two readers estimated ages from all three structures independently. The precision and bias of age estimates between readers and among structures were compared using age bias plots, coefficient of variation (CV), percent agreement (PA), and level of readability. Mean consensus ages from two readers for each structure were compared. Results. Mean consensus age estimates obtained by analysing the scales (2.0 years) were significantly lower than those obtained by analysing the fin rays (2.6) and otoliths (2.7). Between-reader percent agreement was lower and the coefficient of variation was higher for otoliths (PA = 22.2%; CV = 27.6) compared with scales (PA = 46.6%; CV = 10.02) and pectoral fin rays (PA = 67.4%; CV = 10.12). Comparison of age estimates from the different structures revealed the highest PA and the lowest CV values between otoliths and pectoral fin rays (PA = 62.6%; CV = 10.03%), while the lowest PA and highest CV (PA = 35%, CV = 25.03) were observed between age estimates from fin rays and scales (CV, P &gt; 0. 005). The otolith and scale ages agreed for 46.7% and CV was 21.5. The scales were considered by both readers with the highest level of readability (88.9%) than the pectoral fin rays (70.4%) and otoliths (50%). Conclusion. The use of fin rays is recommended for the age estimation of C. maraenoides from the Iskar Reservoir but further work is needed to validate the accuracy of ageing methodology for small, under one-year old Peipsi whitefish.",

    "abstract": "Background. The investigation on different aspects of the reproductive biology is valuable information in the development of breeding technologies towards initiating conservation and other management measures of the indigenous fish stocks. The zig-zag eel, Mastacembelus armatus (Lacep&egrave;de, 1800), is a commercially important fish species in the river Ganga of India. But, the data on the reproductive biology of this species is limited. Hence, this study was done to gather information on some aspects of the reproductive biology of M. armatus to address the gap in the current knowledge. Materials and methods. Some biological traits relating to the reproduction of M. armatus from the river Ganga were studied based on the monthly sampling for one year from April 2015 to March 2016. A total of 286 fish specimens were collected, comprising 167 males and 119 females. Weight&ndash;length relations for both sexes were estimated with the aid of regression analysis. The fecundity was calculated following the gravimetric method. The length at 50% maturity (L50) for the male and female were assessed employing maturity status data. The spawning season was predicted by employing gonadosomatic index and maturity status data. Results. Monthly sex ratio (F &divide; M) ranging between 0.22 &divide; 1 and 2.75 &divide; 1 with a mean of 0.71 &divide; 1 observed in the population was significantly different from 1 &divide; 1. Analysis of mean monthly gonadosomatic index (GSI) and the existence of matured (IV and V) and spent (VI) individuals, indicated year-round spawning with two breeding seasons. The first breeding season, in the river Ganga, occurred between February and May, and the other between July and November. The L50 of Mastacembelus armatus female and male were determined as 362.2 and 385.6 mm total length (TL), respectively. The reproductive potential in terms of absolute fecundity ranged between 2546 and 6058 with a mean of 3962 ova. Conclusion. The current investigation helps to report the size at maturity in the female and the male for the first time from Indian waters. Mastacembelus armatus represents a low fecundity, indicating that this species has a comparatively lower reproductive potential, making it more vulnerable to excessive fishing pressure. For the sustainable management of this species, it is necessary to utilize the resources wisely and avoid overfishing in the river Ganga.",

    "abstract": "This study reports the presence of the genus Cobitis in the Zarrineh River, Urmia Lake basin, Iran. Its taxonomy is clarified and zoogeography of Urmia basin is discussed. This study provides morphological characteristics, mtDNA COI barcode sequences of the collected Cobitis specimens and analyses phylogenetic relation within the members of this genus in Iran. The results revealed that morphometric and molecular (COI) characters of the collected Cobitis specimens are largely overlapping or completely identical with those of Cobitis saniae Eagderi, Jouladeh-Roudbar, Jalili, Sayyadzadeh et Esmaeili 2017. Sequences of Cobitis saniae from the Urmia Lake Basin clustered with published sequences of C. saniae showing a K2P genetic distance of 0.76% to the population from the Caspian Sea basin. This record shows a range extension of this species toward the western part of Iran. Based on first record of C. saniae from the Zarrineh River, the ichthyofauna of the Urmia Lake basin includes 30 species. The presence of C. saniae in Urmia Lake basins reveals the past connection of this basin with the Caspian Sea basin.",

In the genus Oryzias, the morphology of the dorsal and anal fin constitute typical secondary sex characteristics that are controlled by sex steroid hormones through hormone receptors. However, the level expressions of hormone receptors in fish fins of this genus have remained to be clarified. To achieve the aims of this study, we completely examined the patterns of hormone receptor expression in all fin types of adult Oryzias woworae Parenti et Hadiaty, 2010. Materials and methods. The androgen receptor (AR) &#945;, AR&#946;, oestrogen receptor (ER) &#945;, and ER&#946; expression in the dorsal-, anal-, pectoral-, pelvic-, and caudal fins, including the dorsal and ventral edges of the caudal fins, were determined using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Results. Hormone receptor expression levels were significantly different in the dorsal-, anal-, and caudal fins of males, including the dorsal and ventral edges of their caudal fins, and in the pectoral and pelvic fins, and the dorsal and ventral edges of the caudal fins of females. AR&#945; and AR&#946; levels in dorsal fins and AR&#946; levels in anal and caudal fins were higher in males than in females. ER&#945; levels in pectoral fins were higher in males than in females. Conversely, ER&#946; levels in the pectoral and pelvic fins and in the dorsal and ventral edges of caudal fins were higher in females than in males. Conclusion. These results suggest that AR- and ER-mediated functions may regulate sexual dimorphism, and that characteristics of fin morphology are dependent on androgen and oestrogen regulation in adult Oryzias woworae.",

    "abstract": "Background. Successful fisheries management requires estimation of gillnet selectivity for optimum exploitation of the resource. In the Okavango Delta, no study has assessed the selectivity of gillnets for Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822) which is an important component of both the subsistence and the commercial gillnet fishery catch. The aim of this study was to simulate the harvesting pattern of the commercial gillnet fishery and provide gillnet selectivity parameters for C. gariepinus. This will help fishery managers with information on the appropriate mesh sizes needed for sustainable utilisation of the catfish resource. Materials and methods. Monthly gillnet sampling was conducted over a period of 8 years from 2001 to 2009. The SELECT method was used to estimate gillnet selectivity for C. gariepinus using catch data from four mesh sizes (73 mm, 93 mm, 118 mm, and 150 mm). Results. The 93 mm and 118 mm mesh sizes were the most efficient when capturing C. gariepinus accounting for 44.6% and 21.9% of the total catch, respectively. Mean fish length increased with increasing mesh size and was significantly different between mesh sizes (P &#60; 0.001). The modal fish lengths for the four mesh sizes were estimated at 41.63 cm, 53.23 cm, 66.35 cm, and 85.54 cm in order of increasing mesh size. Conclusion. The modal fish lengths for meshes 93 mm and 118 mm are greater than the size at maturity and therefore the current commercial gillnet fishery which uses 100 mm mesh size may not be a threat to the C. gariepinus population in the Upper Okavango Delta. Future studies should aim to conduct fishery dependent selectivity studies in the lower Okavango Delta to determine if selectivity changes with location and gear. Moreover, a comprehensive age-based stock assessment is required to establish the mesh size that optimizes yield without adversely depleting the spawning stock biomass.",

    "abstract": "Background. The catchment of the Neve&#382;is River, the sixth longest river in Lithuania, is among the most affected by agricultural activities. Although seriously disturbed by land reclamation and agricultural pollution, the Neve&#382;is River still has natural, anthropogenically unaffected stretches. Fish species were studied at two sites of the upper part of the river with different hydrological regime, exhibiting clear differences in the trophic status of fish. The combined effect of hydrogeomorphic and water-chemistry variability on the stable isotope composition of fish assemblages in Lithuania has not been investigated. The presently reported study was intended to explore the possible effects of the riverbed morphology and agricultural activities on the chemistry and stable isotope composition of the three main fish species. Materials and methods. This study covered three species of freshwater fishes: the European perch, Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758; the roach, Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758); and the northern pike, Esox lucius Linnaeus, 1758. The sampling was performed in both natural and regulated river stretches using backpack electrofishing equipment. Stable isotope composition of the samples was revealed by applying stable isotope analyses (SIA) with an elemental analyser connected to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. To obtain more information about environmental variability and variation of stable isotopes &delta;13C and &delta;15N in fish, the entire data matrix was analysed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Results. In the study sites on the Neve&#382;is River, algal carbon isotope ratios were more 13C- depleted than those from terrestrial sources. The fishes were clearly dependent on terrestrial carbon sources in natural locations. However, the fishes collected from regulated sites had carbon isotope signatures more similar to algal than to terrestrial sources. Mean values of &delta;15N of the fishes from the natural sites were lower than those from the regulated ones. Conclusion. The presently reported study revealed impact of abiotic habitat variables indicating the importance of physicochemical and morphological characteristics on &delta;13C and &delta;15N isotopic values variance of fish at natural and regulated river sites. Our findings would help to evaluate and predict changes on river food webs that occur due to hydromorphological alterations determined by human activity and climate change. The results could be useful for fisheries, i.e., impact of environmental factors on fish nutrition and growth.",

    "abstract": "Background. Tench, Tinca tinca (Linnaeus, 1758), has been cultivated in Polish fish farms since centuries, due to its good quality meat. However, the most critical problem in tench culture is the slow growth, which makes farming of this species unprofitable. Growth rates of fish are influenced by numerous internal and external factors such as water temperature, food availability and quality, as well as photoperiod. In order to analyse and improve tench growth rate, the most important factors (GH, IGF-I) of the somatotropic axis should be analysed against selected culture factors. Key elements of the axis play a pivotal role in the coordination of protein and energy metabolism during postnatal growth. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess effect of water temperature on the activity of somatotropic axis of tench. Obtained results can be useful in tench farming in order to deal with mass gain. Materials and methods. Forty tench, approximately 3+ years of age, were placed in eight 240 L tanks, five fish in each tank. There were four temperature regimes&#160; (10&#176;C, 15&#176;C, 20&#176;C, and 25&#176;C) studied separately for males and females during a period of one week. At the end of the experiment, 2 mL of blood, the whole pituitary gland, 2 liver samples, and one muscle sample were collected from selected fish specimens.&#160; Real-time PCR was used to assess the effect of water temperatures on the level of tench mRNA gh transcripts in pituitary-, liver-, and muscle samples. Also, the concentration of growth hormone (GH) protein was measured in relation to individual temperature treatments in blood plasma and liver samples using ELISA assay. Results. The highest cycle threshold (Ct) values of mRNA gh were detected in the pituitary samples. ELISA assays confirmed that water temperature affected GH and IGF-I concentrations in the blood and the liver samples. Additionally, results from ELISA assays confirmed sex size dimorphism (SSD) phenomenon in tench. Conclusion. Presented results shed new light on mechanisms of functioning of tench somatotropic axis and constitute benchmark information for future experiments on nutritional factors.",

The effects of establishing partial reserves on a target species, forkbeard, Phycis phycis (Linnaeus, 1766), were assessed in MPAs in the Mediterranean: Cap de Creus (Spain) and Lastovo (Croatia). Materials and methods. In this study, we performed separate statistical analyses based on measurements of length and age for 381 forkbeard from Cap de Creus (2008â€“ 2011) and 739 forkbeard from Lastovo Islands (2010â€“ 2012) as indicators of fishing effects on target fish populations. Results. The establishment of partial reserves in both MPAs, with different regulations imposed on professional and recreational fishing has not proven successful in achieving benefits for a sedentary, relatively long-lived target species such as Phycis phycis. Results of multi-annual research indicate no significant difference in the abundance, mean size, or age of P. phycis between the fishing zones of different protection levels in either of the studied MPAs. Conclusion. In order to achieve the desired benefits for coastal fisheries resources, we recommend that partial fishing reserves are supplemented with integrated networks of no-take zones.",

    "abstract": "Background. The authors suggest that skin injury, particularly scale loss, during the capture may be one reason of the escape mortality. However, skin and fin damages are not responsible for all of the observed mortalities occurring during the fish passage through the mesh of the trawl codend. Nevertheless, physical damages may expose escapees to secondary infections from bacteria and fungi. This study investigated the types and occurrence of deformation for red mullet escapees to better understand the cause of their death. Improving the survival rate by using alternative gear modifications require detailed information on assessments of escape mortality including trawl gear-induced injuries. Therefore we aimed to determine the damages of body parts among the escaped red mullet from trawl codends. Materials and methods. Injuries and mortalities sustained by red mullet, Mullus barbatus Linnaeus, 1758, escaping from three different trawl codends were investigated in the Aegean Sea within 10–18 February 2012. The fish were held captive in fish cages and their behaviour was observed by divers three times per day for a period of 9 days. During the observation, dead fish were removed and immediately transferred to the laboratory for measurement and post-mortem examination. Results. The rates of escape mortality of red mullet penetrating through 40 mm square mesh codend, 44 mm diamond mesh codend, and 50 mm diamond mesh codend were 26.3%, 46.3%, and 27.4%, respectively. In total, 323 red mullet died after escaping from codends. Two of these could not be examined because of post-mortem decomposition and 21 others were defined as undamaged. Scale loss was the most common injury (300 fish, 93.5%) in red mullet individuals that died due to post escape mortality. The second most common injury was tissue loss (34.6%) followed by skin loss (19.9%). The majority of scale damage cases was around the abdomen and on either side of the caudal peduncle. In general, the frequency of the scale loss increased towards the tail. The frequency of different fin injuries of escaped fish were: 58.6% (torn), 44.5% (broken), and 6.2% (loss), respectively. Conclusion. Red mullet escape mortality was highly correlated to fish length (P < 0.001), however, we identified no clear relation between fish size and scale loss.",

    "abstract": "Background. Biological invasions represent a threat to the ecological stability of the ecosystem. Two lionfish species, the red lionfish and the devil firefish—both tropical marine predators native to the Indo–Pacific—were introduced to the Atlantic Ocean. However, only one—the red lionfish, Pterois volitans (Linnaeus, 1758)—has reached the level of an invasive species so far. It is crucial to learn its biology and ecology to understand trends of its invasion and impacts on native fauna, and to determine ecological changes as the invasion progresses. This study reports the growth and mortality of P. volitans in coral reefs of the Parque Nacional Arrecife Alacranes, off the northern Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, in Southern Gulf of Mexico. Materials and methods. Lobster diver fishers participated in voluntary captures of lionfish during the lobster fishing seasons of 2010–2012. In the laboratory, lionfish were taxonomically identified, measured, and weighed. Their length–weight relation was determined according to the commonly used equation: W = aTLb. Fish total lengths were used to calculate the parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth function (VBGF) of lionfish based on the size-frequency analysis routine ELEFAN in the FiSAT II software. Results. A total of 776 lionfish (9.0 to 38.9 cm in total length, 7 to 874 g in total wet weight) were collected. The VBGF parameters estimated were L∞ = 42 cm, K = 0.88–1, t0 = –0.107 years. The total mortality instantaneous rate (Z) calculated by the total length converted catch curve was 2.06 year–1. Conclusion. This study provides first calculation of growth parameters and mortality of P. volitans in Southern Gulf of Mexico as determined by size-frequency analysis. Results contribute to the knowledge on the biology of P. volitans and to a better understanding of aspects of its biological invasion in the region.",

The turbot, Scophthalmus maximus (Linnaeus, 1758), is of high economical value in Turkey and its biological characteristics have hitherto not been studied in the South-western Black Sea. The purpose of this study was to determine the age and growth, length&#8211;weight relation, condition factor, sex ratio, age and length at first maturity, and reproduction period of the turbot in the south-western Black Sea coast of Turkey. Materials and methods. Turbots were collected monthly in the south-western Black Sea coast of Turkey using bottom trawl and turbot gillnets. The fish samples were obtained between October 2004 and September 2005. Results. A total of 264 turbots were sampled and the age groups ranged from I to X (no individuals found at age group IX). Total lengths were between 14.0 and 70.0 cm, while weights varied from 34 to 5550 g. The length&#8211;weight relation for combined sexes was determined as W = 0.0085L3.1581. The von Bertalanffy growth equation parameters were: L&#165; = 73.55 cm, k = 0.17 year&#8211;1, t0 = &#8211;0.12 year. The observed sex ratio (female : male) was 1 : 0.35. The length at first maturity (L50) of the species was 20.38 cm for females and 24.68 cm for males (both at two years old). Monthly gonadosomatic index (GSI) values suggest the spawning activity extends from 15 April to late June. Conclusion. The legal fishing season of the turbot, imposed in 2012, begins on 15 June. We recommend that this date should be postponed to 30 of June due to turbot&#8217;s reproduction extending to late June.",

Selectivity estimates were made for the eight most abundant target and bycatch fish species, namely black scorpionfish, Scorpaena porcus Linnaeus, 1758; annular seabream, Diplodus annularis (Linnaeus, 1758); red mullet, Mullus barbatus Linnaeus, 1758; surmullet, Mullus surmuletus Linnaeus, 1758; round sardinella, Sardinella aurita Valenciennes, 1847; European hake, Merluccius merluccius (Linnaeus, 1758); greater weever, Trachinus draco Linnaeus, 1758; and blotched picarel, Spicara flexuosum Rafinesque, 1810, which accounted for 51.5% by number and 42.7% by weight of the fish caught with trammel nets in the sea trials. The SELECT method was used to estimate the selectivity parameters. Five different selectivity functions (i.e., normal scale, normal location, gamma, log-normal, and bi-normal) were applied with the bi-normal function providing the best fit as it had the lowest deviance value for all species and the lowest values for the dispersion parameter ( D /df). The mesh size of 16 mm in most of the cases retained specimens below the size at first maturity ( L m ). The mesh size of 19 mm seems more appropriate for red mullet, surmullet, and blotched picarel, the mesh size of 22 mm for annular seabream and round sardinella, while for European hake and black scorpionfish, the mesh size larger than 26 mm would be more appropriate.",

The values of the exponent b in the LWR W = a TL b ranged from 2.882 ( Lota lota ) to 3.517 ( Cobitis taenia ) and the correlation coefficient ( r 2 ) was greater than 0.96 for all species except for Cobitis taenia with 0.93. The relations allow for the accurate estimation of weight from length data with reduced handling times of fish in the field while enabling comparisons with other regions and future studies.

The species studied were: Herichthys carpintis (Jordan et Snyder, 1899) and Herichthys pantostictus (Taylor et Miller, 1983). We estimate their genetic diversity, gene flow, and demographic history and perform biogeographic reconstructions using a Bayesian computation approach and environmental niche modeling. The biogeographic reconstruction suggests a different history for each species. Environmental niche modeling indicates that both species experienced a demographic expansion during the Pleistocene but responded differently to Pleistocene climatic changes. In summary, their current sympatric distribution could be the outcome of contemporary and not historical processes reflecting a pseudo-incongruent pattern.",

Mercury levels were found to increase up the food chain; levels of Cd, Pb, and Cu were decreasing, while the Zn remained relatively stable. The authors are of the opinion that, when studying heavy metals along trophic chains, the entire food of animals instead of isolated food items should be analyzed. Moreover, the need to follow changes in contents of the metals studied during migrations of the fish from one habitat to another is emphasized. Sex-related effects were detected in heavy metal levels in certain organs. Mechanisms of defence against toxic metals were found to be better developed in females than in males. Differences in Hg, Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn levels in various organs notwithstanding, the metal contents in fish muscles were in the lower part of the ranges found.",

    "abstract": "Background. Fish are the principal source of n-3 and n-6 fatty acids for humans. Traditionally, these fatty acids have been supplied in the form of captured marine and freshwater fishes. Recently, freshwater cultured species have been increasing their share in the fish volume on the market. Therefore it is crucial for fish farmers to rear fish under proper condition and with proper feeding in order to receive good quality fish flesh at harvest. The presently reported study was aimed at determining the effect of diet with the increased level of lipids or carbohydrates on selected blood indices, reduced glutathione content, lipid peroxidation products concentration in the liver, and body weight gains in carp fingerlings reared in post-cooling waters. Materials and methods. The experiment was carried out in spring (2004) on 300 carp divided into two feeding groups. Group I was fed high-fat feed, whereas group II high-carbohydrate feed. After 7 weeks, fish blood and livers were collected for further analyses. Results. Significantly higher body weight gains were found in the fish fed high-fat feed as well as significant increase of haemoglobin (Hb) concentration in the blood of both feeding groups, which was accompanied by the increase of haematocrit (Ht) index. Furthermore, an increase in the concentration of lipid peroxidation products was observed as well as significantly lower content of reduced glutathione (GSH) in the livers of fish examined. Conclusion. The observed MDA values and reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration in the fish liver may indicate enhanced peroxidation processes in the organisms of the fish from both experimental groups, caused by their intensive feeding with extruded feeds. The peroxidation processes were more intensive in fish fed high-fat feeds.",

    "abstract": "Background. Chiasmodon harteli Melo, 2009 is a rarely captured deepwater fish. Even though the taxonomy of this genus is fairly well resolved, very little is known about the biology of individual Chiasmodon species. The objective of the presently reported study was to supplement new knowledge on C. harteli. Materials and methods. A single female specimen of C. harteli was captured on 1 July 2008 off the south-eastern coast of Greenland during bottom trawling at the depth of 1000 m. Morphometric and meristic data were collected and absolute values of the measurements [to the nearest 0.1 mm] were also related to the fish standard length and head length. To determine the gonad maturity stage, ovaries were fixed in Bouinâ€™s solution and buffered formalin (4%), dehydrated, embedded in paraffin wax, cut into 5-ÎĽm histological sections and finally stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Parasitological examinations covered the skin, eyes, mouth, nasal cavities, gills, gonads, spleen, gastrointestinal tract, liver, kidneys, peritoneum, and muscles. Parasites recovered were preserved in 70% ethanol. Results. Detailed morphometrics, including metric and meristic characters, as well as dentition formula, are provided. The individual studied was a mature female. The ovaries were in stage I Â (Merson scale) (mature, featuring oocytes in early vitellogenesis and oogonies). The mean oocyte cell diameter was 84.62 Â± 4.67 Âµm, while the range: 45.05â€“114.08 Âµm. The fish hosted only one parasite speciesâ€”Anisakis simplex (Nematoda; encysted L3 larvae). The stomach of the specimen studied was enlarged, although completely empty. Conclusion. This is the first substantiated record of this species since its original description in 2009.Â The structure of female gonads of C. harteli was described here for the first time. The acquired data on the gonadal development may shed new light on the speciesâ€™ reproduction and may help to approximate the spawning time. The nematode A. simplex were reported herein for the first time in a Chiasmodon.",

    "abstract": "The knowledge on the effect of different stress factors on Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar Linnaeus, 1758, is far from complete and therefore we decided to find out how the low water level stress could effect pathophysiological parameters such as: plasma cortisol level, haemoglobin, haematocrit, chloride (Cl&#8211;), sodium (Na+), osmolality, lactate, and glucose in this fish; and how this stressor affects the gut morphology. Two hundred and four juvenile Atlantic salmon were randomly distributed into six fibreglass tanks and divided into two groups: group 1 (control) and group 2 (low water level stress). The low water level stress did not affect growth performance and the pathophysiological parameters. Light- and transmission electron microscopy evaluations of the pyloric caeca and the distal intestine revealed that chronic stress had no effect on gut morphology. Low water level stress had no clear effects on pathophysiological parameters and gut morphology of Atlantic salmon.",

There were fewer vertebrae (Mean ± SD) in hatchery-reared- (52.5 ± 2.15) than in wild fish (53.7 ± 0.92). For both the hatchery-reared- and the wild individuals, the correlations between number of vertebrae and vertebral column length (VCL) per standard length (SL) were positive. Head length (HL) was approximated as SL minus VCL. Therefore, the proportion of HL in relation to SL became lower with the higher number of vertebrae. Their vertebral number may relate to the difference of body proportions between hatchery-reared- and wild fish.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of intensively reared European wels, (Silurus glanis L.) to adapt fish to pond conditions. Studies were carried out in two ponds in 1992 and four in 1993. The wels were stocked into the ponds when they were about 11 months of age and had average weights of: 498 and 469 g (1992) or 138, 281, 394 and 213 g (1993) respectively. When they were harvested at the age of 15-20 months, the average weights had increased to 1.461 and 2.125 g (survival 97 to 100%) for the fish stocked in 1992, and to 659, 1.323, 2.057 and 1.382 g (survival 86, 100, 87 and l00%) for the 1993 stock. Thus, European wels cultured intensively under controlled conditions do not lose their ability to actively seek and feed on live prey. Consequently it appears that intensively cultivated European wels may be stocked into ponds, and intensive rearing enables the stocking of fish at one year of age when the body weight may approach 500 g.",

There are insufficient data on the biological characteristics of the species in the literature. The aim of this study was to obtain the growth characteristics of Izmir nase population from Western Anatolia and compare them with the previous data reported in literature. Materials and methods. Biological features of Izmir nase were examined based on a total of 1208 specimens collected from Tahtali Dam Lake during the period May 2006&ndash;April 2007. Age of fish was determined by reading scales. Length&ndash;weight relation and the von Bertalanffy equationwere used to evaluate the fish growth. Results. Scales reading indicated the presence of 5 age classes. The computed growth parameters were: L&infin; = 29.19 cm, k = 0.177&middot; year&ndash;1 and t0 = &ndash;3.258 year&ndash;1 for both sexes. The length-weight relations were estimated as W = 0.019L2.97, W = 0.012L3.11 and W&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.011L3.13 for females, males, and both sexes combined, respectively. Conclusion. The Izmir nase from Tahtali Dam Lake was characterized by linear growth and it was observed that the fish grew faster during the first two years. Many endemic fish species in inland waters of Turkey are under the threat of extinction due to human activities (pollution, drought, dam construction, habitat degradation, and overfishing) but the species is not threatened by these factors in the study area.",

    "abstract": "Background. Fish communities can support or hinder water quality management. Sulej&oacute;w Reservoir, which is situated on the Pilica River in Central Poland, serves as a strategic reserve of drinking water for the &#321;&oacute;d&#378; Agglomeration. Precise knowledge of the long-term dynamics of the structure of the fish community, what was the aim of this study, is important for proper management to slow the eutrophication of the reservoir and prevent toxic algal blooms. Materials and methods. To determine fish species composition, multimesh gill nets with mesh sizes ranging from 11 to 80 mm were used. From 1993 to 2015, gillnetting was conducted 1&ndash;2 times per month from June through November in two representative parts of the reservoir, and principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to explore the temporal variation in fish community structure expressed as the relative contribution of each species to the total fish biomass. Results. Dominance fluctuated among four species in the fish community: common bream, Abramis brama (Linnaeus, 1758); roach, Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758); white bream, Blicca bjoerkna (Linnaeus, 1758); and pike-perch, Sander lucioperca (Linnaeus, 1758). PCA revealed three principal components with eigenvalues larger than one that explained 73.3% of the observed variance in the temporal changes in fish community composition. A negative correlation was found between pike-perch biomass and roach biomass (r = 0.82), while a positive correlation was observed between the biomass of pike-perch and that of common bream (r = 0.73). Consequently, there was a highly negative correlation between the biomasses of common bream and roach (r = 0.80). Furthermore, an interesting temporal pattern was observed; from 1993 to 2000, the fish community was dominated by common bream and pike-perch but then shifted towards domination by roach and white bream, despite declining phosphorous and carbon concentrations. Recently, this trend has been reversed, and a more balanced fish community structure has been established. Conclusion. Fish community succession, which is usually reported to be a one-directional process in reservoirs, i.e., from a riverine fish or percid-dominated to a cyprinid (bream)-dominated state, was more ambiguous in Sulej&oacute;w Reservoir. This was likely a consequence of both restoration issues related to decreasing nutrient loads and the influence of zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha invasion on the trophic relations in the reservoir.",

    "abstract": "Background. Crimean barbel, Barbus tauricus Kessler, 1877, is a riverine cyprinid fish commonly found in well-oxygenated streams with gravel bottom in the Black and Azov Sea basins. Its population has plummeted in the Salgir, Chornaya, and Alma rivers (Crimea) and hence this fish has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The knowledge about its age, growth, length&ndash;weight relation, spawning period, and diet composition are either scarce or not available. This paper aimed to fill the existing gaps in the knowledge by describing selected biological characteristics of B. tauricus in the &Ccedil;iftekavak Stream, in the outskirts of the city of Rize, NE Turkey. Materials and methods. Crimean barbel were collected by electrofishing (60 Hz pulsed DC) from April to November 2014. The total length (L, cm) and weight (W, g) of each specimen were recorded, and sagittal otoliths, gonads, and gut contents were then recovered. The length&ndash;weight relation (LWR) was calculated by a simple power function W = aLb. The age rings on sagittal otoliths were counted to determine fish age that was later used to analyse their growth by various growth models. The wet weight of gonads was used to calculate the gonadosomatic index (GSI). The gut contents were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and the contribution of a prey in the total diet composition was analysed by the occurrence frequency of prey groups (%O) and by numerical percentage frequency of prey groups (%N). Results. The age ranged from 0 to 4 years and more than 50% of the fish represented the 0-year group followed by 1-year group (21.9%) and 2-year group (13.5%). The von Bertalanffy growth model adequately described the correlation between the fish length and the age and indicated that females grew faster than males. The LWR identified negative allometric growth patterns in males and females. The higher values of GSI from males and females were recorded from April through July, while the lowest value of GSI was observed from September through November indicating the completion of the spawning season. A total of 14 prey items (including sand grains) were identified from the guts of Crimean barbel. The main prey items were Culex sp. (larva + pupa + adult), Chironomidae, followed by Ephemeridae and Zygoptera. They constituted up to &gt;78%O (&gt;95%N) of the diet. Conclusion. The results of this study will assess the conservative regulations and policies that will eventually provide a sustainable management of Crimean barbel stocks.",

Atotal of 145 salmon males belonging to a group of low growth rate specimens that had not smoltified during the first spawning season were sampled from the &quot;Aquamar&quot; Fish Farm (Miastko, Poland). The study was based on light microscopy examination of histological sections and a standard procedure of milt quality evaluation. The gonadal development stage was determined with Billard and Escaffre &prime;s 9-grade scale modified by Dziewulska. Results. The mean fork length of males was 10.45 cm. Three groups of males were distinguished: non-maturing (stage I); beginning spermatogenesis (inactive substage II); and precocious (stages VI to IX plus maturing males classified as undergoing &quot;attempted spermatogenesis&quot;). The groups contained 72.4, 4.8, and 22.8% of the males examined, respectively. The gonadosomatic index recorded in the three respective groups ranged from 0.010 to 0.164 (mean 0.040); 0.050 -0.155 (0.089); and 0.058 -6.219 (1.358). The gonadosomatic index is not an accurate indicator of gonadal activity. The precocious males semen contained from 6.1 to 23.0 million spermatozoa per mm 3 (13.41 million on the average). Spermatozoa performing progressive movements constituted 80-90%. Results. On the other hand, precocious male can fertilize mature eggs. The aim of this study was to estimate the magnitude of precocious maturation and to evaluate semen characteristics in a group of cultured 1-year-old salmon.Conclusion. Among non-maturing males and males beginning spermatogenesis, precocious individuals were detected, the latter produced semen of good quality.",

Fish samples were taken from catches of a purse seine fishery in Tachibana Bay, Japan between May and July 2011, covering before and after the passage of a typhoon in the area. Although major changes in total catch amount were not observed before and after the passage of the typhoon, the abundance of the Japanese anchovy, Engraulis japonicus Temminck et Schlegel, 1846, markedly decreased and bycatch of species increased, accompanied by increasing levels of diversity of the fish assemblage. Multivariate analysis showed that community differences before and after the passage were quantitative rather than qualitative. Comparisons in total length frequencies between the two periods indicated that specimens of the species compared were bigger in size for Trachurus japonicus (Temminck et Schlegel, 1844) and smaller for E. japonicus in the “after” period. These results suggest that the passage of the typhoon triggered not only interspecific faunal change but also intraspecific recruitment shifts in and around the bay.",

    "abstract": "The Indian butter catfish, Ompok bimaculatus (Bloch, 1794), is a high-value catfish that has gained immense consumer preference in South-East Asia. However, information on the nutritional requirements of this species is scanty. Hence, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of varying dietary lipid levels on growth, body composition, and activities of digestive and metabolic enzymes in larvae. Three isonitrogenous (40% crude protein) diets were formulated by supplementing fish and vegetable oil (1:1) at 4.5% (D1), 7% (D2), and 9.5% (D3) levels (containing crude lipid 5.7%, 8.0%, and 10.45%, respectively in diets D1–D3) to a fish meal- and oilcake-based formulated diet. Experimental diets were fed to butter catfish larvae (0.15 ± 0.01 g) in triplicate groups for a period of 42 days. Proximate compositions of the experimental diets, as well as fish carcass, were analyzed using standard procedures (AOAC 2005). Digestive and metabolic enzyme activities were analyzed at the completion of the experiment by standard methodology. Butter catfish larvae fed the diet D2 (8% crude lipid) resulted in the best performance in terms of weight gain (final weight 1.40 ± 0.07 g), net weight gain (1.31 ± 0.06 g), specific growth rate (5.50 ± 0.05% · day −1 ), and protein efficiency ratio (2.39 ± 0.17). The highest lipid deposition (2.90 ± 0.12%) in the carcass was also recorded in fish reared on diet D2. The final weight, net weight gain, protein efficiency ratio, and specific growth rate were significantly ( P &amp;lt; 0.05) higher in D2 having 8% lipid. Moisture and lipid contents of the whole body were significantly ( P &amp;lt; 0.05) higher in larvae fed diet D2. Amylase activity in fish significantly ( P &amp;lt; 0.05) decreased with increasing dietary lipid levels. The maximum alkaline protease, pepsin, and lipase activities were noticed in the larvae fed diet D2. Progressive decrease in liver glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities and significant increase ( P &amp;lt; 0.05) in the activities of neoglucogenic enzymes (glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bis phosphatase) were noticed with an increase in dietary lipid levels. Significantly lower ( P &amp;lt; 0.05) activities of LDH, ALT, and AST were recorded in the group fed diet D2. Results of the study indicated that 8% crude lipid in the diet could assure optimum growth and survival of butter catfish larvae during early development. An appraisal on growth, body composition, and digestive as well as metabolic function in the butter catfish larvae recorded in the study might provide some important information to consider application of formulated diets for the larviculture of Ompok bimaculatus .",

    "abstract": "The round goby, Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814), is a fish of Ponto-Caspian origin that has been invading the Baltic Sea since the 1990s. Currently, it is abundant and commercially important in some areas of the sea. This species was first reported in the eastern Gulf of Finland (GoF) in 2012. Its occurrence increased thereafter, however it has remained largely unstudied in this region. The aim of this study was to investigate the population characteristics of the round goby in the eastern GoF to better understand its expansion trend and whether it will become abundant enough to be exploited by the local fishery. Fish were caught using multi-mesh gillnets (12–60 mm mesh) and a beach seine (0.5–10 mm mesh). Occurrence, density, catch per unit effort, biomass per unit effort, relative number and biomass in catches, as well as age, size and sex ratio were studied. The species regularly occurred in samplings along the southern coastline of the GoF, as well as some central areas and along the northern coast. Within 2012–2019, its occurrence in catches increased, with the highest frequency in 2015–2019 in shallow waters (&amp;lt;1.5 m) of Koporye Bay (70%) and in the deeper waters of Narva Bay (74%). Similarly, the highest density in the shallow waters was also observed in Koporye Bay (10.0 ind. ∙ 100 m −2 ), and offshore in Narva Bay. Relative abundance and biomass usually did not exceed 23%, although it reached 93% in Narva Bay. The oldest specimen was five years old. Young-of-the-year (YOY) juveniles predominated in the shallow waters (85%), while three-year-olds prevailed in deeper waters (75%). Among the fish older than two years, females were more predominant (mean ratio 3 to 1), and males were larger than females. Specimens in all life stages were found in the eastern GoF, and their abundance increased annually, suggesting that the round goby has successfully colonized this region of the Baltic Sea. However, compared to other areas of the Baltic Sea inhabited by longer-established populations, its population size is still relatively low.",

    "abstract": "Presently reported study examined the length–weight relations for 11 goby species collected from a mangrove estuary of the Red River, Vietnam. A total of 1097 individuals of the following species, representing three goby families, were analyzed: Butis butis (Hamilton, 1822); Butis koilomatodon (Bleeker, 1849); Acentrogobius moloanus (Herre, 1927); Acentrogobius viridipunctatus (Valenciennes, 1837); Apocryptodon madurensis (Bleeker, 1849); Aulopareia unicolor (Valenciennes, 1837); Glossogobius giuris (Hamilton, 1822); Gobiopsis macrostoma Steindachner, 1861; Mugilogobius abei (Jordan et Snyder, 1901); Tridentiger barbatus (Günther, 1861); and Tridentiger trigonocephalus (Gill, 1859). The regression slope values ( b ) ranged from 2.909 to 3.621. The majority of species had positive allometric or isometric growth pattern with b ≥ 3, except for only one species ( G. giuris ) which had a negative allometric growth with b = 2.909. This study provided the first LWR information of four gobies that have not been reported in FishBase yet. Besides, the reference for LWRs of other gobies at an ecologically important area like Ba Lat Estuary is also provided.",

    "abstract": "Background. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants widespread in the environment. Their ability to accumulate in living organisms leads to food contamination, which is the main route of human exposure to PCBs. During analytical procedure of PCB residue determination, losses of these compounds may occur, which contribute to obtaining underestimated analytical results. Adequate analytical method of chlorobiphenyls determination should be applied to avoid the losses and obtain high recoveries and furthermore to enable accurate estimation of the risk of consuming contaminated food. Especially fish, due to the high bioaccumulation, may contain considerable amounts of these compounds. The aim of this study was to determine if the method of sample preparation influences the recovery of non-ortho (PCB 77, 81, 126, 169) and mono-ortho (PCB 105, 114, 156, 157) PCB congeners in selected fish species. Materials and methods. To prepare samples for chromatographic determination (HP 6890/5973 GC MS) two methods were applied. Fish muscle tissues were dried by rubbing in a mortar with anhydrous sodium sulphate or freeze dried (lyophilised) (LyoLAB 3000). The samples were fortified with a known amount of internal standard (decachlorobiphenyl), and some were additionally fortified with the standard solution of analysed PCB congeners. Results. nternal standard recoveries ranged from 57.61 &plusmn; 1.21% to 88.76 &plusmn; 4.03% in freeze-dried samples, and from 63.81 &plusmn; 5.11% to 97.50 &plusmn; 6.14% in samples rubbed with anhydrous sodium sulphate. Following lyophilisation, recoveries of analysed PCB congeners varied from 68.88 &plusmn; 11.74% for PCB 157 to 79.18 &plusmn; 12.33% for PCB 114. In the samples rubbed with anhydrous sodium sulphate the lowest recovery was determined for PCB 77 (72.40 &plusmn; 12.34%), the highest being typical for PCB 156 (83.47 &plusmn; 12.86%). Following lyophilisation, toxic equivalents (TEQs) for the examined fish species ranged from 0.0050&nbsp;ng-TEQ&#183;g-1 dry weight in salmon to 0.0299&nbsp;ng-TEQ&#183;g-1 dry weight in mackerel. Following rubbing with anhydrous sodium sulphate the highest&nbsp; toxic&nbsp; equivalent (0.0326&nbsp;ng-TEQ&#183;g-1 dry weight) was calculated for mackerel, and the lowest for salmon (0.0055&nbsp;ng-TEQ&#183;g-1 dry weight). Conclusion. The research has demonstrated that in most cases the results obtained with both methods have not differed significantly (P < 0.05), although freeze drying resulted in slightly higher losses of PCB congeners. Despite of smaller recoveries, freeze drying can be applied because of solvent saving and easier sample preparation.",

Atmospheric pressure is one of the most important factors affecting fish activity, but the potential influence on migration patterns of fish lacking a gas bladder is unclear. In this study, we analysed the influence of atmospheric pressure on round goby, Neogobius melanostomus (Pallas, 1814), from the coastal waters of the Black Sea. Materials and methods. Gobies were maintained at low pressure, decreased by 1333 Pa&nbsp; (= 10 mmHg), for several hours a day at temperature intervals of 10&ndash;12&deg;&#1057;, 14&ndash;16&deg;&#1057;, 18&ndash;20&deg;&#1057;, 22&ndash;24&deg;&#1057;, and 26&ndash;28&deg;&#1057; for 5 days and subsequently the pressure was returned to 1333 Pa&nbsp;&nbsp; and the results were compared to controls without pressure/temperature changes. Results. We found that increasing the atmospheric pressure at temperatures 10&ndash;24&deg;C influenced the activity of round goby, which then stabilised within one hour. Fish activity then decreased till it matches the level observed before experimental pressure changes. Changes in atmospheric pressure did not influence fish activity at higher temperatures of 26&ndash;28&deg;C. Conclusion. We intended to determine the influence of atmospheric pressure and water temperature on the swimming activity of round goby. The association between the atmospheric pressure, thermal tolerance, and the fish activity levels is suggested as a possible mechanism driving migrations of the round goby.",

The majority of the morphological characters of the specimen closely matched the diagnostic features of Oxymetopon cyanoctenosum Klausewitz et Condé, 1981 given by the previous study: ray in first dorsal-fin not elongated, tip of depressed rays just reach origin of second dorsal-fin origin; longest first dorsal-fin length shorter than body depth; dorsal crest high, approximately half of the diameter of pupil; tip of depressed pelvic fin reach to anal-fin origin; pelvic-fin length longer than pectoral-fin length. Therefore, the specimen from south-western Taiwan is identified as Oxymetopon cyanoctenosum. This species has previously been known only from Philippines, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. The presently reported specimen represents the first record for Taiwan, as well as the northernmost record of this species up to now.",

    "abstract": "Background. Recent genetic analyses of fish remains, obtained from archaeological sites, revealed that more than 2000 years ago the Baltic Sea was inhabited by sturgeons closely related to the Atlantic sturgeon, Acipenser oxyrinchus Mitchill, 1815. As some wildlife populations of the Atlantic sturgeon are still present in Canadian rivers, we decided to use those fish to restore the extinct Baltic population. Materials and methods. Fin clips of 50 A. oxyrinchus were collected from fry representing two hatcheries. At the hatchery&nbsp; No. 1 sturgeons were reared from fertilized eggs received from the Acadian Sturgeon and Caviar Inc., Canada. At the hatchery No. 2, larvae provided by the Regional Research Institute for Agriculture and Fisheries (Germany) were reared for several months until they were released into rivers. The molecular data of 22 and 28 specimens from hatcheries&nbsp; No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, were compared with homological D-loop sequences and some microsatellite loci derived from two museum specimens of sturgeons from the Tadas Ivanauskas Museum of Zoology, Kaunas, Lithuania. Signs of possible introgressive hybridization between Acipenser sturio Linnaeus, 1758 and A. oxyrinchus in two museum specimens were checked by comparison of alleles at loci AoxD161, AoxD188, AoxD297, AoxD242, and AoxC30. A possible affinity of between sturgeons released in Lithuanian rivers in 2015 and samples representing hatcheries&nbsp; No. 1 and No. 2 was estimated based on multi-locus genotyping data using the Structure software, version 2.3.4. Results. The same D-loop haplotype H1 characteristic for the museum specimens (MK637525 and MK637526) was also found as the only haplotype distributed among sturgeons reared in hatcheries and used for population re-establishment. A possible hybridisation between A. sturio and A. oxyrinchus was not confirmed for two museum specimens studied. The first results of genetic application undertaken in Lithuania also revealed the possibility to discriminate the individuals obtained from different hatcheries based on the set of 13 microsatellite loci Aox45, AoxD54, AoxD161, AoxD297, AoxD188, AoxD234, AoxD242, AoxC45, AoxC30, AoxD241, AoxD64, AoxD186, and Ls-68. The analysis of A. oxyrinchus specimens representing F1 generation of parental individuals reared in two separate hatcheries in Canada and Germany revealed significant differences in the allele composition and high probabilities for individuals released into the natural environment to be assigned to the hatchery of their origin. Conclusion. The results of the molecular analysis will be useful for identification of age, pedigree, and for initiating genetic monitoring of the restored population of the Atlantic sturgeon in the Baltic Sea.",

    "abstract": "Background. Construction of dams alters the physical, chemical, and ecological characteristics of the aquatic environment and modifies fish behaviour and the community composition. Few studies have shown the diel and seasonal fish distribution in tropical reservoirs, mainly in the proximity of the dam, where the risk of injury and death of fishes, which try to migrate downstream, is high. Thus, the data obtained in these regions can encourage actions that may attenuate the impacts on ichthyofauna. Hydroacoustic sampling is an effective tool to study fish behaviour and their spatial distribution in water bodies. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the spatial and seasonal distribution of fish in the reservoir of Três Marias (Minas Gerais, Brazil), immediately upstream of the dam, using hydroacoustic and gillnet sampling. Materials and methods. Hydroacoustics and gillnet sampling were carried out both during the day and at night, and during the rainy and dry seasons. For the acquisition of hydroacoustic data, we employed an echosounder (BioSonics DT-X Digital Scientific) with a split-beam digital transducer. For the biological data, gillnets of different mesh sizes were set. Results. Hydroacoustic data showed significant differences in fish depth between day and night surveys, with fish remaining in deeper water during the day, a phenomenon known as Diel Vertical Migration. Furthermore, hydroacoustic data showed that smaller fish (estimated by \"target strength\") concentrate at smaller depths. There was no significant difference in the size of fish between seasons. Limnological and operation variables were not related to the fish abundance. Distribution maps showed that during the day fishes were distributed in areas more distant from the dam, while at night they were closer to the dam. Gillnets sampled 127 individuals of 22 species and 57.5% of the collected specimens were migratory species. Conclusion. These results can contribute to the understanding of fish behaviour in reservoirs, as well as provide an empirical basis for the development of novel fish management measures for Neotropical dams.",

Drawing upon data from two fishery stock surveys conducted in the inshore waters of Hainan Island in 2022, this study undertook a comprehensive evaluation of the marine ecosystem’s health status in the region. Employing the Fish Index of Biological Integrity (F-IBI) analysis method, coupled with an examination of the structural and functional aspects of the fish community, our research sheds light on the prevailing conditions. Our study revealed a spatial dichotomy within the fish communities of the study area and delineated them into two distinct groups: the northwestern and southeastern ones, with evident disparities in community structure between the two. By employing indicator screening and calculation, we segmented the fish health index in the inshore waters of Hainan Island into five tiers. Despite discernible anthropogenic influences, the ecological health of these waters remained generally robust. Notably, the mean F-IBI of fall (56.30) significantly exceeded that of spring (48.16) ( P &amp;lt; 0.01). Furthermore, regarding spatial distribution, the ecological well-being of the southeastern waters surpassed that of the northwestern and Qionghzhou Strait waters. This study represents a pioneer endeavor to apply ecological health assessment methodologies towards informing resource management and conservation strategies for the inshore fisheries of Hainan Island. By furnishing a scientific foundation, our research contributes to the pursuit of sustainable marine ecological development within this locale.",

    "abstract": "The Otolith Collection of Fishes from the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea was created with the objective to conserve and illustrate the diversity of these structures from species living in the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, and the freshwater and brackish systems of the Yucatan Peninsula, incorporating morphological descriptions and morphometric data. Otoliths, non-skeletal calcareous structures that develop in the inner ear of fish, are essential for balance and hearing. They have become pivotal tools for age and growth determination, population analysis, and ecological, trophic, and archaeological studies due to their resistance to degradation and the extensive information they provide about the environment and physiology of fish. The collection now includes otoliths from 214 species, representing 67 families, obtained through sampling campaigns and collaborations with local fishermen. The otoliths are extracted using techniques that ensure the integrity of the structures for later preservation. High-resolution images were obtained using optical and scanning electron microscopy, and these images are stored in an online database. This database facilitates research and teaching by providing public access to digital specimens and associated data. In addition to fostering academic development, this collection represents a significant step towards the creation of a national platform for otolith data analysis, aligned with international efforts to digitize biological collections. Despite the financial and logistical challenges involved in building and maintaining biological collections, this collection demonstrates its value as an essential resource for taxonomic, systematic, and ecological studies, as well as for biodiversity education and awareness. The online availability of the collection not only facilitates access to data but also promotes innovation and international collaboration in the study of fishes and their habitats.",

Estimating the individual age from poorly defined periodic rings on the surface of otolith sections was difficult, but their microchemistry may reflect a shared nursery environment and subsequent migration throughout the entire river region. The growth curve estimates in the farmed population revealed a mean TL of 60 cm at four years, indicating that farmed fish were smaller than commercially captured wild fish. This is one of the first comprehensive studies of the river region, but more detailed surveys are needed to manage the fish resource sustainably.",

Their concentration in the muscles of crucian carp was higher when absorbed from food (i.e. Chlorella vulgaris cells), than directly from water.

    "abstract": "Background. Constant improvement of animal feed formulas calls for new raw materials. In the feeding of fish, one of diet recipe optimization methods is to search for feed protein sources alternative to fish meal. The presently reported study focuses on an unconventional protein source&mdash;the erythrocyte meal&mdash;for feeding fry of common carp. Materials and methods. The barothermal method (extrusion) was applied for the formulation of experimental feeds prepared as isonitrogenous and isocaloric diets. In the feeds tested, the erythrocyte meal was used as fish meal substitutes at different substitution levels (control diet C = 0%, E5 diet = 5%, E10 diet = 10%, and E15 diet = 15%). The feeds were evaluated on the basis of their physical and chemical characteristics. The feeding trial was carried out on the fry of carp (3.8 &plusmn; 0.1 g). The experiments were carried out under controlled conditions in an indoor fish tank facility in twelve 60-L flow-through aquaria. Each aquarium was stocked with 14 fish. In the final evaluation of the feeding tests, the following rearing effectiveness indices were used: food conversion ratio (FCR), specific growth rate (SGR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), and survival rate (SR). The data obtained were statistically processed using Statistica computer software. Results. At the end of the experiment, the fish body weight from treatment C was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher than the weights of treatments E5 and E15. Significant body weight differences occurred also between treatments E5 and E15. Values of specific growth rate (SGR) depended on the type of applied feed. The minimal value (1.86% &bull; d-1) was reached in treatment E15, while the maximal value (3.34% &bull; d-1) was recorded in treatment C. The most favourable FCR and PER values were recorded for C feed and they differed significantly from the values obtained with other experimental feeds. The application of experimental feeds to carp resulted in an increase in dry matter content in all treatments, and total protein and fat in the fish bodies from groups C and E5. However, there was no change in body ash content at feeding trial. Conclusion. Experimental results showed that the erythrocyte meal addition at 5%, 10%, and 15% rate as replacement for 15% of fish meal did not improve the rearing parameters of common carp fry.",

In contrast, G. derjavini colonised preferentially cultured scales from rainbow trout and, to a lesser degree, scales from salmon.Conclusion.The work indicated that gyrodactylids colonising host epithelia are at least partly dependent on host movements but also have an ability to sense host-specific molecules due to their specific attachment to specific host scales.",

The more than 10-metre deep archaeological site called the Vegetable Market (Kraut Markt), located near the Pomeranian Dukes&#8217; Castle in Szczecin, was explored in 1953-1964. The site was found to contain 20 early-medieval sediment layers and a layer overlying the basement consisting of riverine mud. Historically, the layers spanned a period from the second decade of the 10th to the beginning of the 5th decade of the 13th century. Materials and methods. The dig yielded numerous cultural artefacts, including fish remains examined during this study. The present paper summarises continuation of research on fish bone remains. The research allowed to identify a total of 10 085 bones in 725 labelled collections. The identified bones of 20 fish species were compared with bones of the extant known fish species, belonging to individuals of various size. The analysis made it possible to estimate the lowest abundance and weight of the fish present at the archaeological site examined. Results. The assemblage of 20 species, the remains of which were present in sediment of the site, turned out to be dominated, in terms of abundance, by carp bream (26.4%), followed by zander (17.5%), roach (15.9%), tench (9.5%), wels catfish (9.6%), northern pike (6.3%), European perch (6.0%), sturgeon (3.1%), and asp (2.2%), the total fish weight being dominated by sturgeon (31.3%), followed by wels catfish (27.0%), zander (15.3%), carp bream (10.6%), northern pike (5.1%), tench (4.2%), roach (2.2%), asp (2.1%), and European perch (1.1%). The remaining 11 species (twaite shad, European chub, ide, rudd, zope, white bream, Baltic vimba, ziege, crucian carp, European eel, and ruffe) contributed much less both to the abundance and to the weight.",

    "abstract": "Background. Synchiropus phaeton (G&uuml;nther, 1861) is a sexually dimorphic, benthic species that inhabits mud bottoms. This fish is one of the important by catch species in the trawl fishing. There is no commercial value. But it has ecological importance in this area. The information about the biology of S. phaeton is very limited. This study was conducted to investigate the age and growth relation of phaeton dragonet inhabiting the Gulf of Iskenderun, north-eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey. t_abstract=' Materials and methods. A total of 289 phaeton dragonets were collected as discards during the commercial trawl fishing at the depth range of 100&ndash;150 m in the Gulf of Iskenderun, north-eastern Mediterranean. The fish age was determined from sagittal otoliths. The age readings were performed using Leica S8APO microscope and were documented with the Leica Application Suite (Ver. 4.8.0) software. The index of the mean percentage error (IMPE) was calculated to assess the precision of the age determination between two independent readers. Growth parameters for all specimens were subsequently determined by fitting the observed and the length-at-age data using the von Bertalanffy growth equations. Total length&ndash;weight relations (LWRs) and the condition factor (CF) were determined. Results. The total length and weight of S. phaeton ranged from 7.0 to 19.0 cm and from 2.01 to 22.0&thinsp;g, respectively. The age of the studied individuals ranged from 2 to 7 years. The parameters of von Bertalanffy growth fitted to the mean observed total lengths-at age for each sex separately and were estimated as L&infin; = 23.358 cm, K = 0.248 year&ndash;1, t0 = &ndash;0.501 years for females and L&infin; = 26.543 cm,&nbsp; K = 0.156 year&ndash;1, t0 = &ndash;0.662 years for males, respectively. The overall growth performance index (G) value was determined as 3.46 for the combined sexes. The total length&ndash;weight relations were determined as W = 0.0121TL2.55, R&sup2; = 0.94; 95% confidence intervals of b = 2.395&ndash;2.687, t-test P &lt; 0.05 for females and W = 0.0094TL2.64, R2 = 0.93; 95% confidence intervals of b = 2.470&ndash;2.803, t-test P &lt; 0.05 for males. The types of growth were found negatively allometric (b &lt; 3). The highest condition factor was found at the age of 2 (0.62), while the lowest was found at the age of 6 (0.26). Conclusion. The presently reported study provides the first data on the age and growth of the S. phaeton that had not been studied previously in the Gulf of Iskenderun, north-eastern Mediterranean of Turkey. This study will contribute significantly to the conservation and management strategies of the species of S. phaeton in the future.",

    "abstract": "Background. European perch, Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758, is a predatory freshwater fish present also in the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea. The available catch data indicate that the population profile of this species is disrupted, and the condition of the population is not stable. The aim of this study was to determine the diversity and genetic structure of and assess phylogenetic links and gene flow between selected perch populations originating from various types of reservoirs in northern Poland. Materials and methods. A total of 392 perch were collected from selected bodies of water in north-western Poland and the fin samples were preserved in 96% ethanol or stored for short periods at –20°C. Genomic DNA was isolated, while for further mitochondrial DNA analysis, a 1081-bp fragment of the control region was amplified. Amplification products were sequenced and subjected to restriction analysis (PCR-RFLP) in order to determine the genetic diversity of the control region of mtDNA. The obtained sequences were analyzed using bioinformatics tools, and phylogenetic trees were generated to determine the degree of diversity between individuals in selected perch stocks. Results. Seven haplotypes were identified. Ten polymorphic sites were defined, and the degree of genetic diversity between selected haplotypes was determined. Based on the distribution of perch haplotypes, stocks from Pomeranian Bay (haplotypes F, D), the Szczecin Lagoon (haplotypes D, F, H), and the more homogeneous stocks from Pomeranian Bay (haplotypes F, D) and the Kamieński Lagoon (D, F) can be distinguished. Analysis of phylogenetic relations allowed identifying stocks with the most conserved genome, similar to the standard perch genome, and stocks that have become more genetically distant, probably due to the diversity of the inhabited ecosystems or natural hybridization observed in this species. Conclusion. European perch inhabiting waters of north-western Poland is a species with high plasticity, without isolated stocks or populations that can be clearly distinguished on a genetic basis. It does, however, have a tendency for mitochondrial genomic modifications, which is likely due to the broad spectrum of ecosystems inhabited by the species. Due to the homogeneity of the perch populations from the Szczecin Lagoon, the Kamieński Lagoon, and Lake Myśliborskie, they should be used for the restoration of populations in water bodies in which their genetic structure is severely disrupted. For the same reason, the policy of perch catches should be modified. The authors suggest increasing the protected size to 20 cm and limiting the catches of the species as by-catch by modifying fishing tools, including the introduction of a seasonal prohibition of tools that might eliminate individuals of 15–16 cm in length from natural waters in their spawning period.",

A few years later (1990), he completed his PhD at the Banyuls-sur-Mer Marine Station, under the dual auspices of Paris VI University and Aix-Marseille II University. His PhD thesis was centered on the study of the dynamics of the Posidonia oceanica ecosystem in the Port-Cros National Park. He focused his research on quantifying the biomass variations of the different compartments of this ecosystem in order to develop the modeling of its trophic functioning.

The unique ichthyofauna of Socotra accumulates fish species from different ecoregions, including commercial species which represent an important part of the local fishery. Positive identification of fish species and knowledge of their distributions are important for management strategies in fisheries and biodiversity conservation. Commercial fish species were collected at sea, taken from fish markets or landing sites, or observed underwater during two field trips in 2018 and 2019. Twenty-three new records of commercial fish species from twelve families are reported from the Socotra Archipelago based on collections and/or photographs: Plicomugil labiosus (Valenciennes, 1836); Epinephelus magniscuttis Postel, Fourmanoir et Gu&eacute;z&eacute;, 1963; Epinephelus marginatus (Lowe, 1834); Epinephelus morrhua (Valenciennes, 1833); Epinephelus rivulatus (Valenciennes, 1830); Alectis indica (R&uuml;ppell, 1830); Carangoides fulvoguttatus (Forssk&aring;l, 1775); Parastromateus niger (Bloch, 1795); Selar crumenophthalmus (Bloch, 1793); Uraspis helvola (Forster, 1801); Gerres oblongus Cuvier, 1830; Etelis coruscans Valenciennes, 1862; Diplodus omanensis Bauchot et Bianchi, 1984; Polysteganus coeruleopunctatus (Klunzinger, 1870); Lethrinus crocineus Smith, 1959; Gymnocranius elongatus Senta, 1973; Gymnocranius sp.; Wattsia mossambica (Smith, 1957); Argyrosomus japonicus (Temminck et Schlegel, 1843); Umbrina robinsoni Gilchrist et Thompson, 1908; Polydactylus plebeius (Broussonet, 1782); Histiopterus typus Temminck et Schlegel, 1844; and Siganus sutor (Valenciennes, 1835).

In 1968, the collection, with the entire faculty moved to Szczecin and immediately started to develop in the wake of the global expansion of the Polish fisheries fleet in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The main focus were the finfish, but other items represented also aquatic invertebrates, reptilians, and mammals. In the early 1980s, the exhibition halls of the museum were closed and converted to an experimental aquarium unit. The collection was gradually moved either to glass display cabinets in the hallways of the building or to the storage. After a major renovation of the building, the museum officially re-opened on 13 February 2020. The collection consists of 759 specimens with 329 dry ones, 430 formalin preserved, three specimens of tunicates, and one of cephalochordate. This paper provides the inventory list of the collection in the taxonomic arrangement of Nelson with updates from recent ichthyological publications. The most unique exhibit is a female of Acipenser oxyrinchus Mitchill, 1815&nbsp; caught in 1965 in the Vistula River (next-to-last specimen captured in Poland in the wild), at present the extinct species in the Baltic Sea basin.

    "abstract": "In the presently reported study, we estimated length–weight relation (LWRs) for seven species of freshwater fishes from Central America. Samples were collected using seines from 60 sites across Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama during field expeditions conducted between 1997 and 2012. The fishes were preserved and transported to the lab, where their total weight ( W ) was measured (to nearest 0.0001 g) and standard lengths were taken (to nearest 0.01 mm). Data were collected from four livebearers (Poeciliidae), Alfaro cultratus (Regan, 1908), Phallichthys amates (Miller, 1907), Poecilia gillii (Kner, 1863), and Priapichthys annectens (Regan, 1907); the cichlids (Cichlidae), Parachromis dovii (Günther, 1864) and Parachromis managuensis (Günther, 1867); and a silverside (Atherinopsidae), Atherinella hubbsi (Bussing, 1979). Estimates of parameter b ranged from 2.936 ( A. hubbsi ) to 3.696 ( P. gillii ), while estimates of parameter a ranged from 1.7 × 10 −6 ( P. gillii ) to 1.9 × 10 −5 ( P. managuensis ). Parameter b estimates were greater than three, consistent with allometric growth, with the exception of P. annectens , P. managuensis , and A. hubbsi , for which t -tests failed to reject the null hypothesis of isometric growth. Our results provide the first LWR information for five (71%) of these species and may prove useful for data imputation or estimating the biomass of poeciliid, cichlid, and atheriniform fishes in Central American rivers in the future.",

Measurements were taken for total length (0.1 cm precision) and total weight (0.1 g precision). The LWR parameters were determined using a linear logarithmic regression model of weight against length in which values for the slope of the regression, b , that are higher and lower than 3 indicate positive and negative allometric growth, respectively. The estimated values of parameter b ranged from 2.703 ( Iskandaria kuschakewitschi ) to 3.162 ( Gobio nigrescens ). The correlation coefficient ( r 2 ) values varied from 0.951 to 0.993, indicating a strong positive relation between length and weight. The maximum total lengths of four of the species ( Glyptosternon oschanini , Iskandaria kuschakewitschi , Triplophysa daryoae , and Triplophysa uranoscopus ) constitute new records, and the LWRs of twelve fish species have hitherto not been available in FishBase.",

Currently, the fish is only known to occur in Japan, Taiwan, and Samoa Islands. This anthiadine fish varies from other species of genus Plectranthias by having 30–33 lateral-line scales, a single red blotch below the lateral line, and numerous dark green blotches on the upper half of the body. The mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I ( COI ) is also described for the first time for this species in this article. The pairwise genetic distance computation reveals that P. yamakawai has a very low distance from the sequences of the other eight species of Plectranthias that have been submitted to GenBank.

    "abstract": "The phylogenetic position of the Southeast Asian catfish genus Encheloclarias Myers, 1937 within the family Clariidae is inferred herein using three mitochondrial nucleotide markers: cytochrome b , cytochrome oxidase subunit I , and 16S rRNA genes. We found that Encheloclarias is neither exclusively related to the African taxa having extended neural spines posterior to the dorsal fin ( Encheloclarias shares with some of these taxa the presence of an adipose fin, as opposed to absent in all other clariid taxa) nor to the Asian species of the genus Clarias Scopoli, 1777. Encheloclarias is hypothesized to be the sister group of all other clariids, except Horaglanis Menon, 1951. The inferred position of Encheloclarias confirms that the adipose fin in this genus has an evolutionary origin independent to that of the adipose fin found in some African clariids. Encheloclarias is not only ecologically remarkable, being adapted to acidic peat swamps in Southeast Asia, but it is also an ancient lineage sheltering in these habitats. However, the precise timing of the colonization of peat swamps by Encheloclarias remains to be investigated. The phylogenetic position of Encheloclarias further underscores the importance of studying and protecting the remaining peat swamp habitats in Southeast Asia and their distinctive aquatic fauna.",

The results of physiological and histological changes in Tilapia zillii (Gerv.) showed that, fish were under considerable stress during exposure to sublethal doses of this waste water. Physiological response of fish revealed a significant disturbances in respiratory system, fish metabolism, and ionic osmoregulation. Pathological changes attributed to heavy metals were observed in the gills, liver, and kidney. Bioaccumulation of copper was highest in the liver, followed by the gills, and flesh. It is concluded that the waste water of the Egyptian Copper Works was not acceptable to discharge to drainage canal.

The particular attention was taken to the changes of amounts of dissolved O2 and NO3-, NH4+ and PO43- ions in the water under the conditions of fertilised experimental ponds by the mineral fertiliser NPK with the formula of 17 : 8 : 9. The concentration of oxygen in fertilised ponds increased in the middle of rearing season by 2 to 129%, while at the and it decreased by about 20% in comparison with non-fertilised ponds. The need for phosphates was not shown in September, but the necessity of nitrates was evident during the whole period under study. The significant increase occurred in amount of NH4+ after fertilisation, but already after the second day the application of fertilisers it constantly decreased.",

Based on measurements of radii of various growth zones on the otolith cross-section, mean lengths attained in subsequent years of life were calculated. The von Bertalanffy growth equation parameters were estimated as follows: L&#8734; = 57.48 cm; K = 1.04; t0 =0.439 yr. The mean length at first maturity was estimated at 37.5 cm, i.e., 65% of L&#8734;.",

    "abstract": "Background. Half-smooth tongue sole, Cynoglossus semilaevis G&#252;nther, 1873, a marine teleost, is an important aquaculture species of great economic value. In recent years, its farm production increase coincided, however, with the number of reported cases of bacterial diseases. Further understanding of its immune response to bacterial pathogens can provide more information on pathogenesis and how to prevent disease using immune-related strategy. Peptidoglycan (PGN) recognition proteins (PGRPs) play important roles in the innate immunity against bacterial infection. In the presently reported study, a long type PGRP in half-smooth tongue sole (csPGRP-L) was cloned, and its sequence features, PGN binding ability, and mRNA expressions in different tissues after bacterial infection were also analyzed. Materials and methods. The full length of csPGRP-L cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR and RACE-PCR method, and its sequence features were analyzed by multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree. Meanwhile, its 3-D structure and PGN binding ability were analyzed by comparative modelling and molecular docking methods. Furthermore, the expressions of csPGRP-L in different tissues of healthy fish and fish infected with Streptococcus dysgalactiae were examined using quantitative real-time PCR method. Results. The full length of csPGRP-L cDNA was 1509 bp (GenBank accession No. HQ909441), with a 1446 bp of open reading frame (ORF) encoding 481 amino acids (aa), which possessed several conserved PGRP family features, e.g., a typical PGRP domain at its C-terminal, 3-D structure. Molecular docking showed that the csPGRP-L also possessed the PGN-binding ability. csPGRP-L was constitutive expressed in all the selected tissues from healthy fish and following S. dysgalactiae infection its expression was up-regulated in a tissue-specific expression pattern. Conclusion. The gene we cloned was exactly the homologue of vertebrates&#8217; long type PGRP in half-smooth tongue sole which was confirmed by several analyses and the up-regulation of csPGRP-L after bacterial infection suggest that csPGRP-L plays important role in antibacterial and anti-infective action.",

    "abstract": "Background. The peacock wrasse, Symphodus tinca (Linnaeus, 1758), is a common Mediterranean fish and the most abundant labrid species on the eastern coast of Algeria. Its age and growth, however, have been poorly studied. Such data are essential for proper fisheries management. The aim of this study is to provide information on the age and growth of this wrasse species from the eastern Algeria based on two different methods of fish age determination. Materials and methods. Age and growth of Symphodus tinca were determined by examining otoliths and scales of the fish sampled between January and December 2011 on the eastern coast of Algeria. Otoliths and scales from 515 and 469 specimens, respectively, were used to determine the age using commonly accepted procedures. Results. The age was successfully determined in 513 (99.61%) otoliths (277 females, 209 males) and in 428 (91.25%) scales (232 females, 173 males), representing age classes between 0+ and 5+ years (1+&#8211;3+ years for females and 1+&#8211;5+ years for males). The validity of the otolith and scale readings for estimating age and growth was supported by the back-calculation method. The success rate in reading otoliths and scales of Symphodus tinca was very high. The growth pattern is well described by the von Bertalanffy growth equation: from otoliths, L&#8734; = 26.46&#160;cm, k = 0.79, t0 = &#8211;0.12 for females and L&#8734; = 32.32 cm, k = 0.54, t0 = &#8211;0.22 for males; from scales, L&#8734; = 26.61 cm, k = 0.61, t0 = &#8211;0.45 for females and L&#8734; = 32.50 cm, k = 0.48, t0 = &#8211;0.31 for males. Otolithometry and scalimetry gave very close results. The total lengths (TL) ranged from 4.9 to 31.3 cm, and eviscerated weight (We) from 1.38 to 400.65 g. The length&#8211;weight relation showed an isometric growth for females (b = 3.01), and negative allometric growth for males (b = 2.86). Conclusion. The age was estimated by otolith and scale reading for males and females where the two methods yielded the similar results. Although the otolith readings presented a better fit (99.61%), scales could also be used with fairly good results (91.25%). In the future, research on the growth of S. tinca either of these two methods can be used to save time. The scale method, however, is certainly the easiest.",

As its population increased over the years, field observations were made on colour pattern variation, escape and reproductive behaviour. Regarding a cryptic and poorly documented species, these observations, despite their anecdotal form, need to be made available to ichthyologists. The aim of the present paper was to present this first record with associated field observations and to increse interest of ichthyologists in this species. Materials and methods. Observations were made while snorkelling on the west coast of Reunion Island on the fringing reef of L&#8217;Ermitage (district of Saint Gilles les Bains). The first specimen was observed on 28 January 2012 in a monospecific seagrass bed of Syringodium isoetifolium. Later surveys on the same reef between 2012 and 2016 provided additional observations of the species. Results. Colour pattern and body proportions of the first observed specimen well agree with N. macrolepidotus as described by Randall and Earle (2004). Subsequently observed specimens expressed a previously undescribed colour pattern variation. Escape and reproductive behaviour was observed and are discussed. Conclusion. A reproducing population of N. macrolepidotus has apparently established at Reunion Island. The present field observations of the behaviour of this species should be followed by more detailed ethological studies.",

    "abstract": "Background. The study is a contribution to Project CELFISH which involves genetic identification of populations of fish species presenting a particular economic importance or having a potential to be used in the so-called commercial substitutions. The EU fish trade has been showing a distinct trend of more and more fish species previously unknown to consumers being placed on the market. Molecular assays have become the only way with which to verify the reliability of exporters. This paper is aimed at pinpointing genetic markers with which to label and differentiate between two populations of splendid alfonsino, Beryx splendens Lowe, 1834, a species highly attractive to consumers in Asia and Oceania due to the meat taste and low fat content. Materials and methods. DNA was isolated from fragments of fins collected at local markets in Japan (MJ) (n = 10) and New Zealand (MNZ) (n = 18). The rhodopsin gene (RH1) fragment and 16 microsatellite DNA fragments (SSR) were analysed in all the individuals. The sequences obtained were processed using the BioEdit and BLAST software, whereas SSR data were processed with the GeAlEX analysis package. Results. The BioEdit software-aided comparison of MJ and MNZ nucleotide sequences of the rhodopsin gene fragments were identical and showed 100% agreement with the alfonsino sequence deposited under access number DQ197832. The preliminary analysis of SSR markers showed all the loci analysed in both populations to be polymorphic, and when randomly selected specimens were assigned to the original populations. The affinity test correctly identified the provenance of all those specimens. Conclusion. The results obtained constitute a tool for molecular differentiation between alfonsino populations collected in the FAO 81 (New Zealand) and FAO 71 (Japan) areas for the purpose of catch quota control and for checking the agreement between the label declaration and the actual product.",

    "abstract": "Background. The king angelfish, Holacanthus passer Valenciennes, 1846, is one of the principal species captured in the Gulf of California, Mexico, for the purpose of the aquarium trade. Although the species has been exploited for more than 40 years, studies have not yet been undertaken to understand the population parameters required for adequate management of the fishery. The objective of this work was to describe for the first time the growth and mortality of this species. The information provided in this study contributes to the generation of knowledge necessary to establish sustainable management practices. Materials and methods. The growth curve of the species was determined by applying a modal progression analysis of the sample length frequency distribution to determine the number of cohorts present through the multinomial statistic based on a probability function. Once the cohorts were identified, the von Bertalanffy growth model was adjusted using a maximum likelihood function. To estimate the natural mortality rate and natural mortality-at-age, empirical methods were used. Were also estimated the size and age at first maturity (Lm, tm), the maximum age (tmax), the fishing mortality (F), the total mortality (Z), and the exploitation rate (E). Results. In total, 794 king angelfish were measured and weighed, including 659 juveniles and 135 adults. The total length of the fish ranged from 3 to 29 cm, and the weight was within 2â€“797 g. The potential weightâ€“length relation was significant (r2 = 0.94; P > 0.01), showing a negative allometric curve with the parameters: a = 0.108 and b = 2.618. The parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth equation were: Lâž = 37.894 cm, k = 0.127 yearâ€“1, t0 = â€“ 0.658 years. The natural mortality rate was estimated to be 0.315 yearâ€“1. The following values were estimated for: Lm = 21.835 cm, tm = 6.10 years, tmax = 20.01 years, Z = 1.19 yearâ€“1, F = 0.88 yearâ€“1, and E = 0.74. Conclusion. Estimates of natural mortality could be linked to management measures such as catch quotas.",

    "abstract": "Background. Successful fisheries management requires estimation of gillnet selectivity for optimum exploitation of the resource. In the Okavango Delta, no study has assessed the selectivity of gillnets for Clarias gariepinus (Burchell, 1822) which is an important component of both the subsistence and the commercial gillnet fishery catch. The aim of this study was to simulate the harvesting pattern of the commercial gillnet fishery and provide gillnet selectivity parameters for C. gariepinus. This will help fishery managers with information on the appropriate mesh sizes needed for sustainable utilisation of the catfish resource. Materials and methods. Monthly gillnet sampling was conducted over a period of 8 years from 2001 to 2009. The SELECT method was used to estimate gillnet selectivity for C. gariepinus using catch data from four mesh sizes (73 mm, 93 mm, 118 mm, and 150 mm). Results. The 93 mm and 118 mm mesh sizes were the most efficient when capturing C. gariepinus accounting for 44.6% and 21.9% of the total catch, respectively. Mean fish length increased with increasing mesh size and was significantly different between mesh sizes (P &#60; 0.001). The modal fish lengths for the four mesh sizes were estimated at 41.63 cm, 53.23 cm, 66.35 cm, and 85.54 cm in order of increasing mesh size. Conclusion. The modal fish lengths for meshes 93 mm and 118 mm are greater than the size at maturity and therefore the current commercial gillnet fishery which uses 100 mm mesh size may not be a threat to the C. gariepinus population in the Upper Okavango Delta. Future studies should aim to conduct fishery dependent selectivity studies in the lower Okavango Delta to determine if selectivity changes with location and gear. Moreover, a comprehensive age-based stock assessment is required to establish the mesh size that optimizes yield without adversely depleting the spawning stock biomass.",

    "abstract": "Background. Salmonid spermatozoa are characterised by a very short time of activity in the water, therefore sudden water pollution in the form of increased salinity on the spawning grounds may have a negative effect on the sperm motility parameters, thus affecting the subsequent egg fertilisation and, consequently, the number of hatched individuals of the species. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of water salinity on the motility parameters of spermatozoa of brook trout, Salvelinus fontinalis (Mitchill, 1814). Materials and methods. Sperm motility was monitored with a camera (Basler A312fc) coupled with Nikon Eclipse 50i light microscope from the moment of their activation (contact with water) until the cessation of movement. The following water-salinity treatments were tested: 1.0‰, 3.0‰, 5.0‰, and 10.0‰. The motility parameters: VCL, VSL, VAP, ALH, BCF, LIN, STR, WOB, and MOT, were analysed with Computer Assisted Sperm Analysis (CASA). Results. The mean values of the studied motility parameters of the brook trout spermatozoa (obtained within 30 s), whose activation took place in the water of 0.35‰ salinity and in water of 1.0‰ and 3.0‰ salinity, did not differ significantly. The highest mean values of motility parameters were recorded for the water of 5.0‰ salinity. The 10.0‰ treatment caused a distinct decrease in the values of all the studied parameters. The percentage of MOT was the highest (37.5%) in the sample activated in the water used for fish rearing (0.35‰). In the remaining samples the MOT was lower, and in the water of 10.0‰ salinity it was only 9.1%. No spermatozoa movement of any kind was recorded in the 35th second of the experiment. Conclusion. The values of the motility parameters as well as the percentage of motile spermatozoa (MOT) in the semen decrease with increasing salinity of the water used for activation, and with increasing time of exposure.",

    "abstract": "Background. Bastard grunt, Pomadasys incisus (Bowdich, 1825), is reported as a well-established species in the Mediterranean Sea. Although bastard grunt has rapidly expanded its area of distribution in the Mediterranean, there is no information about its age and growth. The aim of this study was to provide data about growth, condition, and first sexual maturity of the species in order to contribute to a better management of its fishery. Materials and methods. A total of 515 specimens of bastard grunt were caught in the Gulf of Tunis. The age was determined from otoliths. Length–weight relation, von Bertalanffy equation, and growth rate were employed to evaluate the fish growth. Also the condition factor and length at first sexual maturity were calculated. Results. In the Gulf of Tunis population, females were significantly predominant and the overall sex ratio (M : F) reached the value of 1 : 2.17. The two sexes showed a positive allometric growth. The marginal increment analysis validated the annual deposition of one single annulus in the winter. Growth in (total) length (TL) was approximately 65% during the first year of life. The von Bertalanffy growth equation was TL = 23.9 × (1 – e–0.186 × (t + 4.62)). The somatic condition of fish increased markedly during the late spring and summer. Length at first sexual maturity of the bastard grunt was 16.6 cm for males and 16.8 cm for females, which correspond to an age of about 2 years. Conclusion. The rapid growth during the first year of life, the early maturity and the moderately short life cycle contribute to the relatively fast spreading of the species.",

    "abstract": "Background. Intra cohort cannibalism is one of the main factors that affects the growth and survival of cultured fishes, especially in the larval and juvenile stages. Cannibalism is mainly influenced by extrinsic factors, but intrinsic effects cannot be excluded. As regards the family Percidae, all-female rearing can be advantageous for the fish growth, but does this solution have some impact on cannibalism? The main objective of this study was to investigate potential differences in cannibalism rate and its relation to further growth and survival between mixed-sex and all-female Eurasian perch, Perca fluviatilis Linnaeus, 1758, larvae reared in full-siblings and half-siblings groups. The additional purpose of this study was to determine whether there was some maternal influence on the cannibalism–survival–growth dynamics in cultured Eurasian perch larvae. Materials and methods. Cannibalism, survival, and growth were studied in mixed-sex and all-female progenies of Eurasian perch larvae. Ten-day old larvae (body weight of 20 mg) originating from the crosses of four parents (two females: f1 and f2; one male: ma; and one neomale: mc) were reared over 77 days at 22°C under the light regime of 16 : 8 (light : dark) in replicated groups consisting of mixed-sex full siblings (f1ma, f2ma), all-female full siblings (f1mc, f2mc), or mixed-sex half-siblings (f1ma + f2ma) and all-female groups (f1mc + f2mc). Results. At the end of the experiment, there was no sexual growth dimorphism and no sex-biased cannibalism. Neither the effect of sibling versus half-sibling groups, nor effects of normal progeny versus all-female population on survival and cannibalism rate were significant. By contrast, maternal effects on cannibalism were observed, chiefly as regards type I cannibalism (partial and tail-first ingestion), and they impacted on survival, as mortality from other causes (complete cannibalism or others) was independent from maternal origin. Conclusion. There is no particular disadvantage of rearing monosex female progenies in term of cannibalism and survival, whereas this culture-management solution is prone to produce long-term advantages for the perch growth, owing to the faster growth of female fish.",

    "abstract": "During the course of evolution, numerous taxa abandoned canonical sex and reproduced asexually. Examination of the Cobitis hankugensis × Iksookimia longicorpa asexual complex already revealed important evolutionary discoveries tackling phenomena like interspecific hybridization, non-Mendelian inheritance, polyploidy, and asexuality. Yet, as in other similar cases, the investigation is hampered by the lack of easily accessible molecular tools for efficient differentiation among genomotypes. Here, we tested the cross-species amplification of 23 microsatellite markers derived from distantly related species and investigated the extent to which such markers can facilitate the genome identification in the non-model hybrid complex. We found that 21 out of 23 microsatellite markers were amplified in all genomotypes. Five of them could be used for easy diagnostics of parental species and their hybrids due to species-specific amplification profiles. We also noted that three markers, i.e., IC654 and IC783 derived from Cobitis choii Kim et Son, 1984 and Iko_TTA01 from Iksookimia koreensis (Kim, 1975), had dosage-sensitive amplification efficiencies of species-specific alleles. This could be further used for reliable differentiation of genome composition in polyploids. The presently reported study introduces a noninvasive method applicable for the diagnosis of ploidy and genome composition of hybrids, which are not clearly distinguished morphologically. We showed that very detailed information may be obtained even from markers developed in distantly related taxa. Hybridization is being increasingly recognized as a driving force in evolution. Yet, proper detection of hybrids and their ploidy is particularly challenging, especially in non-model organisms. The present paper evaluates the power of microsatellite cross-amplification not only in the identification of hybrid forms but also in estimating their genome dosage on an example of a fish taxon that involves asexuality, hybridization as well as ploidy variation. It thus demonstrates the wide applicability of such cheap and non-invasive tools.",

    "abstract": "Background. Ghrelin, a newly discovered hormone is involved mainly in the regulation of body energy homeostasis. It has also been proved that ghrelin affects many other processes including the control of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis in vertebrates. Ghrelin interacts also with other peptides and neurotransmitters, which are involved in gonadotropin release, such as endogenous opioid peptides. The aim of the experiment was to compare the effects of ghrelin and naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, on LH secretion by pituitary cells of mature female and male common carp, Cyprinus carpio L. Materials and methods. In the in vitro experiment the time-dependent (10 and 24 h) action of ghrelin (10&ndash;7 or 10&ndash;6 M) and naltrexone at 10&ndash;6 M added alone or in combination on LH secretion by enzymatically dispersed pituitary cells of mature female and male carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) was studied. Results. Ghrelin alone at a dose of 10&ndash;6 M stimulated LH secretion after 10 h of female- but not male-derived cell incubations. Ghrelin at 10&ndash;7 M had no effect on LH secretion from either female or male cells. Naltrexone alone stimulated LH secretion only after 24 h of female cell culture. In male cells no significant changes in LH secretion in response to naltrexone alone were found after 10 or 24 h incubation period. Combined treatment (ghrelin 10&ndash;7 or 10&ndash;6 M and naltrexone) stimulated LH secretion in female and male cell incubations at 10 and 24 h: LH levels were significantly higher in comparison to control, to ghrelin alone (in cells of both sexes) and to naltrexone alone (in male cells only). Conclusion. The results suggest that opioids and ghrelin may control LH secretion in carp acting synergistically, probably through the same receptor type. The concept of opioid and ghrelin interaction in the gonadal steroid feedback on LH release is also discussed.",

The initial function for the description of a cross-section contour is the ellipse equation including a factor deforming the symmetry with respect to one of axes. Such equations may find their use in fisheries engineering and food-fish processing. Materials and methods. The morphometric examination of the fish raw material was carried out in order to check whether the proposed function meets expectations and draws a curve. The model fish species used was flounder, Platichthys flesus (L.). Results. The mathematical equation describing changes in a cross-section contour of flatfish body shape along its longitudinal axis. The high value of correlation coefficients (r&nbsp;>&nbsp;0.99) showed that a hypothetical curve matches experiment results quite well. The equation describing the shape of a flatfish body cross-section contour can be defined by means of the ellipse equation including a factor deforming the symmetry with regard to one of its axes. The function represented by equation (8) draws a curve that follows the contour of the fish cross-section. Conclusion. The shape of flounder, defined in the presently reported study may have importance for sustainable and responsible fisheries, helping to design more selective fishing gear. It can also be used in food-fish engineering for designing more effective fish-processing machinery.",

The fyke nets used in eel catches are multi-species gear. Changes in the fishing intensity and location of this gear impacts local fish resources, as does changing preferred gear for other types. Materials and methods. The data on the eel landings and the numbers of licences from all the fisheries bases were obtained from the Regional Sea Fisheries Inspectorate. Direct observations of the spatial and temporal deployment of the fishing effort was observed monthly in the 2000&ndash;2007 period. The trends of changes in relative eel abundance were identified from fyke net complexes deployed in the eastern fishing grounds. Results. Landings and directed fishing effort differed both seasonally and spatially. The most effective fishing grounds were in the eastern (near the border with Russia) and western parts of the lagoon. The discontinuation of stocking resulted in decreased catches and then in fishing effort. Decreases in eel catches and fishing efficiency were evident except in 2003 at the Piaski and KÄ…ty Rybackie fisheries bases (the northern part of the lagoon). Conclusion. The availability of eel stocks had the greatest impact on fishing efficiency and gear distribution patterns. The reduction of fyke net fishery because of low incomes shifted the focus of the fishery to gill nets targeting pikeperch.",

This study, carried out in the MPA of Niamone–Kalounayes (Casamance River estuary, Senegal) aims to enhance our knowledge of the reproductive biology of the largescale mullet, Parachelon grandisquamis (Valenciennes, 1836), a species highly prized by the local population as a food source. To better understand its reproductive biology, a series of monthly samplings over twelve (12) months from July 2021 to June 2022 was carried out. Experimental fisheries were carried out at six (6) stations located in secondary channels lined with mangroves, using a seine net (250 m long and 25 mm mesh side). A total of 361 individuals were sampled, including 321 female specimens and 40 male specimens. The calculated sex ratio was in favor of females (1:8), with a significant difference between the calculated sex ratio and the theoretical 1:1 sex ratio (χ 2 = 218.73; P -value &amp;lt; 0.05). In the MPA of Niamone–Kalounayes, the breeding period of P. grandisquamis extends from March to July, from the end of the dry season up to the beginning of the wet season. The sizes at first sexual maturity were 17 cm in males and 18 cm in females, showing that in the MPA of Niamone–Kalounayes, males and females of P. grandisquamis reach sexual maturity at very close sizes (χ 2 = 0.02; P &amp;gt; 0.05). As this species is subject to the intense fishery by many actors in the area, these findings may be proven useful in the process of developing a management plan for this particular species.",

Upeneus pori and Upeneus tragula Richardson, 1846 are very similar. The difference is that the former has seven spines in the first dorsal fin, lacks any spots or blotches on its body, and exhibits white or creamy white barbels. The latter has eight spines in the first dorsal fin, exhibits black spots on its body, and displays orange-colored barbels, along with different caudal fin patterns. Pairwise genetic distance computation demonstrated that U. pori exhibits a very low genetic distance from sequences of the other three recorded U. pori species found in the type locality of Israel, Red Sea, as documented in GenBank.

The experimental design included a control diet (POMM0) formulated with soybean meal, as the main protein source, and four diets designed with increasing levels of POMM: 25% (POMM25); 50% (POMM50); 75% (POMM75); and 100% (POMM100). Experimental diets were administered to 420 fish, randomly distributed in 15, 100-L tanks. The feeding experiment lasted 45 days. Diets and the final whole body were submitted to a proximate composition analysis. Growth, feed efficiency, protein utilization, and digestive enzyme activities were assessed. Compared to POMM0 and POMM25, weight gain (WG), and specific growth rate (SGR), significantly ( P &amp;lt; 0.05) decreased in fish that were fed POMM50, POMM75, and POMM100%. Feed conversion ratio (FCR), protein efficiency ratio (PER), and survival rate (SR) were not significantly affected by experimental diets.

The affected fish species were documented photographically and a taxonomic list, with their abundance, density, and biomass is presented, as well as a summary of the affected ecosystems according to the affinity of these species. A total of 54 species were recorded; 48 in Telchac and 21 in Chicxulub, with 15 species occurring at both sites. The affected species have a greater affinity to reef systems, beaches, and estuaries, in that order, between 3 m and 113 m depth. In the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) nomenclature, the majority of the species are in the “least concern” category, however, species were also recorded in the “near threatened”, “vulnerable”, and “endangered” categories. Therefore, it is extremely important to monitor these events and report the affected species, since the increase in the frequency of these phenomena due to local and global factors can have significant repercussions on species endemic to the coastal zone.",

The study suggested that since the active compounds of piscicidal plants, at safe concentration level affected the laste system of fishes. Consequently the rate of feeding was inhibited. The less feeding and metabolic disorders found expression as a decline in the total growth of treated fish.

The site selected for Station 2 was a floating shipyard dock about 10 km upstream. The water there had lower salinity and higher nutrient loads than at Station 1. The short,14-day-long periods of exposure were intended primarily to yield information concerning the rate and variability of colonization. In addition, long-term exposure panels were deployed for the entire period of the experiment at both stations. Species diversity was lower in both the micro- and macrofouling communities at Station 2. Settlement of diatoms and ciliates proceeded throughout the whole season, its intensity being higher in spring at both stations. Domination of ciliates was more pronounced at Station 2 than at Station 1, diatoms being more abundant at Station 1. The macrofouling community at Station 1 was dominated by Balanus improvisus, Laomedea loveni, Electra crustulenta, Mytilus edulis, and Fabricia sabella, while the community at Station 2 was dominated by Balanus improvisus, Cordylophora caspia, and Nais elinguis.",

Estimates using the batch fecundity method show that anchovy stocks were highly overestimated because their fecundity was underestimated. It is obvious that in future surveys in the Adriatic, the batch fecundity methods has to be applied.",

    "abstract": "Background. Klein&rsquo;s sole, Synapturichthys kleinii (Risso, 1827), is a rare fish, included in the IUCN Red List as Data Deficient, and its biology is poorly known. Biological investigations of S. kleinii have been surprisingly rare in Tunisian waters. In the presently reported study, we investigated the reproductive period, size at first sexual maturity, and fecundity of S. kleinii along the Tunisian waters, with the aim of achieving the first complete and comprehensive description of the reproduction of this fish in the Mediterranean Sea. Materials and methods. A total of 294 specimens of S. kleinii were sampled over two years, off the Tunisian coasts. Sex ratio was estimated through the seasons of the year and the size classes. The stage of maturity was determined macroscopically only for females. Monthly gonadosomatic index (GSI), monthly hepatosomatic index (HSI), and condition factor (K) were calculated for males and females of S. kleinii. Size at first maturity was estimated only for females during the spawning season. Eighteen mature females at spawning stage were collected, weighed, and fixed in 4% formaldehyde solution for fecundity estimation. Results. Annual sex ratio showed significant differences between males and females. In specimens exceeding 27 cm in total length females outnumbered males significantly. The Klein&rsquo;s sole reproduction period started in October and ended in January. The gonadosomatic index reached highest values in November for females and males. Females attained sexual maturity at 20.53 cm total body length (TL). Total fecundity ranged from 3647 to 23 174 eggs. We found a low correlation coefficient between total fecundity and total length, but a high correlation coefficient between eviscerated weight and ovary weight. Conclusion. Our results constitute a preliminary baseline for monitoring changes in the biological indexes linked to the reproduction cycle and length at first sexual maturity of S. kleinii. The presently acquired data will enable biologists to assess the status of this fish and develop culture technology in natural waters and will be useful for the fishery biologists and conservation biologists, for successful development, management, production, and ultimate conservation of this favoured Tunisian food fish.",

Twenty-six sets of growth parameters were thus estimated, and 66 further sets were located in the literature and FishBase. Prochilodontidae and Serrasalmidae showed a strong inverse relation between the variables composing the auximetric plots.",

The main objective of this paper is to document the presence of this species in the waters of Taiwan. Three specimens (212.6&ndash;344.3 mm standard length) of P. polytaenia were collected from southern Taiwan in 2017. The morphology and fresh coloration of the collected specimens are herein described. The majority of the morphological characters agree well with previous descriptions of P. polytaenia: chin naked with 6 pores; total gill rakers 27&ndash;28; dorsal fin with 12&ndash;13 spines and 21&ndash;22 rays; scales ctenoid; lateral line scales 54&ndash;56; 8&ndash;11 black-edged white longitudinal stripes on body; fins, iris and upper lip yellow; tongue and gill rakers scarlet. Therefore, the specimens from southern Taiwan are identified as Plectorhinchus polytaenia.

In February 2013 two specimens were caught by a commercial bottom trawler on the southwestern Portuguese coast and in August 2019 another specimen was caught at the same location. Analyses of diagnostic morphological characters and morphometric characteristics confirmed the specimens as Ophichthus rufus. The distribution of this species has been described in the literature as endemic to the Mediterranean Sea, however other references describe the presence of O. rufus in Principe Island, Morocco, and Gulf of C&aacute;diz. The new finding described herewith represents the first record of O. rufus for the western Iberian coast and also constitutes the northernmost record of the species.",

Although S. apiensis has been redescribed recently, details of its distributional range and habitat have remained unclear. The presently reported study sought to clarify some aspects of both. Two specimens of S. apiensis were examined, counts and proportional measurements following Hata and Motomura (2017). All measurements were made with digital calipers to the nearest 0.01 mm. Institutional codes follow Sabaj (2019). Two specimens, collected from Japanese river estuaries, represent the first Northern Hemisphere records of S. apiensis, extending the northern limit of the species&rsquo; distribution by approx. 4300 km. Stolephorus apiensis is considered to be widely distributed in the western Pacific from southern Japan to Samoa, most likely as a sometime inhabitant of estuarine waters. The new standard Japanese name &ldquo;Nampu-ainokoiwashi&rdquo; is proposed for the species.",

    "abstract": "The fish biodiversity in the Congo River and its tributaries is extremely rich but the information on fish communities in the headwaters in terms of catch and biomass estimates is rare. Fishes in the running and stagnant waters in this region are of vital importance as a food resource for local residents. This study aimed to describe the fish community, catch, and biomass in the three headwater streams Bambou, Lebomo, and Bongo in the Lake Tumba Landscape (LTL) of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Such information is of vital importance as a benchmark to understand the sustainability of the fish population for future generations of residents of the LTL. The field data were collected from 2007 through 2011, including dry and wet seasons. Here we present the results of this systematic, multi-annual study which was the first for fishes in streams of this region. In total, 50 species of 15 families were found in the nutrient-poor brown waters of these streams where high concentrations of humic acids cause a low pH. Among abundant species occurring in all three streams were the cyprinid Enteromius holotaenia (Boulenger, 1904), the mormyrid Marcusenius moorii (Günther, 1867), the alestids Clupeocharax schoutedeni Pellegrin, 1926 and Bryconaethiops boulengeri Pellegrin, 1900, and the clariid Clarias angolensis Steindachner, 1866. Bongo Stream was distinguished from the others by a rich abundance of Alestopetersius compressus (Poll et Gosse, 1963). The presence of several species at low pH (between 5.0 and 5.5) is new information that lowers the bottom of the pH interval for these species compared to earlier reports. The maximum total length (TL) of some other species was by 5–20 percentage points higher than those reported earlier. The median weight per unit effort (WPUE) in the streams varied between 30 and 115 g per hour during the dry seasons and between 18 and 86 g per hour during the wet seasons. The fish biomass in the streams varied between 0.05 and 0.7 g ⸱ m –2 with a median 0.14 g ⸱ m –2 . This relatively low value compared to other tropical headwaters may be a result of the low pH and dark color of these headwaters. The results of the study serve as a reference point to which future monitoring of fish fauna can be compared for sustainable management of the LTL.",

The objective of the presently study was to assess age, based on otolith structure, and estimate growth parameters through a multimodel approach. Specimens were collected during research cruises of BIP XI from 2014 to 2019. Pacific hake from the Gulf of California ranged in length from 12.5 to 105 cm TL, reaching a maximum age of 13 years, and females were four years older than males.

    "abstract": "The family Profundulidae is one of the few families of freshwater fishes endemic to the Mesoamerican region, and one of the least speciose within the order Cyprinodontiformes, with only 13 valid species. Sexual dimorphism is poorly developed and sparsely studied in this family. Herein, we report the presence of spicule-like organs of contact in scales and fins (anal and dorsal) in fishes of the family Profundulidae and discuss the use of spicules as a means to facilitate the identiﬁcation of male and female in this family. Data from museum specimens of the 13 species of profundulid fishes were analyzed. We studied the following species: Tlaloc labialis (Günther, 1866); Tlaloc candalarius (Hubbs, 1924); Tlaloc hildebrandi (Miller, 1950); Tlaloc portillorum (Matamoros et Schaefer, 2010); Profundulus punctatus (Günther, 1866); Profundulus guatemalensis (Günther, 1866); Profundulus oaxacae (Meek, 1902); Profundulus balsanus Ahl, 1935; Profundulus kreiseri Matamoros, Schaefer, Hernández et Chakrabarty, 2012; Profundulus parentiae Matamoros, Domínguez-Cisneros, Velázquez-Velázquez et McMahan, 2018; Profundulus mixtlanensis Ornelas-García, Martínez-Ramírez et Doadrio, 2015; Profundulus adani Dominguez-Cisneros, Velázquez-Velázquez, McMahan, et Matamoros, 2021; Profundulus chimalapensis Del Moral-Flores, López-Segovia et Hernández-Arellano, 2020. Scales were observed and photographed with a Hitachi VP-MEB SU1510 scanning electron microscope; the spicules in fins were observed from specimens cleared and double-stained. This study revealed the presence of 1–10 spicules on the surface of the scales in males and its absence in females of all species analyzed. Numerous, small and thin spicules were also observed and they were restricted to the middle rays of the anal and dorsal fins of the males. The observation of spicules in the anal fins for the sexual identification of profundulid fishes constitutes an advantage of operational simplicity, speed, and potential for its application in taxonomic and ecological studies.",

Currently, the fish is only known to occur in Japan, Taiwan, and Samoa Islands. This anthiadine fish varies from other species of genus Plectranthias by having 30–33 lateral-line scales, a single red blotch below the lateral line, and numerous dark green blotches on the upper half of the body. The mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I ( COI ) is also described for the first time for this species in this article. The pairwise genetic distance computation reveals that P. yamakawai has a very low distance from the sequences of the other eight species of Plectranthias that have been submitted to GenBank. This is the sixth species of the genus Plectranthias to be reported from the western coast of Luzon, Philippines.",

Ten specimens of each species were cleared and stained with Alcian blue and Alizarin red. A digital camera was used for taking pictures and CorelDraw X6 software for preparing drawings. The three species have some differences in the caudal fin skeleton, shape of the urostyle, neural spine of preural 2, hypural spines 2, and 3, anterior part of parhypural and hypurapophysis, the size of neural spines of preural 2 and 3, hypural 3 and 4, and epurals. Although there are some differences among the species, osteology of these species is very conservative and other traits like behavioral and molecular should be used.",

    "abstract": "Information about ploidy is important in both commercial and conservation aquaculture and fish research. Unfortunately, methods for its determination, such as karyology, determination of the amount of DNA in a cell using microdensitometry or flow cytometry and/or measuring erythrocytes in a blood smear can be stressful or even destructive. Some of these methods are also limited by the relatively large minimum size of the individual being measured. The aim of this study was to test a new low-stress method of determining ploidy by measuring the size of erythrocytes in the capillaries of a fish, including small individuals. First, we examined diploid and triploid loach ( Cobitis sp.) and gibel carp, Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782), using flow cytometry and blood smears, with these results being used as a control. Subsequently, we measured the size of erythrocytes in the caudal fin capillaries of anesthetized fishes of known ploidy under a light microscope. For both the loaches and gibel carp, direct observation of the mean erythrocyte size in epithelial fin capillaries provided a consistent and reliable determination of ploidy when compared with the controls based on flow cytometry and blood smears. This new method allows for rapid determination of ploidy in living small fish, where collection of tissue using other methods may cause excessive stress or damage. The method outlined here simply requires the measurement of erythrocytes directly in the bloodstream of a live fish, thereby making it possible to determine ploidy without the need for blood sampling. The method described is sufficiently efficient, less demanding on equipment than many other procedures, can be used by relatively inexperienced personnel and has benefits as regards animal welfare, which is especially important for fish production facilities or when dealing with rare or endangered species.",

    "abstract": "Information about ploidy is important in both commercial and conservation aquaculture and fish research. Unfortunately, methods for its determination, such as karyology, determination of the amount of DNA in a cell using microdensitometry or flow cytometry and/or measuring erythrocytes in a blood smear can be stressful or even destructive. Some of these methods are also limited by the relatively large minimum size of the individual being measured. The aim of this study was to test a new low-stress method of determining ploidy by measuring the size of erythrocytes in the capillaries of a fish, including small individuals. First, we examined diploid and triploid loach ( Cobitis sp.) and gibel carp, Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782), using flow cytometry and blood smears, with these results being used as a control. Subsequently, we measured the size of erythrocytes in the caudal fin capillaries of anesthetized fishes of known ploidy under a light microscope. For both the loaches and gibel carp, direct observation of the mean erythrocyte size in epithelial fin capillaries provided a consistent and reliable determination of ploidy when compared with the controls based on flow cytometry and blood smears. This new method allows for rapid determination of ploidy in living small fish, where collection of tissue using other methods may cause excessive stress or damage. The method outlined here simply requires the measurement of erythrocytes directly in the bloodstream of a live fish, thereby making it possible to determine ploidy without the need for blood sampling. The method described is sufficiently efficient, less demanding on equipment than many other procedures, can be used by relatively inexperienced personnel and has benefits as regards animal welfare, which is especially important for fish production facilities or when dealing with rare or endangered species.",

In the stratified sampling, the efficiency of drawing a constant number of fish from the stratum (S_CON) as well as drawing a number of fish proportional to the product of the fish numbers and the standard deviation of age in the stratum (S_PROP*SD) were investigated. The S_PROP*SD sampling method was proven to be the most effective. The proportional sampling was shown to be the best when taking into consideration the sampling efficiency and the practical possibilities of implementation of a given drawing scheme.",

Merogony involving different stages with nuclear chromatin aggregated into 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 and more groups within a cell was followed. During the subsequent differentiation, chromatin shifted to the cell periphery and merozoites (up to 32 and more), attached to the residual body, were formed by separation. The released merozoites were scattered between cells. During gamogony, gamont-resembling forms were formed as a stage terminating development in the fish host.",

The study presents the principles of the Polish fisheries education system educating specialists at the professional level, in technical schools, at maritime colleges and universities, with the specification of fields and specializations of education, as well as titles and qualifications obtained after graduation. The number of foreign specialists educated in various types of schools in Poland is also given, along with examples of positions currently held by some graduates in scientific and economic institutions of their countries and international organizations. Forms of advice and assistance in the organization of fishing education in various countries by Poland are presented. The study also presents a proposal for further training of fishing staff in Poland. Taking into account the conditions of a given country, its needs and the level of education, various forms of training were presented directly in the countries concerned. Regardless of the typical training activities, the achievements and offers of technical services that Poland can perform in the field of training, organization of education, construction of schools and research laboratories and conducting scientific research were also presented.",

The treatments differed in the management measures used: (A) control ponds traditionally filled with water in spring, (B) experimental ponds filled in autumn, with intensive mineral fertilization, (C) experimental ponds filled in autumn, with intensive mineral fertilization and regulatory catches during the growing season made in order to decrease the fish density. Each the three treatments was studied using different stocking rates (1800-3600 ind. ha -1). In all treatments fish were fed with cereal feeds (barley) ad libitum. All ponds in treatments B and C were fertilized in two stages: initially in February-March over the ice, and secondly from April until July. In total 900 kg&#1468;ha-1 NPK of fertilizers were used in each pond: 292 kg&#1468;ha-1 of nitrogen (N),108 kg&#1468;ha-1 of phosphorus (P) and 500 kg&#1468;ha-1 of potassium (K). The highest production and the highest profit were obtained in treatment C. Cost of the stocking material represented the main item of the variable costs (from 60% in ponds with low stocking rates to 80% in ponds with highest stocking rates). Cost of fertilisers which were used in treatments B and C was low and amounted to only 1.5-2%.",

    "abstract": "Eutrophication of natural systems is one of the most relevant problems confronting the human society today. Compared to terrestrial and limnological systems, however. the marine environment is affected to a minor degree only, except for coastal waters. Based on the GDR data covering the period of 1976-1988, trend analyses for chlorophyll, primary production, zooplankton biomass, and water transparency have been carried out for the Mecklenburg Bight and different areas of the Baltic Proper. As expected from the increase in nutrient levels, observed over several years, increasing trends in some pelagic biological variables were noticeable. The trends in chlorophyll content were significant (95% probability level) for all the areas investigated. Primary production, too, showed a tendency to increase, the trend, however, not being significant in each subarea. Almost no changes could be observed in the zooplankton-related variables. The results confirm earlier findings and substantiate an assumption that the process of eutrophication in the Baltic is continuing. All the data sets show a high interannual variability which can be partly explained by meteorological and oceanological conditions and by variability inherent in any ecosystem. Although the nutrient levels in winter have ceased to increase, the nutrient input to the system from land via rivers and from the air has not decreased. This impact continues all year round and is particularly relevant in early summer, a larger input of fresh water in that particularly productive season making it still more important. It seems also very likely that the ammonia input via the atmosphere is still highly underestimated. Some other features of Baltic, apart from the nutrient input, support the notion of the continuing eutrophication, e.g., the summer stable three-layer stratification enhancing stagnation and disturbing the phosphorus-nitrogen relationship. The surplus of phosphates gives rise to summer blooms of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and thus to an additional input of nitrogen to the ecosystem. It seems also very likely that the current stagnation observed in the Baltic for thirteen years, by virtue of decreased salinity and weakened permanent halocline, is enhancing the productivity of the ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Total world marine fish catches within 1960-1980 are analysed, based upon 5-year mean catch. A marked increase in the perciform (Perciformes) and salmonid (Salmoniformes) catches along with increasing yields of molluscs, crustaceans, and algae are observed. At the same time, the catches of clupeids (Clupeiformes), gadoids (Gadiformes), redfish (Scorpaeniformes), and flatfish (Pleuronectiformes) tended to become stabilised, while there was a well-marked decrease in catches of marine mammals, the decrease being particularly pronounced in terms of biomass. After the last 12-year period of stabilised overall marine catch, a gradual slow increase can be predicted. Most probably, as soon as in the nearest future, the role of clupeids in the world fisheries wil1 make way for the perciformes.",
