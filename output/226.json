    "abstract": "Designing a user authentication protocol for wireless sensor networks is a difficult task because wireless networks are susceptible to attacks and sensor node has limited energy, processing and storage resources. Recently, several authentication schemes have been proposed. This short paper shows some security problems and design weaknesses in those schemes. Furthermore, an enhanced two-factor user authentication protocol is presented. The proposed scheme only uses hash function, and a successful user authentication just requires three message exchanges. Security and performance analyses demonstrate that compared to the well-known authentication schemes, our proposal is more secure and efficient.",

However, this technique requires the last hop knowledge: to decide wether or not a flooding packet is retransmitted, a node needs to know from which node the packet was received. When considering broadcasting at IP level, this information may be difficult to obtain. We thus propose a scheme for computing an optimized connected dominating set from multipoint relays. This set allows to efficiently broadcast packets without the last hop information with performances close to multipoint relay flooding.",

Then, we model the forest fire detection problem as a node k-coverage problem (k ≥ 1) in wireless sensor networks. We propose approximation algorithms for the node k-coverage problem which is shown to be NP-hard. We present a constant-factor centralized algorithm, and a fully distributed version which does not require sensors know their locations.

Recently, Burkhart et al. [?] proposed several methods to construct topologies whose maximum link interference is minimized while the topology is connected or is a spanner for Euclidean length. In this paper we give algorithms to construct a network topology for wireless ad hoc network such that the maximum (or average) link (or node) interference of the topology is either minimized or approximately minimized.",

Many of them can only be used in a single room (usually when they use infrared or bluetooth technologies), others do not take care of the walls inside the buildings so they use to have tags, and even, in some of them, there is an access point in each room of the floor to locate the sensor. This paper describes two approaches where wireless sensors could find their position using WLAN technology inside a floor of a building. The scenario is an indoor environment with walls, interferences, multipath effect, humidity, temperature variations, etc., and both approaches are based on the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). The first approach uses a training session and the position is based on a heuristic system using the training measurements. The second approach uses triangulation model with some fixed access points, but taking into account wall losses and signal variations. Finally we will compare real measurements of our proposals with the measurements taken by the Ekahau system.",

In this paper, we analyze probabilistic and deterministic approaches (individually and combined) to estimate trust for VANET security. The probabilistic approach determines the trust level of the peer vehicles based on received information. The trust level is used to determine legitimacy of the message, which is used to decide whether the message would be considered for further transmission over the VANET or dropped. The deterministic approach measures the trust level of the received message by using distances calculated using received signal strength (RSS) and the vehicle’s geolocation (position coordinate). Combination of probabilistic and deterministic approach gives better results compared to individual approaches.

However, the dynamic environment of MANETs makes the design and implementation of IDSs a very challenging task. In this paper, we present a non-overlapping Zone-Based Intrusion Detection System (ZBIDS) that fits the requirement of MANETs. On the local detection part, we present a general intrusion detection agent model and propose a Markov Chain based anomaly detection algorithm. We focus on the protection of MANET routing protocols and present the details regarding feature selection, data collection, data preprocess, Markov Chain construction, classifier construction and parameter tuning. We demonstrate that local detection alone cannot achieve desirable performance. Therefore, we further propose a collaboration mechanism among ZBIDS agents and an aggregation algorithm used by gateway nodes. With alert information from a wider area, gateway nodes’ IDS can effectively suppress many falsified alerts and provide more diagnostic information about the occurring attacks. Security officers can have a general understanding about the attacks using the proposed MANET Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (MIDMEF). We carry out extensive simulation to evaluate the performance of ZBIDS at different mobility levels. SimThis paper is the extension of our conference papers [3,4].",

There is a recent trend to deal with this problem by introducing mobile elements (sensors or sink nodes) in the network. The majority of these approaches assume time-driven scenarios and/or singlehop communication between participating nodes. However, there are several real-life applications for which an event-based and multi-hop operation is more appropriate. In this paper we propose to adaptively move the sink node inside the covered region, according to the evolution of current events, so as to minimize the energy consumption incurred by the multihop transmission of the event-related data. Both analytical and simulation results are given for two optimization strategies: minimizing the overall energy consumption, and minimizing the maximum load on a specific sensor respectively. We show that by adaptively moving the sink, significant power saving can be achieved, prolonging the lifetime of the network.",

    "abstract": "The Opportunistic Large Array (OLA is a simple strategy that provides a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) advantage from the spatial diversity of distributed single-antenna radios. In this paper, we present a collection of broadcasting and upstream routing protocols that have been developed for the OLA physical layer. We consider several benefits of OLA transmissions, namely, energy efficiency, survivability during network partitions, improved latency, and robustness against mobility. The strategies for broadcast are OLA with Transmission Threshold (OLA-T) and Alternating OLA-T (A-OLA-T), and the main upstream routing scheme is the OLA Concentric Routing Algorithm (OLACRA). These schemes exploit the nature of OLA broadcasts and limit the number of nodes participating in each hop to reduce the aggregate transmit energy consumed in the network. To increase the network survivability during partition, we propose a new survivable network protocol that detects a network partition and triggers the creation of a large enough OLA to overcome the partition. All of the OLA-based routing schemes share the properties of no centralized control, no individual node addressing, no inter-node coordination, no reliance on node location knowledge, and no dependence on density, given that the density is at least sufficient to support OLA transmission. These properties imply that the OLA-based protocols are scalable with node density and robust against mobility.",

    "abstract": "One way to prolong the lifetime of a wireless sensor network is to schedule the active times of sensor nodes, so that a node is active only when it is really needed. In the dynamic point coverage problem, which is to detect some moving target points in the area of the sensor network, a node is needed to be active only when a target point is in its sensing region. A node can be aware of such times using a predicting mechanism. In this paper, we propose a solution to the problem of dynamic point coverage using irregular cellular learning automata. In this method, learning automaton residing in each cell in cooperation with the learning automata residing in its neighboring cells predicts the existence of any target point in the vicinity of its corresponding node in the network. This prediction is then used to schedule the active times of that node. In order to show the performance of the proposed method, computer experimentations have been conducted. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods such as LEACH, GAF, PEAS and PW in terms of energy consumption.",

However, this assumption would be easily violated due to the selfish nodes which are unwilling to consume precious wireless resources by serving as bundle relays. To apply conventional reputation based incentive schemes in DTNs is extraordinarily challenging due to the unique network characteristics. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose SUCCESS, a secure user-centric and social-aware reputation based incentive scheme for DTNs. Different from conventional reputation schemes which rely on neighboring nodes to monitor the traffic and keep tracks of each other’s reputation, SUCCESS allows a node to manage its reputation evidence and demonstrate its reputation whenever necessary. Two concepts, self-check and community-check, are defined for reputation evaluation according to the candidate’s forwarding competency and the sufficiency of the evidence shown by the node itself, and for speeding up reputation establishment and forming consensus views towards targets in the same community, respectively.

    "abstract": "The recent IEEE 802.15.4 standard offers a promising platform for wireless sensor networks. Among the main problems in many sensor network applications is the problem of ensuring the desired quality of service, expressed as the mean data rate obtained from a specific spatial area, while simultaneously maximizing the lifetime of the network. In this work we consider the feasibility of duty cycle management as the vehicle to achieve these goals. We consider the IEEE 802.15.4 network in beacon enabled mode, and analyze its performance under two duty cycle management algorithms. Both algorithms are fully distributed, i.e., the nodes autonomously control their sleep period according to local information only. In the first algorithm, the sleep period is a geometrically distributed random variable with a given mean value; in the second, the sleep period is inversely proportional to the most recent duration of the packet service time. We model and evaluate both policies using the theory of discrete time Markov chains and M/G/1/K queues with vacations, where geometrically distributed sleep periods are modeled as server vacations. We found that both policies are capable of achieving almost 100% reliability and less than 1% utilization under a wide range of packet arrival rates and network size.",

Data aggregation scheduling (DAS) aims to find an interference-free scheduling for data aggregation with the minimum latency.

In this paper, we investigate the DAS problem in uncoordinated duty-cycledWSNs (DAS-UDC problem) under protocol interference model and prove its NP-hardness. To solve this problem, we propose two novel approximation algorithms called SDAS and CDAS with the data aggregation latency of at most O(Rs + ∆) and O(R + ∆) respectively, where Rs, ∆ and R are the maximum depth of the breadthfirst-search tree rooted at the sink node s, the maximum node degree and the graph-theoretic radius of the network respectively.

To achieve a balanced performance, a WSAN architecture must implement an efficient cooperative communication strategy to allow the nodes to collaborate in the optimal assignment of resources and to execute tasks with the lowest possible delay. Such collaboration must take place by exchanging information and generating negotiated decisions while trying to extend the WSAN lifetime. The main contribution of this work is the proposal of a coordination mechanism taxonomy for WSANs; this taxonomy provides a framework for the classification of coordination mechanisms designed for WSAN environments.

    "abstract": "Rendezvous in cognitive radio networks is the process that cognitive users meet and establish a communication link on a commonly available channel, so that consequent information exchange and data communications can be accomplished on the channel. In this study, we propose two ring-walk (RW) rendezvous algorithms to solve the problem of blind rendezvous, i.e., rendezvous without the help of any central controller and dedicated common control channel. Our basic idea is to represent each channel as a vertex in a ring. Cognitive users “walk” on the ring by visiting vertices of channels with different velocities. Rendezvous is achievable since the user with lower velocity will be eventually “caught” by the user with higher velocity. Compared with the existing solutions, our algorithms provide guaranteed rendezvous without the need of time-synchronization and are applicable to rendezvous of the multi-user and multi-hop scenario. We derive upper bounds on the time-to-rendezvous (TTR) and the expected TTR of our algorithms in both 2-user and multi-user scenarios. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of our algorithms.",

Recently several proper schemes have been proposed in an OPPNET. Among them, floodingbased schemes result in very high network traffic and low transmission delay. On the other hand, wait-based schemes have long transmission delay instead of low network traffic. We propose a message forwarding scheme, called Hotspot-based Forwarding Scheme (HFS), to balance the level of network traffic and transmission delay using a floodings scheme only in a hotpot with the home-cell community-based mobility model (HCMM). Experiments have been performed on the network simulator NS-2. The results show that the proposed scheme balances network traffic and transmission delay in comparison to flooding-based schemes such as Epidemic, PRoPHET, SimBet and the a wait-based scheme such as Wait.",

Instead, a large portion of protocol development is done in (often unrealistic) simulation settings only. In this paper we discuss lessons learned from our experimental work. Specifically, we present results for a fully functioning prototype implementing a p2p middleware (FreePastry) on top of a multihop ad hoc network based on 802.11b technology. Recently, for this technology, [GLNT04] pointed out the existence of an ad hoc horizon (2-3 hops and 10-20 nodes) after which the benefit of multi-hop ad hoc networking vanishes. All the experiments we performed fall inside this ad hoc horizon. The aim is to identify solutions for this realistic setting and to quantify the Quality of Service (QoS) the system is able to provide to the users. Our measurements pointed out that also in this limited setting, several problems still exist to construct efficient multi-hop ad hoc networks. Cross-layering seems to be an effective approach to fix some of the problems identified in our analysis.",

Another area that can also significantly benefit from advanced features of this technology is health-care monitoring. In contrast to the conventional, face-to-face oriented health-care systems organized around health-care centers, the new health-care paradigm presented in this paper relies on personal mobile health-care solutions that utilize ad-hoc networking principles and wireless communication technologies to provide continuous and unobtrusive health monitoring regardless of patient’s or caregiver’s location and activity. Health-care sensors worn by patients are controlled by user’s communication device (for example mobile phone) that automatically recognizes the sensors’ functions and establishes required communication links. In this paper, architecture of such systems is proposed and discussed. A flexible XML based communication protocol that supports various types of sensors is also presented. The concept of distributed, peer-to-peer, health care systems is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "Routing protocols are an essential part of the efficient design of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Existing routing protocols such as DSR, AODV, and TORA are based on a best effort strategy [21,22]. However, in order for MANETs to be practical for more demanding real time applications such as multimedia, providing a certain needed level of quality of service becomes an essential component in the communication protocol design [2, 11–14, 24, 25]. QoS routing protocols provide the capability of finding a path between two nodes which satisfies the application layer’s minimum bandwidth requirements. Previous papers addressed this issue for different communication environments such as TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) [7,8,15,16] and CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)-over-TDMA [3,17,18]. While most of these models are generally more practical and less expensive, they impose on the designer the constraint of the hidden terminal and exposed terminal problems. The paper by Liao and Tseng [15] addressed these issues and provided a TDMA-based bandwidth reservation protocol for QoS routing in MANETs. However, this protocol does not account for the race condition which can become more significant with increased node mobility, network density and higher traffic loads. This race condition is also a limitation of other QoS routing protocols [7, 8]. This paper addresses this issue and provides a protocol which enables the network to cope with this and other related problems such as parallel reservation. We also provide increased optimizations which significantly enhance the throughput and efficiency of the QoS routing protocol.",

    "abstract": "One of the critical issues in wireless sensor network is the lifetime of the network. Since each sensor is equipped with a limited amount of battery capacity, efficient management of the battery powers is important to prolong the lifetime of the network. One possible network management scheme is to partition the sensors into disjoint sets, so that sensors in each of the disjoint sets can completely cover the targets. Then these sets are activated successively. As a result, the larger the number of disjoint sets, the longer the lifetime of the network. In this paper, we propose a new BIP formulation and a new heuristic algorithm to find such disjoint sets. Compared with the previous researches, our formulation may be used to find an optimal solution much faster than the previous formulation and our heuristic is capable of finding good quality solutions quite fast.",

    "abstract": "We present a distributed topology control protocol that runs on a d-QUDG for d ≥ 1/√2, and computes a sparse, constant-spanner, both in Euclidean distance and in hop distance. QUDGs (short for Quasi Unit Disk Graphs) generalize Unit Disk Graphs and permit more realistic modeling of wireless networks, allowing for imperfect and non-uniform transmission ranges as well as uncertain node location information. Our protocol is local and runs in O(1) rounds. The output topology permits memoryless (geographic) routing with guaranteed delivery. In fact, when our topology control protocol is used as preprocessing step for the geographic routing protocol GOAFR+ we get the routing time guarantee of O(l2) for any source-destination pair that are lunits away from each other in the input d-QUDG. The key idea is simple: to obtain planarity, we replace each edge intersection with a virtual node and have a real node serve as a proxy for the virtual node. This idea is supported by other parts of our protocol that (i) use clustering to keep the density of edge crossings bounded and (ii) guarantee that an edge between a virtual node and a neighbor is realized by a constant-hop path in the real network. The virtual node idea is simple enough to be useful in many contexts. For example, it can be combined with a scheme recently suggested by Funke and Milosavljevic (INFOCOM 2007) to guarantee delivery under uncertain node locations. Similarly, the virtual nodes idea can also be used as a cheap alternative to edge-crossing removal schemes suggested by Kim et al. (DIALM-POMC 2005, SENSYS 2006).",

    "abstract": "The rapid adoption of cloud storage services has created an issue that many duplicated copies of files are stored in the remote storage servers, which not only wastes the communication bandwidth for duplicated file uploading, but also increases the cost of security data management. To solve this problem, client-side deduplication was introduced to avoid the client from uploading files already existed in the remote servers. However, the existing scheme was recently found to be vulnerable to security attacks in that by learning a small piece of information related to the file, such as the hash value of the file, the attacker may be able to get full access of the entire file; and the confidentiality of the date may be vulnerable to “honest-but-curious” attacks. In this paper, to solve the problems mentioned above, we propose a cryptographically secure and efficient scheme to support cross-user client side deduplication over encrypted file. Our scheme utilizes the technique of spot checking in which the client only need to access small portions of the original file, dynamic coefficients, randomly chosen indices of the original files and a subtle approach to distribute the file encrypting key among clients to satisfy security requirements. Our extensive security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can generate provable ownership of the encrypted file (POEF) with the presence of the curious server, and maintain a high detection probability of the client misbehavior. Both performance analysis and simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme is much more efficient than the existing schemes, especially in reducing the burden of the client.",

    "abstract": "Networks with frequent and long duration partitions prevent common Internet protocols from working successfully. For protocols to work properly in these Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs), a new protocol layer was proposed that acts on top of the transport layer for the end-to-end exchange of messages (called bundles) taking advantage of scheduled, predicted, opportunistic or permanent connectivity. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a multicast extension to the DTN’s unicast PROPHET protocol. A multicast protocol is useful to reduce the number of copies of packets when they are sent to multiple destinations. PROPHET routes packets based on estimates of the probability of nodes meeting. We show by simulation that by using just one byte for transferring mobility information between nodes, a good clue is given about the region where mobile nodes are, which can be used by the multicast protocol to decide where to forward messages. Additionally, we show that if the number of contacts between nodes is above a minimum threshold, a pseudo multicast tree will exist, multicast works efficiently and message replications are minimized.",

The proposed protocol is simple to implement and it achieves a given target communication quality between nodes, which is quantified by the minimum packet delivery rate between any pair of nodes in the network. We demonstrate the robustness of the proposed protocol against random node failures, inaccuracy of node locations, and imperfect time synchronization of nodes using extensive simulations. We extend our connectivity protocol to provide probabilistic coverage as well, where the sensing ranges of sensors follow probabilistic models. Because it employs both probabilistic communication and sensing models, the proposed protocol is more suitable for real sensor network environments than other protocols in the literature that assume a simple disk model for communication and sensing. We compare our protocol against others in the literature and show that it activates fewer number of nodes, consumes much less energy, and significantly prolongs the network lifetime.",

By simulating various CDMA based ad-hoc networks, we examine various scenarios to compare the performances of the proposed algorithms with the reference algorithm. We draw various conclusions for different network scenarios. For example, the results show that the SpecPure algorithm performs well for “symmetric” base locations scenarios, while the N-GAIR performs best for random base locations scenarios. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, which can be adopted by any cellular, cognitive, ad-hoc or mesh type radio networks.",

In carrier-based sensor relocation, mobile robots (with limited capacity to carry sensors) pick up additional or redundant sensors and relocate them at sensing holes. In the only known localized algorithm, robots randomly traverse field and act based on identified pair of spare sensor and coverage hole. We propose a Market-based Sensor Relocation (MSR) algorithm, which optimizes sensor deployment location, and introduces bidding and coordinating among neighboring robots. Sensors along the boundary of each hole elect one of them as the representative, which bids to neighboring robots for hole filling service. Each robot randomly explores by applying Least Recently Visited policy. It chooses the best bid according to Cost over Progress ratio and fetches a spare sensor nearby to cover the corresponding sensing hole. Robots within communication range share their tasks to search for better possible solutions. Simulation shows that MSR outperforms the existing competing algorithm G-R3S2 significantly on total robot traversed path and energy, and time to cover holes, slightly on number of sensors needed to cover the hole and number of sensor messages for bidding and deployment location sharing.",

To alleviate this undesired effect, we investigate the effect of multiple battery levels to maximize the useful lifetime of the network. We demonstrate a powerful, yet attractively simple scheme to redistribute the total energy budget in multiple (but few) battery levels.

This paper first describes a general health care platform and pinpoints the security challenges and requirements. Further it proposes and analyzes the CICADA-S protocol, a secure cross-layer protocol for WBANs. It is an extension of CICADA, which is a cross-layer protocol that handles both medium access and the routing of data in WBANs. The CICADA-S protocol is the first integrated solution that copes with threats that occur in this mobile medical monitoring scenario. It is shown that the integration of key management and secure, privacy preserving Communication techniques within the CICADA-S protocol has low impact on the power consumption and throughput.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with sensor deployment problem for distributed estimation of unknown signals in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (HWSNs). We consider a network including two types of sensors with different computational processing abilities: type-I sensors with more powerful ability than type-II sensors. Based on this computational heterogeneity, we present an estimator model for distributed sensor fusion in HWSNs and propose a sensor deployment scheme supporting the proposed distributed estimation. It is discovered that the network topology is closely related to the properties of the estimation algorithm. To satisfy the performance of the estimation algorithm, two sensor deployment algorithms are given. The first is concerned with the connectivity of network topology and the second illustrates a greedy approach to further optimize the network topology and the parameters of the estimators. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed estimators and sensor deployment algorithms for distributed estimation in HWSNs.",

    "abstract": "Every time an exceptional situation takes place on the road, dangerous situations occur and they need the drivers' skills in order to cope with them. These special situations can occur due to many reasons such as a non-expected object on the road, or an incoming emergency vehicle. Current proposals consider that vehicles are equipped with sensors and communication devices that collect and communicate sensor data to a central point to take further decisions. In this paper, those exceptional situations are handled in a different way: we propose to integrate an ontology inside each vehicle to provide them with distributed reasoning capabilities. Our system benefits traffic management in emergency situations with immediate and coherent suggestions to drivers where each vehicle is a decision point, reacts considering its neighboring vehicles, and collaborates with them to reach consensus in real time. A complete analysis of the system is given, from the behavior of the wireless link channel to the application level, giving an integral description of the designed solution. The system operates continuously adapting itself to driver reactions. A common ontology provides, during the reasoning process, a suggestion to each driver, maintaining the coherence of the whole set of suggestions (avoiding conflicting situations). Language: en",

    "abstract": "Popular ad hoc routing protocols such as DSDV and AODV use “predecessor” based forwarding, namely, the packet is forwarded to the “predecessor” that advertised the shortest path to destination during the last update. However, if the “predecessor” moves, the routing table entry becomes invalid and “predecessor” based forwarding fails! To overcome the stale forward table problem, in this paper we propose a novel packet forwarding scheme called “direction” forwarding (DFR). When an update is received, a node records the “geographical direction” to where the update came from. When “predecessor” forwarding fails, the packet is forwarded to the “most promising” neighbor in the recorded direction. If the network is sufficiently dense and the routing algorithm includes periodic refresh from destination, direction forwarding will recover from most “predecessor” failures due to motion. We evaluate DFR in a LANMAR routing scenario where the direction to each Landmark is periodically refreshed. Through simulation we show that DFR considerably enhances LANMAR performance in large, mobile network scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Presence of redundant nodes is common in wireless sensor networks because of various reasons such as high probability of failures and necessity of long lifetime. When such redundancy exists, some distributed algorithms are needed for selecting minimal subset of nodes as active nodes in a manner that network area is covered entirely with the selected active nodes. In this paper, a distributed algorithm is proposed which attempts to minimize the number of active nodes in the network using cellular learning automata in such a way that the following two conditions are met: 1. network area is covered entirely, and 2. network of selected active nodes is connected. In the proposed algorithm, each node is equipped with a learning automaton which locally decides for the node to be active or not based on the remaining energy of the node and its neighbors’ situations. To ensure the network connectivity, we analytically determine the radio transmission range of sensor nodes according to their sensing range so that complete coverage of the network area guarantees the connectivity of active nodes. The time and space costs of the proposed algorithm are analytically determined and compared with those of similar existing algorithms such as PEAS and PECAS. Simulation results in J-Sim simulator environment specify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm over existing algorithms such as PEAS and PECAS—especially against high ratio of unexpected failures and nodes’ energy depletion.",

Most head selection mechanisms proposed in literature cannot balance energy and security very well to our knowledge, and a novel framework for trust-based cluster head selection is introduced in this paper to deal with this problem. Both credibility and energy of node are considered in selection process in the framework proposed here. First trust values of each node are calculated based on the interaction history, then the evaluate cloud is defined and generated based on the trust values and residual energy using cloud theory. Finally, cluster head are generated by comparing the evaluate cloud of each node in the cluster. A preliminary simulation has been performed and results show that the framework can both reduce the likelihood of un-trust nodes being selected as cluster head and improve energy efficiency.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, research on Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) has become one of the main topics in electronic and computer fields. Since, the WSNs include many low cost and low power sensor nodes and battery replacement in harsh environments is usually impossible, an energy-efficient paradigm for all layers of protocol stack specially routing schemes is necessary to prolong the sensors' lifetime. In this paper, we first specify the sources of energy consumption in a typical sensor node, and then we classify the energy-efficient routings into three main categories such as flat, hierarchical, and geographic mechanisms based on underlying network structure. However, protocols employing simultaneous schemes such as bio-inspired methods, quality of service, multi-path and querybased manners are also discussed. In this taxonomy, special attention has been devoted to the energy-aware QoS-based and bio-inspired routing algorithms which have not yet obtained much consideration in the literature. Moreover, each class covers a variety of the state-of-the-art routing and cross-layer protocols, which motivate potential ideas for future works. Finally, we compare these mechanisms and discuss open research issues.",

Effective coordination of these bridge nodes is crucial for the smooth operation of a scatternet. In this paper, a distributed, two-phase RP scheduling algorithm called Dichotomized Rendezvous Point algorithm (DRP) is presented to address this problem. DRP makes the assumption that a mesh scatternet is mainly S/S bridge based (with small amount of M/S bridges to connect masters at three hops). The scatternet configuration is further simplified to allow a bridge to be shared by only two piconets, which leads to an easily scalable solution for very large scatternets since the scatternetwide coordination problem can be avoided. A suboptimal RP schedule is generated at the scatternet formation time, while it is adjusted to improve the capacity of bridge nodes later on as per flow basis. The algorithm is implemented on our newly developed Bluetooth simulator under the ns-2 framework. The performance is obtained for various traffic conditions.",

We show that the effects of successive simplifications to the node mobility and radio propagation models are not consistent across protocols. Moreover, even within the same protocol, the effects on performance can vary erratically as simulation parameters change. Our results raise troubling questions about the soundness of evaluations of MANET routing protocols based on simple radio propagation and node mobility",

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of a large number of nodes with limited sensing, computation and communication capabilities. In such a network the data transmission is an energy-consuming operation. Hence to increase the lifetime of the network it is essential to reduce the number of bits transmitted. One widely used method for reducing the data transmission is data aggregation. The security issues such as data integrity, confidentiality and freshness in data aggregation become crucial when the WSN is deployed in a remote or hostile environment. Secure data aggregation schemes are suitable to achieve security in data aggregation. In this paper we propose two protocols called SEEDA-SUM/AVG and SEEDA-MIN/MAX for secure data aggregation that provide end-to-end data privacy. The protocol SEEDA-SUM/AVG is used to compute the SUM and AVERAGE aggregates. Using this protocol the average number of bits transmitted per node is reduced by 30%-70% compared to the scheme proposed by Castelluccia et al. The SEEDA-MIN/MAX protocol computes MINIMUM and MAXIMUM aggregates by comparing the encrypted data. The protocol uses simple comparison operations in contrast to multiple encryptions in the scheme proposed by Ertaul et al.",

    "abstract": "TCP throughput instability is a well-known phenomenon in IEEE 802.11 multi-hop ad-hoc networks. However, we find that this is not restricted to TCP traffic only, but also occurs in UDP traffic. The associated throughput oscillations are not acceptable for real-time applications such as video conferencing and voice-over-IP. The paper re-defines this throughput fluctuation as a instability problem since it is caused by the triggering of the re-routing function. In particular, we show that the throughput instability is mainly induced by re-routing, not the binary exponential back-off of the IEEE 802.11 MAC protocol. Turning off the re-routing function, for example, eliminates the problem. We believe that this is the first paper to study this phenomenon in the context of re-routing instability. We propose to modify the ad-hoc routing protocols with a don't-break-before-you-can-make strategy. The scheme does not require modifications of the IEEE 802.11 standard, making it readily deployable using existing commercial wireless LAN (WLAN) products. Simulations show that the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the throughput variation in a traffic flow by 50-70% and improve the average throughput by up to 11%.",

Existing position-based routing protocols have deficiencies in such scenarios as they always forward packets directly towards the destination. Greedy routing frequently fails and costly recovery mechanisms have to be applied. We propose the Ants-based Mobile Routing Architecture (AMRA) for optimized routing, which combines position-based routing, topology abstraction, and swarm intelligence. AMRA routes packets along paths with high connectivity and short delays by memorizing past traffic and by using ant-like packets to discover shorter paths. The geographic topology abstraction allows AMRA to cope with high mobility and large networks. Simulative evaluation indicate that compared to other position-based routing AMRA finds significantly shorter paths with only marginal overhead protocols.",

    "abstract": "Data collection is a fundamental and important issue in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Recent research has shown that using mobile nodes to collect and carry data in WSNs has many advantages over static multi-hop routing. In this paper, we focus on the problem of data collection in WSNs with the minimum mobile nodes. A mobile node can pick up the data cached in a sensor node via one-hop wireless communications when it passes by a point that R meters away from this stationary sensor node. Since the storage capability of sensor node is limited, each mobile node must visit the sensor nodes, that assigned to it, every t seconds to avoid the overflow of sensor data. In order to reduce the cost of mobile nodes, we try to minimize the number of mobile nodes. We formally prove that the problem of minimizing the number of mobile nodes required by periodical data collection in WSNs is NP hard. We propose a path planning algorithm to minimize the number of mobile nodes. Our simulation results show that our approach can notably reduce the number of required mobile nodes as much as 55.6%.",

    "abstract": "The quest for the autonomic management of communication systems dates back to more than two decades ago. In practice, it be- came a compelling need when such systems started growing in size and complexity. The risk, in fact, was that the support/management of the infrastructure became so expensive to be the major design constraint. In telecommunication networks, in particular, autonomicity is perceived practically as an alias of Autonomic Network Management (ANM) (1): proper handling of network complexity, in fact, is perceived as a corner- stone for achieving robustness and performance. But, despite the expec- tations, while ANM is emerging as one of the hottest research topics, little concrete results have been achieved so far. This can be ascribed, on one hand, to the complexity of the issue itself, whose theoretical foun- dations have not been completed so far, and on the other one to the lack of a research platform on which novel solutions can be tested in a controlled and replicable fashion. In such a scenario, due to their re- configurability and ease of deployment, wireless mesh networks provide us the opportunity to design from scratch an autonomic control plane on top of a network of practical interest. In this paper we propose a novel Knowledge Plane, tailored specifically for the WMNs scenario and capable of enabling consistent sharing of services ontology among the entities participating the WMNs. As a case study, we present JANUS, a novel and freely available monitoring framework exploiting the proposed Knowledge Plane.",

The first step to retrieve data from a sensor network in this way is the dissemination of the query. Energy-efficient query dissemination plays an important role for the lifetime of sensor networks. The topic of this paper is the optimization of probabilistic query dissemination: Based on easy-to-acquire topology information, the optimizer can predict the number of nodes reached and the energy consumption. Furthermore, we propose a topology-discovery protocol that collects the structural information required by the optimizer. Our analysis shows that the energy savings exceed the energy spent to obtain the required information after a small number of queries disseminated in realistic settings. Our evaluation explores the tradeoff between reachability and energy consumption using both simulations and a deployment of Sun SPOT sensor nodes.",

In the graph model we assume that each node knows its geographic coordinates in the plane (location aware nodes). Our algorithms are local in the sense that the status of each node v(whether or not vis in the computed set) depends only on the vertices which are a constant number of hops away from v. This constant is independent of the size of the network. We give upper bounds for the constant depending on the desired approximation ratio. We show that the processing time which is necessary in order to compute the status of a single vertex is bounded by a polynomial in the number of vertices which are at most a constant number of vertices away from it. Our algorithms give the best possible approximation ratios for this setting.\r\n\r\nThe technique which we use to obtain the algorithm for vertex cover can also be employed for constructing the first global PTAS for this problem in unit disk graph which does not need the embedding of the graph as part of the input.",

Most existing mobility models have not been developed with consideration of the obstacles that exist in a disaster environment. This paper proposes two methods of mobility that realistically represent movement in an environment with obstacles. Unmarked Point Model (UPM) uses a high granularity strategy and Adjacency Vertex Model (AVM) uses a method that selects the shortest pathway. UPM consumes more resources than AVM to generate node mobility patterns in an ad hoc network, on a real map area of an urban area, where obstacles have been placed to simulate an emergency and rescue scenario. In addition, a comparative analysis of both models in its routing performance is done using AODV [18].",

    "abstract": "Mobile ad hoc networks have received increasing attention as mobile technology advances and more applications are developed. Mobile peerto-peer (P2P) systems are becoming useful in mobile network applications where installation of infrastructure may be difficult or even infeasible. To realize a mobile P2P system, the double-layered mobile P2P systems that consider both the mobility and energy status of users were introduced. Although the double-layered systems significantly reduce the network traffic, they cannot adequately handle ever changing mobile environments, since they use a fixed mobility-to-energy ratio for hybridization in periodic reconfigurations of the network. Moreover, to determine the optimal fixed ratio, every possible ratio of the two factors should be examined before the system is implemented. In this paper, we propose a more practical mobile P2P system that utilizes a fuzzy method with both mobility and energy as the fuzzy inputs. During each reconfiguration of the network, the proposed system selects super peers adaptively using the fuzzy method to more effectively reflect the current environment. The performance of the proposed system was compared with those of the previous works on the Network Simulator NS-3. Our proposed fuzzy-based system achieves almost the same performance as the fixed ratio system that delivers the optimal performance. A large number of experiments are required to determine the optimal fixed ratio for every single environment.",

    "abstract": "Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are self-configuring networks of nodes connected via wireless without the use of any existing network infrastructure. In MANETs, each node acts both as a host and as a router, thus it must be capable of forwarding data packets to other nodes. Due to the mobility of nodes, topologies of these networks change frequently. In order to solve these problems, a functional and efficient unicast routing protocol is needed. Many different unicast routing protocols have been developed for MANETs. They can be classified into three main categories: proactive, reactive and hybrid. By studying advantages and disadvantages of each one, a new routing protocol is proposed. The new scheme called OLSRBF is proactive routing protocol mostly based on the existing OLSR routing protocol. Modification introduced to the new routing protocol is based primarily on the use of Bellman-Ford algorithm for determining the shortest distance between nodes within a MANET network. In order to validate the design and performance of the new routing protocol it is qualitatively compared with existing AODV, DSDV and OLSR routing protocols. The final evaluation is presented at the end of this paper.",

However, feedback incurs some overhead, especially in lossy network environments. Many previous works on reliable communication neglect the cost of the feedback messages. In this paper, we study the problem of minimum-cost reliable transmission over error-prone wireless networks by considering the cost of feedback. We address two cases: the case where we have a finite number of packets to send and the case where we have infinite packets. In both cases, we provide a solution to the problem with one-hop broadcast transmission. After that, we study the case where network coding is used in our proposed methods. In addition to that, we extend our approaches to address the problem of minimum-cost reliable broadcasting in multi-hop wireless networks. Our simulation results show that the cost of our proposed method is about 40% less than that of the traditional Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) method. Also, the cost of our proposed method with network coding is about 40% less than that of the traditional ARQ",

    "abstract": "Networks of sensors and actors can be used in a variety of applications, including the detection of chemical activity or controlling pests in farms. In these applications, nodes (sensors and actors) are typically deployed in large numbers. Thus, not all of them need to operate at their maximum operational (sensing/acting) ranges, especially when the underlying operation is expensive. In this work, we study how to minimize the operational range in a distributed fashion. Unlike previous work, we consider environments in which location estimation is not possible (e.g., dense forests). We develop a distributed protocol for assigning the operational ranges of nodes (ORAP). ORAP assigns longer ranges to nodes that are less resource constrained (e.g., in terms of energy) than their peers in order to prolong the operational lifetime of every individual node. If the nodes are not aware of their locations, ORAP employs a novel localized algorithm (VICON) for determining the virtual coordinates of the neighbors of each node. VICON relies on conservative estimates of neighbor distances and advertised 1-hop neighborhood information. We show that ORAP introduces negligible overhead and meets its intended goals. Extensive simulations indicate that ORAP balances resource consumption among nodes, resulting in a significant network lifetime improvement even under inaccurate distance estimation.",

    "abstract": "In delay tolerant networks (DTNs), broadcasting is an important routing function that supports the distribution of data to all users in the network. Efficient broadcasting in DTNs is a challenging problem due to the lack of continuous network connectivity. In this paper, we consider the limited bandwidth scenario for DTN broadcasting. Our scheme aims to provide a ticket-based multiple packet broadcasting protocol for a DTN that follows the human mobility patterns – Levy walks and communitybased mobility. Our proposed protocol has two steps: packet selection and relay node selection. Packet selection takes place when two nodes come into contact with each other. It is based on a packet priority ranking scheme, which considers the number of tickets associated with each packet. Relay node selection will consider two parameters: global active level and local active level. Global active level is used for determining when the ticket partition is needed, and local active level is used to decide how the tickets should be partitioned. Each local active level corresponds to the activity level in a grid of 2-D broadcast space. Compared with epidemic, time-based, and hop-count-based schemes, our ticket-based packet priority ranking scheme, which considers the mobility patterns and the node active levels, has the best performance in our simulation. The simulation results show the good performance of our proposed scheme in DTN broadcasting, both in synthetic and real mobility traces.",

Based on the rapid development of wireless and mobile technologies, researchers have proposed several group key protocols for mobile environments. In these protocols, the computational cost of each mobile device is fixed, but each mobile user must hold the public keys of all other users. This study proposes an identity-based authenticated group key agreement protocol for mobile environments based on bilinear pairings. In the proposed scheme, the public key of the user can be easily derived from the user's identity. Therefore, each user is not required to hold the public keys of the other entities. In this approach, the computational cost of each mobile user is independent of the number of mobile users; that is, the computational cost of each mobile user is fixed. The proposed protocol meets the usual security requirements and resists well-known attacks.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the fundamental end-to-end delay performance in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) is of great importance for supporting Quality of Service (QoS) guaranteed applications in such networks. While upper bounds and approximations for end-to-end delay in MANETs have been developed in literature, which usually introduce significant errors in delay analysis, the modeling of exact end-to-end delay in MANETs remains a technical challenge. This is partially due to the highly dynamical behaviors of MANETs, but also due to the lack of an efficient theoretical framework to capture such dynamics. This paper demonstrates the potential application of the powerful Quasi-Birth-and-Death (QBD) theory in tackling the challenging issue of exact end-to-end delay modeling in MANETs. We first apply the QBD theory to develop an efficient theoretical framework for capturing the complex dynamics in MANETs. We then show that with the help of this framework, closed form models can be derived for the analysis of exact end-to-end delay and also per node throughput capacity in MANETs. Simulation and numerical results are further provided to illustrate the efficiency of these QBD theory-based models as well as our theoretical findings.",

We argue in this paper that this diversity is inherent to the MANET domain and therefore it will be important in future environments to simultaneously support multiple MANET protocols. On this basis, we propose a highly configurable component framework that facilitates the support of multiple MANET protocols and accommodates pluggable protocol functionality. Importantly, the framework also allows protocols to be composed, decomposed and hybridised in a variety of ways to create value-added functionality. In addition, it has coherent support for dynamic reconfiguration which opens the possibility for protocol hybridisation strategies to be safely executed at run-time. The paper outlines the functionality of the framework, illustrates its configurability, and offers a preliminary performance evaluation that demonstrates acceptable overhead.",

    "abstract": "The steady increase in user demand for “all the time, everywhere access” asks for effective and portable solutions for mobility management. Traditionally, global mobility has been addressed by solutions at the network layer. This is the case of Mobile IP and related approaches. On the other hand, this class of solutions presents several drawbacks, such as high overhead, poor scalability, inefficiencies at the transport layer, and inability to take into account user preferences and QoS specifications. These drawbacks seriously affect the ability of the systems to provide seamless handovers, that is, transparent management of mobility and continuity of service when changing network connection point. Moreover, most of the proposed solutions cannot deal with vertical handovers, which involve access points equipped with different radio technology (e.g., WLAN and GPRS). In this paper we propose WiOptiMo, an application layer solution for mobility management and seamless handover in heterogeneous multi-technology networks. Working at the application layer, and making use of active and passive cross-layer monitoring, WiOptiMo can overcome most of the drawbacks of previous solutions. It is an integrated approach that can deal effectively with both macroand micro-mobility. Its design has been driven by the objective of realizing a system which is fully portable, energy and cpu aware, and fully compliant to current standards. The inclusion of autonomic components in WiOptiMo’s design empowers the system with basic self-tuning and self-configuring capabilities. We present a detailed description of the system and discuss its pro and cons. Results from real-world experiments are reported to assess the efficiency and the efficacy of the approach.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the ideal shapes of control frames (i.e., RTS/CTS frames) in the IEEE 802.11 MAC layer for efficient power control and directional beam forming in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). Control frames are used to coordinate concurrent transmissions for collision avoidance. Most existing schemes are either overly conservative (i.e., using omnidirectional control frames without power control) or overly aggressive (i.e., using directional control frames with the minimal power). The former has low spatial reuse and the latter increases collisions. We propose twocontrolframeshaping schemes that encourage spatial reuse while avoiding the collisions. The first scheme, called adaptive power control, uses a single RTS/CTS exchange to solve the hidden terminal problem caused by heterogeneous transmission powers. The second scheme, called control frame relay, uses multiple RTS/CTS frames to avoid both the hidden terminal and deafness problems. In designing these schemes, we assume an existing topology control protocol. By exploiting the benefits of regulated traffic and neighbor awareness that accompany a topology control process, the shapes of control frames can be reduced significantly. Extensive simulations were conducted and simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms several existing protocols in terms of spatial reuse and collision avoidance.",

    "abstract": "We study the algorithmic problem of coordinating transmissions in a wireless network where radio interference constrains concurrent transmissions on wireless links. We focus on pairwise conflicts between the links; these can be described as a conflict graph. Associated with the conflict graph are two fundamental network coordination tasks: (a) finding a nonconflicting set of links with the maximum total weight, and (b) finding a link schedule with the minimum total length. Our work shows that two assumptions on the geometric structure of conflict graphs suffice to achieve polynomial-time constant-factor approximations: (i) bounded density of devices, and (ii) bounded range of interference. We also show that these assumptions are not sufficient to obtain a polynomial-time approximation scheme for either coordination task.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks are made up of hundreds of devices deployed over a distant or sensitive field to be monitored. Energy consumption is balanced by taking advantage of the redundancy induced by the random deployment of nodes. Some nodes are active while others are in sleep mode, thus using less energy. Such a dynamic topology should not impact the monitoring activity. Area coverage protocols aim at turning off redundant sensor nodes while ensuring full coverage of the area by the remaining active nodes. Providing k-area coverage therefore means that every physical point of the monitored field is sensed by at least fc sensor devices. Connectivity of the active nodes subset must also be provided so that monitoring reports can reach the sink stations. Existing solutions hardly address these two issues as a unified one. In this paper, we propose a localized algorithm for multiple sensor area coverage able to build connected active nodes sets. We also show that a simple feature of the protocol, called the coverage evaluation scheme, can be enhanced to handle various k-area coverage problem definitions. Experimental results show that our coverage scheme is resistant to collisions of messages as k-area-coverage of the deployment area and connectivity of the active nodes set can still be ensured.",

In TCP case, traffic traces were recorded in two points of the core network as well (Gn interface and the firewall), and the overall delay is dissected to portions belonging to different parts of the network (access, core, backbone). The diversity of the traffic patterns used made it possible to draw conclusions concerning selectivity of certain parts of the network towards different traffic patterns, indicating the direction of future research on reducing latency for subject emerging application domains in legacy networks.",

    "abstract": "Mobile phones are increasingly being equipped with hardware and software services that allow them to determine their locations; however, support for building location-based applications remains a challenging problem. The most widely used localization technology in smart phones is GPS, but it rarely works indoors and provides low energy efficiency. Cell tower-based localization is widely available, but can provide very poor accuracy without a fingerprint profile. WiFi localization, when available, provides reasonable accuracy, but is also much less effective in other areas. Constandache et al. proposed an Escort system to assist in localizing and tracking others in a public place without requiring either GPS, WiFi, war-driving, maps, or floor plans. However, the Escort system may route one person on a long path even though the person being tracked may be close by. In this paper, we will investigate the problem of linding better tracking paths in the Escort system. We propose a GFG routing assisted human tracking algorithm to reduce the length of the tracking path for every pair of users using smart phones in mobile social networks. Through adding one seeker in the Escort system. whose main function is to find better paths between any pair of two intersections by applying the GFG routing algorithm, the localization and tracking algorithm in the Escort system is more effective than the original algorithm. Finally, we conduct simulations of our proposed algorithm at the main campus of Temple University with different numbers of mobile users and different duration times. The simulation results show that the human tracking performance has been greatly enhanced.",

For each link, we name the number of its reserved time slots in each MAC superframe as the replicator factor. First, for the log utility function of transmission reliability, we formulate the replicator factors control problem under the redundancy TDMA MAC as convex programming and a fully distributed algorithm is derived to solve the convex programming. Second, for the general utility function of transmission reliability, we formulate the replicator factors control problem under the redundancy TDMA MAC as nonlinear programming. By the substitution of variables, we convert the nonlinear programming into an equivalent convex one that could be distributively solved by the dual decomposition method. Third, for the retransmission TDMA MAC, we set the retransmission upper bound for each link according to the optimal replicator factors under the redundancy MAC and compute the total communication overhead for the retransmission MAC. In addition, we extend the convergence analysis of our algorithms to the case that considers noisy feedback.",

Previous researches on data aggregation are featured as query-oriented, which only provide partial information of the event happened in the deployment area at the base station.

EDA presents the distributed algorithm by exploiting Cloud Membership model of fuzzy logic to aggregate the information of events in the sensor networks. It also presents a distributed algorithm to collect and aggregate the event information. The base station will restore the whole event information when receiving the aggregated packets of event features. EDA can balance the tradeoff between delay, traffic savings, and precision of the restored events. The performance has been evaluated through both theoretical analysis and simulations. We also confirm the performance with the traces of our offshore sensor network testbed (OceanSense).",

    "abstract": "It is well known that designing, testing and debugging sensor networks are extremely hard. It is mainly due to limited resources and distributed natures of sensor networks. In a lab environment, it is difficult and tedious to try various network configurations and simulate various challenging environment factors. Thereafter, the sensor network community has longed for a good sensor network simulation tool allowing the philosophy of WYSIWYG: What You See Is What You Get. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of a visualized network manipulation tool integrated with TOSSIM and TOSSIM Live, called SimX. The SimX includes the following features: (1) topology manipulation, which allows a simple mouse drag on the virtual network node to actually change the physical network topology and the link qualities; (2) timing control, which allows a user to control a simulation to run faster or slower, even to pause the simulation; (3) variable watch and conditional breakpoints, which allow a user to watch variable value changes of all network nodes concurrently and set conditional breakpoints; (4) sensor input control, which allows a user to simulate different sensor data inputs and sampling rates. Besides supporting those traditional evaluation criteria, such as throughput, energy efficiency and delivery ratio, the SimX also supports a holistic evaluation methodology. The holistic evaluation methodology evaluates how well the holistic high-level spatial and temporal environmental changes have been recorded, not only those lowlevel engineering criteria. We also designed a XML-based sensor network visualization tool, which allows the user to illustrate any sensor network data, including data imported from TOSSIM and SimX. keyword: Wireless Sensor Network, Simulation, SimX, TOSSIM, XMonitor",

    "abstract": "The specific features of mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) impose new requirements for routing protocols. The aim of this paper is to present an approach that enhances routing performance by integrating ad hoc related characteristics. We propose a loop-free adaptive path energy conserving scheme which attempts to minimize both routing and storage overhead in order to efficiently provide robustness to host mobility, adaptability to wireless channel fluctuations and optimization of network resources use in large-scale networks. The strength of our scheme, based on source routing approach, named Energy Conserving Dynamic Source Routing (EC-DSR), is to handle network state related constraints such as node’s energy consumption, links’ availability and paths’ quality. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated via simulation and is compared to DSR protocol. Better results are obtained with EC-DSR in terms of control overhead. Furthermore, EC-DSR shows significant improvements in delay and forwarding efficiency for large scalable networks.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we present new efficient strategy for constructing a wireless tree network containing n nodes of diameter Delta while satisfying the QoS requirements such as bandwidth and delay. Given a tree network T, a coredian path is a path in T that minimizes the centdian function, ak-coredian tree is a subtree of T with k leaves that minimizes the centdian function, and a (k, l)-coredian tree is a subtree of T with k leaves and diameter l at most thatminimizes the centdian function. The (k, l)-coredian tree can serve as a backbone for a network, where intermediate nodes belong to the backbone and the leaves serve as the heads of the clusters covering the rest of the network. We show that a coredian path can be constructed at O(Delta)time with O(n) messages and a k-coredian tree can be constructed at O(kDelta) time with O(kn) messages. While a(k, l)-coredian tree can be constructed at O(n2) time with O(n2) messages. A simulation is presented for various values of n and k.",

An important observed problem is embedding a distributed data-mining algorithm into a sensor network. The proposed solution uses local predictors on each sensor node to make a local prediction and offers several original voting schemes. Results for one voting scheme from the open literature, and for several voting schemes introduced by this research are compared using a simulation methodology. Furthermore, a scheme for building local predictors on the data collected from several neighboring nodes is proposed and evaluated. The presented results indicate that the proposed voting schemes and the proposed scheme for local prediction offer an improved accuracy of the WSN-based prediction and a reduction in necessary communications during the prediction process.",

In this paper, we propose and set up CU-Simulator, a parallel radio channel simulator to enhance the performance for simulating data packet transmission in WSNs using NVIDIA’s CUDA-enabled GPU parallel computing architecture. First, the node positions are simulated on GPU. Second, we propose an efficient data structure for acceleration, called CUDA-quad-trees, residing in the fast on-chip memory of GPU, to organize sensor nodes in such a manner that the detection of possible transmitters is facilitated. Third, a CUDA parallel radio channel simulating engine is established. Experimental results show that CU-Simulator has a super-linear scalability and greatly outperforms a CPU implementation with up to 452.07-times speedup on an HP Z800 workstation with a NVIDIA Tesla C2070 card and an Intel Xeon Core-quad CPU.",

The scenario includes a multi-antenna primary user (working as a Base Station) and a number of singleantenna primary and cognitive radio users (CR users). The core aim of this paper is to maximize the data rate in the downlink, from base station (PU BS) to the desired primary user (PU RX), taking advantage of the cooperation of opportunistically selected CR users. Cooperating CR users will enjoy the benefits of transmitting to their intended CR receivers in a portion of time, allocated by PU BS. The main contribution of this work is proposing the opportunistic cooperative approach. Meanwhile the interference imposed on other PUs, due to cooperation of selected CR users, is removed. Moreover, as the opportunistically selected CR users form a virtual antenna array, it becomes feasible to utilize zero-forcing beamforming to remove the interference on other PUs.",

    "abstract": "We study the power conservation and disseminating reliability problem in precision agriculture applications in this paper. Precision agriculture needs to accurately evaluate farming environment, and soil monitoring is an important part of this effort. Soil measurement requires soil sensors being buried deep enough so as to avoid plowing and other mechanical activities. Due to dielectric loss, reflection and many other reasons, radio communication underground is difficult. But existing work find that the communication between aboveground and underground (air-soil) is feasible, thus aboveground sensor nodes are employed to connect the underground nodes. In such air-soil sensor network, most transmissions are dependent on the aboveground sensor nodes, thus, the energy consumption of them is a critical concern. On the other hand, the reliability of data dissemination must also be well considered as a result of important packets forwarding, such as query commands disseminating, control information delivering and binary reprogramming over the air. Given the situation of limited power and unreliable wireless links, we propose the K-matching problem, which is to minimize the energy consumption by setting optimal transmitting power so that each node underground is connected to at least K aboveground nodes in the air. We prove that this problem is NP-complete and two centralized and one distributed approximation algorithm are provided to solve this problem. Theoretical analysis and experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

Some of the properties considered by a vast majority of researchers include minimum-energy, fault tolerance, minimum interference, and bounded node degree. However preserving two or more combination of these properties at the same time is harder to achieve and often overlooked by the research community. In this paper, we propose a topology control algorithm that preserves connectivity and combines two other important properties, e.g, (a) minimum interference, and (b) fault tolerance. Interestingly, these two properti es create a fundamental tradeoff by running against each other. In one end, interference can be reduced by dropping links that create high interference. On the other end, dropp ing too many links make a network more susceptible to node failure/departure. Thus dropping high interference links while keeping the network significantly connected is a n important goal to achieve. We achieve such goal by formulating the problem of constructing minimum interference path preserving and fault tolerant wireless ad hoc networks under the same framework and then provide algorithms, both centralized and distributed with local information, to solve the problem. Moreover, for the first time in literature , we conceive the concept of fault tolerant interference spanner and provide a local a lgorithm to construct such spanner of a communication graph.",

    "abstract": "Service-oriented wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being paid more and more attention because service computing can hide complexity of WSNs and enables simple and transparent access to individual sensor nodes. Existing WSNs mainly use IEEE 802.15.4 as their communication specification, however, this protocol suite cannot support IP-based routing and service-oriented access because it only specifies a set of physical- and MAC-layer protocols. For inosculating WSNs with IP networks, IEEE proposed a 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over LoW Power wireless Area Networks) as the adaptation layer between IP and MAC layers. However, it is still a challenging task how to discover and manage sensor resources, guarantee the security of WSNs and route messages over resource-restricted sensor nodes. This paper is set to address such three key issues. Firstly, we propose a service-oriented WSN architectural model based on 6LoWPAN and design a lightweight service middleware SOWAM (service-oriented WSN architecture middleware), where each sensor node provides a collection of services and is managed by our SOWAM. Secondly, we develop a security mechanism for the authentication and secure connection among users and sensor nodes. Finally, we propose an energyaware mesh routing protocol (EAMR) for message transmission in a WSN with multiple mobile sinks, aiming at prolonging the lifetime of WSNs as long as possible. In our EAMR, sensor nodes with the residual energy lower than a threshold do not forward messages for other nodes until the threshold is leveled down. As a result, the energy consumption is evened over sensor nodes significantly. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our service-oriented approach and lightweight middleware SOWAM, as well as the effectiveness of our routing algorithm EAMR.",

    "abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSN) consisting of a large number of tiny inexpensive sensor nodes are a viable solution for many problems in the field of building automation. In order to meet the energy constraints, the nodes have to operate according to an extremely low duty cycle schedule. In such a scenario the reduction of the synchronization error, at least among directly communicating nodes, is a crucial functionality of the MAC layer. We propose a time synchronization mechanism based on the usage of a Kalman Filter (KF) on a smoothed sequence of measured beacon intervals. A side effect of this method is the introduction of a global clock synchronization. The implementation of the proposed solution is feasible on sensor devices with minimum processor, memory and energy capacity.",

    "abstract": "Considerations of realistic channel dynamics motivate the design of a new breed of opportunistic schemes, such as opportunistic transmission, scheduling and routing. Compared to their deterministic counter part, opportunistic schemes have been shown to increase network throughput, and/or reduce delay in limited experimental/simulation scenarios. In this paper, we propose analytical models that characterize the performance of routing protocols in lossy wireless networks with Rayleigh fading channels. We investigate the efficiency of a few representative deterministic and opportunistic routing protocols under both light-loaded and saturated traffic conditions. This work deviates from existing work that assumes idealistic packet reception, and is thus of practical relevance. Our study shows that opportunistic routing significantly outperforms its deterministic counterpart in average effective progresses made in single-hop transmissions. In deterministic routing schemes, tuning of parameters based on node density is critical to achieve optimal performance.",

    "abstract": "The wide spread of sensor networks enforces the need to provide a new technology that supports the emerging characteristics of sensors. This has geared IEEE 802.15.4 standards committee toward working on the physical and data link layers in cooperation with ZigBee Alliance that has worked on the network and application layers. The new cooperation, named ZigBee, considers sensors characteristics in the full design. Numerous home applications are guiding the need for communication protocols supporting the new emergent characteristics of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), which demand ultra low rate, low power consumption and low cost. ZigBee operates in the license-free 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band that is used by many other standards such as, Bluetooth IEEE 802.15.1, and WLAN IEEE 802.11b. This paper proposes two smart schemes that enable the communication in environments with ZigBee and WLAN devices in order to achieve higher delivery ratios while maintaining acceptable end-to-end delay values. The proposed schemes carryout essential predictions to achieve fairness among ZigBee and WLAN transmissions, therefore, attain better load balancing among devices of different networks. Simulation results show that the proposed smart and opportunistic schemes increase the packet delivery ratio of ZigBee devices for different scenarios. In addition, the proposed schemes enhance the performance of WLAN devices by increasing the packet delivery ratio, while maintaining an acceptable level of end to end delay values.",

    "abstract": "With the proliferation of low-cost, low-power, and miniature size electronics in the last decade, tiny wireless embedded systems, capable of monitoring real world phenomena, have been explored for a wide variety of monitoring applications, including those that have traditionally been realized with fixed-wired based solutions. In order to achieve long operational lifetime for battery operated wireless embedded systems used in monitoring applications, these are typically designed with low-power modules that offer limited computational performance and communication throughput and therefore, are generally applicable to low-sample rate intermittent monitoring applications. Nevertheless, it is possible to overcome these challenges, in order to fulfill the demands of high-sample rate monitoring applications, by designing wireless embedded platforms that can perform high-throughput in-sensor processing, while maintaining low-power characteristics. In this paper, the design and development of a high-performance and low-power wireless hardware platform along with performance and power consumption for different tasks is presented. With its compact size and modular structure enabling there to be an integrated customized sensor layer, it can be used for a wide variety of applications. In addition, the flexibility provided through dynamically configurable interfaces and power management, helps optimizing performance and power consumption for different applications.",

    "abstract": "We consider dynamic link networks(DLN), where nodes are static, but the links are highly dynamic. Reliable multi-hop communication is critical in such networks, which inspires receiver contention routing, which elects relays from actual receivers to overcome link dynamics. However, in previous studies of receiver contention routing protocols, the multi-hop reliability is lack of deep understanding, because the randomness and redundancy in the multi-hop packet forwarding process are hard to model. We propose RECORD protocol to control the randomness and redundant packet for receiver contention, which is carried out by designing sector-shape forwarding zone, prioritized CTS, and contention clearing scheme. For symmetric link DLNs, RECORD can guarantee multi-hop unique-path routing, which enables a Markov Chain model to the multi-hop forwarding process. The multi-hop reliability is predicted by analyzing the stable status of the Markov chain. Particularly, when positions of all sensors are known, the multi-hop reliability of RECORD has close-form formula; when node positions are unknown, recursive upper bound and lower bound are derived. Further, RECORD is implemented distributively by both simulation and in real sensor networks. Extensive evaluations validate the analytical results.",

    "abstract": "Sensor networks have found important applications on real-time sensing and control. In those applications, the stringent quality of service (QoS) requirements (e.g., delay, jitter) and the dynamic nature of low-power wireless communication render existing MAC protocols undesirable. In this paper, we present RoMac, a localized QoS-aware TDMA MAC protocol for real-time dynamic sensor networks. The key contributions of RoMac include: (1) it provides collision-free communication and persistent QoS guarantee such as constant packet jitter and bounded latency; (2) it is resilient to topology dynamics and truly traffic adaptive in dynamic environments. To our best knowledge, this is the first TDMA MAC protocol that can achieve the resilience to dynamic topologies; (3) its localized design eases the need of scheduling message exchange beyond the initialization phase. We present an implementation of the protocol using the TinyOS operating system running on the iMote2 sensor mote platform. Our experiment result shows that RoMac can achieve the adaptability to dynamic changes in data collection sensor networks and provide persistent QoS support in terms of timeliness, packet jitter and fairness. 1 Keywords-QoS-Aware, Media Access Control, Real-time, Dynamic Sensor Networks",

    "abstract": "Wireless Sensor Actor Networks (WSANs) have contributed to the advancement of ubiquitous computing wherein time and energy considerations to perform the tasks of ubiquitous applications are critical. Therefore, real-timeliness and energy-awareness are amongst the grand challenges of WSANs. In this paper, we present a context-aware task distribution approach for assigning real-time tasks to cost-effective actors and for scheduling these tasks at actor level subject to minimizing the energy consumptions of actors and meeting the deadlines of tasks. The proposed approach comprises of three protocols, namely a Market-based Task Assignment Protocol (MaTAP), an Energy Calculation Protocol (ECaP), and a Context-aware Task Scheduling Protocol (CaTSP). We present the formal models of the proposed protocols using Timed Automata and prove their soundness to validate the correctness of the proposed approach. We show that our proposed approach is more efficient in terms of both the total remaining energies of actors and the average tasks completion time compared to stochastic approach. We also show that our approach guarantees the deadlines of all tasks.",

    "abstract": "In the United States, there has been a high incidence of hurricanes over the past decade. Before a hurricane makes landfall it is important, for safety, that people who live in potentially dangerous areas, such as along the coast, evacuate. Nursing homes have an even greater concern during an evacuation as the patients are primarily elderly or disabled, and require additional assistance. In this paper we investigate the characteristics and challenges associated with hurricane evacuation of health care centers, such as nursing homes. Then, we propose a patient centric hurricane evacuation management system that allow healthcare providers to continuously monitor and track patients. The hardware and software architecture, and the main operations are presented. The proposed system is able to operate in difficult conditions, such as lack of basic communication services such as cellular and Internet. We evaluate the performance of the proposed system using the OPNET network simulator.",

    "abstract": "IEEE 802.11e is being researched to provide Quality of Service (QoS) for the upcoming multimedia applications in broadband wireless networks. It's a contention based channel access mechanism that uses the enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) technique. EDCA statically resets the Contention Window (CW) after each successful transmission. This behavior fails to adapt to network conditions leading to poor link utilization and increasing network delays. This article discusses a novel technique that utilizes fuzzy logic to adapt the CW values. In contrast to other adaptation techniques that utilize crisp data to quantify channel conditions, this method utilizes linguistic terms that accurately model uncertainty through the use of fuzzy logic. The aim of this method is to provide an improved and consistent link utilization, both factors being important for delay sensitive and real time applications. The performance of the proposed fuzzy adaptation technique is compared to the original IEEE 802.11e differentiation scheme in addition to other adaptation techniques. Conducted simulations revealed remarkable adaptation ability reflected in better and more consistent performance most notably for streaming applications.",

    "abstract": "MAC protocols based on preamble sampling techniques offer significant energy savings for low datarate multihop wireless sensor networks by efficiently reduc ing idle listening in lightly loaded networks. However, without any particular optimization, preamble sampling protocols still consume large amounts of energy due to the overhead induced by the long preamble transmitted prior data frames. To reduce the overhead induced by the use a full length preamble, many improvements have been proposed. These proposals targeted both the cost at the receiver and that at t he transmitter. At the transmitter side, proposals tends to minimize the preamble size by means of explicit synchronization, whereas at the receiver, proposals aim at reducing the duration of listeni ng by replacing the preamble with a series of frames. In this paper, we focus on reducing the cost at the receiver si de while showing that our solution is also compatible with solutions that reduce the cost at the transmitter side. We propose a new idea that reduces overhearing further on by avoiding reception of irrelevant frames. With our idea that is based on digest information, not only unicast frames can be fi ltered but also irrelevant (redundant) broadcast frames can be avoided a priori. We show that the use of the digest information together with the sequence number field substantially increases the energ y savings of frame preamble MAC protocols. We propose two possible implementations, Micro Frame Preamble (MFP) and Zebra Frame Preamble (ZFP), in which avoiding reception of irrelevant broadcasts can be integrated. We provide an analytical framework, in which we model the lifetime of various frame preamble MAC protocols. We complete the theoretical analysis with ns2 simulation and experimental validation through implementation on the Chipcon CC 2500 evaluation kit. We analytically show that the solution based on micro frames yields",

However, mobile ad hoc networks are not a friendly environment for various reasons in nature. Routing Proto- cols without any security feature can put entire network at risk. As security becomes an increasingly important issue, secure mobile ad hoc routing is attracting more and more research attention. In this paper, we make a comprehensive investigation on the issue of network security and conduct an up-to-date survey of secure mobile ad hoc routing protocols.",

    "abstract": "Nodes in sensor fields and in autonomous swarms of mobile robots need to communicate; this usually requires individual nodes to either consume a significant amount of energy, carefully position themselves, precisely align carrier phase, or use complex coding. We propose an alternative strategy of allowing multiple independent and mobile wireless transmitters to share the power-consumption burden by combining low-power transmissions into a unified higher-power transmission. This is not a distributed beamforming or space-time coding approach. Instead, all nodes simultaneously broadcast the same symbol on the same channel without using different code books and without aligning carriers. This paper describes modulation, synchronization, and node selection schemes which make this possible. It also covers both baseband and over-the-air test results.",

    "abstract": "© 2019 Old City Publishing, Inc. To better understand connectivity of multihop wireless networks with the log-normal shadowing, we study the impact of radio irregularities on network connectivity under such a realistic shadowing model. Existing results indicate that connectivity increases when the radio propagation becomes more irregular. But all of these results were only based on simulation studies or the assumption that the important boundary effect is ignored to avoid the challenging technical analysis. Therefore, they can hardly be applied to any practical wireless networks. It is extremely challenging to take the complicated boundary effect into consideration under such a realistic model because the transmission area of each node is an irregular region other than a circular area. In this paper, we assume the wireless nodes are represented by a Poisson point process with density n over a unit-area disk. We investigate the impact of radio irregularity on network connectivity with different transmission power settings, taking the important boundary effect into consideration. When each node transmits at a fixed uniform power, we prove analytically that network connectivity increases as the radio propagation becomes more irregular under such a realistic shadowing model. When each node transmits at an adjustable power so that the average node degree of the network is kept constant, we prove analytically that the expected number of the isolated nodes in the network is also unchanged under such a realistic shadowing model. The results obtained in this paper are validated via numberical analysis. These results can be used as design guidelines for all practical multihop wireless networks in which both the shadowing and boundary effects must be taken into consideration.",
