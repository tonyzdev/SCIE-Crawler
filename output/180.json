    "abstract": "Abstract The filarial nematode Dirofilaria repens is currently considered to be one of the most extensively spreading human and animal parasites in Europe. In Ukraine, reporting cases of dirofilariasis has been mandatory since 1975, and the disease was included in the national surveillance system for notifiable diseases. Up until December 31st 2012, a total of 1533 cases have been registered, with 1465 cases occurring within the previous 16 years. Most of the cases of dirofilariasis were registered in 6 regions: Kyiv, and the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya, Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson and Chernihiv oblasts. In the years 1997–2002 the highest incidence rate was noted in the Kherson oblast in the south of the country (9.79 per 100 000 people), and the lowest in western Ukraine (0.07–1.68 per 100 000 people). D. repens infections were registered in all oblasts. Parasitic lesions were most often located in the head, the subconjunctival tissue and around the eyes. D. repens lesions were also found in the limbs, torso, male sexual organs, and female mammary glands. Dirofilariasis was diagnosed in persons aged from 11 months to 90 years old, most often among people between 21–40 years of age. Most patients had only one parasitic skin lesion; the majority of isolated nematodes were female. The results of our analysis point to a constant increase in D. repens dirofilariasis incidence in humans in Ukraine. Despite educational efforts, infections have become more frequent and the territory in which the disease occurs has enlarged to encompass the whole of Ukraine. Nevertheless, the Ukrainian sanitary-epidemiological services managed to achieve some measure of success, e.g. by creating a registration system for D. repens infections and establishing proper diagnostics for the disease.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The phylogenetic relationships of representative species of the superfamily Lepocreadioidea were assessed using partial lsrDNA and nad1 sequences. Forty-two members of the family Lepocreadiidae, six putative members of the Enenteridae, six gyliauchenid species and one Gorgocephalidae, were studied along with 22 species representing 8 families. The Lepocreadioidea is found to be monophyletic, except for the two species of the putative enenterid genus Cadenatella, which are found to be only distantly related to the lepocreadioids. The Lepocreadioidea is formed of five clades in a polytomy, the Gorgocephalidae, a clade containing the Enenteridae and Gyliauchenidae, a small clade of atypical lepocreadiines and the deep-sea lepidapedine lepocreadiids, a small clade consisting of a freshwater form and a group of shallow-water putative lepidapedines and the final clade includes the remaining lepocreadiids. Thus, the generally accepted concept of the Lepocreadiidae is polyphyletic. The Enenteridae (minus Cadenatella) and the Gyliauchenidae are jointly and individually monophyletic, and are sister groups. The nad1 gene on its own places a deep-sea lepocreadiine with the deep-sea lepidapedines, whereas lsrDNA, combined sequences and morphology place this deep-sea lepocreadiine within a group of typical lepocreadiids. It could not be demonstrated that a significant proportion of sites in the nad1 gene evolved under positive selection; this anomalous relationship therefore remains unexplained. Most deep-sea species are in a monophyletic group, a few of which also occur in shallow waters, retaining some characters of the deep-sea clade. Many lepocreadioid species infect herbivorous fish, and it may be that the recently discovered life-cycle involving a bivalve first intermediate host and metacercariae encysted on vegetation is a common life-cycle pattern. The host relationships show no indication of co-speciation, although the host-spectrums exhibited are not random, with related worms tending to utilize related hosts. There are, however, many exceptions. Morphology is found to be of limited value in indicating higher level relationships. For example, even with the benefit of hindsight the gyliauchenids show little morphological similarity to their sister group, the Enenteridae.",

In total, 460 birds of 43 species and 14 families (mostly passerines) were examined for the presence of infections. Of them, 267 were recognised as infected with haemosporidian parasites. Mixed infections were recorded in 24 individuals (9%). Besides the 24 individuals with mix infections, 114 (43%) were positive for Plasmodium spp. and 129 (48%) for Haemoproteus spp. We identified 52 genetic lineages of haemosporidian parasites: 38 of Haemoproteus and 14 of Plasmodium. Twelve new cyt b lineages of Haemoproteus were recorded; they occurred in the following hosts: grey-faced woodpecker (Picus canus), golden oriole (Oriolus oriolus), jay (Garrulus glandarius), barred warbler (Sylvia nisoria), song thrush (Turdus philomelos), spotted flycatcher (Muscicapa striata), spanish sparrow (Passer hispaniolensis), hawfinch (Coccothraustes coccothraustes), and cirl bunting (Emberiza cirlus). We also detected 22 new host records for previously known lineages. The most common lineage was SGS1 (Plasmodium relictum), which had a total prevalence of 14% and occurred in 8 host species belonging to 5 families. Three of the cyt b lineages of genus Haemoproteus (DURB1, DURB2 and SYNIS2) showed more than 5% divergence from all described morphologically lineages. These lineages probably represent at least 2 different morphospecies which remains to be identified.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Malaria remains a major public health issue in the world despite a decline in the disease burden. However, though symptomatic malaria is diagnosed and treated, asymptomatic infections remain poorly known and support transmission. This study assessed the prevalence of symptomatic and asymptomatic Plasmodium spp. infections in three areas in Gabon to monitor and evaluate the impact of malaria. Methods and Results A cross-sectional study was conducted in three areas of Gabon. Febrile and afebrile children aged 6 months to 15 years were included in this study. Malaria prevalence was determined by microscopy of and using rapid diagnostic test (RDT). Plasmodium spp. species were identified by PCR according to the Snounou method. The data were recorded in Excel, and the statistical analyses were performed using the software R version R 64 × 3.5.0. A total of 2381(333 asymptomatic and 107 symptomatic) children were included. The overall prevalence of malaria was 40% (952/2381), with the majority (77% symptomatic and 98% asymptomatic) of infections caused by Plasmodium falciparum . A high prevalence of malaria was found in infected children in rural and semi-rural areas. In these two areas, a higher prevalence of Plasmodium malariae was observed in asymptomatic. Furthermore, mixed infections were more prevalent in asymptomatic children than in symptomatic. Conclusion This study showed that the prevalence of Plasmodium spp. infection varied according to the regions. The main species was Plasmodium falciparum , but in asymptomatic children the prevalence of Plasmodium malariae was high in rural areas. To help fight malaria more effectively asymptomatic infections should be taken into account and treated.",

In the present study, the aim was to investigate the potential role of sanguinarine as a specific inhibitor of Leishmania PP2C that can induce apoptosis in the parasite. The results demonstrated that sanguinarine inhibits, in a dose-dependent mode at 72 h, the growth and phosphatase activity of both Leishmania major and Leishmania mexicana promastigotes. Therefore, all assays were performed from this time period onwards. TUNEL assay was used to identify apoptosis and indicated apoptosis in L. major and L. mexicana promastigotes. Similarly, Western blot assay showed that PARP, a DNA damage indicator molecule, was present in L. major and L. mexicana promastigotes incubated with the inhibitor. In addition, differential expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was observed in both Leishmania species. Finally, the protein phosphatase PP2C expression was not affected, whereas p38 MAPK phosphorylation was increased in L. major promastigotes than in L. mexicana promastigotes. Therefore, sanguinarine proved to be an inhibitor of the growth and PP2C enzymatic activity of L. major and L. mexicana promastigotes, and with it, this inhibition induced apoptosis.",

To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to report the detection of Colpodella sp. in foxes (Cyprus red fox Vulpes vulpes indutus ), wild birds (Eurasian coot Fulica atra , duck Anas spp.) and goats ( Capra hircus ) worldwide. Methods A total of 180 faecal samples (29 foxes, 48 Eurasian coot, 20 Eurasian teal Anas crecca , 7 duck, 44 goats − 10 from a farm and 34 free-living individuals - and 32 sheep Ovis aries ) were analyzed for the parasite by nested PCR and sequencing. Results Four samples were positive (4/180 = 2.2%), including one goat from a farm (1/10 = 10%), one fox (1/29 = 3.4%), one Eurasian coot (1/48 = 2.1%) and one duck (1/7 = 14.3%). Conclusion The results of this study support the evidence that Colpodella sp. can infect mammals and birds, as well as livestock and wildlife, which could act as zoonotic reservoirs of the parasite and potentially pose a risk to human and animal health.",

Polylekithum catahoulensis sp. nov. was described from material collected from catfishes at the Catahoula Wildlife Refuge, LaSalle Parish, Louisiana, USA, and compared with P. ictaluri collected from catfishes in Reelfoot Lake, Obion County, Tennessee, USA, and the Pearl River, Hancock County, Mississippi, USA. Polylekithum catahoulensis had smaller eggs (77–88 μm long by 51–63 μm wide vs. 94–108 μm by 52–76 μm) and a longer forebody (35–41% of overall body length vs. 29–34%). Comparison of more than 2,400 bp long fragments of nuclear ribosomal DNA (complete ITS and partial 28S regions) strongly supported the status of P. catahoulensis as a new species. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of 28S rDNA gene sequences from Polylekithum as well as representative species from Allocreadiidae, Atractotrematidae, Brachycoeliidae, Callodistomidae, Dicrocoeliidae, Encyclometridae, Gorgoderidae, Haploporidae, Opecoelidae, Plagiorchiidae, and Telorchiidae rooted by Monorchiidae and Lissorchiidae demonstrated that of the families tested, Polylekithum was most closely related to Encyclometridae as a gorgoderoid and not to Allocreadiidae as previously reported. Morphological features of three South American allocreadiids, Allocreadium patagonicum, P. percai, and A. pichi were inconsistent with generic diagnoses of Allocreadium and Polylekithum, so we suggested they belonged in a single unnamed genus similar to Creptotrema. Polylekithum catlai from India was assessed from the description and failed to conform to the generic diagnosis of Polylekithum. Morphology of Caudouterina suggested a close relationship with Polylekithum and not Allocreadiidae.",

Nuclear ribosomal RNA gene sequences are well-established and valuable markers for resolving flatworm interrelationships spanning a wide range of taxonomic divergences, but fail to provide resolution amongst recently diverged lineages. Entire mt genomes of selected cyclophyllidean tapeworms are available on GenBank, and we used these to design PCR primers to amplify mtDNA from cox1, rrnL and nad1 for a range of cyclophyllideans (7 davaineids, 1 hymenolepidid and 1 dilepidid) and selected outgroups (Tetrabothrius sp. and Mesocestoides sp.). A combined nuclear and mt gene data set was used to estimate a reference phylogeny and the performance of the individual genes was compared to this. Although nuclear and mt genes each contributed to the structure and stability of the phylogenetic estimate, strongest nodal support was provided by nuclear data amongst the basal lineages and by mt data amongst the most recently diverged lineages. The apparent complementarity afforded by combining nuclear and mt data was compromised by these data partitions providing conflicting signal at poorly supported nodes. Nevertheless, we argue for a combined evidence approach. PCR primers that amplify rrnL were designed and tested successfully against a diversity of cyclophyllideans; rrnL and nad1 appeared to be more informative than the fragment of cox1. The genus Raillietina was not supported by molecular evidence. The new primers will likely provide considerable resolution to estimates of cyclophyllidean interrelationships in future studies.",

The presence of cheeks and legs with micromammillate cuticle makes adults of C. fonsecai morphologically related to a group of argasid species (mostly bat-associated) formerly classified into the subgenus Alectorobius, genus Ornithodoros. Examination of larvae indicates that C. fonsecai is clearly distinct from most of the previously described Carios species formerly classified into the subgenus Alectorobius, based primarily on its larger body size, dorsal setae number, dorsal plate shape, and hypostomal morphology. On the other hand, the larva of C. fonsecai is most similar to Carios peropteryx, and Carios peruvianus, from which differences in dorsal plate length and width, tarsal setae, and hypostome characteristics are useful for morphological differentiation. The mitochondrial 16S rDNA sequence of C. fonsecai showed to be closest (85–88% identity) to several corresponding sequences of different Carios species available in GenBank. Bats identified as Peropteryx macrotis and Desmodus rotundus were found infested by C. fonsecai larvae in the same cave where the type series was collected. C. fonsecai showed to be aggressive to humans in the laboratory.",

Such parasites included Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, Tripartiella tetramerii and Trichodina nobilis (Protozoa), Dolops longicauda (Argulidae), Gussevia alioides, Gussevia disparoides (Monogenoidea), Digenea metacercarie, Pseudoproleptus larvae, Anisakidae larvae (Nematoda), Proteocephalidea plerocercoid (Eucestoda) and Gorytocephalus spectabilis (Acanthocephala). Ciliates were the most dominant and abundant taxon, while cestodes were the least prevalent. The parasites showed seasonal variation in their infection dynamics associated with environmental changes during the Amazonian drainage season, except the infection with I. multifiliis. The parasites community in A. tetramerus was also characterized by higher diversity, species richness and uniformity during the drainage season when compared to Amazon flood season.

    "abstract": "Abstract To estimate the current prevalence of gastrointestinal (GI) parasites in dogs and cats, a total of 105 fresh faecal samples were collected from rural areas in Peninsular Malaysia. Each faecal sample was examined for the presence of GI parasites by microscopic examination after formalin-ether concentration technique and for protozoa, trichrome and Ziehl-Neelsen staining were employed. The overall prevalence of GI parasitic infection was 88.6% (95% CI = 82.5–94.7) in which 88.3% of dogs and 89.3% of cats were infected with at least one parasites species, respectively. There were 14 different GI parasites species (nematodes, cestodes and protozoa) detected, including Ancylostoma spp. (62.9%), Toxocara spp. (32.4%), Trichuris vulpis (21.0%), Spirometra spp. (9.5%), Toxascaris leonina (5.7%), Dipylidium caninum (4.8%), Ascaris spp. (2.9%), Hymenolepis diminuta (1.0%) and others. General prevalence of GI parasites showed a significant difference between helminth (84.4%) and protozoa (34.3%) infections. Monoparasitism (38.1%) was less frequent than polyparasitism (46.7%). As several of these GI parasites are recognized as zoonotic agents, the results of this investigation revealed that local populations may be exposed to a broad spectrum of zoonotic agents by means of environmental contamination with dogs and cats faeces and this information should be used to mitigate public health risks. Prevention and control measures have to be taken in order to reduce the prevalence rates especially in socioeconomically disadvantaged communities where animals live in close proximity to people, poor levels of hygiene and overcrowding together with a lack in veterinary attention and zoonotic awareness.",

In this study, screening for cardiopulmonary and intestinal helminths and sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) was done on 118 foxes originating from two distinct localities in Denmark, (Copenhagen) greater area and southern Jutland. Fifteen parasite species were recorded in 116 foxes (98.3%), nine parasitic species are of zoonotic potential. Parasite diversity was greater in foxes of Copenhagen in terms of overall parasite species richness and species richness of all helminth groups individually: trematodes; cestodes; and nematodes. Six parasite species were recovered from foxes of Copenhagen, but not from foxes of Southern Jutland: Echinochasmus perfoliatus; Echinostoma sp.; Pseudamphistomum truncatum; Dipylidium caninum; Angiostrongylus vasorum; and Sarcoptes scabiei, but Toxascaris leonina was only recorded in foxes of southern Jutland. A high prevalence and abundance of A. vasorum in foxes of Copenhagen was observed. The prevalence of four nematode species; Eucoleus (Capillaria) aerophilus, Uncinaria stenocephala, Toxocara canis, and Crenosoma vulpis, in foxes of both localities were comparable and ranging from 22.9% to 89%. The prevalence of Mesocestoides sp. was significantly higher in foxes of Copenhagen. Taenia spp. were detected using morphological and molecular analysis, which revealed the dominance of T. polyacantha in foxes of both localities. Infections with sarcoptic mange were evident only among foxes of Copenhagen (44.9%), which significantly affected the average weight of the infected animals. Further remarks on the zoonotic and veterinary implications of the parasites recovered are given.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Encephalitozoon intestinalis is an obligate intracellular microsporidian fungus that causes severe gastrointestinal infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Propolis (PROP), a resinous substance derived from bees, has antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, while royal jelly (RJ) has immunomodulatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of PROP and RJ against E. intestinalis. Methods The phenolic composition of PROP was analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection, and the chemical components of RJ were evaluated according to ISO12824 standards. The cytotoxicity of PROP and RJ on HEK-293 cells was evaluated using the XTT assay. The three highest non-cytotoxic concentrations of each sample were tested for their effects on E. intestinalis spores by qRT-PCR. Trichrome-stained photomicrographs were used to assess spore density in HEK-293 cells treated with PROP and RJ. Results PROP analysis revealed flavonoids such as quercetin, kaempferol, pinocembrin and galangin, as well as phenolic acids such as caffeic and cinnamic acids, known for their bioactive properties. RJ contained mainly proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and sugars, reflecting its role as a nutritionally and biologically active substance. According to the results of this first study evaluating the effect of PROP and RJ on E. intestinalis, all concentrations evaluated in the study showed a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of E. intestinalis spores compared to the control group. Conclusion In conclusion, we believe that PROP and RJ should be considered as an alternative option in the development of antimicrosporidial drugs due to their potential medicinal and pharmaceutical properties.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose This study aimed to assess the anticoccidial effects of betaine and a vaccine compared to monensin sodium in experimentally induced coccidiosis in broiler chickens. Methods 600 day-old broiler chickens (Ross 308) were randomly assigned to five groups, each with four replicates of 30 birds. While the control group received a basal diet, two experimental groups received basal diet supplemented with either 100 mg/kg monensin sodium or 2.0 g/kg betaine. The remaining experimental groups received a commercial coccidiosis vaccine alone or in combination with betaine. All chickens were challenged with sporulated field-mixed Eimeria species at 20 days of age. Results Throughout the study, vaccinated birds showed superior performance in terms of body weight gain (BWG) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) compared to other anticoccidial treatments ( P &lt; 0.05), followed by betaine, vaccine + betaine, and monensin treatments in descending order. While all anticoccidial regimens significantly reduced fecal oocyst output only at the beginning of the observation period, this effect diminished thereafter ( P &lt; 0.05). Supplementation with monensin and vaccination against coccidiosis significantly decreased small intestine weight compared to untreated controls ( P &lt; 0.01), with a numerical decrease observed in chicks fed betaine-supplemented diets and treated with the combination of betaine and vaccine. Conclusion Notably, there has been no prior study comparing betaine with monensin sodium and a coccidiosis vaccine. These findings suggest that dietary betaine supplementation and a commercial coccidiosis vaccine containing mixed Eimeria spp. may offer benefits in controlling coccidiosis, presenting viable, cost-effective, sustainable, and safe alternatives to conventional ionophore anticoccidials, with added benefits of no residue and reduced resistance hazards for both animal and human consumption.",

Infection parameters differed: The fish from the Atlantic showing a prevalence of 87.97% and a mean intensity of 4.69, while, in those from the Mediterranean, these were 41.27% and 1.73, respectively. In both samples the two-third larval stage types were isolated: Anisakis simplex sensu lato and Anisakis larvae type II, with prevalence of 85.71% and 30.83% in fish from the Atlantic and 41.27% and 1.59% for those from the Mediterranean, respectively. In both samples, the prevalence of larvae in viscera was clearly higher than in the muscle tissue. We also observed an increase in parasitization with increasing host length, those ≥ 46 cm having the highest prevalences (94.87% for those from the Atlantic and 58.33% for those from the Mediterranean; p&lt;0.03).",

The main goals of this study were: (1) to determine the helminth parasite fauna of L. latinasus; (2) to determine the richness and diversity of parasites at the component and infracommunity levels; (3) to analyze the relationships between helminth, frog body size and sex, and (4) to identify and examine species affinity of helminth communities. The helminth component community of this frog’s population consisted of 17 species. The predominant groups of parasites were the trematodes (adults: Glypthelmins repandum, Catadiscus inopinatus and Haematoloechus longiplexus; larvae: Travtrema aff. stenocotyle, Bursotrema aff. tetracotyloides, Styphlodora sp., unknown opisthogonimid species, Petasiger sp. and unknown strigeid species), followed by the nematodes (Cosmocerca podicipinus, C. parva, C. rara, C. cruzi, Schrankiana schranki and Aplectana hylambatis); other groups of parasites were represented by only one species (unknown larval cestode species and Centrorhynchus sp.). All parasite helminth species showed an aggregated pattern of distribution. The most infected organs were kidneys, small intestine, large intestine and pharyngeal zone. The host body size was important in determining the parasites abundance of G. repandum. At the level of component community G. repandum was the species with highest prevalence of infection and Bursotrema aff. tetracotyloides was the dominant species. Helminth species showed four significant pairs of covariation and two significant pairs of association in the infracommunities of Leptodactylus latinasus.",

    "abstract": "Abstract While studying Myxobolus gill infections of cyprinid fishes, the authors found large, segmented plasmodia in three species: ide (Leuciscus idus), asp (Aspius aspius) and white bream (Blicca bjoerkna). As regards their size and morphology, the spores from these plasmodia corresponded to those of M. dujardini described from chub (Leuciscus cephalus). However, the 18S rDNA sequences of spores from the three cyprinids differed from those of M. dujardini. Based on molecular differences, this paper describes two new species: M. alvarezae sp. nov. from ide and asp, and M. sitjae sp. nov. from white bream. The two new species and M. dujardini had a similar tissue tropism, and infected the multilayered epithelium of the gill filaments. Histological examination of the infected filaments demonstrated that the large plasmodia with multiple buddings were formed from amalgamating small plasmodia. Besides carrying infection in the filamental epithelium, the three above fish species were infected by small intralamellar plasmodia as well. These plasmodia were filled by spores that resembled the roach parasite M. intimus both in morphology and seasonal development. The 18S rDNA sequences of ‘intimus-like’ spores from ide and asp differed only in some base pairs from spores found in the type host roach, and were identified as belonging to M. intimus. The spores found in white bream, however, showed 3.6-5.0% difference in DNA sequence from those of M. intimus; therefore, they have been described as M. eirasianus sp. nov. The aim of this paper was to demonstrate the importance of using molecular methods for separating and identifying morphologically corresponding or closely similar Myxobolus spp.",

All the collected Nerocila species showed significant seasonal fluctuations in the prevalence of infestation, reaching maximum from October through April and minimum (or total absence of the parasites) from May through September. Such fluctuations were analyzed based on environmental parameters. Body surface, postero-ventral side of the head and the lateral line of the host fish form the major infestation site for the recovered Nerocila species.

These metabolites were eluted with methanol and screened using SYBR Green I assay for their antiplasmodial activity against blood stage Plasmodium falciparum in human red blood cell culture. Our results revealed that fungal endophytes belonging to diverse genera elaborate antiplasmodial metabolites. A Fusarium sp. (580, IC50: 1.94 μg ml−1) endophytic in a marine alga and a Nigrospora sp. (151, IC50: 2.88 μg ml−1) endophytic in a tree species were subjected to antiplasmodial activity-guided reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography separation. Purification led to potentiation as reflected in IC50 values of 0.12 μg ml-1 and 0.15 μg ml−1 for two of the fractions obtained from 580. Our study adds further credence to the notion that fungal endophytes are a potential storehouse for a variety of novel secondary metabolites vested with different bioactivities including some that can stall the growth of the malaria parasite.",

FLOTAC resulted in generally higher egg counts and lower coefficients of variation than the other two methods used. The reliability of FECPAK and McMaster is depended on the area under the slide counted. All three methods can be used for making decisions whether to treat but FLOTAC or Mini-FLOTAC should be used for faecal egg count reduction tests when lower egg counts are present.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Resistance and adverse consequences of albendazole (ABZ) in treating trichinellosis urged demand for secure and effective new drugs. The current study aimed to assess the effect of chitosan-coated lipid nano-combination with albendazole and miltefosine (MFS) in treating experimental murine trichinellosis and evaluating pathological and immunological changes of trichinellosis. Materials and Methods One hundred twenty Swiss albino mice were divided into six groups. Each group was subdivided into a and b subgroups based on the scarification time, which was 7- and 40-days post-infection (PI), respectively. The treatment efficacy was evaluated using parasitological, histopathological, serological (interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-4 serum levels), immunohistochemical (GATA3, glutathione peroxidase1 (GPX1) and caspase-3), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methods. Results The most effective drug was nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) loaded with ABZ (G5), which showed the most significant reduction in adults and larval count (100% and 92.39%, respectively). The greatest amelioration in histopathological changes was reported in G4 treated with MFS. GATA3 and caspase-3 were significantly reduced in all treated groups. GPX1 was significantly increased in G6 treated with MFS + NLCs. The highest degenerative effects on adults and larvae by SEM were documented in G6. Conclusion Loading ABZ or MFS on chitosan-coated NLCs enhanced their efficacy against trichinellosis. Although ABZ was better than MFS, their combination should be considered as MFS caused a significant reduction in the intensity of infection. Furthermore, MFS showed anti-inflammatory (↓GATA3) and antiapoptotic effects (↓caspase-3), especially in the muscular phase. Also, when loaded with NLCS, it showed an antioxidant effect (↑GPX1).

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is caused by the larval form of Echinococcus granulosus. Clinical, radiologic, pathologic, and serologic findings should be evaluated together for the diagnosis of CE. The sensitivity and specificity oalf serologic tests may vary depending on the method used. In this study, we aimed to detect IgG antibodies specific to E. granulosus using indirect hemagglutination assay (IHA), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), indirect fluorescent antibodies (IFA) and western blot (WB) tests. Methods In our study, the serum samples of 74 patients sent to our laboratory with suspicion of CE were studied using two different commercial IHA tests, ELISA, IFA and WB test. The test results were evaluated along with radiological findings and histopathological examinations, the latter being the gold standard. Results Of all the patients, 51 (69%) were female and 23 (31%) were male. There was a statistically significant difference between males and females (χ 2 = 9.7, p = 0.002). Out of 74 patients, positivity rates for Siemens IHA, Fumouze IHA, ELISA, IFA and WB test were positive as 33 (44.6%), 35 (47.3%), 43 (58.1%), 42 (56.7%) and 38 (51.3%), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the tests were as follows: 66.67 and 2.31% for Siemens IHA; 70.83% and 96.15% for Fumouze IHA; 85.42%, and 88.46% for ELISA; 83.33% and 88.46% for IFA; 72.92% and 88.46% for WB test. Conclusion There were statistically significant differences in between all five methods ( p &lt; 0,001). While the tests with the highest specificity was Fumouze IHA, the test with the highest sensitivity was the ELISA test. It was concluded that IHA and ELISA tests were more practical in practice because of their greater applicability.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Gyrodactylus fauna of 274 fish taken from ten salmonid farms in Poland was sampled in 2006. Four fish species were investigated: rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, brown trout Salmo trutta (morphs fario, lacustris, and trutta), grayling Thymallus thymallus and huchen Hucho hucho. No parasites were observed on huchen. No indications of gyrodactylosis were observed, but an unexpected parasite species diversity was found. A molecular species identification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of ITS1 + 5.8S + ITS2 was utilized, with addition of morphometric methods. The most frequent parasite was a new record in Poland, G. teuchis. It was present in two molecular forms on brown trout and rainbow trout, which also carried G. derjavinoides and G. truttae. Three molecular forms of G. salaris/G. thymalli were found, the standard type ITS only on grayling. A heterozygous (or heterogenic) G. salaris type described earlier in Denmark was found in seven farms on rainbow trout, and a complementary homozygous clone which differs from the standard by three nucleotides, in two farms. This homozygous form has not been recorded earlier. The PCR-RFLP results were confirmed by sequencing ITS segment from representative specimens of each type and comparing them with all available salmonid-specific Gyrodactylus sequences in GenBank. The Polish fauna with seven different Gyrodactylus clones separated by PCR-RFLP was the most diverse reported in fish farms in any country so far.",

The hosts were collected off Cat Ba Island, Halong Bay, Gulf of Tonkin, Vietnam in May, 2009. This brings the total number of species of Rhadinorhynchus Lühe, 1911 to 38. Specimens of the first species are characterized by having 11–12 proboscis hook rows with 30–31 hooks each, large dorsal and ventral spines in the posterior field of trunk spines, large eggs (100 × 20), and subterminal gonopore in both males and females. It is further characterized by many prominent fragmented nuclei in the body wall. The 1 female of the second species has 18 proboscis hook rows with 24 hooks each, smaller eggs (62 × 17), lateral trunk spines connecting those in the anterior and the posterior fields, and subterminal female gonopore.

The hamuli and marginal hooks of G. hildae sp. nov. and G. yacatli sp. nov. differ notably from G. cichlidarum, a species commonly found on O. n. niloticus. The hooks of G. ulinganisus sp. nov., however, are morphologically similar to those of G. cichlidarum, but the two species were found to differ by 42 nucleotide substitutions (24 within the 342 bp long ITS1; 18 within the 303 bp long ITS2) and by 1 insertion/deletion. This study confirms that Nile and Mozambique tilapia harbour a number of different species of Gyrodactylus, with G. cichlidarum being the most frequently encountered and being associated with mortalities of juvenile O. n. niloticus. This study discusses the host specificity of gyrodactylids on commercial cichlid species and the potential repercussions of their movement on stocks of fish into new environments where cichlids are already present.",

This study was carried out in the Sharjah Emirate, UAE in order to accurately detect and differentiate Entamoeba histolytica, Entamoeba dispar and E. moshkovskii in fecal samples collected from the Sharjah municipality public health clinic by ELISA and nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). One hundred and twenty specimens were examined and the PCR was positive for E. histolytica, E. dispar and E. moshkovskii (collectively referred to as Entamoeba complex) in 19.2% (23 out of 120). Of those, 10% (12/120) were mono — infection with E. histolytica; 2.5% (3/120) with E. dispar; and 2.5% (3/120) E. moshkovskii. The nested PCR also detected mixed infections by both E. histolytica and E. dispar in 3.3% (4/120) and E. dispar and E. moshkovskii in 0.8% (1/120). The TechLab ELISA kit failed to detect E. histolytica in any of the E. histolytica PCR positive samples. Overall, the percentage of E. histolytica including those found in mixed infections was 13.3% (16/120). Compared to nested PCR, microscopy was found to have an overall sensitivity of 52.2% and a specificity of 75.2% for detection of Entamoeba complex. The present study indicates that E. histolytica is present in the UAE with an average incidence rate of 13.3%. However, larger studies need to be conducted in order to confirm these findings. We propose the use of PCR in both the routine diagnosis of amoebiasis and epidemiological survey in the UAE.",

Although the majority of apogonid species harboured only a single Ceratomyxa species, four were found with multiple species of Ceratomyxa. This study describes eight novel species using a combination of morphological, small subunit ribosomal DNA (SSU rDNA) and biological characters. Six Ceratomyxa species are reported from single apogonid species, while two are reported from multiple host species. Molecular data were critical in identifying several morphologically cryptic species. However, our results suggest that SSU rDNA was not capable of distinguishing all the species present in the current study system and alternative genetic markers should be investigated in the future.",

In Europe, delineation of species within the genus Radix is unresolved and, therefore, spectrum of snail hosts susceptible to trematode infections is under discussion. We used and compared three criteria for species delineation using snails collected at 43 localities. (a) Sequence analysis of ITS-2 rDNA disclosed that the collected snails belong to four species — R. auricularia (Linnaeus, 1758), R. peregra (Müller, 1774), R. lagotis (Schrank, 1803) and R. labiata (Rossmaessler, 1835) (criteria and names are based on the work of Bargues et al. 2001). Occurrence of R. peregra in the Czech Republic was confirmed by molecular data for the first time. (b) Characterization of reproductive system disclosed differences in location, size and shape of bursa copulatrix and its ductus. Unfortunately, some R. labiata specimens shared morphological features of reproductive organs with R. lagotis. (c) Statistical analysis of shell morphology proved that significant differences exist among particular species. One prediction model showed that correct classification of species may be achieved in 82-84% of cases. However, identification of individual snails in the field (without knowledge of respective snail population and use of statistical tools) still remains a complicated issue due to overlaps of shell characteristics. Concerning the role in trematode transmission, R. lagotis, R. labiata and R. peregra are susceptible to Trichobilharzia regenti. Also, successful experimental infections of R. lagotis and R. labiata by Fascioloides magna were accomplished.",

A total of 1,390 ectoparasitic flies were collected, belonging to 24 species of Streblidae and one of Nycteribiidae, parasitizing 227 bats of 15 species. Among the species found, the presence of Trichobius sp. on Lonchophylla mordax and the first occurrence of Hershkovitzia sp. on Thyroptera devivoi are highlighted. Lophostoma species presented the highest proportion of individuals with infracommunities and the highest values of parasitological indexes. The high number of bat fly species and hosts, as well as the high values for rates of parasitism and infracommunities, suggests that this area of cerrado has good shelter conditions for these species. The abundance of species and high rates of parasitism detracts from the hypothesis that a higher mean intensity of ectoparasites results from lower competition among flies for hosts in areas with lower ectoparasite species richness. Biogeographical and historical factors of host populations, besides the number of host species and individuals sampled, may contribute to species number and intensity of parasitism.",

There are few monoxenous parasites, the majority of parasites are typical for other Bovidae and Cervidae species and many are newly acquired from Cervidae. This is an evident increased trend in the parasite species richness, in both the prevalence and intensity of infections, which is associated with the bison population size, host status (captive breeding or free-ranging) and the possibility of contact with other ruminant species. In light of the changes to parasite species richness during the last decades, special emphasis shall be given to new parasite species reported in European bison, their pathogenicity and potential implications for conservation.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) and undernutrition in under-five children are a major public health concern in low and middle-income countries, contributing to childhood morbidity and disability. This study aimed to investigate the effect of intestinal parasites on the anthropometric status of outpatients in under five children. An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Assela referral hospital, Ethiopia from February 15 to March 30, 2024. Stool samples were collected from 227 children and examined using direct wet mount and formal ether concentration techniques. An Adjusted Odds Ratio analysis was done to test the association between intestinal parasitic infection and nutritional status (stunting, wasting and underweight). The prevalence of stunting, underweight, and wasting was 38(16.7%), 64(28.2%), and 59(26%), respectively. The total prevalence of parasitosis was 44(19.4%) of children infected with at least one type of intestinal parasite. The most common intestinal parasitic infections detected in the study were E. histolytica (8.4%), E. vermicularis (4.4%), and Giardia lamblia (3.5%). Residence (rural)(AOR = 2.46,CI 1.31–3.45,P = 0.02) fingernail cleanliness (not clean and also unclimbed AOR = 1.1,CI 1.1–2.3; P = 0.01 and climbed but not clean AOR = 1.22 CI 1.1–3.3;P = 0.01), parental education (unable to read and write AOR = 6.3 CI 1.3–19.1 P = 0.01 and Only able to read and write AOR = 2.91 CI 1.23–7.13;P = 0.02), deworming (lack of IPI treatment AOR = 3.1 CI 1.26–8.56 P = 0.01), water source (unprotected spring AOR = 1.21 CI 1.01–2.1 and unprotected river or stream AOR = 1.22 CI 1.04–4.3 P = 0.01) were more likely to be infected in intestinal parasites than the respective category. Undernutrition (stunting AOR = 4.1 CI 1.92–8.7; P = 0.02; underweight AOR = 8.5, CI 1.69–4.49; P = 0.01 and wasting AOR = 7.64, CI 4.1-16.64; P = 0.02) were significantly associated with intestinal parasitic infections at 5% significant level. This study indicated that intestinal parasitic infections had significant effect on nutritional status of under five children in study area. To address the problem public health interventions activities were needed like deworming programs, health education, sanitation and nutritional improvement.",

Their larvae are obligate endoparasites of equids, and their third instar larvae remain in specific areas of the gastrointestinal tract for many months. Non-equids are unsuitable hosts for Gasterophilus spp. However, their larvae have occasionally been found in the digestive tracts of carnivores and scavengers; this is known as accidental myiasis. A gray wolf (Canis lupus) hunted near a settlement in northern Kazakhstan in February 2023 was necropsied. Its stomach, which was otherwise empty, contained four cylindrical, cream-coloured maggots, approximately 15 mm long, attached to the gastric mucosa. The maggots were identified morphologically as second and third instar Gasterophilus larvae and molecularly as Gasterophilus pecorum. This is the first reported case of accidental gastric myiasis in wolves. The causative species, Gasterophilus pecorum, is a common parasite of equids in Asian countries. The larvae must have survived the ingestion process intact and remained attached to the wolf's stomach wall with cephalopharyngeal hooks for a prolonged period of time, lasting from more than half a day to several days.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Acanthamoeba spp. are microscopic single-celled protozoa commonly found in the environment, particularly in soil, water sources, and dust. These parasites are associated with serious infections such as Acanthamoeba keratitis and granulomatous amebic encephalitis. Recent epidemiological studies have highlighted a significant increase in Acanthamoeba keratitis cases. Current treatment methods are generally effective only in the early stages and show limited success when applied late, emphasizing the urgent need for more effective therapeutic and cultivation approaches. The laboratory cultivation of Acanthamoeba spp. is traditionally performed using axenic or monoxenic cultures. However, these methods have notable drawbacks, including the loss of virulence, reduced encystment capability, errors in bacterial inoculation, and time-consuming procedures. To address these limitations, nanotechnological approaches have been proposed. Nanotechnology offers innovative solutions for developing new drug formulations and diagnosing, preventing, and treating various diseases. Methods In this study, we developed humic acid-coated magnetic nanocomposites capable of adhering to the cyst wall of Acanthamoeba spp. without causing damage. Experimental results demonstrated that these nanocomposites bind with high affinity to macromolecules on the cyst wall, facilitating the aggregation of parasites in the pellet. Additionally, biologically enriched leech saliva was incorporated into the culture medium to enhance the growth rate. Leech saliva provides a rich source of organic matter and bioactive molecules that promote cell division. The addition of leech saliva resulted in a significant increase in the growth rate of Acanthamoeba spp., with maximum growth density observed at 120 h. Results These findings indicate that humic acid-coated magnetic nanocomposites and leech saliva -enriched culture media offer a promising alternative to conventional methods for the rapid and efficient cultivation of Acanthamoeba spp. Our study concludes that humic acid-coated magnetic nanocomposites effectively concentrate parasites, increasing their quantitative density, while leech saliva provides a nutrient-rich environment that stimulates trophozoite feeding and division. Conclusion This study is noteworthy for presenting an innovative and effective method for the rapid laboratory cultivation and potential treatment of Acanthamoeba spp.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Scabies is a common parasitic skin condition with significant morbidity. This study aimed to identify risk factors for treatment failure and analyze lesion distribution patterns in relation to sex, age, and comorbidities in patients with treatment-resistant scabies. Methods The study included patients with dermatologist-confirmed scabies who had received at least one treatment within the past six months without clinical improvement. Clinical, sociodemographic, and cutaneous findings were evaluated. Results A total of 246 patients were included (130 females, 52.8%; 116 males, 47.2%). Males had significantly higher rates of excoriation ( p &lt; 0.001), pustules ( p = 0.047), tunnels ( p = 0.046), and genital involvement ( p = 0.012). Nodules were more common in individuals under 18 ( p = 0.003), while excoriations predominated in those over 65 ( p &lt; 0.001). Longer pruritus duration was observed in older adults, rural residents, and patients receiving weekend home visits ( p = 0.017, p &lt; 0.001, and p = 0.011, respectively), and was associated with increased lesion severity. A threefold increase in abdominal involvement and a 3.33-fold increase in pustules were seen in patients receiving three or more treatments. Higher education (university or above) was linked to a 46% reduced risk of treatment-resistant scabies. Conclusions This study identifies key demographic and clinical risk factors associated with treatment failure in scabies and underscores the need for targeted management strategies. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first to comprehensively investigate lesion distribution and clinical patterns of resistant scabies in relation to sex, age, and comorbid conditions.",

These fishes may be definitive, second intermediate or paratenic hosts of the helminths. The most species-rich taxon is Digenea. Virtually all of these digeneans use teleosts as definitive hosts. Only one species, Otodistomum cestoides, occurs as the adult stage in skates (Chondrichthyes), with teleosts as its second intermediate host. Among 14 cestode species maturing in fishes only one, Parabothriocephalus johnstoni, occurs in a bony fish, Macrourus whitsoni, whereas the others are parasites of Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fishes). Antarctic Chondrichthyes are not infected with nematode and acanthocephalan species. Specificity to the intermediate and/or paratenic hosts of the majority of Antarctic helminths is wide, whereas that for definitive hosts is often narrower, restricted to one order or sometimes even to one or two host species. Almost all of 73 helminth species maturing in Antarctic fishes are endemics. Only 4 digenean and one nematode species are cosmopolitan or bipolar.",

Appropriate techniques for diagnosis of bovine neosporosis, both in vivo and in aborted foetuses, have been developed in the last ten years and some of them are commercially available. For diagnosis in live animals, detection of antibodies in serum or milk has been shown to be the best option both at the herd and the individual level. These techniques are excellent tools to examine N. caninum-associated abortion problems and to adopt some basic herd-control measures. Concerning foetal diagnosis, detection of compatible lesions by histological examination and parasites by PCR in brain (as well as heart and liver) are the best choices. Diagnostic criteria to distinguish foetal infection and Neospora-associated abortion are based not only on the demonstration of the parasite in the foetus but also on the extent and severity of the lesions in the foetus, foetal age and the assessment of neosporosis at the herd level. In the near future, new tools to diagnose infection should help to detect animals with parasite reactivation by testing the immune response to stage-specific antigens and lead to the development of molecular typing methods to characterise different parasite isolates. Finally, uniform diagnostic procedures need to be established between laboratories and countries in order to standardise result interpretation. The role of National or Regional Reference Laboratories is essential in countries or regions where control programmes for the disease are being developed.",

The new species are characterized mainly by the length of spicules and the length and structure of the gubernaculum, structure of the male caudal end (except for P. lagocephali), body size, location in the host and by the types of hosts. In addition, Philometra sp.

Diagnostic procedures included both microscopy and molecular methods (PCR and sequencing of the 18S rRNA gene). Microscopic examination of blood smears revealed no hematozoan infections — unlike the molecular analyses. Nine Brazilian capybaras were found to be infected with Hepatozoon canis (prevalence 64%), two of which were coinfected with a previously unknown babesid (prevalence 14%) loosely related to Theileria equi (90% 18S rRNA gene similarity according to BLAS® analysis). One jaguar and one crab-eating raccoon from Venezuela were infected by H. canis. Four of the red deer were infected with theilerids (5.7% prevalence), two with Theileria sp. and two with T. annulata. One red squirrel and three pine martens were infected with Hepatozoon sp. The isolate form the red squirrel was phylogenetically related to Hepatozoon sp. reported in Spanish bank voles, whereas those infecting the pine martens were related to Hepatozoon felis reported in Spanish cats. In conclusion, the molecular findings show that some non-canid mammals are carriers of H. canis in South America, while red deer may carry T. annulata in Europe. Small mammals in Europe appear to be unlikely hosts of H. canis and H. felis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract At present the nematode genus Rhabdochona Railliet, 1916 (Rhabdochonidae) comprises 92 possibly valid species, mostly intestinal parasites of freshwater fishes in all zoogeographical regions. Because of the absence of any phylogenetic studies using molecular methods in this nematode group, an attempt to evaluate affinities among these parasites and their zoogeography on the basis of morphological features and host-parasite relationships has been carried out. Only true definitive hosts should be considered for such evaluation. It appears that, during the evolution of Rhabdochona spp., there occur an increase in the number of anterior prostomal teeth, loss of lateral alae, the right spicule attains a boat-like shape and a dorsal barb develops on its distal tip, and the distal tip of the left spicule attains gradually a more complex structure; the eggs with a smooth surface are considered to be more primitive. Nematodes of this genus most probably originated in the region of present southern Asia at the beginning of Tertiary. Closest to the initial type appear to be members of the subgenus Globochona Moravec, 1972, from which lineages leading to the subgenera Globochonoides Moravec, 1975, Rhabdochona Railliet, 1916 and Sinonema Moravec, 1975 can be derived. The morphology of Rhabdochona spp. indicate a close relationship between the Palaearctic fauna of these nematodes with the Nearctic species, and the Oriental fauna with the Ethiopian fauna. The Neotropical species can be derived from Nearctic members of the subgenus Rhabdochona; the latter probably penetrated, along with leuciscine hosts into North America from Palaearctic Eurasia at the end of Tertiary. The distribution of Palaearctic species of Rhabdochona corresponds to faunistical complexes in the conception of ichthyologists.",

In this study, 26 populations of Gyrodactylus parasitising either O. n. niloticus or Mozambique tilapia, Oreochromis mossambicus, were sampled from fourteen countries and compared with type material of Gyrodactylus cichlidarum Paperna, 1968, Gyrodactylus niloticus (syn. of G. cichlidarum) and Gyrodactylus shariffi Cone, Arthur et Bondad-Reantaso, 1995. Representative specimens from each population were bisected, each half being used for morphological and molecular analyses. Principal component analyses (PCA) identified five distinct clusters: (1) a cluster representing G. cichlidarum collected from O. n. niloticus from 13 countries; (2) the G. shariffi paratype; (3) three specimens with pronounced ventral bar processes collected from two populations of Mexican O. n. niloticus (Gyrodactylus sp. 1); (4) four specimens collected from an Ethiopian population nominally identified as O. n. niloticus (Gyrodactylus sp. 2); (5) nine gyrodactylids from South African O. mossambicus (Gyrodactylus sp. 3). Molecular analyses comparing the sequence of the ribosomal transcribed spacer regions (ITS 1 and 2) and the 5.8S gene from the non-hook bearing half of worms representative for each population and for each cluster of parasites, confirmed the presence of G. cichlidarum in most samples analysed. Molecular data also confirmed that the DNA sequence of Gyrodactylus sp. 2 and Gyrodactylus sp. 3 (the morphologically-cryptic group of South African specimens from O. mossambicus) differed from that of G. cichlidarum and therefore represent new species; no sequences were obtained from Gyrodactylus sp. 1.

In six monitored Slovak regions the seropositivity varied between 1.11 and 3.48%. The statistically significant differences were recorded between the Košice and Prešov region. The seroprevalence of toxoplasmosis in sows (4.26%) was two times higher than that in slaughter pigs (2.06%) (OR = 2.12; 95% CI = 0.48–9.36). Presence of Toxoplasma gondii in tissues of seropositive pig isolates was confirmed by TGR1E and B1 genes and analysis of DNA polymorphism at SAG2 and ROP1 genes revealed the presence of virulent strain of genotype I in 85.7% of infected pigs and an avirulent strain (genotype II) in 14.3% of pigs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Onchocerpa lupi was first isolated from a wolf in Russia. Since then, canine ocular onchocercosis has been increasingly reported, particularly in Europe and the United States. It is thought that blackflies and midges are the vectors of transmission, and it is possible that these vectors could transmit the parasite to humans. The first human case of O. lupi in Turkey was reported in 2011. In this report we present the third human case of O. lupi infection in Turkey. Our patient was a 28-year-old male who displayed a painless, immobile mass under the conjunctiva. The mass measured 10 × 12 mm in size. Pathological examination of the surgically excised tissue was suggestive of infection by a filarial nematode. Subsequently, the parasite was identified as O. lupi through molecular analysis. All of the previously reported cases of O. lupi in both humans and dogs were more symptomatic than in our patient, Onchocerca infection should not be ruled out during the differential diagnosis of the subconjunctival and orbital cystic mass in instances where there is little to no inflammation. It is important to consider biopsy and carry out molecular analysis to identify the parasite.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Zoographical distribution of metazoan fish parasites in herring, Clupea harengus, from the Baltic Sea was analysed in order to use them as potential biological indicators. A total of 210 herring from six different sampling sites were investigated, harbouring 12 different parasite species [five digeneans (D), one cestode (C), three nematodes (N) and three acanthocephalans (A)]. The distribution of the parasite species differed according to region, with a distinct gradient of decreasing species richness towards the east of the Baltic Sea. The western localities at Kiel Bay, Rügen and Poland had the highest parasite diversity, including the marine parasite species Anisakis simplex (s.s.) (N), Brachyphallus crenatus and Hemiurus luehei (both D). The eastern localities had low parasite species richness, predominated by the freshwater digenean Diplostomum spathaceum. We could identify three different Baltic herring stocks, the spring-spawning herring of the western Baltic reaching from the Kattegat to the German and Polish coast, the stock of the central Baltic proper and the northern stock of C. harengus var. membras of the Gulf of Finland. The limited distribution of the herring parasites within the Baltic Sea enables their use as biological indicators for migration patterns and stock separation. The acanthocephalan Pomphorhynchus laevis that has already been used as an accumulation bioindicator for heavy metals was only recorded for the western herring stocks. However, the presence of mainly generalistic parasites and their uneven distribution patterns make their use as indicators for regional environmental and global change more difficult.",

    "abstract": "Malaria epidemics are increasing in East Africa since the 1980s, coincident with rising temperature and widening climate variability. A projected 1-3.5 °C rise in average global temperatures by 2100 could exacerbate the epidemics by modifying disease transmission thresholds. Future malaria scenarios for the Lake Victoria Basin (LVB) are quantified for projected climate scenarios spanning 2006-2100.Regression relationships are established between historical (1995-2010) clinical malaria and anaemia cases and rainfall and temperature for four East African malaria hotspots. The vector autoregressive moving average processes model, VARMAX (p,q,s), is then used to forecast malaria and anaemia responses to rainfall and temperatures projected with an ensemble of eight General Circulation Models (GCMs) for climate change scenarios defined by three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5).Maximum temperatures in the long rainy (March-May) and dry (June-September) seasons will likely increase by over 2.0 °C by 2070, relative to 1971-2000, under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5. Minimum temperatures (June-September) will likely increase by over 1.5-3.0 °C under RCPs 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5. The short rains (OND) will likely increase more than the long rains (MAM) by the 2050s and 2070s under RCPs 4.5 and 8.5. Historical malaria cases are positively and linearly related to the 3-6-month running means of monthly rainfall and maximum temperature. Marked variation characterizes the patterns projected for each of the three scenarios across the eight General Circulation Models, reaffirming the importance of using an ensemble of models for projections.The short rains (OND), wet season (MAM) temperatures and clinical malaria cases will likely increase in the Lake Victoria Basin. Climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies, including malaria control interventions could reduce the projected epidemics and cases. Interventions should reduce emerging risks, human vulnerability and environmental suitability for malaria transmission.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Main conclusions Green-synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticle is a promising treatment modality against parasitic infection through its powerful anthelmintic, antioxidant, healing promotion, and anti-inflammation effects. Background Nanoparticles have many properties, depending on their size, shape, and morphology, allowing them to interact with microorganisms, plants, and animals. Objectives Investigation of the therapeutic effects of green-synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) on Parascaris equorum infection in rats. Methods Thirty-six rats were divided into two divisions: the first division is noninfected groups were allocated into three groups. Group 1: Control, group 2: ZnO NPs (30 mg/kg), and group 3: ZnO NPs (60 mg/kg). The second division is infected groups were allocated into three groups. Group 1: vehicle, group 2: ZnO NPs (30 mg/kg), and group 3: ZnO NPs (60 mg/kg). Findings Ten days post-infection, two larvae per gram of liver tissue were present in the vehicle group compared to the control group. No larvae were recovered from ZnO NPs (30 mg/kg), and one larva/g.tissue from ZnO NPs (60 mg/kg)-treated groups compared to untreated infected animals. Green-synthesized ZnO NPs caused a significant decrease in liver functions, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), cholesterol, triglycerides, malondialdehyde (MDA), and nitric oxide (NO). While it caused a significant increase in hemoglobin (HB), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE), glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in infected treated rats. The histological inflammation and fibroplasia scores showed a significant enhancement during the treatment with ZnO NPs (30, 60 mg/kg) compared to the infected untreated animals that scored the highest pathological destruction score. Immunohistochemical markers of NF-κB showed a significant decrease during the treatment with ZnO NPs (30, 60 mg/kg) compared to the infected untreated animals.",

To support our morphologically based taxonomic approach, three nuclear ribosomal DNA regions (28S, ITS1 and ITS2) were sequenced and analysed to explore the geographic distribution and integrity of the putative species recovered from these widespread localities. Sequencing of the rDNA regions included multiple replicates and revealed three distinct genotypes. Two of the observed genotypes were associated with phenotypically similar specimens of Latuterus, but were each restricted to a single locality, Lizard Island, GBR or Rasdhoo Atoll, Maldives. A posteriori analysis of the associated morphotypes revealed distinct morphological differences and these consistent differences, in combination with the consistent genetic differences led to the recognition of two distinct species in the system. Caulanus is distinguished by having oral spines, caeca which open via ani at the posterior end of the body, tandem testes and uterus that extends from the posterior end of the body to the pharynx. Latuterus is distinguished by lacking oral spines, having multiple/follicular testes, a uterus that is extensive in both fore-and hindbody and vitelline follicles which are confined to the region from the pharynx to oral sucker. Caulanus thomasi sp. nov. had identical sequences for all of the rDNA regions examined from specimens recovered from all three localities, indicating that this species has a wide Indo-Pacific distribution. The species reported here are evidently restricted to Lutjanus bohar because they were never found in large numbers of other lutjanid species sampled at the same localities.",

We also report the metacercariae of two species from an atherinid fish, Atherinomorus capricornensis, from near Heron Island. Morphological analysis of the species reported here was augmented by DNA sequence analyses utilizing data from the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) 1 and 2, large subunit (LSU) and 5.8S nuclear ribosomal DNA to explore the integrity of the species and their biogeographic distributions. The analysis found strong support for the integrity of Siphoderina and found that it is the sister-taxon to Beluesca Miller et Cribb, 2007. Sequencing included multiple replicates and no intraspecific variation was observed between any of the taxa over the rDNA regions examined. Sequence data from the ITS and LSU regions were analysed with that of species of Beluesca, Caulanus Miller et Cribb, 2007, Chelediadema Miller et Cribb, 2007, Latuterus Miller et Cribb, 2007, Neometadena Hafeezullah et Siddiqi, 1970 and Retrovarium Miller et Cribb, 2007 which all also infect lutjanids or haemulids. Some closely related species of Siphoderina infect only distantly related fishes among the haemulids and lutjanids whereas others form clusters in association with clusters of closely related lutjanids. This pattern suggests a history of some co-evolutionary divergence together with significant host switching. Pseudallacanthochasmus Velasquez, 1961 is considered a synonym of Siphoderina and the new combinations S. grandispinus (Velasquez, 1961) n. comb. and S. magnivesiculum (Gaevskaya et Aljoshkina, 1985) n. comb. are proposed. As a result of the new species described here and these new combinations, Siphoderina now contains 43 species, making it by far the largest genus of the Cryptogonimidae.",

In order to solve the problem, we tested some methods which might be suitable for cercarial differentiation. Fourteen isolates of three Trichobilharzia species (T. szidati, T. franki, T. regenti) occurring sympatrically in Central Europe were used. Dimensions of individual cercariae do not represent a useful criterion for identification, because the intraspecific variability exceeds the interspecific one. On the other hand, chaetotaxy appears a promising way for discrimination, although some sensory papillae do not stain sufficiently with silver nitrate. The papillary pattern (i.e. number and relative position of papillae) is specific for all Trichobilharzia species studied by us. Therefore, we compiled an identification key for the three Trichobilharzia species. In addition, we tried to find species-specific surface saccharide epitopes; none of the labeled lectin probes can be used as a speciesspecific marker.",

Although “Sanguinicolidae von Graff, 1907” (or. Graff, 1907.) has been a widely-accepted family-group name for the fish blood flukes subsequent to Yamaguti’s 1954 and 1958 synoptical publications (“Systema Helminthum”), a critical examination of the relevant literature, much of it published in German during 1900 through 1926, reveals that “Aporocotylidae Odhner, 1912” is the earliest available family-group name for these flukes. The name Aporocotylidae, moreover, was in wide usage by alpha taxonomists before 1954 and by several authors between 1954 and the present time. We speculate that the recent long-standing uncertainty about the earliest available family-group name primarily stems from the (1) logistics of Ludwig von Graff’s tome published in 1904–1908, (2) bibliographic confusion between that work and another Graff work published in 1907 (both of which treat Sanguinicola but not Aporocotyle), (3) initial ambiguity regarding the phylogenetic relatedness of the first four aporocotylid species that were named, (4) lack of consensus on the status of Aporocotylidae and Sanguinicolidae and the genera included within them, and (5) misleading application of. Graff, 1907. to Sanguinicolidae by Poche in 1926, Fuhrmann in 1928, Yamaguti in 1954 and 1958, and subsequent review articles that treated fish blood flukes. Under the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN, Article 8.3), “Sanguinicolidae” was not made available by Graff because he disclaimed the name in the same, and only, work wherein he used the name (ICZN, Article 8.3). Sanguinicolidae was first made available in 1926 by Poche, who referenced Graff’s 1907 work. Hence, “Poche, 1926” comprises the correct authority and date for that family-group name, not “von Graff, 1907” or “Graff, 1907”. Since we presently accept only a single family for all fish blood flukes and abide by the Principal of Priority (ICZN, Article 23), we herein regard Sanguinicolidae Poche, 1926 as a junior subjective synonym of Aporocotylidae Odhner, 1912.",

However, very little is known about the occurrence of these parasites and their impact on the hosts in Greenland waters. During a survey in 2005, stomach sample of 227 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and 64 Greenland cod (Gadus ogac) was collected in Godthaab and Sisimiut fiord systems in West Greenland waters. All cod were dissected for stomach contents and anisakid nematodes were removed from the visceral cavity. Third stage larvae (L3) of three anisakid species were found, including Contracaecum osculatum (Rudolphi, 1802), Anisakis simplex (Rudolphi, 1809) and Hysterothylacium aduncum (Rudolphi, 1802). Molecular identification by PCR-RFLP indicated the presence of A. simplex s.s. and the sibling species C. osculatum B and C. The prevalence of infection by C. osculatum was higher in Greenland cod (84.3%) than in Atlantic cod (73.9%) whereas the prevalence of A. simplex showed an opposite pattern (Greenland cod 8.3%; Atlantic cod 24.2%). Only one G. morhua (1.0%) was infected by H. aduncum. No gender specific difference in both nematode species regarding prevalence of infection and mean infection intensity was evident, and there was no relationship between fish condition and the intensity of nematode infections. Standardised for size, capelin-eating cod were in better condition and more heavily infected than fish subsisting on alternative prey at the point of collection. Hence, nematode infections in the two gadids seem governed in part by feeding behaviour, and capelin appears a significant source of larval anisakids.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study presents data from a molecular survey of the species of the genus Culicoides from the region of Kalimok Field Station (NE Bulgaria) and haemosporidian parasites occurring in them in order to investigate the host-parasite specificity of haemosporidians to their dipteran vectors. The identification of Culicoides spp. was carried out by morphological and molecular-genetic methods. We collected and analysed 230 individuals of the genus Culicoides. Nine species were found. Eight species were identified morphologically; Culicoides obsoletus, C. riethi, C. newsteadi, C. circumscriptus, C. festivipennis, C. punctatus, C. pictipennis and C. puncticollis. The ninth species might be classified as either of C. nubeculosus or C. riethi and its identification needs additional investigations. The total prevalence of Haemoproteus in the examined biting midges was 2.17%. Three individuals of C. pictipennis were infected with the Haemoproteus lineage TURDUS2 (prevalence 16.67%), a common parasite of thrushes (Turdidae). Two individuals of C. circumscriptus contained Haemoproteus lineages (prevalence 2.78%); these were the lineage HAWF2 (previously reported from Coccothraustes coccothraustes) and a new lineage CULCIR1 not previously reported in the literature.",

Minimal prevalence rate for Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. in ticks for the urban park Bělský les was found to be 13.8% (17.6% in males, 17.8% in females and 11.7% in nymphs), similarly for the natural site Proskovice was minimal prevalence 15% (12.5% in males, 20% in females and 14.9% in nymphs). Six proven human pathogenic genomic species have been recorded in the study: B. afzelii, B. garinii, B. burgdorferi s.s., B. valaisiana, B. lusitaniae, and B. spielmanii. Emerging B. spielmanii was detected for the first time in Ixodes ricinus ticks in the region. Our results highlight the need for surveillance of zoonotic tick-borne pathogens even in urban areas.",

Five new occurrences were recorded for the state of Minas Gerais, increasing the range for bat flies Anatrichobius passosi, Paraeuctenodes similis, Basilia juquiensis, Basilia producta and for mite Periglischrus vargasi. Moreover, two new species of mites were recorded for Brazil (P. bakeri and Macronyssus aff. leislerianus).

To date, two Trichinella species are known to be etiological agents of disease among domestic animals and wildlife in Poland: T. spiralis and T. britovi. In the last decades, since the administration of an oral vaccination against rabies, the red fox population in Poland has increased exponentially. The study area covers the Nowy Targ region: a mountainous area (585-1138 m above the sea) in southern Poland. Of 24 red foxes examined in the study, four were infected with Trichinella isolates: three were identified as T. britovi and one as T. pseudospiralis. The muscle of red foxes infected with T. britovi harboured 2.75, 3.11, 4.4 LPG and with T. pseudospiralis 0.36 LPG. Trichinella larvae were identified at species level by genomic and mitochondrial multiplex PCR, the products of which were sequenced for comparison with other sequences available in GenBank. The sequences obtained from the Polish T. pseudospiralis isolate, deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers JQ809660.1 and JQ809661.1, matched sequences already published in GenBank. Sequence comparison showed a 100% match with the large subunit ribosomal RNA gene of T. pseudospiralis isolate ISS 013, and a 96-95% match with those of T. pseudospiralis isolates ISS 141 and ISS 470. This is the first report of the identification of T. pseudospiralis larvae from red fox in Poland.",

    "abstract": "Ornamental fish, Xiphophorus maculatus, were imported from Singapore to Denmark for distribution to local aquarists. Importers observed lethargic and erratic swimming patterns among fish and forwarded a total of 30 fish for pathological examination to a university diagnostic service. All fish were diagnosed infected with encysted Centrocestus sp. metacercariae in gills (prevalence of 100% and mean intensity of 454.5 ± 161.9 parasites per fish). Metacercariae were identified by morphological and molecular methods. Cysts (mean length 163.3 ± 13.7 μm and mean width 113.3 ± 10.6 μm) contained a bent metacercaria with an X-shaped excretory bladder. PCR amplification of a rDNA region (5.8S rRNA gene, ITS-2, 28S rRNA gene) and subsequent sequencing confirmed the diagnosis. Metacercariae were found in gill filaments adjacent to the cartilage associated with cartilage hypertrophy, epithelial and mucous cell hyperplasia, clubbing and lamellar fusion. Host cell encapsulation of cysts comprised several layers of leucocytes, chondroblast-like and fibroblast like cells. The observations raise concerns with regard to veterinary inspection and quarantine procedures. The zoonotic potential of these trematodes and a possible spread of the parasites in natural habitats in Europe should be regarded as a public health issue. So far, several cases of human infections have been reported only in Asia, but the potential intermediate host snail, Melanoides tuberculata, has been recorded in Germany. Accordingly, establishment of the parasite in Europe with climate changes should be considered a risk.",

There are reliably known finds of 29 species of helminths: Monogenea - 1, Trematoda - 21, Nematoda - 7. Trematodes Gorgodera asiatica Pigulevsky, 1945, Paralepoderma cloacicola (Luhe, 1909), mtc. and nematodes Icosiella neglecta (Diesing, 1851) were observed for the first time in a given host on the territory of Russia and the Volga Basin. Six species of worms make the basis of helminth fauna: nematodes Rhabdias bufonis, Oswaldocruzia filiformis, Neoxysomatium brevicaudatum and Cosmocerca ornata, trematode Haplometra cylindracea and monogenea Polystoma integerrimum. These six species are the most common and widespread parasites of the brown frog. For each species of helminths there is the following information included: taxonomic position, localization, area of detection, biology, definitive hosts, geographic distribution, the degree of host-specificity.",

    "abstract": "Toxocariasis has been highlighted as a potentially important neglected infection of poverty in developed countries that experience substantive health disparities such as the United States. An association between Toxocara infection and lung function, in concert with a relatively high prevalence of infection, may mark an important mechanism by which this infection could contribute significantly to the differential morbidity across different socioeconomic groups and landscapes. To assess the potential relevance of this infection in a dense urban environment, we measured the association between forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV₁) and serology diagnosed Toxocara infection in a sample of US-born New York City residents. We identified a significant independent association between Toxocara infection and lung function, wherein those with previous Toxocara infection had a 236.9 mL reduced FEV₁ compared to those without Toxocara infection even after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, level of education, smoking status, body mass index, and pet ownership. These findings from New York City corroborate similar findings in a national sample and, while the cross-sectional data preclude a direct causal relationship, this study identifies a potentially important neglected infection in a dense urban landscape.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Leishmaniasis is a neglected disease with high prevalence and incidence in tropical and subtropical areas. Existing drugs are limited due to cost, toxicity, declining efficacy and unavailability in endemic places. Drug repurposing has established as an efficient way for the discovery of drugs for a variety of diseases. Purpose The objective of the present work was testing the antileishmanial activity of thioridazine, an antipsychotic agent with demonstrated effect against other intracellular pathogens. Methods The cytotoxicity for mouse peritoneal macrophages as well as the activity against Leishmania amazonensis , Leishmania mexicana and Leishmania major promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes, as well as in a mouse model of cutaneous leishmaniasis, were assessed. Results Thioridazine inhibited the in vitro proliferation of promastigotes (50% inhibitory concentration—IC 50 —values in the range of 0.73 µM to 3.8 µM against L. amazonensis , L. mexicana and L. major ) and intracellular amastigotes (IC 50 values of 1.27 µM to 4.4 µM for the same species). In contrast, in mouse peritoneal macrophages, the 50% cytotoxic concentration was 24.0 ± 1.89 µM. Thioridazine inhibited the growth of cutaneous lesions and reduced the number of parasites in the infected tissue of mice. The dose of thioridazine that inhibited lesion development by 50% compared to controls was 23.3 ± 3.1 mg/kg and in terms of parasite load, it was 11.1 ± 0.97 mg/kg. Conclusions Thioridazine was effective against the promastigote and intracellular amastigote stages of three Leishmania species and in a mouse model of cutaneous leishmaniasis, supporting the potential repurposing of this drug as an antileishmanial agent.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The in vivo efficacy of ultrasonicated Rosmarinus officinalis ethanolic extract (UROEE) and its chitosan-loaded nanoparticles (UROEE-CsNPs) was investigated as a dietary prophylactic agent and as a therapeutic treatment against Eimeria tenella infected broiler chickens. Methods Chickens were infected with 4 × 10 4 E. tenella oocysts at 21 days old for primary infection and with 8 × 10 4 oocysts at 35 days old for secondary infection. Eleven experimental groups were conducted. Dietary addition of 100 mg/kg UROEE and 20 mg/kg for CsNPs as well as UROEE-CsNPs were included for prophylactic groups from day 1 to 42. The same doses were used for therapeutic treatment groups for 5 constitutive days. Oocyst output in feces was counted. Histopathological and immunohistochemical studies were conducted. Gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines as IFN-γ, IL-1β and IL-6 as well as anti-inflammatory cytokines as IL-10 and TGF-β4 was analyzed using semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. Results The results showed an efficacy of UROEE, CsNPs and UROEE-CsNPs in reduction of oocyst excretion and improving the cecal tissue architecture. CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes protein expression were reduced. E. tenella infection lead to upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines as IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-6 and anti-inflammatory cytokines as TGF-β4 following primary infection, while their expression was downregulated following secondary infection. Conclusion The dietary prophylactic additives and therapeutic treatments with UROEE, CsNPs and UROEE-CsNPs could decrease the inflammatory response to E. tenella as indicated by oocyst output reduction, histopathological improvements, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells protein expression reduction as well as reducing mRNA expression levels of the tested cytokines following primary and secondary infections. Consequently, these results will help to develop better-combating strategies for the control and prevention of coccidiosis on poultry farms as a dietary prophylactic agent or as a therapeutic treatment.

Over the years, a number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of chagasic tissue lesions, all of which have faced some criticism or been received with skepticism. This article excludes the autoimmunity hypothesis for Chagas disease because it has been extensively reviewed elsewhere, and summarizes the various alternative hypotheses that have been advanced over the years. For each of these hypotheses, an outline of its main tenets and key findings that support them is presented. This is followed by the results and comments that have challenged them and the caveats that stand on their way to wider acceptance. It is hoped that this writing will draw attention to our shortcomings in understanding the pathogenesis of Chagas disease, which, unfortunately, continues to figure among the most serious health problems of the American continent.",

Spermiogenesis follows the characteristic caryophyllidean type and is initiated by the formation of a differentiation zone. This area, delimited at its base by a ring of arching membranes and bordered by cortical microtubules, contains two centrioles associated with typical striated rootlets with a reduced intercentriolar body between them. The apical area of the differentiation zone exhibits electron-dense material that is present only during the early stages of spermiogenesis. Only one of the centrioles develops into a free flagellum that grows at an angle of &gt;90° in relation to the cytoplasmic extension. Spermiogenesis is also characterized by a flagellar rotation and a proximodistal fusion of the flagellum with the cytoplasmic extension. The most interesting features observed in W virilis are the presence of a reduced, very narrow intercentriolar body and the unique type of flagellar rotation &gt;90°. Results are compared with those described in two caryophyllideans, Glaridacris catostomi Cooper, 1920 and Khawia armeniaca (Cholodkovski, 1915). Contrary to the original report of Świderski and Mackiewicz (2002), that flagellar rotation has never been observed in spermiogenesis of G. catostomi, re-assessment of their description and illustrations leads us to conclude that flagellar rotation must logically occur in that species. The value of various morphological features of sperm in phylogenetic inference is discussed.",

The escape from the negative effects associated with these natural enemies is commonly employed as an explanation for the success and expansion of invasive species, which is termed the enemy release hypothesis (ERH). In this study, nested PCR techniques and microscopy were used to determine the prevalence and intensity (respectively) of Plasmodium spp. and Haemoproteus spp. in introduced house sparrows and native urban birds of central Brazil. Generalized linear mixed models were fitted by Laplace approximation considering a binomial error distribution and logit link function. Location and species were considered as random effects and species categorization (native or non-indigenous) as fixed effects. We found that native birds from Brazil presented significantly higher parasite prevalence in accordance with the ERH. We also compared our data with the literature, and found that house sparrows native to Europe exhibited significantly higher parasite prevalence than introduced house sparrows from Brazil, which also supports the ERH. Therefore, it is possible that house sparrows from Brazil might have experienced a parasitic release during the process of introduction, which might also be related to a demographic release (e.g. release from the negative effects of parasites on host population dynamics).",

In particular, the aim was to evaluate the contribution of both environmental variability and the structure of fox population (extrinsic and intrinsic factors, respectively) in shaping the structure and composition of the intestinal helminth communities. To identify the influence of the characteristics of the host (i.e. age and sex) together with extrinsic factors (year, site, season, and altitude of collection) on number of species, total load per fox, prevalence and abundance of each parasite species, general linear models were performed. Fifteen helminth species have been detected in the intestine of 545 infected animals (84.5%) with a total of 17,144 parasites collected. The analysis of factors influencing both prevalence and abundance of infection of the parasite species revealed the preponderance of extrinsic factors on intrinsic ones. In particular, geographical areas influenced prevalence and abundance of every parasite species, showing high spatial variability. The lower influence of host factors may suggest that, in this case, host dynamics play a trivial role with respect to spatial variability in determining parasite abundance. These results pointed out high prevalence of intestinal helminth infections in the Italian Alpine fox, confirmed the typical composition of parasite fauna within fox populations, underlined local differences in the structure and composition of the helminth communities. Moreover, this study highlights the major role of extrinsic factors vs intrinsic ones.",

Some clones differed from standard ITS only by ≤ 4 nucleotides, but they belonged to a mtDNA clade that differed from the Northern European lineages of G. salaris by d MCL = 0.266 ± 0.108 (maximum composite likelihood distance). The divergence of d MCL = 0.013 ± 0.005 within the alien mtDNA clade suggested introgression from an unknown maternal ancestor into the G. salaris Malmberg genome 137 to 57 kyr ago (or, less probably, repeated introgression). A comparable modern hybrid was detected based on permanently heterozygous ITS (28 bp/1264 = 2.2%) in a clone that is widespread throughout Finnish rainbow trout farms. This was a F1 hybrid of maternal G. pomeraniae Kuusela, Ziętara et Lumme (on roach, Rutilus rutilus (L.)) and G. lavareti Malmberg (on whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus (L.)). The mtDNA of the parental species differed by d MCL = 0.290 ± 0.130. The observations emphasize that both nuclear and maternally-inherited DNA markers are necessary to characterize sexually-produced lineages or clones of Gyrodactylus. The hybridization events demonstrated predict incongruence of mitochondrial vs. nuclear gene trees, i.e., reticulate evolution in species trees.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In Europe, Serbia ranks among countries with a high prevalence of Trichinella infection in pigs, which continues to be a serious human health problem. While in some Balkan countries, more than one Trichinella species/genotype has been described in both the sylvatic and domestic cycles, these data are lacking for Serbia. To date, only a few Serbian isolates of Trichinella have been genetically specified, and all were classified as T. spiralis. Although transmission of Trichinella from domestic pigs to wildlife could be assumed, neither the infection status nor the species of Trichinella circulating among wildlife in Serbia has been investigated. This study shows the presence of two Trichinella species, T. spiralis and T. britovi, in wild animals originating from five districts in Serbia, where Trichinella infections in domestic pigs and humans have been recorded. Trichinella spiralis was detected in jackals (n = 3), red foxes (n = 2) and a wild cat (n = 1). We also established that wolves (n = 4) and red foxes (n = 2) serve as sylvatic reservoirs for T. britovi. This is the first report on the presence of T. britovi in Serbia.",

A total of 4,725 gastropods were examined. Six species of digenean parasitising four snail species were found; four of them were registered for first time: Maritrema sp. 1 (Microphallidae) in Crepidula dilatata (Calyptraeidae), Parorchis sp. (Philophtalmidae) and sporocyst of Renicolidae in Trophon geversianus (Muricidae), and Diphterostomum sp. (Zoogonidae) in Buccinanops globulosus (Nassariidae). Two other species were found in Siphonaria lessoni (Siphonariidae): Maritrema sp. 2 and Hemiuridae. One snail species, Tegula patagonica (Trochidae) was not parasitised. These gastropods act as first intermediate host, and C. dilatata, S. lessoni and B. globulosus also frequently host metacercariae within the sporocyst. Overall prevalences varied from 0.16% of Diphterostomum in the intertidal population of B. globulosus to 33.45% of Maritrema sp. 1 in C. dilatata.",

(Philometridae), is described from male and female specimens found in the ovary of the sin croaker, Johnius dussumieri (Cuvier) (Perciformes, Sciaenidae), in the Arabian Gulf, off the southern coast of Iraq. Based on light and scanning electron microscopical examination, the new species differs from all other gonad-infecting Philometra spp. with dorsal lamella-like structures on the distal tip of the gubernaculum in having a dorsal bipartite protuberance formed by two subdorsal lamellated parts separated from each other by a smooth longitudinal field. This gubernaculum structure is unique among all philometrids. Other distinguishing features include the structure of the male tail, number (6 pairs) and arrangement of genital papillae and the length of spicules (102–153 μm). From eight congeneric, gonad-infecting species with unknown males, the new species can be distinguished by some morphological and biometrical features found in gravid females (absence of caudal projections, length of oesophagus, moderately developed anterior oesophageal inflation, length of first-stage larvae) by the host type (fish family) and geographical distribution. Philometra johnii sp. nov. is the fourth known philometrid species recorded from marine waters of Iraq.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tumor-associated immune system cells secrete protease and cytokines that can inhibit the immune response. In particular, T-cell effector functions could be inhibited, potentially causing an increase in parasitic infestations. Demodex species are common inhabitants of normal hair follicles. Humans are the specific host for two species Demodex folliculorum and D. brevis. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and infestation of D. folliculorum and D. brevis in patients with cancer. In the present study, 101 patients with cancer were selected from among patients who were diagnosed and treated for cancer. The cancer patients were divided into four groups according to cancer type. Slides were examined for parasites using light microscopy at magnifications of ×40 and ×100. Infestation was defined as having at least five living parasites/cm2 of skin. The ages of the patients with cancer ranged between 38 and 82 years, with a mean of 65.5±10.1 years. It was determined that 77 of the 101 (76.2%) cancer patients were positive for Demodex species. Infestation was positive in 18 (47.4%) of the 38 cases in the breast cancer group, 7 (29.2%) of the 24 cases in the lung cancer group, 5 (18.5%) of the 27 cases in the gastrointestinal system cancer group, and 2 (16.7%) of the 12 cases in the urogenital system cancer group. Results showed that the rate of Demodex species infestation was higher in patients with breast cancer. Thus, cancer — and particularly breast cancer — is a risk factor for Demodex species infestation.",

Two hundred and thirty seven cattle suspected of suffering from theileriosis were investigated for the presence of Theileria annulata in the blood smears and any tick species on their body. In this study, 402 ticks were obtained from 99 cattle. The examination of 402 ticks by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers derived from the gene encoding heat shock protein70 (Hsp70) revealed that 39.9% of Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum, 3.5% of H. asiaticum asiaticum, and 18.2% H. anatolicum excavatum, were infected with T. annulata. The results suggest that H. a. anatolicum may play a major role in transmission of T. annulata infection in Iran. Finally, digestion of the PCR products of T. annulata with two different restriction enzymes produced only a single pattern.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum are closely related protozoan parasites, they share many common hosts, and can cause neurological diseases in dogs. Dogs can have close contacts with humans and livestock and therefore they can act as reservoirs of these parasites. The aim of this study was to survey the seroprevalence of antibodies against T. gondii and N. caninum and their co-infection rate in dogs in Korea. In total, sera from 553 domestic dogs were collected from different breeds, sexes, and ages of dogs from nine provinces across the country of Korea during 2006 and 2007. The presence of antibodies against T. gondii and N. caninum was analyzed using the latex agglutination test (LAT) with a cut-off value of 1:32, and the indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) using a serum titer of 1:100. In the total dog population, 71 (12.8%) dogs were positive for anti-T. gondii antibodies and only 20 (3.6%) were positive for anti-N. caninum antibodies. Relatively higher seropositive frequencies of antibodies against T. gondii (20.1%) and N. caninum (4.9%) were detected in the dog population from the Gyeonggi. A higher proportion of animals seropositive for anti-T. gondii antibodies was found in stray dog populations as compared to household dog populations: 18.5% (59/319) vs 5.1% (12/234), respectively. The Chi-square tests revealed significant differences in the seropositive frequencies of antibodies against T. gondii between stray and household dogs in the total population (p&lt;0.0001), and in dogs from the Gyeonggi (p&lt;0.01). No significant differences were observed for the presence of antibodies against T. gondii or N. caninum when compared across the sex or age (p&gt;0.05). The first serological survey on antibodies against both T. gondii and N. caninum parasites across the entire country showed that co-infection was not common in these canine populations with a seropositive level of 0.72%. The significantly higher positive frequency of T. gondii antibodies in stray dogs in both, Gyeonggi and in the total dog populations suggests that further investigation on the seroprevalence of parasites should focus on stray dogs.",

The primers were used in a multiplex PCR to detect parasite DNA in blood samples from cattle. There was no cross reactions with B. ovata, B. major, B. sp. Kashi, Theileria annulata, T. sergenti, T. sinensis or normal bovine DNA. The sensitivity of multiplex PCR assay was 1 pg and 10 pg DNA for B. bigemina and B. bovis, respectively. A total of 260 field blood samples collected from cattle in five provinces of China were analyzed by multiplex PCR and light microscopy. PCR testing revealed that 7.3% (19/260) and 5.8% (15/260) of cattle were positive for B. bigemina and B. bovis and 1.2% (3/260) of cattle were co-infected with B. bigemina and B. bovis. Using light microscopy, 2.3% (6/260) and 1.5% (4/260) of cattle were infected by B. bigemina and B. bovis, respectively, and no co-infection was found. The results showed that the multiplex PCR developed in the present study could be an alternative diagnostic tool for the detection of B. bovis and B. bigemina infection in cattle.",

Because cockroaches are generally infected by thelastomatid nematodes, they are being distributed around the world with their parasitic nematodes. Nothing is known about parasitic nematode species in P. fuliginosa differences, or similarity of the parasite's population structures between the different countries of the host cockroaches. Here we investigated the P. fuliginosa invasive to Japan and found that 100% of individuals were infected with one nematode species. According to the morphology and the sequence of the D2/D3 expansion segment of the 28S ribosomal RNA gene, we identified the parasite as Leidynema appendiculata. This nematode reproduced by haplodiploidy and its developmental timing under various conditions is quite divergent. Their population in the hindgut of P. fuliginosa was controlled with a few adult females and a male. This is the first report of the thelastomatid nematode isolated from the smokybrown cockroach, and is the basis for our future research examining the origin, distribution route and immigration history of the cockroach and the impact of L. appendiculata on native Japanese cockroach species.",

Ecological aspects of monogenean fauna of the moggel Labeo umbratus (Smith 1841) and the Orange River mudfish Labeo capensis (Smith 1841), as recorded during both winter and summer sampling surveys, are reported here. Fish were collected using gill nets, euthanized and gills removed and examined to both quantify parasite numbers and distribution on the gills. Results obtained support the hypothesis that gill site preference is not due to active choice for a particular attachment site, but rather a result of water flow over gills during respiration in conjunction with fish behaviour and habitat use. Interaction between individual elements investigated (temperature effects, parasite population dynamics and host population dynamics) may be largely responsible for seasonal differences in infection statistics of monogenean parasites. Such interactions should be investigated in future large scale ecological studies, in combination with experimental studies, to further elucidate these effects.",

(only females) from the cloudy grouper E. erythrurus (Valenciennes). Philometra indica is mainly characterized by the length of spicules 192–195 μm and the gubernaculum 84 μm, the distal tip of the gubernaculum without a dorsal protuberance, and by the presence of five pairs of caudal papillae. Philometra tropica is mainly characterized by the spicules conspicuously ventrally distended at their posterior halves, the distal tip of the gubernaculum with a dorsal protuberance, and the presence of three pairs of caudal papillae.",

Due to its zoonotic potential, it is important to know the frequency of this parasite in companion animals. The aim of this study was to determine current epidemiological status of G. duodenalis in household dogs and cats. Methods In this study, 293 fecal samples from pet dogs and cats were collected from January 2017 to July 2019 and tested for G. duodenalis by PCR (using β-giardin gene). The animals were divided into groups depending on their age, breed and fecal consistency. Results The examination allowed for detection of G. duodenalis in 6.0% of canine and 3.9% of feline fecal samples. The highest frequency was revealed in young (under one-year old) dogs. Sequencing confirmed the presence of assemblages C and D in dogs and A and F in cats. Conclusion The study showed current frequency of G. duodenalis in dogs and cats and also revealed the occurrence of host-specific assemblages as well as zoonotic assemblage A.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium resistance to antimalarial drugs is an obstacle to the elimination of malaria in endemic areas. This situation is particularly dramatic for Africa, which accounts for nearly 92% of malaria cases worldwide. Drug pressure has been identified as a key factor in the emergence of antimalarial drug resistance. Indeed, this pressure is favoured by several factors, including the use of counterfeit forms of antimalarials, inadequate prescription controls, poor adherence to treatment regimens, dosing errors, and the increasing use of other forms of unapproved antimalarials. This resistance has led to the replacement of chloroquine (CQ) by artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) which are likely to become ineffective in the coming years due to the uncontrolled use of Artemisia annua in the sub-Saharan African region for malaria prevention and COVID-19. The use of Artemisia annua for the prevention of malaria and COVID-19 could be an important factor in the emergence of resistance to Artemisinin-based combination therapies.",

Here, we describe the implementation of a freely available computational tool, Machine Learning Synergy Predictor (MLSyPred©), to predict potential synergy in antimalarial drug combinations. Methods The MLSyPred© synergy prediction method extracts molecular fingerprints from the drugs’ biochemical structures to use as features and also cleans and prepares the raw data. Five machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support vector machine, Ada Boost, and Gradient Boost) were implemented to build prediction models. Implementation and application of the MLSyPred© tool were tested using datasets from 1540 combinations of 79 drugs and compounds biologically evaluated in pairs for three strains of Plasmodium falciparum (3D7, HB3, and Dd2). Results The best prediction models were obtained using Logistic Regression for antimalarials with the strains Dd2 and HB3 (0.81 and 0.70 AUC, respectively) and Random Forest for antimalarials with 3D7 (0.69 AUC). The MLSyPred© tool yielded 45% precision for synergistically predicted antimalarial drug combinations that were annotated and biologically validated, thus confirming the functionality and applicability of the tool. Conclusion The MLSyPred© tool is freely available and represents a promising strategy for discovering potential synergistic drug combinations for further development as novel antimalarial therapies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Trematode infections of the genus Schistosoma can induce physiological and behavioral changes in intermediate snail hosts. This is because the parasite consumes essential resources necessary for the host's survival, prompting hosts to adapt their behavior to maintain some level of fitness before parasite-induced mortality occurs. Methods In this study, the reproductive and biochemical parameters of Biomphalaria alexandrina and Bulinus truncatus were examined during the cercareal shedding stage of infection with Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium , respectively, compared with controls. Results The study revealed an infection rate of 34.7% for S. mansoni and 30.4% for S. haematobium . In B. alexandrina infected with S. mansoni , a survival rate of 65.2% was recorded, along with a mean prepatent period of 30.3 ± 1.41 days, a mean shedding duration of 14.2 ± 0.16 days, and a mean lifespan of 44.1 ± 0.24 days. Meanwhile, in B. truncatus infected with S. haematobium , a survival rate of 56.4% was observed, with a mean prepatent period of 44.3 ± 1.41 days, a mean shedding duration of 22.6 ± 2.7 days, and a mean lifespan of 66.9 ± 1.6 days. Feeding increased in both infected species of snails, while the net reproductive rate (Ro) of the infected snails decreased. Total antioxidant (TAO) and lipid peroxidation activity increased in the two infected snail species during shedding, while Glutathione- S -transferase levels decreased. Lipid peroxidase activity and nitrogen oxide levels significantly decreased in infected B. alexandrina and increased in infected Bulinus. Steroid hormone levels were elevated in infected Biomphalaria, whereas they were reduced in infected Bulinus . Comet assay parameters showed an increase in the two infected genera after infection compared to control snails, indicating genotoxic damage and histopathological damage was observed. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that infection with larva species diverse biochemical, hormonal, genotoxic, and histopathological changes in the tissues responsible for fecundity and reproduction in B . alexandrina and B. truncates comparing with controls.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The aim of this study was the comparative analysis of the parasite communities of new populations of invasive pumpkinseed ( Lepomis gibbosus ) in western Ukraine with pumpkinseed from Czechia, where populations have rapidly expanded over the last two decades. Methods Sampling took place at three localities in the western part of Ukraine (i.e. Dobrotvir Reservoir (Vistula basin), Burshtyn Reservoir (Dniester basin), Mynai Pond (Danube basin)) and four in Czechia (i.e. Oxbow D2, Heršpický Pond (Danube basin), and Kolín oxbow and Římov Reservoir (Elbe basin). Results In total, 11 parasite taxa were recorded in Ukraine and 17 in Czechia. Four species were co-introduced from North America with their host, i.e. the myxosporean Myxobolus dechtiari , the monogeneans Onchocleidus dispar and Onchocleidus similis , and metacercariae of a trematode Posthodiplostomum centrarchi . High dominance indices were related to a high abundance of co-introduced parasites, i.e. O. similis in Mynai pond and P. centrarchi in Dobrotvir Reservoir. Overall abundance of acquired parasites was generally low. Conclusion This study shows that parasite communities in recently established pumpkinseed populations in the western part of Ukraine and Czechia are less diverse than those established in Europe for decades. The generally low parasite load in these new populations may play an important role in their ability to successfully establish and create strong populations by providing a competitive advantage over local species.",

The 557 hosts analysed in this study were trapped seasonally between autumn 2002 and summer 2005 across 6 habitat types. Twelve helminth species were detected among which, Taenia parva larvae, Angiostrongylus dujardini, Heligmosomoides polygyrus, Syphacia stroma and S. frederici constitute the component species, accounting for 98.7% of all worms. H. polygyrus was the most prevalent helminth parasite. Species richness varied according to habitat and season. The highest species richness was found in sand dunes during winter whereas the lowest was detected along lake margins also during the winter. Some differences in prevalence and mean intensity values were found in relation to year (T. parva larvae and H. polygyrus), habitat (A. dujardini), season (T. parva larvae, H. polygyrus, A. dujardini and S. stroma) and host sex (T. parva larvae and S. stroma). These differences are discussed both in view of the host’s biology and habitat characteristics.",

Most parasites attach their haptors to the proximal region of the gill filament (primary gill lamellae), while few specimens were seen attached to the distal region. Attachment of the haptor was achieved mainly by the blade of the hamuli, but no evidence was found indicating the participation of marginal hooklets in the attachment. The hamuli of M. clarii penetrate into the interlamellar epithelium of the gill tissue. Some evidences were found to indicate that M. clarii may also utilize suction force during haptoral attachment. The pathological effects of M. clarii are manifested by breakdown of the coating epithelium, necrosis of the epithelial cells, vacuolations inside and outside the host cells, fusion of the gill lamellae, rupture of blood capillaries, infiltration of erythrocytes and degeneration and fibrosis of the interlamellar epithelium. The host response includes the appearance of lymphocytes, mucoid secretions and hyperplasia of the tissue at the site of attachment.",

Analyses of nuclear 18S sequences indicate no detectable differentiation between these genotypes, but may be due to expected differences in the resolution of these genetic markers.

However, the diameter of the individual muscle fibres increases distinctly in the adult worms. The general pattern of 5-HT IR fibres in cercariae, metacercariae and adult O. felineus remains the same. Despite the large increase in body size, the number of 5-HT IR neurones remains almost the same in the cercariae and metacercariae and only a modest increase in number of neurones was observed in the adult worms.

Sixteen different parasite species were found, most of them belonging to the Digenea (6 species) and Nematoda (6). Twelve new host and 11 new locality records were established, and 8 deep-sea generalists and 5 deep-sea specialists were found. Twelve adult and 3 larval parasites occurred, with Allopodocotyle margolisi (Digenea), Tetraphyllidea indet. (Scolex pleuronectis, Cestoda) and Ascarophis longiovata (Nematoda) being the predominant species. These parasites reached a prevalence of 50.0%, 86.8% and 68.4% with an intensity of infection of 1–10, 1–91 and 1–74, respectively. The food consisted of crustaceans and cephalopods; no further prey items such as fish could be identified. Coryphaenoides mediterraneus demonstrates a parasite fauna similar to that of other deep-sea macrourids. No MAR-specific parasite species were found, and the collected helminths are common fish parasites of the North Atlantic deep-sea basin and the adjacent continental shelf regions. Only few larval epipelagic generalists such as ascaridoid nematodes were found, due to the deep origin of the studied fish between 1700–3500 m. The recorded species rich parasite fauna reflects the wide depth range and opportunistic feeding behaviour of C. mediterraneus on benthopelagic food. The recorded parasite species composition around the MAR appears to be similar to other deep-sea locations in the Atlantic Ocean, demonstrating the wide zoogeographical distribution of these deep-sea metazoans. Consequences of the MAR, the CGFZ and the homogeneous deep-sea environmental conditions for the parasite species distribution are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Heterocotyle tokoloshei sp. nov. is described from the gills of a single Short-tail stingray, Dasyatis brevicaudata, kept in captivity at the Two Oceans Aquarium in Cape Town, South Africa. The stingray exhibited laboured gill ventilation and deteriorating health on exhibit and was removed to the quarantine area for parasitological study and treatment. A 12 h bath treatment of praziquantel at 20mg/l, pre-dissolved in ethanol, removed 3084 parasites from the gills of the ray. However, the presence of a large number of eggs 24 h post-treatment indicated that viable egg laying adults remained on the gills and that the treatment was not 100% effective. Praziquantel was subsequently administered orally by intubation to the same ray at 150 mg/kg under anaesthetic (2-phenoxyethanol at 0.15 ml/l for approximately 1 h), which resulted in the removal of approximately 392 000 parasites from the gills 12 h post-oral treatment. Twenty-four h post-oral treatment, 3383 worms, but no eggs were recovered. No worms or eggs were recovered 48 h to 10 days post-oral treatment. The ray died approximately 30 days after the completion of the treatment. Heterocotyle tokoloshei sp. nov. is the first Heterocotyle species described from South Africa and represents the first record of a pathogenic Heterocotyle species. The new species can be distinguished from the other 16 species in the genus by the distal region of the male copulatory organ which has distinct small spines and by the morphology of the male copulatory organ accessory piece. Eggs of H. tokoloshei sp. nov. are laid singly and hatch spontaneously between 5 and 8 days at 18°C.",

Herein, we report results of screening for Neorickettsia of an extensive collection of DNA extracts from adult and larval digeneans obtained from various vertebrates and mollusks in the United States. Seven isolates of Neorickettsia were detected by PCR and sequenced targeting a 527 bp long region of 16S rRNA. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that four isolates matched published sequences of Neorickettsia risticii. Three other isolates, provisionally named “catfish agents 1 and 2” (obtained from Megalogonia ictaluri and Phyllodistomum lacustri, both parasitic in catfishes) and Neorickettsia sp. (obtained from cercariae of Diplostomum sp.), differed from previously known genotypes of Neorickettsia and are likely candidates for new species. All 7 isolates of Neorickettsia were obtained from digenean species and genera that were not previously reported as hosts of these bacteria. Members of four digenean families (Dicrocoeliidae, Heronimidae, Macroderoididae and Gorgoderidae) are reported as hosts of Neorickettsia for the first time. Our study reveals several new pathways of Neorickettsia circulation in nature. We have found for the first time a Neorickettsia from a digenean (dicrocoeliid Conspicuum icteridorum) with an entirely terrestrial life cycle. We found N. risticii in digeneans (Alloglossidium corti and Heronimus mollis) with entirely aquatic life cycles. Previously, this Neorickettsia species was known only from digeneans with aquatic/terrestrial life cycles. Our results suggest that our current knowledge of the diversity, host associations and circulation of neorickettsiae is far from satisfactory.",

The new species is morphologically closest to A. corti and A. geminum. These two species were also found in the same region as A. fonti sp. nov. and sometimes in the same individual fish. Examination of numerous genetically marked specimens has demonstrated that the most reliable distinguishing feature among the three species is the position of anterior margin of the vitelline fields. In the new species they are situated at the level of anterior margin of ventral sucker while in A. corti it is at the level of intestinal bifurcation or even further anteriorly, and in A. geminum it is at the level of posterior margin of ventral sucker or further posteriorly. The new species has a relatively smaller cirrus sac than A. geminum. Despite rather minor, albeit stable morphological differences, the molecular data strongly supported the status of A. fonti sp. nov. as a new species. Moreover, molecular data and morphological examination of new material suggested that A. kenti, earlier synonymized with A. corti, is a valid species that is resurrected here. Comparison of 2420 base long sequences of nuclear rDNA (partial 18S, complete ITS region, and partial 28S) obtained from multiple specimens of all 4 species collected in Minnesota, North Dakota, Nebraska and Mississippi, showed essentially no intraspecific variability (except for 1 base difference in the ITS2 region of A. fonti sp. nov.), but has demonstrated pronounced interspecific differences. The new species was not found in the four examined catfish species from the Red River of the North (on the border between North Dakota and Minnesota) and neighbouring North Dakota.",

Migrating red deer carried this parasite from neighboring countries to Polish territory. Until now, in Poland, this parasite has been recorded in European bison, red deer, roe deer and fallow deer. As a result of post-mortem examinations of 10 elk, 2 of them from the Augustów Forest and Biebrza Marshes, A. sidemi were found in abomasa for the first time in Poland. The intensity of the invasions was 120 and 7 specimens, respectively. This finding of Ashworthius sidemi in elk indicates a further expansion of the focus of ashworthiosis in BiaŁowieża towards the north into the Biebrza Marshes and the Augustowska Forest. The growth of the elk population and their tendency for long distance migrations can contribute to the spread of the parasitosis in much greater distances than deer. On the basis of our own research and data from the literature, the current spread of ashworthiosis in Poland is discussed.",

The cytodifferentiation of immature vitelline cells (vitellocytes) assumes the production and subsequent accumulation in their cytoplasm of several inclusions. Mature vitelline cells of P. angulatum are characterized by the presence of vitelline clusters (∼2.7 μm in diameter, with ∼100 vitelline globules of ∼0.35 μm in diameter) and osmiophobic, saturated lipid droplets (∼2-3 μm in diameter), and in A. lucii vitelline clusters of the same diameter include much fewer vitelline globules (∼50 globules of ∼0.5 μm in diameter), osmiophilic lipid droplets and α-glycogen. In both P. angulatum and A. lucii, interstitial cells are also present within the vitellarium. Two types of contact sites (septate and tight junctions) between adjoining interstitial cells also occur in both digenean species. Judging from the present and previous ultrastructural studies, it is suggested that there are three potential discriminatory characters of the digenean vitellarium (the number of different types of cell components within the vitellarium, the presence and type of junctional complexes between these cells, and the isolation of the vitellarium from the surrounding tissue) which may prove useful for a better understanding of the biology and evolutionary history of the different digenean groups.",

    "abstract": "Abstract One of the best examples of rapid displacement of native species by an invader is the eradication of native Artemia salina and A. parthenogenetica in the Mediterranean by the introduced American A. franciscana. Previous studies based on sampling from limited time periods suggest that the success of the American species as a competitor may be due partly to different parasite burden, since native Artemia spp. have high cestode infection rates regulating their density. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that the helminth infection in A. franciscana in its invasive range is low throughout its annual life cycle. Samples of A. franciscana were collected every second month from La Tapa saltern (Andalusia) during one year. Five helminth species were recorded: cestodes Flamingolepis liguloides, F. flamingo, Gynandrotaenia stammeri (all flamingo parasites), Eurycestus avoceti (a shorebird parasite) and larval spirurids of the Acuariinae (the first record of nematodes in Artemia). The overall infection rate was low, with total prevalence 5.9% and prevalence of individual parasite species between 0.2 and 3.2%. The mean abundance of helminths was 0.005–0.155 (av. 0.068), 5–13 times lower than in native congeners. Waterbird counts indicate that the low infection rates cannot be explained by lack of definitive hosts. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that helminths have no regulating effect on the invasive brine shrimp in the Mediterranean. The replacement of the native populations by the invader can be partially explained by a competition mediated by parasites/predators through a differential impact on host fitness.",

An improved faecal flotation followed by a species-specific PCR is described with a sensitivity of 74% (95% CI = 62-84%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI = 94-100%). These parameters are similar to those of the intestinal scraping technique (sensitivity = 78%, specificity = 100%). The sensitivity of the improved flotation was significantly higher (P < 0.0001) than that of routine flotation techniques. The costs of the method are similar or lower than those of other antemortem diagnostic methods. Based on these data, the method is suitable for surveys of domesticated and wild carnivores.",

Based on the similar morphological and morphometric characteristics, the same host and a similar host habitat environment, it can be concluded for the first time that the present species is conspecific with Haemogregarina garnhami previously reported from Psammophis shokari aegyptius. To further characterize this parasite, the partial 18S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced. The sequence analysis also showed that Haemogregarina garnhami should be reassigned into the genus Hepatozoon as Hepatozoon garnhami which has 99.5% (859/863 bp) sequence similarity to Hepatozoon ayorgbor, infecting the erythrocytes of Python regius in Ghana. Phylogenetic analysis showed that H. garnhami formed a mixed clade with Hepatozoon spp. from geckos, snakes and rodents and ophidian Hepatozoon spp. did not form a separated phylogenetic unit. Also, Psammophis schokari-infecting Hepatozoon contained several different genetic lineages.

Specimens of Rhadinorhynchus from Scorpis aequipinnis, Girella tricuspidata, Johnius australis and Grammatobothus polyophthalmus could not be identified further. New host and locality records are reported for R. bicircumspinus found in Trachurus declivis and Rexea solandri from the east coast of Tasmania; R. carangis found in Trachinotus bailonii and T. copperingi from Queensland and Western Australian coasts; R. polynemi from Queensland; R. seriolae found in Seriola lalandi from the east coast of Australia. An immature female specimen of R. johnstoni provided no additional data on the species. Rhadinorhynchus biformis sp. nov., described from Pelates quadrilineatus and a trumpeter from Moreton Bay, Queensland differs from all its congeners in the pattern of the trunk spines, a single field of numerous small spines ventro-laterally, overlapping with irregular rows and circles of larger spines extending posteriorly. Rhadinorhynchus pichelinae sp. nov. described from Upeneichthys vlamingi from Point Peron, Western Australia differs from all its congeners in having proboscis armature of 10 longitudinal rows of 24–28, usually 26–27 hooks up to 87 long and a single field of 21–24 irregular circles of spines on the anterior trunk, with the posterior circles incomplete dorsally. Rhadinorhynchus polydactyli sp. nov. described from Polydactylus sp. from Moreton Bay is differentiated from all congenerics by the elongated neck of the females and having a proboscis armature of up to 34 hooks in 10 longitudinal rows. Rhadinorhynchus pomatomi sp. nov. found in Pomotomus saltrix differs from its most similar congeners, those without dorsal trunk spines, in having a proboscis armature of 12–15 rows of 20–22 hooks up to 73.5–80.5 long. Rhadinorhynchus bicircumspinus, R. biformis, R. pichelinae, R. polydactyli and R. pomatomi are known only from Australian waters while R. carangis and R. seriolae are also known from Japanese waters, R. johnstoni from the western Pacific and R. polynemi from the Indian coast.",

A total of 7,504 snail specimens was dissected and the larval stages of 15 different trematodes were recovered and examined morphologically. These larvae included four species that had previously been reported from H. australis in Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina: the heterophyid Ascocotyle (Phagicola) longa and the microphallids, Maritrema bonaerense, Maritrema orensense, and Microphallus simillimus. Three other species, the echinostomatid Stephanoprora uruguayensis, the microphallid Levinseniella cruzi, and the psilostomid Psilochasmus oxyurus are reported here for the first time as parasites of H. australis. Eight other trematodes found in H. australis are described and placed in the appropriate superfamilies, families or genera (Cryptogonimidae, Apocreadiidae, Aporocotylidae, Notocotylidae, Haploporidae, Renicolidae, Himasthla, and Renicola). The prevalence of the trematode taxa infecting H. australis in the Bahía Blanca estuary was low (&lt;3%) with a single exception (M. simillimus; &gt;20%). Microphallidae were the richest and the most prevalent family, probably because of the high abundance of crabs — the second-intermediate hosts of certain microphallid species — and the considerable diversity of gulls. Here we compare the parasite assemblage found in the H. australis from Bahía Blanca estuary with other parasite assemblages infecting Heleobia spp. and other rissooids from the rest of the world.",

We examined surface water samples collected from 50 sites and first, the tolerance thermic test was performed in order to select thermophilic, potentially pathogenic strains. For molecular identification of FLA, regions of 18S rDNA, 16S rDNA and intergenic spacers were amplified. Acanthamoeba T4 and T16 genotypes of 18S rDNA gene and 18S rDNA of H. vermiformis were detected. We identified two variants of Acanthamoeba T4 genotype, two variants of Acanthamoeba T16 genotype and one variant of H. vermiformis. Identification of the T16 genotype and H. vermiformis in water was for the first time in Poland. Additionally, we made attempts to adapt the RLB method for detection and differentiation of FLA species and strains. PCR seems to be more sensitive than RLB hybridization, though.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Parasitic diseases of livestock together with poor welfare conditions can negatively affect the health status and production of small ruminants. Protozoan parasites and tick-borne infectious agents are common threat of livestock including small ruminants mostly during the pasture season. Therefore the priority of the study was to analyse the circulation and presence of two protozoan parasites Toxoplasma gondii and Neospora caninum as well as tick-transmitted bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum in one selected goat farm in Eastern Slovakia. Throughout a three-year study period we have repeatedly screened the sera and blood of goats and dogs from monitored farm. In total, 343 blood serum samples from 116 goats were examined by ELISA. The mean seropositivity for T. gondii was 56.9% (66/116, CI (95%) = 48–66.0) and 15.5% (18/116, CI (95%) = 9.3–22.7) for N. caninum. The permanent occurrence of anti-Toxoplasma and anti-Neospora antibodies was detected in repeatedly examined goats during the whole monitored period. The presence of both parasites in the flock was analysed by PCR. DNA of T. gondii was confirmed in 12 out of 25 Toxoplasma-seropositive goats and N. caninum in 14 samples out of 18 Neospora-seropositive animals; four goats were co-infected with both pathogens. The risk of endogenous transmission of both parasites was pursued by examination of 41 kid’s sera, where seropositivity for toxoplasmosis was 31.7% and for neosporosis 14.6%. In dogs 61.1% seropositivity for T. gondii and 38.9% for N. caninum was found, however, their faeces were negative for coccidian oocysts. Eight out of 108 tested animals were infected with A. phagocytophilum, the causative agent of tick-borne fever. Seven of them were simultaneously infected with T. gondii and A. phagocytophilum, out of which four goats were concurrently infected with all three pathogens.",

Previous study found that Haemonchus contortus actin could be recognized by the serum of goats infected with the homology parasite. This indicated that H. contortus actin could be a potential candidate for vaccine. In this study, DNA vaccine encoding H. contortus actin was tested for protection against experimental H. contortus infections in goats. Fifteen goats were allocated into three trial groups. The animals of Actin group were vaccinated with the DNA vaccine on day 0 and 14, and challenged with 5000 infective H. contortus third stage larval (L3) on day 28. An unvaccinated positive control group was challenged with L3 at the same time. An unvaccinated negative control group was not challenged with L3. The results showed that DNA vaccine were transcribed at local injection sites and expressed in vivo post immunizations respectively. For goats in Actin vaccinated group, higher levels of serum IgG, serum IgA and mucosal IgA were produced, the percentages of CD4+ T lymphocytes, CD8+ T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes and the concentrations of TGF-β were increased significantly (P&lt;0.05). Following L3 challenge, the mean eggs per gram feces (EPG) and worm burdens of Actin group were reduced by 34.4% and 33.1%, respectively. This study suggest that recombinant H. contortus Actin DNA vaccine induced partial immune response and has protective potential against goat haemonchosis.",

The vitellocyte inclusions of D. rudolphii are shell globule clusters containing tightly packed shell globules associated with a matrix of moderate electron density, glycogen granules, large electron-lucent lipid droplets (up to 3 μm in diameter), and, occasionally, a lipid droplet may occur in the nucleus of the vitellocytes. The diameter of the clusters ranges from 0.4 to 2.5 μm, the number of shell globules in the clusters varies from 8 to 45, and the size of the globules ranges from 0.12 to 0.25 μm and they are of approximately homogeneous sizes within a cluster. Most vitellocyte lipid droplets have a heterogeneous configuration with a ‘cavity’ inside them when they are within vitelline ducts and intrauterine eggs. Vitellocytes of the eggs contain dark concentric bodies and lipid droplets. The interstitial tissue has a syncytial structure. The morphological parameters of the diameter and shape of shell globule clusters, arrangement of shell globules in clusters, number and diameter of globules within clusters, types of lipid droplets and presence of dark concentric bodies are compared with those of two other spathebothriidean genera, Cyathocephalus and Diplocotyle. The comparative data demonstrate that vitelline material morphology has unique features in three spathenothriidean genera and may be used as evidence for the recognition of separate taxa.",

The component community is constituted by seventeen helminth species, which frequency and mean abundance show a bimodal pattern. The set of core species is constituted by the trichurids Pearsonema plica, Eucoleus aerophilus and Aonchotheca putorii (72.2% of total helminth individuals found), while the remaining can be considered satellite species. Significant co-occurrences were found among E. aerophilus/A. putorii and E. aerophilus/P. plica. These results demonstrate the great importance of earthworms within the diet of pine marten and contribute to the knowledge of the pine marten’s food ethology, since this kind of prey normally goes undetected in diet studies. Several helminth species, as Sobolevingylus petrowi, Centrorhynchus aluconis, Uncinaria criniformis, Mastophorus muris and Spirura rytipleurites seurati seem to show geographical distributions limited to insular ecosystems. Moreover, helminth communities of M. martes among four Spanish territories, including mainland and insular areas, are characterized and compared.",

Forty-four wild caught and naturally infected eels were placed in an aquarium filled with water from the fishing site (Vaccarès Lagoon, French Mediterranean coast). In this confined environment (271), under decreasing oxygen resources, the first eel death occurred after 45 h (O2 = 0.98 mg l−1) and the last one after 96 h (O2 = 0.48 mg l−1). After dissection and parasite examination, analyses revealed significant negative correlations between the time to death and various parameters of parasite pressure (e.g., number of lumen worms, parasite mass, health state of the infected organ). It was shown that the severity of damage to the swimbladder rather than the count of living parasites was the major contributing factor in explaining the variation in time to death. These semi-experimental data demonstrating an increased eel mortality rate under severe oxygen stress are discussed for their relevance under field conditions, especially during hot summer months.",

Both external bands of this intercentriolar body are made up of a row of granules. During spermiogenesis, a flagellar rotation of 90° is described. The old spermatid does not present external ornamentations. The spermatozoon is characterized, in its anterior region, by the presence of a lateral expansion exhibiting one spinelike body. In C. endopapillatus, external ornamentations are localized only at the level where the lateral expansion appears. The posterior extremity of spermatozoon exhibits a nucleus surrounded by a plasmic membrane lacking microtubules, but presenting a small lateral expansion. This is the first species of Gastrothylacidae family studied by transmission electron microscopy.",

The new species, studied using both light and scanning electron microscopy, is characterized mainly by the structure of the mouth (highly reduced pseudolabia, high pseudolabial terminal projections, no submedian labia, well-developed, bilobed sublabia), bifurcate deirids, the length of the spicules (663–729 μm and 105–108 μm) and the presence of filaments on both egg poles (2–5 on each). Similascarophis Muñoz, González et George-Nascimento, 2004 is considered a subgenus of Ascarophis van Beneden, 1871 to accommodate the species characterized by highly reduced pseudolabia. Presence of the new species in fish from Seamount Nova (Lord Howe Rise) but not from the Chesterfield plateau suggests that it is endemic to this seamount, a case already encountered for many benthic invertebrates.",

Findings of the first two species represent the second records since their original descriptions and P. floridensis was for the first time recorded from South Carolina estuaries. Detailed study of these nematode species, using both light (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), revealed the presence of minute caudal projections in the gravid female of P. carolinensis and four pairs of caudal papillae in the conspecific male; the cephalic and caudal ends of this species were for the first time examined by SEM. The related species P. carolinensis and P. floridensis, both parasitizing sciaenid fishes, can be distinguished from each other mainly by the presence/absence of oesophageal teeth, lengths of spicules and body lengths of gravid females. The morphology of North American specimens of P. saltatrix was found to be identical with that of specimens from Europe, thus confirming their conspecificity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Vitellogenesis in Wenyonia virilis was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), including the cytochemical detection of glycogen at the ultrastructural level with the periodic acid-thiosemicarbazide-silver proteinate (PA-TSC-SP) technique. Mature vitelline follicles have cells in various stages of development, progressing from immature cells of gonial type near the periphery of the follicle to maturing and mature vitellocytes towards the centre. Maturation is characterized by: (1) increase in cell volume; (2) increase in nuclear surface area restoring the N/C (nucleo-cytoplasmic) ratio; (3) nucleolar transformation; (4) extensive development of parallel cisternae of GER, the shell-protein producing units; (5) development of Golgi complexes, engaged in shell-granule/shell-globule formation and packaging; (6) synthesis and storage of glycogen in the cytoplasm; (7) simultaneous, independent formation and storage of intranuclear glycogen; (8) continuous fusion of small shell-granules into larger shell-globules and fusion of these into large shell-globule clusters with a progressive increase in the number and size of the latter; and (9) disintegration of GER in the medial layer of vitellocyte cytoplasm, degenerative changes and accumulation of glycogen and shell-globule clusters within the cytoplasm. The functional significance of numerous shell-globule clusters and the relatively small amount of nuclear and cytoplasmic glycogen is analysed. Unlike vitellogenesis of other caryophyllids, the nuclear glycogen of mature vitellocytes in W. virilis is randomly dispersed in the nucleoplasm and never forms a high central accumulation, the so-called “nuclear vacuole”. The nutritive function of vitellocytes appears greatly reduced in W. virilis, a fact perhaps related to the intrauterine development of the early embryos. The ultrastructure of vitellogenesis in W. virilis is compared with that in other lower cestodes, both monozoic and polyzoic. Conclusions concerning interrelationships of the vitellogenesis pattern of the ultrastructural cytochemistry of mature vitellocytes of W. virilis to intrauterine embryonation, absence of uterine glands and an extensive uterus characteristic for this species, are drawn and discussed.",

We captured 95 bats belonging to nine species, but only Artibeus lituratus, Artibeus fimbriatus, Sturnira lilium (Phyllostomidae) and Myotis nigricans (Vespertilionidae) were found to be parasitized. The bat flies collected were: Streblidae — Paratrichobius longicrus (on A. lituratus) and Megistopoda aranea (on A. lituratus and A. fimbriatus), Megistopoda proxima (on S. lilium); Nycteribiidae — Basilia andersoni (on M. nigricans). Artibeus fimbriatus and S. lilium showed the highest values of parasite prevalence (60 and 35.7%, respectively) and mean intensities (1.9 and 2.1, respectively). Only two parasitized individuals of A. lituratus were found, resulting in the lowest local rate of parasite prevalence (2.6%) and mean intensity (1.0). This low rate may result from the use of ephemeral roosts in the area. The high values of frequency and number of flies per host on A. fimbriatus and S. lilium in relation to other studies could be explained by the low richness of bat flies here, and in turn, by low competition among fly species per host.",

Despite the ubiquitous distribution of this parasite and its broad range of hosts, the number of N. caninum isolates obtained to date is limited. In addition, the majority of isolates have been obtained from clinically affected hosts, therefore potentially biasing this population towards more virulent isolates. This report describes the isolation and biological characterisation of a new N. caninum isolate, Nc-Goiás 1, obtained from an asymptomatic, naturally infected calf from Brazil. This new isolate was identified as a member of the N. caninum species by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers based on the N. caninum internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1) sequence, and was genetically identified at multiple loci using microsatellite analysis. Finally, a pathogenicity study was conducted in a BALB/c mice model. All Nc-Goiás 1-infected mice survived without exhibiting any clinical signs. Further pathogenic characterisation of this isolate suggested that Nc-Goiás 1 is less virulent than other N. caninum isolates (Nc-Liv and Nc-1) studied in this mouse model. This is the first report of the isolation and biological characterisation of N. caninum from an infected but clinically healthy calf in South America.",

The two flagella undergo a rotation of 90° until they become parallel to the median cytoplasmic extension with which they fuse. Electron-dense material is present in the apical region of the zone of differentiation in the early stages of spermiogenesis. This electron-dense material is characteristic for the orders Bothriocephalidea and Diphyllobothriidea. The mature spermatozoon contains two axonemes of the 9 + ‘1’ trepaxonematan pattern, nucleus, parallel cortical microtubules and electron-dense granules of glycogen. The anterior extremity of the spermatozoon exhibits a single helical electron-dense crested body 130 nm thick. One of the most interesting features is the presence of a ring of cortical microtubules surrounding the axoneme. This character has been reported only for species of the order Bothriocephalidea and may be unique in this cestode group.",

Species of this new genus were recovered from sites off Heron and Lizard Islands on the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, New Caledonia and Rasdhoo Atoll, Maldives. Varialvus gen. nov. is distinguished from all other cryptogonimid genera by the combination of a fusiform to oval body, the relatively small number of large oral spines, a median ovary which is relatively condensed and highly lobed, opposite to slightly oblique testes, uterine loops that are restricted to the hindbody and extend well posterior to the testes, and vitelline follicles that are mainly in the forebody but may extend from the anterior margin of the ovary to anterior to the intestinal bifurcation. Bayesian inference analysis of partial large subunit (LSU) rDNA sequence data for these species revealed that they formed a monophyletic clade, despite V. charadrus sp. nov. having a distinctly muscular gonotyl, which based on morphological characters alone may have warranted placement in a separate genus in the absence of DNA sequence data. At least one species of Varialvus gen. nov. is apparently widespread in the Indo-West Pacific. Three species, V. lacertus sp. nov., V. jenae sp. nov. and V. angustus sp. nov. have each been found at only one locality, but V. charadrus sp. nov. was recovered from lutjanids off the Great Barrier Reef, New Caledonia and the Maldives, demonstrating a biogeographic range of at least 10,000 kilometres.

The pro-oxidant parameter used was the colorimetric quantification of reactive substances to thiobarbituric acid, while the antioxidant markers used were blood content of reduced glutathione and determination of the activity of catalase. The worm burden was assessed by Kato-Katz method. The results pointed out that initially there was no difference in the catalase activity. However, there was a positive correlation between the increase in parasitic load and intensity of lipid peroxidation, and decrease in the content of reduced glutathione. Additionally, only the aspartate aminotransferase levels presented to be high, while there was a decrease in bilirubin level. Therefore, a possible association between the establishment of the oxidative stress in tissue and the parasitic load of Schistosoma mansoni is suggested.",

A total of twelve species of helminths were identified in these rodent populations, including Brachylaima sp.

In A. agrarius, H. polygyrus was the most prevalent, as well as the most abundant helminth, but R. fraterna was the species with the highest mean intensity. In contrast, S. stroma dominated the A. flavicollis helminth fauna with the highest prevalence, mean abundance and mean intensity. Both rodent populations harboured nine helminth species, although the mean individual species richness was significantly higher in A. agrarius than in A. flavicollis. The analysis of helminth diversity at both component and infracommunity levels revealed differences between the two rodent populations, which are most likely attributable to the specific host ecology.",

A Myxidium sp. closely similar to M. elmatboulii is described herein for the first time as a histozoic parasite in the ovary of the onespot snapper fish, Lutjanus monostigma (Teleostei, Lutjanidae) from the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia. The infected ovary was morphologically abnormal, with two protruding digitiform black cysts at its distal end, densely packed with mature plasmodia suspended in a mucoid liquid. Histological examination revealed that the cysts were extended deeply within the ovary, and each was surrounded by a capsule consisting of a relatively thick layer of fibrous connective tissues of host origin (host tissue reaction), and followed internally by a distinct black layer composed of melanomacrophages encircling the parasite mass; this layer clearly indicates the ability of this myxosporean parasite to induce a strong immune inflammatory response in the ovary of L. monostigma. Many small or developing cysts with the same characteristics were seen scattered in the connective tissue between the ovarian follicles. Plasmodia or spores of the parasite were not seen within the oocytes or within its developmental stages. The cysts occupied a considerable part of the ovary, and some areas of the ovarian tissues appeared to be vacuolated or degenerated. Thus, the typical ovarian structure of L. monostigma was greatly affected and lost its normal architecture. Therefore, the infection caused by this Myxidium sp. is presumed to negatively affect the reproductive capacity of the fish host.",

    "abstract": "Larvae of a vast majority of water mite species are parasites of aquatic insects. Owing to this, they migrate to new localities, and are able to survive unfavourable environmental conditions. This also concerns species from subgenus Arrenurus s. str., parasites of dragonflies. The detailed analysis of this phenomenon, however, has only been possible in the last several years, since the key to the identification of larvae from genus Arrenurus Dug. was published. In 2010, the parasitism of Arrenurus s. str. larvae on dragonflies in the Lake Świdwie reserve (NW Poland) was analysed. Larvae of 9 species of water mites were recorded on 107 imagines of dragonflies from 8 species. The following were identified as hosts of water mites for the first time: Anax imperator, Libellula quadrimaculata, and Leucorrhinia caudalis. The highest prevalence occurred in the case of: Erythromma najas and Lestes dryas (100%), Coenagrion pulchellum (96.5%), and C. puella (80.0%). Coenagrion pulchellum was infested by 9 species of parasites, C. puella by 6, and Erythromma najas and Lestes dryas by three species. The highest number of host species occurred in the case of Arrenurus maculator (5); followed by A. cuspidator, A. batillifer cf., A. bicuspidator, and A. tetracyphus (3 each); A. papillator, A. tricuspidator, and A. bruzelii (2 each), and A. claviger (1). Differentiation of preferences of particular parasites towards various parts of the host body was observed, probably related to the coevolution of parasites and hosts, and competition between the host species. The body sizes of the parasites suggest that approximately 50% of body size growth of water mites from subgenus Arrenurus s. str. occurs at the stage of parasitic larva.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The liver fluke Fasciola hepatica infects a wide range of hosts, and has a considerable impact on the agriculture industry, mainly through infections of sheep and cattle. Further, human infection is now considered of public health importance and is hyperendemic in some regions. The fluke infection causes considerable damage to the hosts’ liver. However, the mechanisms of liver destruction have not yet been completely elucidated. In the present report we incubated a human liver cell line in the presence of either F. hepatica excretory/secretory material (FhES) or recombinant phosphoglycerate kinase (FhPGK). Dosedependent cytotoxicity in the presence of FhES was observed, indicating that FhES is capable of killing human hepatocytes, supporting a role for FhES in damaging host liver cells during infection; while treatment with a recombinant intracellular protein — FhPGK, had no impact on cell survival.",

Theileriosis is not yet documented in the Philippines as compared to babesiosis and anaplasmosis which are considered major tick-borne diseases that infect livestock in the country and contribute major losses to the livestock industry. The study was aimed to detect Theileria sp. at genus level in blood samples of cattle using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. Specifically, it determined the phylogenetic relationship of Theileria species affecting cattle in the Philippines to other Theileria sp. registered in the GenBank. A total of 292 blood samples of cattle that were collected from various provinces were used. Theileria sp. was detected in 43/292 from the cattle blood samples using PCR assay targeting the major piroplasm surface protein (MPSP) gene. DNA sequence showed high similarity (90–99%) among the reported Theileria sp. isolates in the GenBank and the Philippine isolates of Theileria. Phylogenetic tree construction using nucleotide sequence classified the Philippine isolates of Theileria as benign. However, nucleotide polymorphism was observed in the new isolate based on nucleotide sequence alignment. It revealed that the new isolate can be a new species of Theileria.",

In addition, nematodes collected from these five different fishes have been characterized using molecular methods by sequencing and analysing the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) of ribosomal DNA. No variation in size and nucleotide polymorphisms is detected within the target sequence among all samples analysed. These data contribute to facilitate an accurate diagnosis of this poorly known nematode. An identification key to the species of the subgenus Ichthyascaris is also provided.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The infection patterns of parasites are often tied to host behavior. Although most studies have investigated definitive hosts and their parasites, intermediate host behavior may play a role in shaping the distribution and accumulation of parasites, particularly the larval stages. In an attempt to answer this question, more than 4,500 pulmonate snails were collected from 11 states in the mid-Atlantic and Midwestern United States in the summer of 2012. These snails were necropsied and echinostome metecercariae were commonly observed infecting the snails as 2nd intermediate hosts (20.0%). The snails included species of 3 genera with distinct differences in the infection patterns of Echinostoma spp. metacercariae among them. Physa spp. (comprising of P. acuta and P. gyrina) snails exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of infection (23.5%) than both Lymnaea columella (11.6%) and Helisoma spp. (comprising of H. anceps and H. trivolvis) (14.2%; P &lt; 0.05), with no difference in prevalence observed between the latter 2 genera (P &gt; 0.05). The intensity of metacercariae within the snail hosts was significantly different between the 3 genera (P &lt; 0.05), with L. columella having the highest intensity (24.3 ± 5.6), followed by Physa spp. (15.2 ± 1.5) and Helisoma spp. (5.0 ± 0.9). Differences in prevalence and intensity were also observed when the different snail families co-habited the same body of water. The disparities in infection patterns are likely due to distinct differences in the behavioral and feeding ecology of the snail hosts.",

The present study was designed to investigate the prevalence and species characterization of Eimeria oocysts in river buffalo calves of Khuzestan province, southwest of Iran. Of the total 108 fecal samples examined for Eimeria, 108 (100%) were found infected with 11 species of the parasite. Among the identified species of Eimeria, E. bovis was found to be the predominant etiological agent (76.85%), followed in order by E. canadensis (62.96%), E. zuernii (47.2%), E. ellipsoidalis (26.85%), E. subspherica (25.92%), E. brasiliensis (19.4%), E. auburnensis (18.51%), E. alabamensis (14.81%), E. pellita (11.1%), E. illinoisensis (5.5%) and E. bukidnonensis (2.7%). In most calves multiple infections with three species were present. While, 20.7% of calves showed heavy infection, 50.4 and 24.8% of calves showed weak and moderate infection, respectively. There was no significant difference in the OPG values between the calves of different localities. There was also no significant difference between the prevalence rate of infection in males and females. A total of 16.6% of all faecal samples were found to be diarrheic. A highly significant relationship could be identified between the occurrence of diarrhea and the level of E. bovis and E. zuernii oocysts excretion. Considering the pervasive occurrence and negative effects of the infection on the health condition and the growth performance of buffalo calves, infections should receive increased attention by both farmers and veterinarians.",

Molecular analysis was done on adult lungworms that were obtained from the respiratory track of four free-roaming bison euthanized as a part of the population health control program. As the result of the study four identical small subunit-ribosomal RNA gene sequences from the lungworms were obtained and deposited in GenBank as sequence, 1708 bp long (GenBank KC771250).

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent parasitological examinations of the marine perciform fish (tigerteeth croaker) Otolithes ruber (Bloch et Schneider) (Sciaenidae) from off Iran yielded one new and one previously known nematode species: Dichelyne (Dichelyne) spinigerus sp. nov. (Cucullanidae) from the host’s intestine in the Persian Gulf and Philometra otolithi Moravec et Manoharan, 2013 (Philometridae) from the ovary in the Persian Gulf and the Sea of Oman. The new species D. spinigerus is mainly characterized by the tail tip of both sexes terminating in two shaply pointed spikes (one dorsal and one ventral) and bearing a pair of minute lateral cuticular spines at its base, situation of both deirids and the excretory pore well posterior to the level of the posterior end of oesophagus, absence of a precloacal sucker and the presence of one or two intestinal caeca. The male and small mature females of the gonad-infecting species P. otolithi are described for the first time, based on light and scanning electron microscopical studies. The male of P. otolithi is most similar to that of P. johnii Moravec et Ali, 2013, but differs from it by the structure of the cephalic end and the number of caudal papillae; both species also differ from each other by the presence of transverse lamellae in the buccal cavity of gravid and subgravid females of P. otolithi, which are missing in those of P. johnii.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The nematodes of the genus Thelazia are the cause of eye diseases of wild and domestic ruminants throughout the world. The aim of the study was to describe clinical cases of thelasiosis in European bison ( Bison bonasus ) in Poland, and provide morphometrical features of Thelazia gulosa Railiet and Henry, 1910 and Thelazia skrjabini Erschov, 1928 regarded as potentially useful for species differentiation Methods The conjunctival sacs, tear ducts, the surface of the cornea and nicitating membrane collected from bison were rinsed with saline solution. Any nematodes isolated from the sediment were subjected to morphometric analysis. Results Thirteen of the 16 examined European bison were infected with Thelazia nematodes , belonging to the species T. gulosa and T. skrjabini. The intensity of infection ranged from one to six (mean intensity 5), and four to 29 (mean intensity 14) nematodes T. skrjabini and T. gulosa respectively. Congestion of conjunctival sac, keratitis and corneal opacity, corneal ulceration and perforation as well as purulent eyeball inflammation were observed in infected animals. Conclusions Thelazia gulosa and T. skrjabini can be identified by morphometrical features. As thelasiosis might be a serious threat for protected population of European bison, further studies are needed of the epidemiology and pathology of this emerging parasitosis in Poland.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The aim of the study was to examine Demodex survival in makeup cosmetics, i.e., powder cream, mascara, and lipstick, and to determine whether cosmetics shared with others can be a source of D. folliculorum infection. Methods Live D. folliculorum adults were placed in cosmetic samples and their motility was observed under a microscope. The mites were fully or partially immersed in the powder cream and lipstick, and only partially immersed in the mascara. Partial immersion means that only the opisthosoma was covered by the cosmetic, whereas the gnathosoma and podosoma had no contact with the cosmetic. Cessation of motility was regarded as a sign of death. Results In the control (mites placed on a microscope slide with no cosmetics), the survival time was 41.2 h. D. folliculorum that were immersed fully or partially in the lipstick substrate were viable for 38.5 h and 148 h, respectively. The survival time of the mites at full and partial immersion in the powder cream was 0.78 h and 2.16 h, respectively. The average survival time in the mascara was 21 h. Conclusions Makeup cosmetics used by different individuals at short intervals (from several hours to several days) can be a source of transmission of Demodex sp. mites.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The current study aimed to investigate the efficacy of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) synthesized by Melia azedarach aqueous extract to control Hyalomma dromedarii tick, and to evaluate their toxic effects on Swiss albino mice. Methods ZnO NPs were synthesized using M. azedarach aqueous extract. UV–visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy were used to characterize the synthesized NPs. Egg, nymph, larva, and adult immersion tests were used for bioassay of tick stages with the synthesized ZnO NP. A toxicity study was performed on Swiss albino mice after treatment with 1/10 of the oral LD 50 of ZnO NPs (8437 mg/kg) for 5 successive days by oral gavage. Results The LC 50 of ZnO NPs on the eggs, larvae, and nymphs was 11.6, 8.03, and 3.9 mg/ml, respectively. The reproductive performance of females treated with ZnO NPs was lower than that of untreated females. The hematological results showed an insignificant increase in the level of white blood cells with normal red blood cells, hemoglobin, in addition to normal platelet count. The biochemical analysis showed an insignificant increased level ( P &gt; 0.05) of alkaline phosphatase and alanine aminotransferase. The liver and kidney suffered few histopathological changes after oral administration of ZnO NPs. Conclusion These results suggest that ZnO NPs have good acaricidal activity against eggs, larvae, and engorged nymphs of H. dromedarii. ZnO NPs minimized the number of eggs laid by engorged females and the hatchability of their eggs. ZnO NPs did not affect unfed adults. The toxicity results of the mice revealed insignificant changes in the hemogram, biochemistry, with liver and kidney suffering few histopathological changes. Future studies are needed to assess application routes (topical vs oral). Based on these findings, ZnO NPs may be incorporated in the control of camel tick H. dromedarii.",

In one of these localities a relatively high infection of Galba truncatula (26 out of 76) with mature cercariae of F. magna was detected. R. peregra, which is dominant over Galba truncatula, has never been reported as the natural intermediate host of F. magna. Its potential susceptibility to F. magna infection was confirmed experimentally with 67 snails of R. peregra (out of 371) infected. The present data indicate the capability of F. magna to expand the spectrum of its intermediate hosts and demonstrate the potential epizootiological importance of lymnaeid snails, other than G. truncatula, for transmission of the parasite in Europe.",

However, terrestrial systems in general and small mammals in particular are rarely considered in these ecological studies. Based on the effects of a wildfire which occurred in the Spanish Serra Calderona Natural Park — a typical Mediterranean ecosystem — the regeneration process of the wood mouse population and its helminth community is analysed. A total of 217 individuals of Apodemus sylvaticus were studied in a five year period, from the second to the fifth post-fire year: 152 mice originating from the burned area and 65 from the control — non-burned — area. The helminth community for both burned and non-burned areas as well as the effect of intrinsic (host age and sex) and extrinsic (site, period and season of capture) factors on helminth prevalences and abundances were analysed. Taking into account the most important results of this study, various aspects of the helminth community dynamics of the wood mouse are postulated as biological tags of the environmental impact of a wildfire, such as the changes in the frequency distribution of the helminth species, the higher diversity in the burned area, and the prevalences of helminth species having biological cycles directly affected by climatic conditions and the vegetal regeneration process. Consequently, the helminth species of A. sylvaticus should be considered suitable biological tags of environmental perturbations, such as a wildfire, and the wood mouse/helminth model can be applied to predict the consequences for helminth species in general.",

Overall helminth prevalences were relatively high for both species [6/6 (100%) for E. iheringii and 9/14 (64%) for E. perditus]. The helminth assemblages from both host species were depauperate and dominated by generalist helminths with direct life-cycles.",

In contrast, E. merra in New Caledonia harbours only P. melanesiensis (Laird, 1958).

P. youngi sp. nov. is described from E. fasciatus from New Caledonia (type-locality), Heron Island, and French Polynesia, and distinguished from P. cupatus on the basis of the male quadriloculate organ, sclerotised vagina and lamellosquamodiscs. Thus, P. cupatus, P. melanesiensis and P. youngi each have a single host, respectively E. quoyanus, E. merra, and E. fasciatus. Results for E. fasciatus and E. merra in New Caledonia, Wallis and French Polynesia suggest impoverishment of the monogenean fauna in a West-East gradient in the Pacific.",

Altogether 109 birds were examined during the years 2006–2010. The occurrence of Haemoproteus sp., Leucocytozoon fringillinarum and Trypanosoma sp. was documented. Blood parasite prevalences of 45% by microscopic examination and 55% by PCR diagnostics were found. The prevalence of Leucocytozoon sp. was found to be dependent on host sex with males showing a significantly higher intensity of infection with Leucocytozoon. Adult birds showed significantly higher infection prevalence than subadults. The prevalences of both Leucocytozoon sp. and Haemoproteus sp. were significantly dependent on bird age. The intensity of infection with Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon was positively correlated and higher intensity of infection was confirmed in adult birds then in subadults birds. The prevalence of blood parasites in our samples was significantly higher in comparison to most other studies from different countries of Europe conducted at lower altitudes, indicating that the montane zone is especially favourable for the transmission of Leucocytozoon and Haemoproteus species.",

All samples were submited to blood cell counts and detection of Theileria or Babesia. DNA extraction and PCR were performed in all samples for identification of piroplasm infection (T. equi and B. caballi). From the 25 horses evaluated for piroplasm detection by PCR, seven horses (28%) were positive in jugular vein blood but negative in splenic blood samples, five horses (20%) were positive in splenic blood samples but negative in jugular vein blood samples, and 13 horses (52%) were positive in both jugular vein and splenic blood samples. The hematological evaluation revealed anemia in 13 of 25 (52%) infected horses, lymphopenia in five (20%), neutrophilia in two (8%), neutropenia in one (4%), and thrombocytopenia in one (4%) infected horse.

Subsequently, the following methodology was applied: protein concentration assay by the Lowry method — as modified by Schacterle and Pollack; assay of proteolytic activity in relation to various substrates (gelatine, haemoglobin, ovoalbumin, albumin, cytochrome C, casein) by the modified Anson method; identification of proteolytic activity in relation to diagnostic inhibitors of proteolytic enzymes (pepstatin A, PMSF, iodoacetamide, o-phenantrolin), using the Lee and Lin method; identification of acidic, neutral and basic protease activities by means of the modified Anson method; electrophoretic analysis of proteins in a polyacrylamide gel for protease detection with the Laemmli method and for protease inhibitor detection with the Felicioli method. The highest value of protein concentration was found in the tau-fluvalinate-sensitive V. destructor, while the highest activity levels of acidic, neutral and alkaline proteases were observed in the tau-fluvalinate-resistant mites. Aspartic, serine, thiolic and metallic proteases were found in the drug-resistant and drug-sensitive Varroa mites. The control samples were found to contain aspartic and serine proteases. In an acidic and alkaline environment, the results revealed a complete loss of inhibitor activities in the in vitro analyses and electrophoresis. Serine protease inhibitor activities (at pH 7.0) were high, especially in the group of tau-fluvalinate-resistant mites.",

Here we demonstrate that female Sprague-Dawley rats vaccinated with cDNA encoding a recently discovered cysteine proteinase of Fasciola hepatica (FhPcW1) develop considerably lower liver fluke burdens after F. hepatica infection than their male counterparts. This is accompanied by differences in the course of their immune responses which involve different eosinophil and monocyte responses throughout the study as well as humoral responses. It is evident that host gender influences the outcome of parasitic infections after vaccination and research on both sexes should be considered when developing new treatments against parasites.",

To date a 100% effective vaccine has not been developed and the disease is controlled by drug therapy. Great efforts are put into development of effective vaccine against parasite what is difficult since Fasciola spp. (like other helmints) during evolutionary process has developed sophisticated and efficient methods to evade immune response. During preliminary experiments it is convenient to use cell lines which are relatively cheap and allow for reproducible comparison of results between laboratories. We stimulated BOMA (bovine monocyte/macrophage cell line) and BOMAC (bovine macrophage cell line) with native or recombinant antigens of Fasciola hepatica and assessed IFN-γ, IL-4 and TNF-α level upon stimulation. We observed diminished secretion of proinflammatory TNF-α in LPS activated BOMA cells stimulated with Excretory/Secretory products of adult fluke (Fh-ES). We also observed greater changes in gene expression in LPS activated BOMA cells than in non activated BOMA cells upon stimulation using Fh-ES. The results show possibility of using cell lines for in vitro research of bovine immune response against liver fluke, although this model still requires validation and further characterization.",

During routine molecular screening of apicomplexan parasites in reptiles using the 18S rRNA gene, we have amplified and sequenced Proteromonas parasites from three lizard hosts (less than 1% prevalence). We conducted phylogenetic analysis to confirm the taxonomic position and infer their relationships with other stramenopiles. Although our phylogeny is limited due to scarcity of molecular data on these protists, our results confirm they are closely related to Proteromonas lacertae. Our findings show that unexpected parasites can be amplified from host samples (blood and tissue) using general procedures to detect hemoparasites, and stress that positive PCR amplifications alone should not be considered as definitive proof of infection by particular parasites. Further validation by sequence confirmation and thorough phylogenetic assessment will not only avoid false positives and biased prevalence estimates but also provide valuable information on the biodiversity and phylogenetic relationships of other parasitic organisms. More generally, our results illustrate the perils of general diagnosis protocols in parasitological studies and the need of cross-validation procedures.",

Leishmaniases are still endemic in China, especially in the west and northwest froniter regions. To revalue the preliminary phylogenetic results of Chinese Leishmania isolates, we amplified partial fragment of small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) and 7 spliced leader RNA (7SL RNA), then tested the phylogenetic relationships among Chinese Leishmania isolates and their relatives by analyzing SSU rRNA gene sequences and 7SL RNA gene sequences. 19 SSU RNA sequences and 9 7SL RNA sequences were obtained in our study, then analyzed with 42 SSU RNA sequences and 32 7SL RNA sequences retrieved from Genbank, respectively. In the Bayesian analysis of the SSU RNA gene, the isolate MHOM/CN/93/GS7 and the isolate IPHL/CN/77/XJ771 are members of Leishmania donovani complex, while the isolate MHOM/CN/84/JS1 clustered with Leishmania tropica.

Each centriole develops into a free flagellum orthogonal to a median cytoplasmic process. Later these flagella rotate and become parallel to the median cytoplasmic process, which already exhibits two electron-dense areas and spinelike bodies before its proximodistal fusion with the flagella. The final stage of the spermiogenesis is characterized by the constriction of the ring of arched membranes, giving rise to the young spermatozoon, which detaches from the residual cytoplasm. The mature spermatozoon of W. capitellata presents most of the classical characters reported in digenean spermatozoa such as two axonemes of different lengths of the 9 + “1” trepaxonematan pattern, nucleus, mitochondrion, two bundles of parallel cortical microtubules and granules of glycogen. However, some peculiarities such as two lateral expansions accompanied by external ornamentation of the plasma membrane and spinelike bodies characterize the mature sperm. Moreover, a new spermatological character is described for the first time, the so-called cytoplasmic ornamented buttons.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Eleven parasite taxa were found infecting 68 Atlantic chub mackerel, Scomber colias Gmelin, 1789 from the Canary Islands, Central North Atlantic. The most abundant parasites were the gill monogenean Pseudokuhnia minor (P = 54.4%), larval anisakid nematodes (P = 11.8%) in the body cavity, a larval tetraphyllidean infecting bile ducts (P = 8.8%) and didymozoid digeneans infecting the gills (P = 7.4%). No correlation between fish length and abundance of infection with these parasites was found. Within the Atlantic, the comparison of present results with previous reports on the occurrence of parasites in this fish host, might suggest that there is more than one population unit of Atlantic chub mackerel in the Eastern Atlantic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Heterakis is a genus of parasitic nematodes, the majority of which are found in ground-feeding birds and only rarely in mammals. The best-known species is Heterakis spumosa, a parasite associated with the cosmopolitan invasive rodent Rattus rattus of Asiatic origin. Heterakis dahomensis was described in 1911 as a parasite of the Gambian giant rat (Cricetomys gambianus) from Benin (Africa), subsequently synonymized to H. spumosa by Hall (1916). The study of helminths in African rodents is scarce and patchy. Since the original description of H. dahomensis, there have been only a few reports from Africa of species belonging to the genus Heterakis and the validity of this species has never in fact been confirmed or rejected. In the present study individual Heterakis spp. were collected from C. gambianus from Senegal. The morphological data taken point to differences between Heterakis dahomensis and H. spumosa, specifically in the number of tail papillae in males and in the vulva cuticular processes of females. In addition, molecular data revealed differences between these taxa and so H. dahomensis should be considered as a valid species. Moreover, recent changes in the systematics of the genus Cricetomys mean that it is now necessary to study the morphology and genetics of the Heterakis specimens collected from Cricetomys spp. (previously assigned to C. gambianus) in order to determine their taxonomic status as either H. dahomensis o H. spumosa.",

Staphylepis is the most similar genus but differs in its apical structure because of the presence of a rudimentary rostellum. Moreover, molecular phylogenetic analyses show that Staphylepis and Colibrilepis are not sister taxa.",

In the present study, faecal flotation and microscopy of parasite eggs was done on 31 foxes originating from two distant localities in Denmark, the city of Copenhagen in the north east part of the island Zealand and from the southern part of the peninsular Jutland. In total, eggs of Eucoleus boehmi were recovered from a surprisingly high number of foxes (n=22 samples; 71%). The findings represent the first observations of E. boehmi in Denmark, which is likely an overlooked infection of the upper respiratory tract of red foxes, which can be also found in other canids. Several morphological features of the eggs of E. boehmi can be used to distinguish it from other the closely related trichuroid eggs. Detecting cardiopulmonary parasites by faecal examination can be indicative of the presence of cardiopulmonary parasites based on the more sensitive post mortem analysis.",

Five samples of each species were selected for sequencing. Sixteen different internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences representing the seven species of Cylicocyclus were obtained. Sequence differences in the first internal transcribed spacer (ITS-1) among species was lower than that of the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS-2). Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using the combined ITS-1 and ITS-2 data sets from the present study and using reference sequences from the GenBank database. The MP and ML trees were similar in topology. The phylogenetic trees were divided into two clades. Clade I included 8 species of Cylicocyclus; within this group, Cylicocyclus leptostomus (Kotlan, 1920) is nested between different samples of Cylicocyclus ashworthi (LeRoux, 1924), suggesting C. ashworthi may represent a species complex. Clade II included Cylicocyclus elongatus (Looss, 1900) and Cylicocyclus ultrajectinus (Ihle, 1920); however, these two species always clustered with the comparative species (Petrovinema poculatum (Looss, 1900) and Poteriostomum imparidentatum Quiel, 1919), suggesting that C. elongatus and C. ultrajectinus represent members of other genera.",

The 791 bp GRA6 product was PCR amplified from the genomic DNA of different T. gondii Indian isolates, including the RH-IVRI strain. Tru1I restriction endonuclease based PCR-RFLP of GRA6 sequence produced polymorphic digestion pattern that discriminated the virulent RH-IVRI strain (as type I) from the moderately virulent local isolates as type III. The PCR amplicon of T. gondii GRA6 from RH-IVRI strain as well as from the local isolates were cloned in cloning vector and custom sequenced. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of T. gondii isolates were aligned with that of the type I, II and III strains (RH, BEVERLEY, ME49, C56, TONT and NED) available in public domain and analyzed in silico using MEGA version 4.0 software. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of GRA6 marker from the Indian isolates revealed a close genetic relationship with type III strains of T. gondii. Further, detection of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at positions 162 and 171 of the GRA6 marker, established the lineage of Indian isolates as type III. This is the first report on characterization of T. gondii lineage as type III in selective chicken population of India based on PCR-RFLP and sequence analysis of GRA6 gene.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Heterakidosis is a common parasitic infection caused in domestic birds by Heterakis species: Heterakis gallinarum , H. isolonche , and H. dispar . Among them, the best described species is H. gallinarum , noted mainly in gallinaceous birds. In waterfowl, H. dispar is the predominant species. The variations in morphology and host specificity qualify H. dispar as a different species, but the phylogenetic relationships between heterakids were unclear for a long time, because of a lack of H. dispar sequences. Methods The authors provided the molecular data for H. dispar and analyzed the obtained sequences of the partial 18S rRNA gene and region ITS1-5.8SrRNA-ITS2 with the homological sequences. Results The 18S rRNA PCR product of H. dispar was about 800 bp, and the ITS-5.8S-ITS2 PCR product was about 920 bp, noticeably smaller size compared to H. gallinarum product. The BLAST analysis of H. dispar 18S sequence showed a 99% similarity with the sequences of Heterakis gallinarum and Ascaridia galli , 98% with A. nymphii , but only 94% with the sequence of Heterakis sp. Our ITS sequence of H. dispar was almost identical to the H. isolonche isolate, there is only one nucleotide of difference among the 943 sites analyzed. It also showed a lower similarity to the ITS sequences of H. gallinarum (88%), H. spumosa (87%), and H. dahomensis (87%). Conclusions In our phylogenetic analysis, it is the first attempt at the reconstruction of relationships within this superfamily Heterakoidea based on 18S rDNA and ITS region.",

Tick infestation of red foxes in the regions of Košice, Prešov, Bratislava and Žilina was studied during the period 2017–2018. Ticks were collected from the fur of animals using tweezers and identified using appropriate keys. In total, 146 red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) were investigated. In total, 39 (26.7%) of animals were found to be infected with ticks from five species. Pholeoixodes ticks were found on 13 (3.4%) of the foxes: Ixodes hexagonus (Leach, 1815) on 5 specimens (3.4%), in the Košice, Prešov and Žilina regions; I. crenulatus (Koch, 1844) on 8 specimens (5.5%) in the Prešov and Bratislava regions; Ixodes ricinus (Linnaeus, 1758) collected from 25 (17.2%) foxes in every locality; Dermacentor reticulatus (Fabricius, 1794) from 5 foxes (3.4%) in the Košice, Prešov and Žilina regions; Haemaphysalis concinna (Koch, 1844), from 4 foxes (2.8%) from the Košice region. Ixodes hexagonus has been previously recorded in Slovakia. However, this is the first finding of I. crenulatus in the country. The morphological features of the I. crenulatus specimens found in Slovakia were identical to those of ticks described in Poland and descriptions given in identification keys.",

Methods Thirty adult Blattella germanica (12 males; 18 females) were trapped near Madrid, Spain. Expelled faecal pellets were collected in the laboratory over 5 days in two plastic containers. Protozoan cysts from one container were weighted and those in the other used for morphologically identification. Results Protozoan cysts/oocysts per gram of faecal pellet were: Nyctotherus sp. (0.0019/g), Entamoeba (0.0007/g), Balantidium coli (0.0001/g), Lophomonas blattarum (0.00038/g). Observation of 189 protozoan cysts/oocysts indicated the following prevalence: Nyctotherus sp. 65 (34.4%); Gregarina spp. 34 (18%); Entamoeba sp. 24 (12.7%); Cryptosporidium sp. 17 (9%); Coccidia 16 (8.4%); Lophomonas blattarum 13 (6.8%); Balantidium coli 4 (2.1%); and unclassified 16 (8.4%). Conclusion Lophomonas blattarum has previously been demonstrated in the gut of cockroaches, but this is the first assessment of the prevalence in Blattella germanica in faecal pellets. The presence of protozoa in faecal pellets provides some evidence for one step in a hypothesised route of respiratory infection whereby protozoa from household insects enter the respiratory tract.",

Thailand is a developing agricultural country located in Southeast Asia. Livestock developments particularly in dairy cows of this country have been hampered by low productivity including milk and slow growth rate due to the impact of many pathogens including N. caninum. Currently, there is no effective method for control of neosporosis since there is less information regarding current status of infections. The objective of this study was to investigate the seroprevalence of neosporosis in dairy cows of the northern part of Thailand. During 2006–2007, the sera of 642 cows from 42 small farm holders with the top three highest consensus of dairy farms in the northern provinces, such as Chiang Rai, Chiang Mai and Lumpang were collected and performed tests. Antibodies to N. caninum were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with recombinant N. caninum surface antigen 1 (NcSAG1) and indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT). The overall prevalence of N. caninum infection in this study was 46.9% (301/642) by ELISA and 34.3% (220/642) by IFAT.",

In the context of epidemiological studies on livestock in Egypt, this report investigated the spread of Theileria annulata among diseased farm cows (Bos indicus) over one year. Blood samples collected from 130 cows were investigated by routine staining and 64 samples were investigated by PCR assay using two different probes targeting tams-1 gene. Microscopy revealed the infection of 33.8% of animals with Theileria while PCR detected infection in 51% of animals with one primer pair and the other primer pair detected the infection in 31% of animals. Combined PCR results indicated the infection of 68.8% of animals with T. annulata. Seasonal fluctuation of parasite infection was evident with the highest infection percentage and prevalence recorded during summer based on both microscopy and PCR data. For the first time, the current study reports the presence of two T. annulata isolates based on tams-1 gene partial sequence in Egypt. Targeting polymorphic genes for parasite detection may result in underestimation of infection and target gene diversity has to be considered. The high infection with these pathogens in the clinically ill cows necessitates implementing serious programs to minimize their economic burden on the Egyptian farming industry.",

Larvae of the Tetraphyllidea differ from each other in the morphology of their scoleces and represent five forms.

Only one species of the family Onchobothriidae, Onchobothrium antarcticum, has been described from Antarctica and larvae with trilocular bothridia were assigned to this cestode species. In this study, ten larvae obtained from Notothenia rossii and three adult specimens of Onchobothrium antarcticum isolated from Bathyraja eatonii were examined. A partial sequence of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 of three adult specimens and four larvae was identical. The remaining six larval sequences differed from the sequences obtained from adult cestodes. Partial sequences of lsrDNA of all analyzed larvae were identical. These results confirm the taxonomic affiliation of the larvae with trilocular bothridia parasitizing marbled rockcod in Antarctica as Onchobothrium antarcticum.",

    "abstract": "Despite Madagascar's high amphibian diversity of more than 400 species, only a few polystome species are known from the island. The dissection of frogs from museum collections, together with amphibian and parasite surveys conducted in Madagascar led to the discovery of an undescribed polystome infecting Aglyptodactylus madagascariensis. The purpose of this study is to formally describe this species.Polystomes recovered from A. madagascariensis were stained (Acetocarmine) and mounted (Canada balsam) to facilitate morphometrics and taxonomic drawings. Some specimens were fixed in absolute alcohol, a Bayesian tree inferred from the analysis of concatenated 18S, 28S and COI gene sequences was constructed and pairwise distances were calculated. Parasites collected from archived hosts in museums were used for histology and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).Polystomes recovered from A. madagascariensis display characteristics of the genus Metapolystoma and morphologically differed from all other known metapolystomes. The Bayesian phylogeny shows that Metapolystoma n. sp. ex. A. madagascariensis and M. falcatum are sister species with high Bayesian posterior probability. Histological and SEM investigations contributed to morphological descriptions.Morphological examination supported by phylogenetic analysis and genetic divergences revealed distinct differences from all known metapolystome species, supporting the description of a new species. Differences between the life cycles of Metapolystoma and Polystoma provided additional evidence for the validity of that genus as taxon. Whereas Polystoma may display ovoviviparity on rare occasions after incomplete egg expulsion towards the end of the breeding season, Metapolystoma displays true ovoviviparity. We emphasize the need for parasite surveys in Madagascar and recommended for museum material to be examined for polystomes to provide supplementary material and localities for further field investigation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective The aim of this study was to identify Echinococcus species by morphological and molecular means. Methods A dead gray wolf ( Canis lupus ) was found near Erzurum province and brought to the parasitology laboratory. Sedimentation and counting technique (SCT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis were conducted. Results The SCT implications indicated that the wolf had a substantial worm burden (62,720 and 49,280 parasites) due to a co-infection of E. granulosus s.l. and E. multilocularis. Genus/species-specific PCR was used to analyze DNA extracted from adult worms and confirmed as E. granulosus s.s. and E. multilocularis , utilizing COI and 12S rRNA gene sequence analysis, respectively. Conclusion This report presents the first co-detection of E. granulosus s.s. and E. multilocularis in a gray wolf found in an urban area in a highly endemic area for human echinococcosis in northeastern Turkey. The results emphasize that AE is not only a problem of rural areas, but also occurs in urban areas, which may pose a threat to public health. Therefore, surveillance in urban areas is crucial. The need to develop new control strategies for domestic and wildlife in the study area is also highlighted.",

R. kanagurta was parasitised by Diplosentis nudus (Harada, 1938) Pichelin et Cribb, 2001 (Acanthocephala, Cavisomidae), and S. luridus by Sclerocollum rubrimaris Schmidt et Paperna, 1978 (Acanthocephala, Cavisomidae). The infection of R. kanagurta was followed monthly for one year (from September, 2004 to August, 2005). As a result, the seasonal cycle of D. nudus in its definitive host is described herein for the first time. The cycle is well-defined and extends for about 11 months (from October to August); in October, new generation of D. nudus starts to appear in the intestine of R. kanagurta; during the winter, the juvenile worms continued their growth; during the spring, most of the worms attained maturity and the mature worms copulated; during the summer, the worms began to die off naturally prior to their elimination from the intestine of the host. Sclerocollum rubrimaris is redescribed and Sclerocollum Schmidt et Paperna, 1978 is retained as a valid genus within the Cavisomidae.",

Only mature sarcocysts, measuring up to 2 mm in length and up to 750 μm in width, were observed. The sarcocyst wall was smooth. The villar protrusions on the sarcocyst wall were up to 5 μm long and up to 1.1 μm wide; they were folded over the sarcocyst wall giving a thin-walled appearance. The microtubules in villar protrusions were smooth and confined to villar protrusions. Bradyzoites in sections were 5.4–6.6 × 1.3–2.0 μm in size. Sequencing the small subunit and first internal transcribed spacer portions of ribosomal DNA related this parasite to, but distinguished it from, previously characterized species of Sarcocystis that encyst in the musculature of birds and complete their sexual development in New World opossums of the genus Didelphis. This evidence suggests that the parrot may have acquired its infection from an opossum from which it suffered a debilitating attack a year prior to the onset of depression, anorexia, and ultimately death.",

The new species is described and its opisthaptoral hard parts compared to those of G. derjavini. Our molecular analysis of G. derjavinoides and G. derjavini confirmed that the morphological differences between them are species differences and not intraspecific variations. Phylogenetic analysis using the ITS rDNA region placed both species within the subgenus G. (Limnonephrotus) and within the G. wageneri-group, quite in accordance with morphological results. The two species, however, did not cluster as sister taxa. The correspondence between molecular-based clades within G. (Limnonephrotus) and the morphological shapes of marginal hooks within these clades are discussed. The importance of combined molecular and morphological analyses when describing or redescribing Gyrodactylus species is stressed.",

In this study, a complete open reading frame of oligopeptidase B-2 from Leishmania amazonensis (PH8 strain) was amplified by PCR using primers designed for the oligopeptidase B-2 gene of L. major. The 2,715 bp fragment coded for a protein of 905 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 103,918.9 Da and theoretical pI of 5.82. The encoded protein displayed ∼96% identity with L. major and ∼75% identity with Trypanosoma cruzi and T. brucei oligopeptidases B-2, and ∼21% identity with Escherichia coli and L. amazonensis classical oligopeptidase B. An unusual C-terminal extension was found in relation to the classical trypanosomatid oligopeptidase B. By sequence alignment, we determined a catalytic triad (Ser 629, Asp 717 and His 758), S1 subsite (Glu 674 and Glu 676) and suggest a difference in the S2 subsite of L. amazonensis oligopeptidase B-2. We also found that the oligopeptidase B-2 gene is expressed in all cycle stages of L. amazonensis. A phylogenetic analysis indicated that oligopeptidase B-2 is a new member of oligopeptidase B.",

A total of 233 Ixodes ricinus (L.) ticks (76 larvae and 157 nymphs) was found on 31 of 235 captured lizards (13.2%). The tick infestation is relatively low compared to that of mammals and passerine birds from the same area (Siński et al. 2006, Gryczyńska et al. 2002). Tick infestation depended on the month of capture, being the highest in spring. In autumn no ticks were recorded on any of the captured lizards. The oldest lizards carried the highest number of ticks but no differences related to sex of the host were found. All the collected ticks were analysed by PCR for the presence of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, the etiological agents of Lyme disease. Spirochetes were detected in 11 out of 233 (4.7%) ticks tested. Genetic analysis confirmed that the spirochetes are members of the Borrelia afzelii, B. garinii and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto genospecies. Mixed infection were not detected. The prevalence of infection was analysed in relation to months of the capture, age and sex of the lizards, but differences were not statistically significant. The obtained results suggest that lizards are probably not B. burgdorferi reservoirs, but further studies are required to confirm this.",

The new species is characterized mainly by the length of spicules (84–90 and 72–87 μm) and the length (54 μm) and structure of the gubernaculum in the male, and by the presence of three large oesophageal teeth protruding from the mouth, the number and arrangement of small cephalic papillae (8 papillae in 4 pairs of external circle and 6 single papillae of internal circle), the length (1.09–1.50 mm) and structure of the oesophagus and two large papilla-like caudal projections, and by the length of their bodies (19.34–30.07 mm). Philometra morii is the third species of this genus reported from E. morio in the Gulf of Mexico, differing from the two previously described species, in addition to morphological features, by the site of infection in this host (mouth cavity and sinuses vs oculo-orbits or gonads). From the same region (northern Gulf of Mexico, off Florida), gravid females of Philometra Costa, 1845, morphologically and biometrically similar to those of P. morii, were found in the subcutaneous tissues and sinuses of the head of another serranid fish (gag), Mycteroperca microlepis (Good et Bean).

Each embryonated egg is composed of a miracidium surrounded by three envelopes: (1) the egg shell, (2) the outer and (3) inner envelopes. Egg envelopes play an important role in the protection, metabolism, storage of nutritive reserves and the general biology of the M. jourdanei egg. The inner envelope is characterised by large, flattened nuclei, and its syncytial cytoplasm contains a heavy accumulation of glycogen, lipid droplets, mitochondria and large vesicles. These traits indicate that this layer has the features of a metabolically-active syncytial layer with an energy storage capability. In the infective eggs observed before the hatching of the miracidium, areas of so-called “focal cytoplasmic degradation” were frequently observed, which may be involved in the autolytic process of all components of this envelopes.",

Aquatic organisms typically exhibit this heterogeneous distribution but to date little is known about the distribution of many common parasite species within water bodies.

Different fish species exhibited differences in their louse burdens (prevalence and intensity). The highest prevalence of A. foliaceus was observed on fish species dominated by larger individuals (i.e. Cyprinus carpio, Abramis brama and Tinca tinca). C. carpio and A. brama also exhibited the highest mean louse intensities. Infested fish were generally heavier than uninfested conspecifics. Differences in the weight of uninfested and infested fish were significant (P&lt;0.05) for the whole fish community samples and the Scardinius erythrophthalmus, A. brama and C. carpio samples. There was also a general pattern of increasing infestation intensity with an increase in host body weight, with significant correlations for the whole fish community for S. erythrophthalmus, A. brama and C. carpio samples. In addition there were significant differences in parasite prevalence and intensity between different host weight groups and larger (heavier) fish appeared to be more prone to infestation by A. foliaceus.",

(Brachylaimidae), Catenotaenia chabaudi (Catenotaeniidae), Protospirura muricola (Spiruridae), Dermatoxys getula and Syphacia pallaryi (Oxyuuridae), and Trichostrongylus sp. (Trichostrongylidae). We report for the first time the presence of P. muricola, Trichostrongylus sp. and Brachylaima sp. in A. getulus. Brachylaima sp. was found in the insular population only, as a result of a diet that includes snails. The two oxyurids were found at both sites. The continental population showed higher species richness (5 vs 3 species). This is the first report of helminth parasites from A. getulus from the Canary Islands.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Neospora caninum negatively impacts bovine reproductive performance around the world. Addressing this problem requires a greater understanding of the parasite’s molecular biology. In this study, monoclonal antibodies against recombinant proteins were successfully developed and employed to characterise two different proteins of N. caninum: the acute phase-associated NcGRA7 and the chronic phase-associated NcSAG4. Immunofluorescence with the anti-rNcGRA7 monoclonal antibody suggested that NcGRA7 trafficks from tachyzoite dense granules to the matrix of the parasitophorous vacuole and parasite’s surroundings. Furthermore, NcGRA7 is also expressed in the bradyzoite stage and localised on the matrix of bradyzoite-positive vacuoles. NcGRA7 appears to be partially involved in the tachyzoite-invasion mechanisms, as an anti-rNcGRA7 monoclonal antibody partially inhibited in vitro tachyzoite-invasion. A monoclonal antibody specific for NcSAG4 confirmed this protein’s bradyzoitespecific expression both by western blot and immunofluorescence. However, some bradyzoite-positive vacuoles only weakly expressed NcSAG4, if it was expressed at all. The specificity of the anti-rNcSAG4 monoclonal antibody was confirmed by the recognition of the NcSAG4 in the membrane surface of Nc-1SAG4c transgenic tachyzoites, which constitutively expresses NcSAG4. Blocking NcSAG4 of Nc-1SAG4c tachyzoites with the monoclonal antibody did not affect host cell invasion. However, its implication on the host cell adhesion or host immune evasion should not be discarded.",

Molecular methods were used to confirm their identity and analyze genetic variations compared with published data for this species.

PCR amplification and sequence analysis of 18S rDNA (1472 bp), ITS regions (1218 bp), cox1 (885 bp), and nad5 (1028 bp) revealed that these four sequences showed more than 99% identity to reference sequences for D. latum, confirming that this species is D. latum. To date, a total of 12 diphyllobothriosis cases have been documented in China. This study represents the first molecular characterization of D. latum in China, providing molecular evidence of human diphyllobothriosis in China.",

Each GER-body is surrounded by numerous free ribosomes, polyribosomes, α-glycogen rosettes and large mitochondria. Results of cytochemical analysis by means of PATSC-SP test for polysaccharides indicated that glycogen is absent within the GER-bodies, however, a strongly positive reaction was observed only in large aggregations of α-glycogen rosettes and β-glycogen particles, localised usually near GER-bodies.",

Recently in Japan a Kudoa species, K. septempunctata, was newly implicated as a causative agent of unidentified food poisoning related to the consumption of raw olive flounder. Other marine fishery products are also suspected as causative raw foods of unidentified food poisoning. For this study, we detected kudoid parasites from sliced raw muscle tissues of a young Pacific bluefin and an adult yellowfin tuna. No cyst or pseudocyst was evident in muscles macroscopically, but pseudocysts were detected in both samples histologically. One substitution (within 1100 bp overlap) and ten substitutions (within 753 bp overlap) were found respectively between the partial sequences of 18S and 28S rDNAs from both isolates. Nucleotide sequence similarity searching of 18S and 28S rDNAs from both isolates showed the highest identity with those of K. neothunni from tuna. Based on the spore morphology, the mode of parasitism, and the nucleotide sequence similarity, these isolates from a Pacific bluefin and a yellowfin tuna were identified as K. neothunni. Phylogenetic analysis of the 28S rDNA sequence revealed that K. neothunni is classifiable into two genotypes: one from Pacific bluefin and the other from yellowfin tuna. Recently, an unidentified kudoid parasite morphologically and genetically similar K. neothunni were detected from stocked tuna samples in unidentified food poisoning cases in Japan. The possibility exists that K. neothunni, especially from the Pacific bluefin tuna, causes food poisoning, as does K. septempunctata.",

The activities of erythrocyte GSH-Px, SOD, CAT and TAC were significantly lower (p<0.05) in the infected goats than in healthy ones. MDA concentration in erythrocytes of infected goats was significantly higher in infected goats than in healthy ones (p<0.05). Severity of parasitemia showed a positive correlation with the MDA and negative correlation with PCV, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px and TAC. Also, MDA was negatively correlated with PCV, SOD, CAT, GSH-Px and TAC. The results of this study suggested that oxidative damage to RBCs may contribute to the pathogenesis of anemia in caprine babesiosis.",

As larvae, they are found in the connective tissue or body cavities of freshwater fish. In Japan, E. ignotus and E. tubifex have been found in three avian species, but their distribution in intermediate and paratenic hosts remains unclear. For this study, 16 commercial raw Japanese smelts, Hypomesus transpacificus nipponensis, were used for parasitological examination. A pinkish red worm collected from the abdominal wall of one smelt (6.3%) was identified as E. ignotus based on the high sequence similarity (99.9%) of the partial 18S ribosomal RNA gene and the morphology of its cephalic and caudal ends. Furthermore, a Raphidascaris-like nematode was found in the intestines of five smelts examined (31.3%) and was identified as R. gigi in view of the absence of lateral cuticular alae. Eustrongylides ignotus and R. gigi have been reported in various freshwater fish, but not in smelts. Therefore, this finding of E. ignotus and R. gigi in H. transpacificus nipponensis represents a new host record.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic parasite capable of infecting a wide range of hosts. Free-range chickens are important sentinels in the epidemiology of this parasite as they feed from the ground and are likely to ingest oocysts shed in the faeces of infected cats. Atypical strains of T. gondii are known to dominate in South America where they are associated with more severe disease in humans, yet relatively little is known about the strains circulating in neighbouring Caribbean islands. In this study, hearts and brains were collected from free-range chickens in Antigua and Barbuda (n = 45), Dominica (n = 76) and Trinidad (n = 41), and DNA was extracted for nested ITS1 PCR and PCR–RFLP. Sera were collected and screened for antibodies using the modified agglutination test (MAT). Antibodies to T. gondii were detected in 20.5, 38.2 and 17.1% of chickens in Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica and Trinidad, respectively. Toxoplasma gondii DNA was also detected by PCR in 24.4, 17.1 and 17.1% of chickens, respectively, giving an overall prevalence of 31.1, 42.1, and 29.3% for each of the 3 island nations. Results of PCR–RFLP revealed 2 new atypical genotypes (designated ToxoDB #281 and #282) and one Type III (ToxoDB #2) in chickens from Antigua. Partial genotyping of a further 8 isolates (7 from Antigua and one from Trinidad) revealed different allele-types at five or more markers for 7 of the isolates, suggesting atypical genotypes. This is the first study to report the prevalence of T. gondii in free-range chickens in Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica and Trinidad and Tobago. It is also the first to report the presence of atypical genotypes in Antigua and Barbuda and Trinidad and Tobago.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Hookworms are blood feeding intestinal nematodes that infect more than 500 million people and cause iron deficiency anemia. Infected children suffer from physical and cognitive growth retardation. Because of potential anthelminthic drug resistance, the need for vaccine development is urgent. Numerous antigens have been tested in animal models as vaccines against hookworm infection, but there is no effective human vaccine. We cloned a cDNA encoding Ancylostoma ceylanicum metalloprotease 6 (Acemep-6). Ace-MEP-6 is a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 101.87 kDa and based on computational analysis it is very likely to be engaged in food processing via hemoglobin digestion. Groups of hamsters were immunized with an Ace-mep-6 cDNA vaccine, either once or three times. Animals that were administered one dose developed high resistance (80%, p &lt; 0.01) against challenge infection, whereas triple immunization resulted in no worm burden reduction. These results suggest that DNA vaccines can be powerful tools in ancylostomiasis control, although the mechanisms through which protection is conferred remain unclear.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about cryptosporidiosis in turtles of invasive alien species (IAS) inhabiting European bodies of fresh water. In this article, we report an occurrence of Cryptosporidium parvum in a red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans) captured in a rural aquatic ecosystem in eastern Poland. A pair of samples consisting of feces and scrapings of intestinal mucosa (taken during necropsy) were collected from 104 animals representing the four IAS turtle species red-eared slider, yellow-bellied slider, false map and Cumberland slider. The animals were trapped in running and standing freshwater ecosystems across the Lublin province. Parasite genomic DNA was extracted from samples using a modified alkali wash and a heat-lysis method and identification of the Cryptosporidium species was performed at the 18SSU rRNA and COWP loci. The presence of Cryptosporidium DNA was only detected in one sample of intestinal scraping collected from a red-eared slider. A phylogenetic analysis of a 18SSU rRNA gene fragment showed 100% sequence identity between the C. parvum strain isolated from the turtle and other C. parvum strains previously detected in cattle from the Lublin province. There was no clinical evidence that the red-eared slider turtle was truly infected rather than being merely a mechanical parasite carrier. Sporadic detection of this protozoan parasite in the studied population of IAS turtles could be associated with low natural occurrence of Cryptosporidium infections in this animal species. The results provide evidence for possible transmission of zoonotic Cryptosporidium species by IAS turtles.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study investigated the factors (i.e., season, locality, sampling year, total length and maturity stage of the hosts) that might influence the structure of parasite populations and communities in the clingfish Gobiesox marmoratus. The parasite community was described and analyzed using numerical descriptors, such as prevalence, intensity and species richness, between factors previously mentioned. A total of 260 clingfish were collected from 2 localities of central Chile, four seasons and during 3 year cycles (from July 2006 to July 2009). In the whole clingfish sample, 668 parasites were found, which belonged to 14 parasite taxa; 9 of them were new records in G. marmoratus. Parasite infracommunity richness ranged 0–3 species, although 1 trematode species, Helicometrina nimia, represented 80% of all parasites collected and was the most abundant and prevalent parasite species. The average of parasite abundance and intensity (± SD) was 2.5 ± 8.2 and 7.5 ± 12.7, respectively. Generalized linear model showed that parasite communities were influenced by season, locality, sampling year, and maturity stage when considering the abundance and intensity of parasites. For the parasite richness, only the locality and maturity of fish was determinant for explaining the differences. The populations and communities of the parasite variations were variable due to differences in fish body length because prevalence, abundance and intensity of parasites significantly correlated with the fish body length. Concordantly, maturity fish were longer than immature fish. Thus, clingfish from El Tabo were longest and mature, which harbored higher parasite richness than those fish from Las Cruces.",

Here we present the first description of the leech in southern Spain (Andalusia) in association with a small fragmented population of fresh-water turtles in which E. orbicularis and Mauremys leprosa coexist. Unusually, the leech was found attached to the carapace of a male M. leprosa.",

New details on morphology were recorded. The ultrastructural study revealed that the tegument of A. tubarium had a syncytial organization with a distal cytoplasm lying over a basal matrix and cytons. The surface of the tegument is covered with pectinate spines arranged quincuncially. As anterior-posterior differences were observed, particular attention was given to spines. Spines decrease in size and density from the anterior part of body to posterior part. Two types of sensory structures were identified, uniciliated and dome-shaped. Type 1 sensory receptors were outgrowths bearing groups of papillae with shorter and rigid apical seta visible on the anterior part of body surface, encircling the worm. Type 2 sensory receptors was dome-shaped papillae devoid of cilia, found mainly around the oral sucker. Diagrams of spines and sensory receptors were made to help in understanding the nature of these structures. Surface morphology may prove to be useful in distinguishing Aphallus spp with other Cryptogonimidae.",

The new species was also characterized using molecular methods by sequencing and analysing the small subunit (18S) and the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS-2) of nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA). In addition, Cucullanus muraenesocis (Yin et Zhang, 1983) was regarded a homonym of C. muraenesocis Yamaguti, 1961, and a new name, Cucullanus wangi nom. nov. was given to it.",

In this study, cases of thrombocytopenia and haemoglobinemia were more prominent in subjects infected with Plasmodium falciparum (Welch, 1897) than those with Plasmodium vivax (Grassi et Feletti, 1890). However, anaemia, jaundice, convulsions and acute renal failure were significantly high (3–4 times) in subjects infected with P. falciparum than those infected with P. vivax. The incidence of splenomegaly and neurological sequelae were 2 and 6 times higher in P. falciparum infections compared to the infections of P. vivax. Both in P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria, the cases of splenomegaly, jaundice and neurological sequelae were almost double in children (&lt;10 years) compared to older patients. The liver enzymes were generally in normal range in cases of low and mild infections. However, the AST, ALT, ALP activities and serum bilirubin, creatinine, and the urea content were increased in P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria patients having high parasitaemia, confirming liver dysfunction and renal failures in few cases of severe malaria both in India and Saudi Arabia.",

The present study investigated the efficacy of ginger ( Zingiber officinale ), garlic ( Allium sativum), and pomegranate ( Punica granatum ) peel extracts on the development and progression of experimental cryptosporidiosis in mice. Methods Eighty-two mice were assigned to 6 groups: control, infected non-treated, metronidazole (MTZ), ginger, garlic, and pomegranate. The control group topically received no treatments. The infected non-treated group was experimentally infected by 10 4 C. parvum oocysts per mouse using a stomach tube. The MTZ group was infected with C. parvum oocysts combined with MTZ (50 mg/kg b.w./day). The ginger, garlic, and pomegranate groups daily received different plant extracts at doses of 100 mg/kg BW, 50 mg/kg BW, and 3 gm/kg BW, respectively, followed by infection with C. parvum oocysts. All treatments were applied orally one day after the infection for continuous 30 days. Results Histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations for P53 and caspase-3 expressions in stomach and spleen tissues showed that MTZ and garlic-treated mice had a more significant effect on infected mice. Conclusion The garlic extract was found to exert a more pronounced effect on infected mice compared with the other treatments as well as to improve health. Garlic extracts, therefore, represent an effective and natural therapeutic alternative for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis with low side effects and without drug resistance.",

Methods 51 birds of 18 species from seven orders previously reported as definitive hosts of the Clinostomum spp. were collected. Identification of the species was made by morphological characteristics and partial sequence of the cox 1 gene. Results This study concludes that Ardea alba and Ardea cinerea were infected with Clinostomum complanatum , while Ardea purpurea was infected with Clinostomum tilapiae . Conclusion Clinostomum complanatum has been reported for the first time in the definitive hosts in Turkey. This study is the first molecular report of C. tilapiae in definitive hosts and the first report in Turkey. The present work indicates that Clinostomum species in the Afrotropic and Palearctic regions can also be found in Turkey.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose In the present study, the effects of leaf and rhizome extracts of Arum rupicola Boiss rupicola were searched on the infective stage Toxocara canis larvae (L3) in the experimentally infected mice. Methods Four-six week-old male BALB/c mice were divided into eight groups (G1-8, each group consisted of 7 mice), and they were infected orally with 500 T. canis eggs with L3. After 24 h, the following treatment protocol was applied to the groups for five days: G-1: Albendazole (ABZ) (100 mg/kg), G-2: Leaf Extract (10 mg/mL) + ABZ (100 mg/kg), G-3: Leaf Extract (40 mg/mL) + ABZ (100 mg/kg), G-4: Rhizome Extract + ABZ (100 mg/kg), G-5: Leaf Extract (10 mg/mL), G-6: Leaf Extract (40 mg/mL), G-7: Rhizome extract, G-8: Negative control. The necropsy was performed on the 45th day of experimental infection. Results The rhizome extract significantly reduced the effectiveness of ABZ compared to leaf extracts. The number of larvae in rhizome extract-treated mice (G7) was similar to ABZ-treated mice (G1) ( P &lt; 0.05). The larval number in mice administered leaf extract (10 mg/mL and 40 mg/mL) was slightly decreased. But no significant difference was detected in the larval number depending on the dose of leaf extracts ( P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion The administration of the leaf and rhizome extracts did not contribute to the effectiveness of ABZ. Also the effect of ABZ on the larvae number obtained from the tissues was reduced by the rhizome extract. The larvae number in the group in which rhizome extract was given alone was almost close to the group in which ABZ was administered. The results provide insight for further research on the antiparasitic properties of A. rupicola Boiss rupicola rhizome extract.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The thyroid gland is one of the most vital endocrine organs. It is responsible for the synthesis and secretion of hormones principally triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4). These hormones play a significant role in the functions and the metabolism of the body. The thyroid gland could be affected by several infections, among them Toxoplasma gondii . Congenital toxoplasmosis took place when the parasite reached the developing fetus and infected any nucleated cells within it. This study assessed the effect of experimental congenital toxoplasmosis on the thyroid gland structure and function. Methods We used 34 Wistar rats and allocated them into two groups: normal control group (17 rats) and congenital toxoplasmosis group (17 rats). After euthanasia, the brain and the thyroid gland was assessed through histopathological examination. Thyroid functions examination was performed through measuring the serum levels of T3, thyroxine T4, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Moreover, serum levels of thyroid antibodies [thyroid-peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab) and anti-thyroglobulin (TG-Ab)] were examined. Results The examination of thyroid tissues of the congenital toxoplasmosis group showed decreased or absent colloid secretion. About 47.1% of follicles showed degeneration with different grades. Parafollicular cells hyperplasia were observed in 23.6% of specimens. The serum concentrations of T3, T4, and TSH were significantly higher in congenital toxoplasmosis group than the control group. The congenital toxoplasmosis group had lower serum concentrations of TPO-Abs than the control group. Conclusion These results indicated that congenital Toxoplasma infection could result in a central hyperthyroidism state with alteration of thyroid gland structure in offspring.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The freshwater snails Biomphalaria alexandrina and Bulinus trancatus are key contributors to the transmission of S. mansoni and S. haematobium , respectively, for being their intermediate hosts. Objectives This research study aimed to investigate the potency of the nucleoproteins (NPs) extracted from both snail species on the host immune reactions as an approach to developing a potential vaccine. Methods Three groups of six-week-old Swiss-Webster mice ( n = 18; 15–20 g each) were injected intraperitoneally for three consecutive weeks with single doses (once a week) of B. alexandrina , B. truncatus , or a mixture of their nucleoproteins (50 µg each). On day 21st, the nucleoprotein-treated mice altogether, with six more mice, received subcutaneously S. mansoni cercariae (60/mouse). Eight weeks later, the experimental mice were sacrificed for evaluation of certain parasitological, molecular and immunological responses. Results The data of mice immunized with the various types of nucleoproteins showed a significant increase of FAS/R gene expressions in hepatic tissues and anti-IgG antibody levels in sera on the one hand and a significant decrease of worm loads and β-actin/R gene expression levels on the other hand when compared to the infected control mice. Conclusion These findings highlight the role of snails in immunomodulation and shed light on the possibility of antagonizing effects that might occur when the nucleoproteins of different species are mixed. Moreover, this research study might promote the literature spotting the importance of snail proteins against schistosomiasis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Trichinellosis affects around 11 million people globally. Treatments for this medical condition are limited by adverse effects and resistance, emphasising the importance of effective and safe therapies. Consequentially, we sought to study colchicine’s synergistic effects with atorvastatin or acetazolamide in the treatment of Trichinella spiralis ( T. spiralis) -infected mice. Methods Seventy mice were evenly divided into two groups (a and b) of 35 each. During the intestinal phase, group (a) began therapy on the second day post-infection (dpi) and lasted four days. Group (b) had treatment for four weeks during the muscle phase, beginning on the 12th dpi. While the other five infected groups received atorvastatin, colchicine, acetazolamide, a combination of acetazolamide and colchicine, or none, one group of infected mice received no treatment at all as a negative control. The efficacy was assessed by parasite count, histopathology and scanning electron microscopy. Results Our data revealed that the combination treatment lowered T. spiralis adult worm and larvae counts in infected animals. Moreover, it restored the normal intestinal and muscular architecture, reduced edema, and alleviated inflammation, as demonstrated by reduced inflammatory infiltrate. Scanning electron microscopic examination of adults and larvae verified our findings. Conclusion Adjuvant treatment with colchicine as an antifibrotic can help treat muscle trichinellosis by reducing the production of fibrous tissue. This might help to enhance treatment results by enabling the admission of larvicidal medications and, as a result, reducing the number of larvae in the muscle, which together form the basis of pathology and can be debilitating for the patient.",

Only nine out of the 62 species in the genus have been reported from the Americas, and from them, only two have been sequenced. Methods We analyzed two species of Mugil (L.) from Northern Yucatán Peninsula. Specimens of Ligophorus were sampled from the gills of their hosts. The morphology of the specimens was examined. In addition, 28S and ITS rDNA sequences were obtained and compared with previous sequences downloaded from GenBank. Results We discovered two species of Ligophorus using morphological and molecular characters, L. mediterraneus , parasitizing the stripped mullet Mugil cephalus off the coast of Celestún, and L. yucatanensis , parasitizing the silver mullet M. curema in four coastal lagoons. Sequence data of the latter species are reported for the first time. Conclusion Our findings showed that two species of Ligophorus occur in mugilids of the Yucatán Peninsula. One represents a widely distributed marine species with records in the Mediterranean Sea and the Yucatán Peninsula, whereas the second one, L. yucatanensis , represents an endemic species restricted to coastal lagoons of the Yucatán Peninsula.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), is an invasive and a highly polyphagous species with a strong dispersal capacity. Unfortunately, there is currently no effective control method that can prevent or reduce the economic loss caused by this pest. Among natural enemies, microsporidia cause infections in insects so that they can generally shorten life span, reduce fertility and inhibit growth. Methods Current study involved field study, light and electron microscopy and molecular phylogenic analyses of a microsporidian pathogen in the populations of H. halys in Türkiye. Results The microsporidian infection were mostly observed in malpighian tubules and fatty tissue filled with high spore density. Fresh uninucleate spores are oval, measued as 3.73 × 2.01 µm in dimensions. The mature spore wall is relatively thick and measures 75–85 nm and consists of a clear endospore (40–50 nm) and an electron-dense, uniform, thin exospore (25–30 nm). The polar filament is isofilar, 85–110 mm in diameter and has 7–8 coils. It is found to be most closely related to Nosema maddoxi isolate Mn.6 isolated from H. halys in Georgia in phylogenetic tree. Conclusion The spore morphology and structural features of the isolate from H. halys identify it as Nosema maddoxi . The phylogenetic analyses confirm both light and electron microscopic observations. This is the first microsporidian record from H. halys and also from the order Hemiptera in Türkiye. It is also confirmed that the invasive pest, H. halys carries its natural pathogen, N. maddoxi to new geographical locations during its distribution.",

    "abstract": "Malaria remains a major global health challenge, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), contributing substantially to mortality and morbidity rates. In resource-limited settings, access to specialized diagnostic tests is often restricted, making basic blood analysis a valuable diagnostic tool. This study investigated the correlation between malaria infection and full blood count values in a rural region of Ghana during the 2022 rainy season, aiming to highlight diagnostic insights available from routine blood analyses. A retrospective case-control analysis was conducted on 544 confirmed malaria cases, comparing their blood values with those of matched malaria-negative controls. Parasitaemia levels peaked during the rainy season, with July showing the highest values. Malaria-positive patients exhibited lower levels of haemoglobin, white blood cells, lymphocytes, and platelets, but higher neutrophil counts compared to controls. Middle-aged women had significantly lower haemoglobin levels than men, and younger individuals showed higher parasitaemia levels. A negative correlation was found between Plasmodium density and haemoglobin and platelet counts, while positive correlations were observed with white blood cell and neutrophil counts. This study highlights the significant burden of malaria in rural Ghana during the rainy season and underscores the impact of infection on blood values. Routine full blood count analysis provides a practical and accessible diagnostic tool in resource-limited settings. The findings emphasise the importance of targeted interventions for high-risk groups, particularly children and women, to improve patient management and reduce malaria-related morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Understanding parasite diversity in wild and captive animal populations is vital for their individual health and ecosystem dynamics. The helminth community in mountain gazelles (Gazella gazella Pallas, 1766), particularly in the isolated northernmost population in Türkiye, remains poorly understood, posing challenges for conservation. This study aimed to identify and compare the diversity of helminths in captive and free-ranging mountain gazelles in Hatay, Türkiye, while assessing potential zoonotic risks. We collected a total of 188 fresh fecal samples from both captive and free-ranging populations. The samples were analyzed using DNA metabarcoding to assess helminth species and their species diversity across seasons. Our findings revealed eight helminth taxa in Gazella gazella, including six intestinal and two lung nematodes, with four of these species previously unreported in Türkiye. We also found seasonal differences in helminth composition and abundance. The identification of these helminth taxa highlights the value of advanced molecular techniques in uncovering parasite diversity in ungulates. Seasonal differences in helminth composition and abundance, and the biological characteristics of the detected helminth species align with the climatic parameters of the seasons in which they were identified.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Anaplasmosis is a tick-borne disease which is caused by different Anaplasma species. Among Anaplasma species, A. ovis which can infect sheep and goats cause ovine anaplasmosis. In this study, the prevalence of Anaplasma spp. was investigated in 31 different breeds of sheep from different regions of Türkiye. Method Anaplasma spp. was investigated by PCR targeting MSP-4 gene in blood samples of sheep breeds (n = 366) collected from different regions of Türkiye. Also, some Anaplasma spp. positive samples were sequenced for species identification and sub-cluster analyses. Results The molecular prevalence of Anaplasma spp. was 43.9% (161/366). In Anatolian Merino (n = 10) and Akkaraman (n = 11) breeds, the molecular prevalence of Anaplasma spp. reached to 100%. Also, the highest molecular prevalence was detected in Black Sea region by 70% (28/40) and the lowest molecular prevalence was detected in Marmara region by 32% (16/50). While the prevalence of Anaplasma spp. was 59.7% in sheep produced in the extensive system, it was found as 39.2% and 9.8% in sheep produced in semi-extensive and intensive systems, respectively. Accordingly, these findings suggest that the production of sheep in the intensive system protects them from tick-borne diseases, which are of great economic importance. According to BLAST results, all sequenced Anaplasma spp. positive samples (n = 29) were identified as A. ovis . Also, mixed infections were detected in 6 positive samples. The phylogenetic tree constructed by 38 sequence data showed the presence of three different sub-clusters for A. ovis (Sub-cluster 1, 2, and 3). Sub-cluster 2 was found as the most prevalent sub-cluster with 42.1% frequency compared to the other sub-clusters. Conclusion This study showed that sheep grown in different regions of Türkiye have a high molecular prevalence value for Anaplasma spp.",

    "abstract": "A major worldwide health concern is cysticercosis, a zoonotic parasitic illness brought on by human parasites. This study aims to examine the current worldwide cysticercosis burden in order to serve as a resource for developing successful global control initiatives. Five layers of data about cysticercosis were analyzed: gender, age, year, and the regional and national social and economic development index (SDI). The various groups were compared using age-standardized rates, and patterns in the burden of disease were examined and evaluated. Furthermore, from 2022 to 2050, disease patterns were predicted using the ARIMA and ES models. It was discovered that compared with 1990, the number of deaths decreased by 362 in 2021, the prevalence number increased by 1,318,963, the DALYs decreased by 151,192, and the age-standardized Mortality rate (ASMR) decreased by 0.02 per 100,000 people (EAPC - 2.39, 95% CI - 2.46 to - 2.32), the age-standardized DALY rate (ASDR) decreased by 9.14 per 100,000 people (EAPC - 1.84, 95% CI - 1.93 to - 1.75), and the age-standardized prevalence rate (ASPR) decreased by 17.18 per 100,000 people (EAPC - 1.2, 95% CI - 1.3 to - 1.1). To sum up, although the prevalence of cysticercosis has dramatically declined globally over the last 30 years, it is still high in many low-SDI nations and regions. Therefore, in order to further optimize prevention and control methods and lower the burden of disease in high-burden regions and countries, it is imperative that international cooperation be strengthened.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Given the unclear relationship between Blastocystis spp. infection and colorectal cancer (CRC), this study aimed to provide insight into Blastocystis infection, assess the effect of chemotherapy on Blastocystosis in CRC patients, and explore potential links between CRC and Blastocystis subtypes (STs). Subjects A total of 150 participants were divided into three groups: Group I (50 CRC patients not receiving chemotherapy), Group II (50 CRC patients who were receiving chemotherapy), and Group III (50 healthy, age- and sex-matched controls). Results Blastocystis spp. was detected in 42 cases through microscopy and culture, with infection rates higher in Group I (40%) and Group II (32%) compared to the control group (12%). Among all participants, 86 were asymptomatic, while 64 experienced symptoms. PCR analysis confirmed Blastocystis in 26 out of the 42 cases. PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis identified 60% of isolates as Group A and 16% as Group C, while sequencing later confirmed that 24% belonged to Group B. PCR-sequence-tagged site (STS) analysis revealed five STs (ST1, ST2, ST3, ST5, and ST7), with ST1 (52%) and ST3 (24%) identified as the most prevalent STs. Conclusion Blastocystis infection was significantly higher in CRC patients, suggesting a possible association with the disease. It appears to act as an opportunistic pathogen, contributing to symptom development regardless of CRC. The absence of significant differences in ST distribution across groups indicates that Blastocystis pathogenicity is complex and not exclusively linked to specific STs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Opecoelids, a diverse group of digenean trematodes, pose a taxonomic challenge due to morphological similarities. The genus Genitocotyle is little studied with only five recognized species. Recent phylogenetic advancements have refined Opecoelidae classification, recognizing 15 subfamilies, including opecoelins, distinguished by the absence of a cirrus sac and a canalicular seminal receptacle. Within this subfamily, the genus Genitocotyle remains understudied, with only five recognized species. The aim of this study is to describe a new species and to clarify a long-standing taxonomic ambiguity. Methods Two historical specimens of Genitocotyl e from Apogon imberbis off Madeira, preserved in the Natural History Museum, London, were examined alongside newly collected specimens from Algerian waters. Comparative morphological analyses, including illustrations and morphometric measurements, were conducted. Results Genitocotyle necromnemos n. sp. is described, differing from its congeners by its larger body size, the more numerous eggs, the extended post-testicular region, the seminal vesicle restricted to the forebody, the extension of the vitellarium and the shape of the ovary. This new species designation clarifies the identity of some museum specimens, undescribed since their collection in 1951. Conclusion This study highlights the importance of museum collections for the clarification of taxonomic uncertainties and the expansion of knowledge about the biodiversity of trematodes. The result contribute the systematics of opecoelines and emphasise the ecological and biogeographical importance of Genitocotyle spp. in marine fish hosts.",

    "abstract": "The louse flies in the genus Ornithomya Latreille are avian ectoparasites. The patterns of alar microtrichia on the wings of the Ornithomyae are commonly used to help distinguish the various species, with the patterns in most species found to be constant between individuals. The Finch Louse Fly Ornithomya fringillina (Curtis) in the United Kingdom, Ireland and the Isle of Man, is unusual in that the several patterns have been described. Consequently it has a complicated taxonomic history and there is some confusion about species identification. Louse flies were collected by licensed bird ringers and an analysis of the simple morphological features, phenology and geographical distribution of these traits was performed. No significant differences were found between the three main types, and it was concluded that the differences were not due to sexual dimorphism and did not provide evidence that the different forms were separate species. Analysis of COX1 DNA sequences confirmed this result and proved that these are indeed morphotypes and not distinct species. There was no geographical separation between COX1 sequences from the United Kingdom and those from flies sampled in other parts of the world. The molecular analysis also suggested that Ornithomya bequaerti (Maa) and Ornithomya candida (Maa) may not be valid species, but represent morphotypes of O. fringillina. The three patterns of alar microtrichia are morphotypes of a single species, Ornithomya fringillina. Further research is necessary to determine the status of some other species in the genus Ornithomya.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The first description of vitellogenesis in the Trypanorhyncha is presented in this paper. Though the type of vitellogenesis and mature vitellocyte in Dollfusiella spinulifera appear to be unique among the Eucestoda, to some extent they resemble that observed in the lower cestodes, namely the Tetraphyllidea and Pseudophyllidea. Maturation is characterized by: (1) an increase in cell volume; (2) extensive development of large, parallel, frequently concentric cisternae of GER that produce proteinaceous granules; (3) development of Golgi complexes engaged in packaging this material; (4) continuous enlargement of proteinaceous granules within vesicles and their transformation into shell globule clusters; and (5) progressive fusion of all vesicles, with flocculent material containing the proteinaceous granules and shell globule clusters, into a single very large vesicle that characterises mature vitellocytes of this tapeworm. Cell inclusions in and around the large vesicle consist of flocculent material of a very low density, a few shell globule clusters, moderately dense proteinaceous granules and numerous large droplets of unsaturated lipids. A new previously unreported mode of transformation of proteinaceous granules into shell globule clusters, that evidently differs from that of pseudophyllideans and tetraphyllideans, is described. Cytochemical staining with periodic acid-thiosemicarbazide-silver proteinate for polysaccharides indicates a strongly positive reaction for membrane-bound glycoproteins in all membranous structures such as GER, mitochondria, Golgi complexes, nuclear and cell plasma membranes. Similar staining revealed β-glycogen particles scattered in the cytoplasm of maturing vitellocytes. Typical cytoplasmic β-glycogen particles appear mainly during early vitellocyte maturation but it is characteristic for this species that they are only seldom visible in mature cells. Some working hypotheses concerning the interrelationship between this particular pattern of vitellogensis, possible mode of egg formation in D. spinulifera, its embryonic development and trypanorhynchean life cycle, are drawn and discussed.",

L. theroni differs from the five other species of this subgroup (L. ergensi, L. kechemirae, L. tomentosus, L. sanfilippoi, L. baeri) by the morphology and the size of the haptoral dorsal bar. L. theroni, as well as, L. hilii, L. bidens, L. impervius, was only reported on the sparid Diplodus puntazzo. These parasite species are all considered as oioxenic.",

Three developmental stages were recognised: (1) an early stage of exogenous budding at the surface of the central vesicle; (2) a stage of polycephalic cyst development accompanied by segmentation of the growing larval strobile and an obvious decrease in the size of the central vesicle; (3) fully-formed larval strobile and invaginated scoleces. In fully-developed encysted polycephalic larvae, there are usually 14–24 segmented larval strobilae, each terminating with an invaginated scolex; larval strobilae arise from a common central vesicle and remain attached posterior to it during the entire development. The number of segments varies between 109 and 120 per larval strobila. The polycephalic larvae examined closely resemble the strobilocercus type of taeniid larvae. The structure of developing and fully-formed larvae was examined by TEM. The tegument, scolex, subtegumental musculature of the strobilar segments, protonephridial system, calcareous corpuscles and medullary parenchyma of larvae exhibit general similarity with the same structures in adults at both LM and TEM levels. The morphogenesis of the larva of T. parva is compared with that of the polycephalic larvae of other Taenia spp. (T. krepkogorski, T. twitchelli and T. endothoracica) and with other asexually-multiplying cestode larvae (mesocestoidids, hymenolepidids and dilepidids).",

Nine cytochrome b gene lineages were recorded, 4 belonging to Haemoproteus spp. and 5 to Plasmodium spp. The overall prevalence of haemosporidians was 33.3%. The composition of parasites varied geographically, with six lineages recorded in Russia, five lineages in Bulgaria and two lineages in Kazakhstan. Two lineages are described for the first time, i.e. ACAGR1 (belonging to Plasmodium sp. and recorded from a single bird in Russia) and ACAGR2 (belonging to Haemoproteus sp., recorded from Bulgaria and Russia). The latter lineage is the most widespread parasite in the Bulgarian population, scarce in Russia and absent in Kazakhstan. It is supposed that ACAGR2 has originated from the widespread lineage ACDUM1 differing from it by a single nucleotide. One lineage only (ACDUM2) occurs in all the three populations studied and is a nonspecific parasite known from various passerines. Six of the registered lineages have been found in a single population of A. agricola and also represent non-specific parasites occurring in a wide range of passerine birds. Their records in A. agricola may indicate the high transmission rate of these parasites in the habitats where this host co-occurs with other passerines. The variation of the composition of the haemosporidian parasite communities through the breeding range of A. agricola makes up heterogeneous selection pressures that may drive intraspecific variation in important life-history traits.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The ultrastructure of spermatogenesis of Taenia taeniaeformis is described for the first time by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mature testes contain all stages of spermatogenesis; primary spermatogonia are usually situated at the periphery and mature spermatozoa in the centre of testes. The general process is similar to that described in other cestodes. Six incomplete, synchronic cytokineses occur: four mitotic and two meiotic cell divisions. All these divisions occur simultaneously, resulting in a rosette cluster of four tertiary spermatogonia, then eight quaternary spermatogonia, and subsequently sixteen primary spermatocytes. All of these enter into a growth period and their enlarged nuclei move to the periphery of cells of the rosettes. The first meiotic division forms thirty-two secondary spermatocytes and after the second meiotic division, there are sixty-four spermatids. Spermiogenesis in T. taeniaeformis corresponds to the Ba and Marchand’s Type 3 and begins with the formation of a differentiation zone in the form of a conical projection of cytoplasm delimited by a ring of arching membranes and surrounded by submembranous cortical microtubules. Within this area, there are two centrioles, orthogonally disposed, and vestigial striated rootlets. Only one of the centrioles develops a flagellum that grows externally to the cytoplasmic extension. Posteriorly, a flagellar rotation inferior to 90° occurs and the flagellum becomes parallel to the cytoplasmic extension. Later, the two processes fuse during the so-called proximodistal fusion. The nucleus elongates and moves into the cytoplasmic extension. In the final stage of spermiogenesis, a single crested body appears at the base of the differentiating spermatozoon. Finally, the ring of arching membranes constricts and the young spermatozoon detaches from the residual cytoplasm. Ultrastructural aspects of spermatogenesis are compared with that of other cestodes studied to date, particularly of the family Taeniidae.",

Ascarophis holocentri Parukhin, 1984 is considered a junior synonym of A. adioryx.

Internally, the handle, the proximal region of the blade in the articulation region and the distal pointed region of the blade consist of three layers. Distal to the articulation region, the blade consists of four layers with differing electron densities. A cavity is associated with the distal region of the blade and the handle. A cyton containing secretory bodies of different sizes and shapes was found in association with each marginal hooklet. The possible function of these secretions is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The lectin binding properties of Fasciola hepatica miracidia were studied by a panel of fluorescein- and gold-conjugated lectins (ConA, LCA, WGA, LEA, SBA, HPA and UEA-I). The presence of mannose and/or glucose residues was demonstrated with ConA and LCA as weak diffuse fluorescence of the miracidial surface, which was more intense at the anterior part of the larva. The N-acetylglucosamine-binding lectins WGA and LEA reacted intensely with the whole miracidial surface. No labelling with N-acetylgalactosamine and/or galactose-specific (SBA and HPA) and fucose-specific UEA-I lectins was observed. The possibility that the specific recognition of the miracidial surface carbohydrates by lectins may initiate the process of transformation of the miracidia into sporocysts was examined in vitro in physiological saline for Galba truncatula. Incubation in the presence of ConA and WGA resulted in facilitation of the transformation process. Facilitation was absent in the presence of inhibitor sugars. Incubation in the presence of SBA or UEA-I had no effect. The results suggested a possible impact of carbohydrate-lectin interactions in transformation of miracidia of F. hepatica to sporocysts in vivo.",

The posterior or distal regions of the uterus are filled with eggs containing larvae at advanced stages of morphogenesis and fully-formed cotylocidia. Various stages and organs of this larva are described in detail, including the aspects of the developing and fully-differentiated cotylocidium, the body wall (tegument and musculature), glandular regions and the protonephridial excretory system. Blastomere multiplication by means of mitotic divisions takes place simultaneously with the degeneration or apoptosis of some micromeres; this frequently observed characteristic is compared and discussed in relation to corresponding reports for other neodermatans. During the advanced stages of the embryonic development of A. limacoides, the vitelline syncytium disappears and the size of the embryo increases rapidly. Evident polarization of the differentiating larva was observed; towards one pole of the egg, cytodifferentiation of the mouth, surrounded by the oral sucker and cephalic glands, takes place, whereas, towards the opposite pole, differentiation of the posterior sucker (incipient ventral disc) occurs. The oral and posterior suckers are formed from numerous embryonic cells which have differentiated into myocytes. The central part of the oral sucker undergoes invagination and forms the future pharynx and intestine. Fully-developed cotylocidia of A. limacoides have a neodermatan type of tegument, flame cells and two types of glandular structures. These results suggest a sister relationship between the Aspidogastrea and the Digenea, although the systematic position of aspidogastreans in relation to other platyhelminth taxa remains somewhat equivocal.",

It differs from other species of the genus parasitic in turtles by several characters including the shape of the median ridge in the buccal capsule and the position of the anterior pair of caudal papillae in males. Camallanus sprenti sp. nov. is reported from Elseya latisternum (type host) and Emydura krefftii in northern Queensland. It is closely related to Camallanus tuckeri, and differs from the latter species in possessing a shorter oesophagus. We summarize data on morphology, distribution and specificity of 5 known Camallanus spp. from Australian turtles and provide a key for their identification. Sequence comparison of more than 500 base pairs at the 5′ end of the nuclear 28S rDNA gene confirms the status of C. sprenti and C. beveridgei as new species. Camallanus sprenti differs from the other 4 species of Camallanus from Australian turtles by 16–59 bases (3.1–11.5%) while C. beveridgei differed from the other 4 species by 23–60 bases (4.5–11.6%). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates close interrelationships among C. tuckeri, C. sprenti and C. beveridgei, the three species with most similar buccal capsules.",

Among the 66 valid species described so far in the genus, the new species most closely resembles H. zenis (Baylis, 1929). Both species, apparently specific for fishes of the family Zeidae, share the shape of the dorsal lip, the long expanded lateral alae originating from subventral interlabia and the ornamentation of the tail tip, as well as general morphometry. The combination of these shared features distinguishes both species from all congeners so far known. However, the new species is distinguishable from H. zenis by having shorter interlabia, and consequently the lateral alae originating more posteriorly, shorter spicules, a smaller number of postcloacal papillae and the presence of two pairs of double postcloacal papillae.",

The parasitic mite, Dermanyssus hirundinis, was found in nests of snow buntings Plectrophenax nivalis nivalis, both natural nests and within nesting boxes, on Spitsbergen. Densities per nest varied from sporadic to greater than 26,000 individuals. This is the northernmost observation of this parasite. The mite was present in new nests, nests constructed the previous year and nests not utilized the previous summer. The parasite survives at least 18 months without access to a blood meal and can tolerate the Arctic winter, surviving temperatures below −20°C. D. hirundinis is hence well adapted to arctic conditions. Only females were observed suggesting that this population is facultatively parthenogenetic.",

    "abstract": "Although the incidence of anisakiasis is rising worldwide, its frequency is still unknown in Brazil. The aim of this study was to verify immunoreactivity to Anisakis simplex antigens in healthy adults and determine its possible relationship with frequency of fish consumption and allergy symptoms. A prospective cross-sectional study was carried out with 67 volunteers recruited from a military facility in Niterói, Brazil. The subjects completed a structured questionnaire and serum titers of specific anti-Anisakis IgE and IgG antibodies were measured. The association between frequency of fish intake and IgE reactivity was evaluated by Fisher's exact test. Almost all subjects (97.0%, 65/67) that consumed seafood; 64.6% (42/65) ate fish at least once weekly. Of all seafood consumers, 56.9% (37/65) reported allergy symptoms, being gut allergies most often cited (35.5%). IgE seroreactivity to Anisakis simplex was found in 20.9% of subjects (14/67), with 13.4% (9/67) reacting exclusively to somatic antigen, 3.0% (2/67) exclusively to excretory/secretory antigens and 4.5% (3/67) to both antigens. There was a significant association between frequency of fish consumption and positive serology (p = 0.019). An immunoblot assay for Anisakis antigens showed different positive bands for IgG. The direct relationship between ELISA reactivity and frequency of fish intake and absence of association with allergy symptoms suggests previous contact with Anisakis simplex antigens.",

Its meat, however, can represent a reservoir of dangerous foodborne diseases and can play an important role in the transmission of many pathogens, including Toxoplasma gondii, in humans and animals worldwide. The aim of the present study was to determine the presence of antibodies to T. gondii in the serum of hunted wild boars in Poland. Using the commercial direct agglutination test, 398 serum samples collected during the hunting season 2009/2010 were tested for the presence of T. gondii antibodies, and the titre of 40 was considered indicative of T. gondii infection in analysed samples. It was found that nationwide, 37.7% were seropositive to T. gondii, although seroprevalence varied from 11.6 to 50% depending on the Voivodeship. Significant differences were observed between the Great Poland and Lubusz Voivodeships and between Great Poland and Warmian-Masurian. Serological test indicated widespread exposure to T. gondii by wild boar; therefore, consumption of raw or undercooked game meat of infected animals can carry a significant risk of T. gondii infection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Perumytilus purpuratus is an abundant bivalve located in the intertidal rocky zone of South America that has been considered as a key species of the ecosystem. There are few studies of the host-parasite relationship of this bivalve; thus, this research aims to analyse the spatial and temporal variation in the prevalence of trematodes in P. purpuratus. Bivalves were collected from three localities (El Tabo, Las Cruces and Montemar) of central Chile (33°S, 71°W) during different seasons of 2010. The bivalves were also collected every metre, from the lowest to the highest level of the intertidal rocky zone, to determine the parasite distribution within the localities. Three species of trematodes as sporocyst stages were found: Prosorhynchoides carvajali, Proctoeces sp. and an undetermined fellodistomid species. Of the 37,692 bivalve specimens collected, 2.68% were parasitised. The undetermined fellodistomid species was the most prevalent parasite observed (1.69%). There were little detected differences in the prevalence of some trematode species between seasons. The prevalence of P. carvajali varied between localities, being most prevalent at Montemar. The distribution of trematodes along the rocky zone within the localities was variable, with P. carvajali being more prevalent in the mid-lowest level of the intertidal zone and the undetermined fellodistomid species being more prevalent in the mid-highest level. Both the abundance of definitive hosts and the environmental conditions likely result in different levels of infection by trematodes in P. purpuratus between and within the localities.",

Males and very tiny nongravid female philometrid nematodes were collected from the ovaries of the fish. Based on light and scanning electron microscope observations, and supported by molecular analyses of the partial nucleotide sequences of the 18S small subunit ribosomal DNA, the philometrid nematode was determined to be a new species belonging to the genus Philometra Costa, 1845 in the family Philometridae (Nematoda: Dracunculoidea), and was named P. philippinensis sp. nov. This new species was clearly distinguishable morphologically from other congeners that parasitize the gonads of marine fishes. Males have unique sickle-shaped spicules and gubernaculum, and a vulva-like cloacal opening. Following Dentirumai philippinensis Quiazon et Moravec, 2013 and Philometra robusta Moravec, Möller et Heeger, 1992, this is the third philometrid species and the first gonad-infecting philometrid from the Philippine archipelago.",

    "abstract": "Leishmania, the causative agent of various forms of leishmaniasis, is the significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Regarding energy metabolism, which is an essential factor for the survival, parasites adapt to the environment under low oxygen tension in the host using metabolic systems which are very different from that of the host mammals. We carried out the study of susceptibilities to different inhibitors of mitochondrial electron transport chain and studies on substrate level phosphorylation in wild-type L. donovani. The amastigote forms of L. donovani are independent on oxidative phosphorylation for ATP production. Indeed, its cell growth was not inhibited by excess oligomycin and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, which are the most specific inhibitors of the mitochondrial Fo/F1-ATP synthase. In contrast, mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone and complex III inhibitor antimycin A inhibited amastigote cell growth, suggesting the role of complex I and complex III in cell survival. Complex II appeared to have no role in cell survival. To further investigate the site of ATP production, we studied the substrate level phosphorylation, which was involved in the synthesis of ATP. Succinate-pyruvate couple showed the highest substrate level phosphorylation in amastigotes whereas NADH-fumarate and NADH-pyruvate couples failed to produce ATP. In contrast, NADPH-fumarate showed the highest rate of ATP formation in promastigotes. Therefore, we can conclude that substrate level phosphorylation is essential for the survival of amastigote forms of Leishmania donovani.",

The purpose of this analysis was whether the COVID-19 outbreak had a significant impact on the number of reported Lyme disease cases.The data included in the World Health Organization (WHO) and the data from the \"Reports on incidence of infectious diseases, infections and poisoning in Poland\" presented by the Department of Epidemiology NIZP-PZH were analyzed.To the end of 2020, there were registered 12, 524 Lyme disease cases. In the same period, in 2018 and 2019 were registered, respectively, 20, 150 and 20, 614 Lyme disease cases. The overall number of Lyme disease cases in 2018 and 2019 was at a similar level. The monthly increase in the number of cases was also at a similar level. The year 2020 in January and February was characterized by the same increase in the number of cases as in previous years. The difference started to be noticeable in March and the lowered growth compared to the previous years has been maintained to this day. In December, about 8, 000 fewer cases of Lyme disease were registered than in previous years.The reduced number of cases of Lyme disease coincided with the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic in Poland in March 2020. Every year, the incidence of Lyme disease in Poland is at a similar level with a similar monthly increase. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the number of cases recorded, which could have catastrophic consequences for people who did not receive treatment in the right time.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Cryptosporidiosis is a zoonotic infectious disease caused by the protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium spp., frequently found in several animal species, including bats. Several Cryptosporidium genotypes have been described in bats worldwide, suggesting that bats are infected by host-specific Cryptosporidium spp. To date, there are no published reports about Cryptosporidium spp. in bats from Colombia. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the presence and molecular diversity of Cryptosporidium spp. in Colombian bats. Methods A total of 63 gut samples from three bat species served for molecular detection of Cryptosporidium spp. 18S rDNA gene by qPCR. The sequenced amplicons were used in subsequent phylogenetic analyses to identify them as species or genotypes. Results Cryptosporidium spp. qPCR detection occurred in 9.5% (6/63) of bat intestines, and four sequences represented two new genotypes, called Cryptosporidium bat genotypes XIX and XX, were identified. Conclusions This study describes the detection of two novel Cryptosporidium bat genotypes, in two species of bats from a region of Colombia, requiring further studies to determine the relationhip between Cryptosporidium and bats in Colombia.",

    "abstract": "Human toxocariasis is a helminthic zoonosis caused by infection of Toxocara canis or T. cati. Humans can be infected by through ingestion of embryonated eggs from contaminated water, food or soil. Diagnosis is challenging, immunodiagnosis tests are commonly implemented with major pitfalls in the cross-reactivity with other pathogens, particularly in endemic areas. With the aim of identify species-specific genes encoding for highly expressed antigenic proteins, a list of parasites that may infect humans and that might present similar clinical symptoms to T. canis infections was built. Only organisms whose genomes were completely sequenced and the proteome predicted were included. First, orthologous proteins were detected and the subcellular localization of T. canis proteins was predicted. In order to identify differentially expressed genes encoding proteins in larvae L3, pair-wise comparisons among transcriptomes from body parts and genders were performed. Finally, all secreted proteins classified as species-specific of T. canis, whose genes were upregulated in larvae L3 were included in an antigenic prediction. Twenty-eight parasites were included in the analyses, proteins of T. canis were clustered in 11,399 groups, however, 279 were species-specific groups which represent 816 proteins. Three hundred and twenty-two proteins were predicted to be secreted and upregulated in larvae L3, however, after filtering these proteins by their orthology inference, only three proteins met all the features included in this study (species-specific, upregulated, secreted, and antigenic potential). To conclude, our strategy in the study is a rational approach for discovering antigenic proteins to be used in diagnosis.",

We studied the presence of Acanthamoeba spp. in the water system of a hemodialysis unit and assessed the potential for transmission to hemodialysis patients. Methods Water samples collected from pretreatment and posttreatment water of the treatment station and from input and output water of the dialysis machines were cultured on non-nutrient agar supplemented with Escherichia coli . Blood samples from dialysis patients in the unit and from a control group in the same hospital were tested for anti- Acanthamoeba IgG antibodies. Results Acanthamoeba spp. were found in posttreatment water. They were more commonly found in the input water samples (79.2%), than in the output water samples (16.7%) ( p = 0.001). Anti- Acanthamoeba IgG antibodies were present in 32.9% of patients and were absent in the control group ( p = 0.002). The duration of hemodialysis was significantly longer in seropositive patients than in seronegative patients ( p = 0.008). Conclusion The study highlights the presence of Acanthamoeba spp. in the dialysis system. The relatively high prevalence of anti- Acanthamoeba IgG antibodies and the link between dialysis duration and seropositivity emphasize the importance of rigorous water monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Acanthamoeba castellanii is an important opportunistic human protozoal pathogen that can cause both skin, ocular and brain infections. Recent studies have established that brews and solvent extract (SE) of green tea ( Camellia sinensis ) can inhibit the growth and encystation of A. castellanii . Here we characterized those growth and encystation inhibitions. Methods Herein, we characterize of the morphological and chemical changes that occur in the trophozoites and the encysting stage of A. castellanii after exposure to C. sinensis SE and brew using Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy and fluorescence-based assays. Results TEM showed ultrastructural changes in both A. castellanii stages. FTIR microspectroscopy revealed modifications of amide I and II band peaks in the C. sinensis -treated trophozoites, suggesting an inhibition of protein synthesis. Assessment of the nucleus integrity of trophozoites exposed to SE and brew revealed disruption of the nuclear membrane integrity, nuclear fragmentation, and chromatin degradation, and reduction in the quantity of DNA and RNA, indicating trophozoite death. These results are consistent with C. sinensis acting as a membrane-active anti-acanthamoebic, exhibiting amoebicidal activity against growing and encysting A. castellanii . This work underlines the importance of characterizing the effect of C. sinensis constituents, individually or in combinations, to clarify which ones are the primary components responsible for its action and the observed alterations in the structure and function of A. castellanii . Conclusion These results demonstrated that exposure to C. sinensis SE or brew alters the synthesis of protein, DNA, RNA and disrupts the cell wall integrity.",

This study aims to resolve this ambiguity by describing a new Choricotyle species, C. justinemusei n. sp. previously identified as C. cf. chrysophryi , and clarifying the taxonomic status of related congeneric species, particularly those reported from sparids in Mediterranean and Atlantic waters. Methods Choricotyle justinemusei n. sp. was described based on Mediterranean specimens from the gills of Pagellus acarne , found in the Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris. The species was differentiated from its congeners through morphological and anatomical features, including the presence or absence of a terminal lappet, and of ring organ, number of atrial hooks and of testes. Molecular analysis using cox 1 sequences was also conducted to aid in species identification. Results Choricotyle justinemusei n. sp. was described and distinguished from other Choricotyle species by several key morphological traits and molecular sequences. The record of C. chrysophryi from Pagellus bogaraveo in Atlantic waters was reassigned to C. chrysophryi sensu Llewellyn (1941). Furthermore, C. pagelli from P. bogaraveo was found to be distinct from C. chrysophryi sensu Llewellyn (1941), confirming the validity of both C. pagelli and C. chrysophryi as separate species, and the former was reinstated as a valid species. A differential diagnosis was also provided for C. marionis , reinstating it based on its original type-host, Spicara maena . Conclusion This study clarifies the taxonomic status of C. chrysophryi and related species, describing C. justinemusei n. sp. and reinstating C. pagelli and C. marionis as valid species. These findings contribute to a more accurate understanding of Choricotyle species and their host specificity.",

Four patients with MKC were studied. Demographic information, symptoms, and clinical data were collected. Diagnosis involved ophthalmic examinations, corneal scraping microscopy (including Giemsa staining, modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining, Calcofour white staining), bacterial and fungal cultures, and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). Treatment included various topical medications like polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB), fluconazole, tacrolimus, sodium hyaluronate, and systemic medication such as albendazole. Three cases were caused by Encephalitozoon hellem proved by mNGS. Patients had symptoms like eye redness, swelling, pain, foreign body sensation, and vision loss. Risk factors included improper contact lens - wearing habits, contact with birds, or exposure to potentially contaminated environments. All patients showed improvements after treatment, with 3 cases cured and 1 case improved. MKC is a unilateral, acute, non-purulent ocular surface infectious disease. Clinicians should be more aware of it. Diagnosis depends on recognizing clinical signs, exploring risk factors, and laboratory tests. There is no consensus on treatment, but combined topical and systemic anti-protozoal drugs showed good results. Further large-scale validation is needed. Relevant departments should strengthen water source management, and patients should pay attention to personal hygiene.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Toxocara canis is a globally distributed zoonotic parasite found in dogs' intestines, leading to various pathological damages, particularly to the intestinal flora. The larval stage causes human toxocariasis, especially in children, and may result in neurological disorders and blindness. Quercetin is a flavonoid with strong secondary metabolites and possesses medicinal advantages and antiparasitic qualities. Methods The assay involved four groups, each of 10 young adult T. canis ; Group I was incubated in concentrations of an ethanolic extract of quercetin, Group II in albendazole (0.2 mM/ml) (+ve control), Group III in RPMI 1640 medium with ethanol (control), and Group IV in RPMI 1640 medium only (-ve control). The potential action of quercetin against adult T. canis in vitro was detected using scanning electron microscopy, histological investigations, and enzyme analysis. Results SEM declared that exposure to LC90 of quercetin caused body shrinkage, cuticle and caudal papillae swelling, and disfigurement and erosion of cuticular annulations. Compared to albendazole's effect on the treated worm's body wall, results showed that quercetin generates oxidative stress and has an extensive and variable effect on T. canis organs, including the body wall, the gut, and the genitalia. Conclusion Quercetin may set the stage for a new class of medications with remarkable potential for treating parasitic nematodes in dogs and could be extended to humans. This is the first time to employ a comprehensive study illuminating the potential action of quercetin against adult Toxocara canis in vitro.",

Methods The study examined the effects of Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigen (SEA) on type 1 diabetes (T1D) using a mouse model, involving 50 mice divided into three groups: a healthy control group receiving phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), a diabetic control group with STZ-induced T1D also receiving PBS, and a diabetic treated group receiving SEA. Biochemical and immunological analyses were conducted on blood samples collected at four and eight weeks post-treatment to assess metabolic markers like blood glucose and insulin levels, as well as immune markers including TNF-α, TGF-β, FOXp3, IL-4, and IL-10. Results SEA treatment induced early immune modulation at four weeks and sustained metabolic and immunological improvements at eight weeks, marked by increased regulatory T cells (elevated FOXp3), activation of immunosuppressive pathways (increased TGF-β), reduced inflammation (decreased TNF-α), a shift to an anti-inflammatory Th2 response (elevated IL-4 and IL-10), improved glycemic control, lower blood glucose levels, and higher insulin levels. Conclusion SEA exhibits potential therapeutic effects against T1D by modulating immune responses, promoting Th2 polarization, and increasing regulatory T cell activity. This immunological shift reduces systemic inflammation and enhances glycemic control.",

Moreover, identifying drugs can effectively eliminate and successfully treat the infection with Cryptosporidium . Methods Sixty male Swiss albino mice were divided into six groups, each of 10 mice. G1 served as the control, and G2 was inoculated with 10 4 oocysts. Mice were orally administered NZ (200 mg/kg b.wt.), LF (150 µg/kg b.wt.), or LF-NC (150 mg/kg b.wt./day) for a period of six days post-infection. The immunomodulatory potential and drug efficacy were assessed by fecal and intestinal oocyst counts, measuring antioxidant activities and cytokine levels in addition. Intestinal tissues were examined histopathologically. Results The cytokines TGF-β, INF-γ, and IL-10 were increased during infection and decreased following therapy. Mutually, the quantity of pathological lesions and oocysts in the ileal tissues was significantly diminished with the NZ plus LF-NC treatment. In addition, a considerable reduction of both fecal and intestinal samples, as well as a notable deterioration in oocyst counts, suggested that treatment with NZ alone or in combination with LF-NC was more effective. Conclusion LF or LF-NC was found to exert a potent immunomodulatory effect on infected mice as well as minimize pathological lesions. This therapy approaches a successful therapeutic alternative for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis with few adverse effects.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Trypanosoma theileri is an opportunistic parasite that has worldwide distribution. This parasite has been detected in various hosts including cattle. Normally T. theileri can cause mild infection but it may lead to disease among animals in case of mixed infection or immunosuppression. In the present study, it was aimed to investigate the presence, prevalence, and to detect genotypes of T. theileri in cattle from different provinces in Türkiye using molecular techniques. Methods In this study, 517 cattle blood collected from different provinces (Giresun, Samsun, Tokat, Sivas, Çorum, Trabzon, and Kastamonu) of Türkiye. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples using a commercial kit. The obtained gDNAs were screened for the presence of T. theileri using PCR. Partial parts of the CATL gene of randomly selected four positive samples were sequenced to determine the phylogenetic position of T. theileri Türkiye isolates. Results PCR results showed that 18 out of 517 samples (3.48%) were positive in terms of T. theileri . The highest prevalence of T. theileri was observed in animals over 3 years of age (3.98%), followed by animals in the 1–3-year age group (3.16%). The prevalence of T. theileri was higher in female animals (3.62%) than in male animals (2.91%). The phylogenetic analyses of positive samples showed that T. theileri Türkiye isolates were clustered with the Tth IIB genotype of the T. theileri TthII lineage. Conclusion In conclusion, the presence and prevalence of T. theileri in cattle were determined by molecular analyses for the first time in Türkiye. Moreover, Tth IIB genotype was also reported in Türkiye with this work. Although T. theileri is not thought to cause serious clinical symptoms in hosts, it should not be overlooked that it can cause significant economic losses in mixed infections with different pathogens.",

However, there are a limited number of studies on the presence, molecular epidemiology, and genotyping of E. bieneusi in camels worldwide. Currently, no data are available on the occurrence, distribution, and genotypes of E. bieneusi in wrestling camels in Türkiye. This study aimed to address the knowledge gap regarding E. bieneusi in wrestling camels in Türkiye. Methods In this study, a total of 110 fecal samples from camels in various provinces of Türkiye were investigated to reveal the presence of E. bieneusi , and the subsequent zoonotic potential of isolates was assessed at the genotype level by PCR-sequence analysis of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene region. Results Three fecal specimens were detected as E. bieneusi positive, and the overall prevalence was 2.72%. Further sequence analyses revealed a novel genotype hereby named camelEb from wrestling camels in the Aydin ( n = 1) and Mugla ( n = 2) provinces of Türkiye. In the phylogenetic analyses, the camelEb genotype clustered into group 6 with other genotypes reported from camels. Conclusion This is the first report on the presence of E. bieneusi in wrestling camels, suggesting that camels could also serve as a potential reservoir or carrier for E. bieneusi in Türkiye.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Trichinosis is a severe parasitic disease with a wide distribution and potential to affect humans. Available chemotherapeutic agents exhibit limited efficacy and are associated with numerous side effects. This study evaluated the ameliorative effects of blue LED irradiated and non-irradiated fenugreek seed extracts on experimental trichinosis. Methods Eighty-four mice were divided into seven groups; each further subdivided into intestinal and muscular phases (six mice per subgroup): non-infected non-treated controls, infected non-treated controls, infected albendazole-treated, infected non-irradiated fenugreek extract-treated, infected blue LED irradiated fenugreek extract-treated, infected non-irradiated fenugreek and albendazole-treated, and infected blue LED irradiated fenugreek and albendazole-treated. Mice were sacrificed on the 7th-day post-infection for the intestinal phase and the 40th day for the muscular phase. Small intestine, muscle tissues, and serum samples were collected to assess parasitic load, histopathological changes, TGF-β immunohistochemical expression, serum IFN-γ levels, oxidative stress markers (MDA, nitrate/SOD, and catalase), and BAX gene expression as an apoptotic marker. Metabolomic profiling of extract was pursued to spot differential expression of metabolites. Results Study outcomes demonstrated that blue LED irradiated and non-irradiated fenugreek seed extracts combined with albendazole exhibited superior efficacy in reducing adult and larval burdens, improving pathological changes, decreasing IFN-γ levels, mitigating oxidative stress (reduced MDA and nitrate along with elevated SOD and catalase), and downregulating BAX expression. The observed metabolic differences were primarily driven by the upregulation of steroids, downregulation of most alkaloids, and dysregulation various flavonoids in the irradiated extract. Conclusion Blue LED irradiated and non-irradiated fenugreek seed extracts can enhance albendazole's activity against trichinosis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Objective Chagas disease is an infectious disease classified under neglected tropical diseases and caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi . This study aimed to investigate the cytotoxic activity, antitrypanosomal efficacy, and combination effects with benznidazole of hybrid silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) synthesized with miltefosine against T. cruzi epimastigotes. Methods In this study, a hybrid miltefosine (Mil)-silver nanoparticle (OA-MilAg-NP) complex was synthesized. The nanoparticles were characterized using FT-IR spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. The cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles was assessed in L929 fibroblast cells, while their antitrypanosomal activity was evaluated against a Trypanosoma cruzi ATCC 50828 strain using the broth microdilution method. The interaction between the nanoparticle complex or miltefosine and benznidazole was analyzed using the checkerboard method. Results FT-IR analysis demonstrated that the amylose surface was successfully coated with silver and miltefosine, confirming the successful synthesis of the hybrid complex. SEM analysis revealed that the nanoparticles exhibited a spherical morphology with varying sizes, while TEM analysis determined their sizes ranged between 10.14 and 18.42 nm. The OA-MilAg-NP complex exhibited high antitrypanosomal activity and a selectivity index twice as high as that of miltefosine. Synergistic interactions were observed in the combinations of the OA-MilAg-NP complex or miltefosine with benznidazole. Conclusion The development of novel bioactive compounds with lower toxicity compared to traditional drugs has become essential for the treatment of Chagas disease. Drug repurposing combined with nanotechnology applications holds significant potential for improving therapeutic outcomes. The hybridization of miltefosine with silver nanoparticles, demonstrating strong antitrypanosomal activity and synergistic effects with benznidazole, may fill critical gaps in the literature. Graphical Abstract In this study, oxidized amylose-miltefosine-silver (OA-MilAg-NP) hybrid nanoparticles were synthesized. The characterization of the nanoparticles was performed using FTIR, SEM, and TEM analyses. The cytotoxicity of the hybrid OA-MilAg-NPs was evaluated on the L929 fibroblast cell line. The antitrypanosomal activity of the synthesized nanoparticles against T. cruzi isolates was determined using the in vitro broth microdilution method, while their synergy with benznidazole was assessed using the checkerboard method.",

Cosmocerca australis has 3–4 pairs of plectanes, C. archeyi and C. zugi each have 4 pairs of plectanes; however, in each species the plectanes lie in the fourth quarter of the body and just anterior to the cloaca. In C. tyleri sp. nov. the plectanes lie in the third quarter of the body and there is significant space between the cloaca and the posterior pair of plectanes.",

Oogonia, maturing oocytes and mature oocytes are surrounded by a syncytial interstitial cytoplasm, one of the distinctive traits of which is the presence of numerous myelin-like bodies. Oocyte inclusions comprise cortical granules and a small number of lipid droplets. The thickened, nucleated epithelium of the ovicapt lacks any apical structure and is a prolongation of the narrow ovarian epithelium. The muscular sphincter of the ovicapt is formed by a band of longitudinal muscles and bands of radial muscles at right angles to the longitudinal layer, and numerous myocytes surround the ovicapt wall. The oviduct of D. rudolphii is subdivided into three regions: (1) the proximal oviduct; (2) the fertilization chamber — the region distal to the point of entry of the duct from the seminal receptacle; and (3) the ovovitelline duct — the region distal to the point of entry of the duct from the vitelline reservoir. A comparative analysis is made between the structures of the ovary, ovicapt and oviduct of D. rudolphii and those of two other spathebothriideans, Cyathocephalus truncatus and Diplocotyle olrikii, with a discussion of ultrastructural traits that might be used as taxonomic criteria within the order Spathebothriidea.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The aim of this work was to examine if the game species from the north-western Poland, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), red deer (Cervus elaphus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa), may be reservoir hosts of bacteria from the genus Bartonella, and whether the sheep tick (Ixodes ricinus) is their vector. To this end, the prevalence of Bartonella DNA in the tissues of these game species was measured, just as in sheep ticks (I. ricinus) infesting them, and ticks collected from plants in the hunting area. The prevalence of Bartonella DNA was 39% (23/59) in roe deer and 35% (7/20) in red deer. No Bartonella DNA was detected in any of the 21 wild boars. The presence of Bartonella DNAwas detected in 1.9% of ticks infesting roe deer (2/103), while no pathogen DNA was found in the 20 ticks infesting the red deer and the 3 ticks infesting wild boars, or the 200 ticks collected from plants. Amplicons of two different lengths were obtained; 198 bp, characteristic for B. bovis, and 317 bp, characteristic for B. schoenbuchensis, which were confirmed later by sequencing. The examined ruminants are probably the reservoir hosts of B. schoenbuchensis and B. bovis in the biotope of the Puszcza Wkrzańska Forest, and wild boars do not participate in the Bartonella propagation in the environment. I. ricinus is unlikely to be the main vector of Bartonella species detected in the examined roe deer and red deer; probably other bloodsucking arthropods, parasitizing wild ruminants, play this role.",

Of this number, 29 (22.30%) were slightly or heavily parasitized by the acanthocephalan Diplosentis nudus (Harada, 1938) Pichelin et Cribb, 2001 (Cavisomidae); no other helminth parasites were found in the intestine of R. kanagurta. Twenty-nine infrapopulations of D. nudus, ranging from 23–218 individuals were collected from the infected fishes. These infrapopulations were distributed in a well-defined fundamental niche along the intestine of R. kanagurta, where the distribution of male worms was not random with respect to female worms size and position and suggests that the male-male competition for access to female may be intense and may select for large males. No correlation between fish size and infrapopulation size was observed. Correlations between female-to-male sex ratio and infrapopulation size, numbers of females and their mean lengths, numbers of males and their mean lengths, mean female length and mean male length within infrapopulation were very strong, and clearly suggest that as the infrapopulation size increased, the number of females and their mean lengths decreased and the number of males and their mean lengths increased. Combination of these results strongly suggests density-dependent effects and competition between male worms. The relationship between the mean female length or size and the number of eggs within its pseudocoel was strongly positive; egg production by female worm significantly decreases as the infrapopulation size increases, suggesting density-dependent reduction in female worm fecundity. Tendency for the variability in male testes size was not significant in infrapopulations of D. nudus. All of these results are discussed.",

These nematodes were firstly identified as D. (C.) elongatus (Törnquist, 1931), a commonly reported species from M. furnieri in South American Atlantic waters. However, other species of Dichelyne have so far been reported from this host in the same area, namely D. (C.) rodriguesi (Pinto, Fábio et Noronha, 1970), D. (C.) amaruincai (Freitas, Vicente et Ibañez, 1969) and D. (Dichelyne) micropogonii Pereira et Costa, 1996. A careful re-examination of these parasites, as well as of type specimens of all species reported from M. furnieri, revealed that these nematodes represented a new species. The new species is distinguished from most of its congeners by having papillae 5–7 and 9 forming a subventral line close to cloaca, this feature is shared with other 6 species [D. (C.) dichelyneformis (Szidat, 1950), D. (C.) fraseri (Baylis, 1929), D. (C.) abbreviatus (Rudolphi, 1819), D. (C.) adriaticus (Törnquist, 1931), D. (C.) minutus (Rudolphi, 1819) and D. (C.) mariajuliae Alarcos, Timi, Etchegoin et Sardella, 2006)], which are readily distinguished by their body size, spicules length, distribution patterns of other papillae and position of the excretory pore and deirids. Also, D. (C.) elongatus from Umbrina canariensis (Valenciennes) from West Africa is established as a new species Dichelyne (Cucullanellus) yvonnecampanae sp. nov.; D. (C.) amaruincai from Pacific waters is considered as a valid species, D. (D.) micropogonii is regarded as species inquirendae and D. (C.) rodriguesi is identified as Cucullanus sp.",

Here, we present data on the temporal distribution of E. patellae infections in P. vulgata from an intertidal site on the Irish south coast as well as on the intramolluscan development of the cercariae over a period of one year. Prevalence of infection showed temporal variation with a distinct peak in September, possibly related to an increase in the abundance of bird final hosts coinciding with comparatively high temperatures at the study locality during the summer months. Maturation of cercarial stages was strongly correlated with water temperature. Whilst fully developed cercariae were present in the rediae from May to November, large numbers of infective stages occurred in the limpets’ mantle blood vessels — where they accumulate prior to release — between June and September, suggesting this period of time to be the main transmission window for E. patellae cercariae.",

Strongyloides myopotami became known by causing “marsh itch” (also called “nutria itch” or “swimmer’s itch”), a severe rash caused by larvae that enter the skin in humans, and it is recognised as a zoonosis for people handling nutria fur. In the present study S. myopotami was found in 2 of the 5 examined species of Ctenomys (C. talarum from Argentina and C. pearsoni from Uruguay), both inhabiting the vicinity of water courses. Population descriptors of S. myopotami in C. talarum showed that a population of this parasite is well established in this rodent. The development of infective filariform larvae from eggs in the faeces of C. talarum and the prevalence of gravid parasitic females in this host can be considered as evidence of the establishment of a population of S. myopotami independent of the source population parasitizing M. coypus. Therefore, the presence of S. myopotami in these species of tuco-tucos indicates a change from a semi-aquatic to subterranean life cycle. Evidence that tuco-tucos are reservoirs for these nematodes and therefore may be a risk to human health in the areas studied is provided.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ultrastructural evidence for early intraurerine embryonic development of Wenyonia virilis is presented. At the initial stage of egg formation, the fertilized oocyte or ovum is surrounded by numerous vitellocytes and newly formed eggshell. Individual vitellocytes undergo progressive fusion into a vitelline syncytium. During cleavage divisions, three types of blastomeres are formed: macromeres, mesomeres and micromeres. Two large macromeres contain a large nucleus with spherical nucleolus and numerous small heterochromatin islands dispersed in moderately electron-dense nucleoplasm. The granular cytoplasm shows a few large mitochondria. Medium-sized mesomeres contain a spherical nucleus with numerous heterochromatin islands, adjacent to the nuclear envelope, and a prominent electron-dense nucleolus. Their nuclei are embedded in granular cytoplasm with a few large and numerous small mitochondria and Golgi complexes. The small micromeres are characterized by presence of spherical nucleoli with large areas of highly condensed heterochromatin and a few islands of granular electron-lucent nucleoplasm. Their granular cytoplasm shows a few small lipid droplets and several spherical mitochondria. Majority of micromeres give rise to the hexacanth but many of them also undergo degeneration or apoptosis. Both mesomeres and macromeres are engaged in the formation of the oncospheral envelopes. The outer envelope is formed by a fusion of two macromeres whereas the inner envelope originates from a fusion of mesomeres. The intrauterine eggs of W. virilis usually contain an embryo at the early preoncopheral phase of development and possesses three primary envelopes: (1) thick eggshell; (2) thin cytoplasmic layer of the outer envelope and (3) inner envelope. Based on embryonic development, egg type and life-cycle characteristics, caryophyllideans tend to show closer affinities to spathebothriideans than to the former pseudophyllideans.",

The prevalence of infection was 12/72 (16.66%). Myxobolus egyptica was identified on the basis of spore morphometry, histology and transmission electron microscopy. It was distinguished from all previously reported Myxobolus spp. by its shape, dimensions of the mature spore 10.0 ± 0.6 (9.5–10.5) μm in length, 8.5 ± 0.4 (8.0–9.0) μm in width and 8.7 ± 0.5 (8.4–9.2) μm in thickness, polar capsules, locality and host. The parasite formed intrafilamental cyst-like plasmodia. These plasmodia caused curling and atrophy of the gill lamellae. The ultrastructural analysis revealed a double-unit plasmodial membrane which was in direct contact with the host cells and had numerous vesicles. Some mitochondria were found below this membrane. The disporic pansporoblast was earliest recognizable stage of sporogenesis. Advanced developmental stages of spores and mature spores were reported.",

The ovigerous female of E. epinepheli can be distinguished from E. raynaudii by a less ovate body; cephalon deeply immersed in pereonite 1; eyes almost concealed by the amphicephalic processes; pereonites 3–7 distinctly decreasing in size (width and length); pleonites 1–5 distinctly increasing in width; and pleotelson larger. E. epinepheli can be distinguished from E. myripristae by the anterior margin of the cephalon being rounded in dorsal view and all pleonites being visible. E. epinepheli is the first species of Elthusa reported from the host genus Epinephelus.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Vitellogenesis and vitellocytes of the bothriocephalidean cestode Clestobothrium crassiceps (Rudolphi, 1819), a parasite of the teleost fish Merluccius merluccius (L., 1758), were studied by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cytochemistry. During vitellogenesis, four developmental stages were distinguished at the TEM level: (I) a stem cell stage of the gonial type; (II) an early differentiation stage, predominantly exhibiting lipid and protein synthetic activity; (III) an advanced differentiation or vitellocyte maturation stage, primarily exhibiting active glycogenesis still accompanied by an increase in lipid accumulation; and (IV) a mature vitellocyte stage. Vitellogenesis involves: (1) an increase in cell volume; (2) an extensive development of parallel, frequently concentrically arranged, cisternae of granular endoplasmic reticulum (GER) that produce dense, proteinaceous shell-gobules; (3) the development of Golgi complexes engaged in the packaging of this material; (4) an accelerated accumulation of unsaturated and saturated lipid droplets, along with their continuous enlargement and fusion; (5) the formation of individual β-glycogen particles and α-glycogen rosettes and their accumulation in the form of glycogen islands scattered among lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of maturing and mature vitellocytes; and (6) the rapid accumulation of large, saturated lipid droplets accompanied by dense accumulations of α- and β-glycogen along with proteinaceous shell-globules or shell-globule clusters in the peripheral layer during the advanced stage of vitellocyte maturation. Vitellogenesis in C. crassiceps generally resembles that previously described for three other bothriocephalideans, but differs from that of other cestode orders. Cytochemical staining with periodic acid-thiocarbazide-silver proteinate for glycogen indicates a strongly positive reaction for β-glycogen particles and α-glycogen rosettes, which form several large glycogen accumulations around the large, saturated lipid droplets of maturing and mature vitellocytes. Some hypotheses concerning the interrelationships between patterns of vitellogenesis, the possible modes of egg formation, embryonic development and life cycles in cestodes, and their phylogenetic implications are commented upon.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We describe the spermiogenesis process and the ultrastructural characters of the spermatozoon of Acanthobothrium crassicolle by means of transmission electron microscopy, including cytochemical analysis for glycogen. Spermiogenesis in A. crassicolle begins with the formation of the differentiation zone that contains two centrioles associated with striated rootlets and an intercentriolar body. The latter is formed by one electron-dense layer. The centrioles develop into two free flagella that first grow orthogonally to a median cytoplasmic process and then undergo flagellar rotation becoming parallel to that median cytoplasmic process. After flagellar rotation only one of the flagella completes its growth and both short and long flagella undergo proximodistal fusion with the median cytoplasmic process. In the final stages of spermiogenesis, the nucleus becomes filiform and migrates into the spermatid body. Later, the ring of arched membranes constricts and the spermatozoon is liberated from the residual cytoplasm. The ultrastructural organization of the spermatozoon of A. crassicolle follows the general pattern of spermatozoa of the other Tetraphyllidea-Onchobothriidae species, but exhibits some differences. It is filiform, tapered at both extremities and lacks mitochondrion. It contains two axonemes of unequal length showing the 9 + “1“ pattern of Trepaxonemata, a nucleus, parallel cortical microtubules and electron-dense granules of glycogen. The anterior extremity of the male gamete contains a single crested body surrounding a thin and long apical cone. This type of apical cone has never been described in a tetraphyllidean spermatozoon. Another particularity is the presence of a single electron-dense microtubule at the vertex of the crested body.",

The study was conducted in three different environments: pH 7.5 (high activity of bee enzymes and very low activity of parasite enzymes), pH 5 (moderate activity of enzymes from both sources) and pH 3.5 (limited activity of bee proteinases and high activity of mite proteinases). Based on electrophoretic studies, the inhibition of the activity of bee haemolymph proteinases by V. destructor extracts was observed at each pH. The study at pH 7.5 with commercial inhibitors of the 4 main classes of proteinases (pepstatin A, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), E-64 (trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)-butane), soybean trypsin inhibitor and Kunitz inhibitor) suggested that parasite extracts mainly inhibited serine proteinases and, to a lower degree, cysteine and aspartyl proteinases. At pH 3.5 and pH 5, a decrease of approximately 40% in parasite proteinase activity was also observed in the presence of bee haemolymph. The result points to the presence of aspartyl proteinase inhibitors in bee haemolymph, which may be an important defence element for bees during food intake by a mite. It was demonstrated that trypsin and trypsin inhibitors are active in the excretion/secretion products of V. destructor, the proteinases of which may assist the parasite in food suckling by preventing haemolymph coagulation, among other things.",

The present study assesses the accumulation of heavy metals in Tetrabothrius bassani and in its host, the Atlantic gannet (Morus bassanus) found dead due to bycatch along the seashore in the centre of Portugal. Samples of kidney, liver and pectoral muscle of 23 infected gannets, as well as specimens of T. bassani were analysed for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mn, Pb, Se and Zn by ICP-MS. The evidenced lower concentrations of Cr and Pb in tissues of gannets in comparison to an earlier study performed in the same area may reveal a change in the diet of M. bassanus between both study periods. The highest bioaccumulation factor was obtained for Cd with a 12.7-times higher concentration in the cestode than in gannet muscle. Lead concentration in T. bassani was 6.9-times higher than in kidney tissue, 8.5-times higher than in muscle and 9.5-times higher than in liver of M. bassanus. The cestode/seabird system T. bassani/M. bassanus can be considered a promising bioindicator system to monitor environmental Cd and Pb pollution in marine ecosystems.",

We conducted preliminary experiments to investigate this possibility. Zebrafish were inoculated with viable G. duodenalis cysts from two different Assemblages (A and D) using a modified oro-gastric tube. Direct microscopy and immunofluorescent antibody test were used to check for Giardia cysts/trophozoites in the intestine, and histology was performed on intestinal mucosa to evaluate possible pathological changes. Giardia cysts were successfully deposited in the zebrafish alimentary tract using a modified oro-gastric tube, and were maintained in the fish gut for at least 8 days. Although a single trophozoite was observed in one fish three days post-exposure, we were unable to demonstrate established, propagative infection under the conditions tested.",

A total of 104 paired samples of milk and serum were collected from four dairy farms. Individual samples were analyzed for N. caninum antibodies by ELISA: IDEXX Neospora Ab (Idx) (three farms: A, B, C; n = 60) and ID-VET Lab (Idv) (farm D; n = 44). Additionally, four pooled milk samples, one per each farm (A, B, C) and a composed one (A+B+C), were analyzed with Idx ELISA. Optimized cut-off values for milk samples were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, with serum results considered as true status. The agreement was expressed by K values. The overall seroprevalence of N. caninum infection was 45% in the farms tested by Idx ELISA and 56.8% in the farm tested by Idv ELISA. A good agreement between serum and milk was obtained for both ELISA kits (K = 0.72 and 0.77, respectively). The specificity and sensitivity at optimized cut-off of S/P&gt;0.704 for Idx and S/P%&gt;7.966% for Idv were 100% and 70.37% for Idx and 89.47% and 88% for Idv. Testing pooled milk samples, there were identified as N. caninum positive the dairy farms with a 15% or higher within-herd seroprevalence at the cut-off value of S/P&gt;0.51. This is the first study in Romania in which milk samples were tested to determine the N. caninum infection status in dairy farms, providing a base for further researches.",

The life cycle of the microsporidians identified exhibited the sequential developmental cycles that are similar to the general developmental cycle of the genus, Nosema. The spores showed considerable variations in their shape, length and width. The pathogenicity observed was dose-dependent and differed from each of the microsporidian isolates; the NIWB-15mb was found to be more virulent than other isolates. All of the microsporidians were found to infect most of the tissues examined and showed gonadal infection and transovarial transmission in the infected silkworms. SSU-rRNA sequence based phylogenetic tree placed NIWB-14b, NIWB-12n and NIWB-11bp in a separate branch along with other Nosema species and Nosema bombycis; while NIWB-15mb and NIWB-13md together formed another cluster along with other Nosema species. NIK-1s_mys revealed a signature sequence similar to standard type species, N. bombycis, indicating that NIK-1s_mys is similar to N. bombycis. Based on phylogenetic relationships, branch length information based on genetic distance and nucleotide differences, we conclude that the microsporidian isolates identified are distinctly different from the other known species and belonging to the genus, Nosema. This SSU-rRNA gene sequence analysis method is found to be more useful approach in detecting different and closely related microsporidians of this economically important domestic insect.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In the present study, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been used to study the ultrastructure of the digestive system, namely the pharynx, oesophageal glands and intestine, of the monogenean skin and fin parasite Macrogyrodactylus congolensis. The pharynx consists of an anterior highly muscular region and a posterior mainly glandular syncytial region. The anterior region is provided with six pharyngeal papillae, the centre of each of which is occupied by electron dense secretory bodies, identical with those in the posterior region of the pharynx. The intestine has an uninterrupted syncytial gastrodermis and the luminal surface is provided with many unbranched lamellae. The intestine of living specimens contains large and small granules which give it a reddish brown colour. Large particles, presumed to be lipid droplets, and small granules, presumed to be melanin granules, were found in the gastrodermis and in the intestinal lumen. Parasites were induced to feed and then preserved for TEM at the following intervals: just after feeding, 30 min after feeding, 1 h 30 min after feeding and 2 h after feeding. The specimens were then processed for TEM and sections cut through the intestine of each specimen were examined with the transmission electron microscope. Three types of vacuoles (V1, V2, V3) were detected in the gastrodermis. Vacuoles V1 have thick walls and are likely to be endocytotic, enclosing luminal contents at the surface of the gastrodermis. V2 vacuoles may be lysosomes that fuse with V1 vacuoles. V3 vacuoles may serve to dispose of residual digestive material into the lumen.",

The sea lice Caligus epinepheli Yamaguti, 1936 (Caligidae) was collected from the Japanese threadfin bream, Nemipterus japonicus (Bloch). It had been frequently reported from teleost fishes around the world. The second record, comprising male and female, was another caligid, rarely caught from fishes — Hermilius longicornis Bassett-Smith, 1898, collected from the giant catfish, Netuma thalassina (Rüppell). This paper features the first description of the male of the latter species. The third record was the lernanthropid, Lernanthropinus temminckii (von Nordmann, 1864) (Lernanthropidae), redescribed based on the specimens collected from the greater lizard fish, Saurida tumbil (Bloch) (Synodontidae). In order to clarify its taxonomic status, our specimen was compared with the holotype of L. gibbosus (Pillai, 1964) from the collections of Zoological Survey of India, Kolkata, and the syntypes of L. sauridae Do in Ho and Do, 1985 and L. temminckii from the collections of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington D.C. We found similarities in the morphology of the body, mouthparts, and legs 1–4 in three above-mentioned species. The prominent feature, the setation pattern of legs 1 and 2 was similar in all the female specimens examined. In the light of this, we formally relegate L. gibbosus and L. sauridae to synonymy with L. temminckii. Another important similarity is that Lernanthropinus gibbosus, L. sauridae, and L. temminckii have exclusively been parasitic on lizardfishes (Synodontidae). The attachment site of all three copepods reported form Iraq were the gill filaments.",

Here we supplemented its description based on the morphological, histological and molecular data. It was characterized by the presence of small round or ellipsoidal plasmodia in the gills of host and histology showed the plasmodia developed in the capillary network of the gill lamella. Mature spores of M. tsangwuensis were ellipsodal in frontal view and lemon shaped in lateral view, averaging 11.2 ± 0.7 (10.2–12.5) μm × 9.3 ± 0.3 (8.5–10.0) μm × 6.2 ± 0.4 (5.5–7.0) μm. Spores valves were symmetrical and smooth. Occasionally, a small intercapsular appendix was observed. Two polar capsules were pyriform with different sizes, measuring 5.0 ± 0.2 (4.4–5.3) μm × 3.1 ± 0.1 (2.9–3.5) μm and 3.9 ± 0.2 (3.4–4.3) μm × 2.5 ± 0.2 (2.0–2.8) μm, respectively.

M. portucalensis sp. nov. most closely resembles Maritrema subdolum Jägerskiöld, 1909, a species that also frequently uses C. maenas as second intermediate host. The new species differs from M. subdolum in having a narrower body at the level of testes and a smaller ovary and testes. Also, the digestive caeca presented various folds along their length, thickening in the terminal region. Moreover, the body surface was fully covered by tegumental spines provided with several teeth. To complement our morphological characterization and to identify M. portucalensis metacercariae, the ITS1 rDNA region of the cysts isolated from C. maenas was sequenced and compared with the corresponding available sequences of digenean trematodes belonging to the family Microphallidae. Alignments revealed 28 base-pair differences between the query-ITS1 and that of M. subdolum, and more importantly a 100% similarity with the sequence of Microphallidae sp. no. 15 cercaria from the snail Hydrobia ulvae. The last observation allowed us to establish an unequivocal association between cercaria known as Microphallidae sp. no. 15, and the metacercaria of M. portucalensis sp. nov. characterized in this work, contributing decisively to the clarification of its life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Twelve species of Filisoma Van Cleave, 1928 are recognized parasitizing tropical and subtropical fish. Four of these species were described from kyphosid fish and it has been suggested that a co-speciation may have occurred among species of Kyphosus Lacepède, 1801 and Filisoma, which could provide valuable information about the evolution history of this host-parasite system.During a survey of the helminth fauna of Kyphosus sectatrix (Linnaeus, 1758) and Kyphosus incisor (Cuvier, 1831) (Kyphosidae Jordan, 1887) off Rio de Janeiro coast, a new species of Filisoma was found and is described herein based on morphological, genetic, and ultrastructural data.Fish were obtained off Rio de Janeiro coast, Brazil. The parasites found in the intestine were measured and drawings were made with a drawing tube. Type specimens were deposited at the Helminthological Collection of Oswaldo Cruz Institute (CHIOC). The ultrastructure was studied using scanning electron microscope. The genetic analysis included the study of the partial sequences of 18S, ITS1, 5.8S and 28S rDNA, and the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase 1 gene (cox 1), with phylogenetic reconstructions based on the maximum likelihood analysis.Filisoma caudata n. sp. is characterized by a proboscis with 16‒18 longitudinal rows of 38‒45 hooks each. Hooks are uniform in shape dorsoventrally, gradually decreasing in size towards the base of the proboscis. Anterior hooks are 30‒45 μ long, middle hooks 30‒35 μ long and 5 basal transversal hooks 20‒30 μ long. The new species is differentiated from the closest species Filisoma filiformis Weaver and Smales, 2013 by the size and distribution of hooks, apart from having a subterminal vulva and a curved posterior trunk end (tail) measuring 500‒1,000 long. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S, 28S rDNA and mtDNA-cox1 markers grouped the new species with Filisoma bucerium Van Cleave, 1940 and Filisoma rizalinum Tubangui and Masiluñgan, 1946 showing a close relationship between these species of Cavisomidae Meyer, 1932 and Echinorhynchidae Cobbold, 1879; the latter represented by species of Acanthocephalus Koelreuther, 1771. The new species can be differentiated from others on morphological and molecular basis. A key to the 13 species of Filisoma Van Cleave, 1928 is provided.Filisoma caudata n. sp. is described herein based on morphological, genetic, and ultrastructural data. The topologies of obtained phylogenies suggest that species of Echinorhynchidae should be reevaluated since the family is considered paraphyletic in all analyses conducted.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The genus Grillotia Guiart, 1927 is cosmopolitan in its distribution and the type-species, G. erinaceus (van Beneden, 1858), has been relatively well studied. However, this study provides infection indices of Grillotia erinaceus from southern and northern Black Sea whiting Merlangius merlangus for the first time. The specimens of Grillotia erinaceus were obtained from subserosa of the anterior oesophagus, stomach, pyloric caeca, liver, ovaries and mesenterium of whiting caught by commercial fishing vessels off Sinop, Turkey and off Balaklava, Ukraine. Fish were examined during the period from May 2011 to April 2012. Prevalence and mean intensity values in 268 fish collected off Sinop in the Black Sea were 18.66% and 1.82 ± 0.16 parasites per infected fish, respectively. In Ukrainian 166 whiting samples collected off Balaklava in the Black Sea, however, G. erinaceus plerocercus infection prevalence was 10.24% and mean intensity 1.71 ± 0.75 parasites per infected fish. Infection parameters were also determined at both sampling sites in relation with host length, sex and season.",

The sheath structure in the studied larvae appeared to be similar to that described in other species of the family Rhabdiasidae, its chequered aspect being caused by a combination of outer longitudinal striations and inner longitudinal as well as transverse ridges. The larvae were similar in general morphology but differed in the presence/absence of anterior apical protuberances (pseudolabia), the shape and ornamentation of the tail tip, and the structure of lateral alae in the caudal region of the body. No relationship between the morphological characters of the larvae of the studied species and their taxonomic position or specificity of adult parasites to a particular host group was observed. Regardless, the larvae of each species can be identified by a combination of morphological peculiarities in the anterior and caudal regions of the body.",

The occurrence of larval and juvenile cestodes only, in this shark, suggests that the leafscale gulper shark features as a paratenic or a dead-end host for the parasites.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Anisakidae larvae belonging to the genera Anisakis and Pseudoterranova, are the most responsible for zoonosis transmitted by fish products (anisakidosis). Acquired by the consumption of raw or undercooked marine fish or squid, the anisakid larvae may cause pathogenic diseases like gastric or intestinal anisakiasis and gastro-allergic disorders. In accordance with current EU legislation, the fresh fish products must be inspected visually in order to detect the possible presence of visible parasites. It is recognized that the visual method is not accurate enough to detect the larvae of parasites in food preparations containing raw or practically raw seafood and it clearly emerges that the official system of control needs to be able to utilise an most efficient analytical technique. In this work, the authors have drawn up and validated an analytical method, which involves artificial digestion and the use of a heated magnetic stirrer, based on the EU Regulation n. 2075/2005. The larvae isolated are then subjected to morphological identification at genus level by using optical microscope. The method, proved to be suitable for the detection of live and dead larvae of anisakidae in ready-to-eat foodstuffs containing raw fish or cephalopods and it is fast and accurate. The method showed high levels of sensitivity and specificity, and the suitability of its use in official food control was confirmed. Its use should be incorporated systematically into specific monitoring programs for the control of foodstuffs containing raw fish products.",

Six larval life stages and one adult stage of P. ichtyoxanthon were identified from specimens collected in vitro and in situ. In vitro, eggs hatched after 21 days at 18°C. Eggs collected during winter were significantly larger than those laid during spring or summer. Paradiplozoon ichthyoxanthon oncomiracidia have peripheral eyes with pink pigmentation, a tubular anterior bladder-like structure, bicuspid basal pharynx valve and a branched digestive caecum and residual shell material or vitellaria in the caecum. Immature reproductive tissue connected to the ventral sucker and dorsal papillae were noted for the first time in diporpa. Large nervous ganglia and innervation of muscle were observed around the ventral sucker.",

Herein we describe the utilisation of this technique in a case of ophthalmomyiasis interna. A 12-year-old boy was infested during a summer holiday in northern Norway, while visiting an area populated with reindeer. Following medical examination, a Diptera larva was surgically removed from the boy’s eye and tentatively identified from its morphological traits as Hypoderma tarandi (L.) (Diptera: Oestridae). Ultimately, DNA barcoding confirmed this impression. The larval cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) DNA sequence was matched with both profiles of five adult H. tarandi from the same region where the boy was infested, and other established profiles of H. tarandi in the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) identification engine.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Ligulosis caused by Ligula intestinalis adversely affects the fisheries carried out in the lakes and ponds, causing economic losses in the fish industry. In this study, it was aimed to reveal the molecular characterization of L. intestinalis isolates obtained from woodfish ( Acanthobrama marmid ) in Keban Dam Lake in Elazig province of Turkey by using mt-CO1 gene sequences and to determine the genetic differences and haplotypes between the isolates. Methods In the examination made in terms of L. intestinalis , the intestine of the fish was opened with the help of fine-tipped scissors, the contents were allowed to come out, and the parasites were taken into a petri dish containing phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Then, L. intestinalis plerocercoids were taken into 15 ml falcon tubes containing 70% ethanol and stored at − 20 °C until further analysis. From each isolate, total gDNA was extracted from the plerocercoids. A partial (480 bp) mt-CO1 gene was amplified by PCR and sequenced unidirectionally. The final size of the trimmed sequences was 392 bp for 43 sequences. Sequence and haplotype analyses were performed, followed by phylogenetic analyses. Results All isolates were confirmed as L. intestinalis by BLAST analysis. In addition, 87 nucleotide mutation positions were determined among 43 CO1 gene sequences. As a result of the haplotype network performed for the mt-CO1 gene region of L. intestinalis isolates; arranged in a star-like configuration with the main haplotype (Hap05), separated from other haplotypes by 1–6 mutation steps, and 29 haplotypes were identified, covering 13.9% (6/43) of the total isolates. Also, 75 variable (polymorphic) sites were determined, 52 of which were parsimony informative sites. Conclusions The molecular characterization of L. intestinalis in woodfish ( A. marmid ) was identified for the first time in Turkey.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Accurate identification of medically important intermediate host and vector species is crucial for understanding disease transmission and control. Identifying Bulinus snails which act as intermediate host species for the transmission of schistosomiasis is typically undertaken using conchological and genital morphology as well as molecular methods. Methods Here, a landmark-based morphometric analysis of shell morphology was undertaken to determine its utility to distinguish the closely related and morphologically similar sister species Bulinus senegalensis and Bulinus forskalii . The method was developed to increase the accuracy of conchological morphology methods to identify Bulinus species in the field. Both species are found in West Africa, but only B. senegalensis is implicated in the transmission of urogenital schistosomiasis. Results We found when scaled down to the same length, 3-whorl and 4-whorl (juvenile) B. senegalensis shells had a longer spire, narrower body whorl and shorter aperture than B. forskalii . In contrast, 5-whorl (adult) B. senegalensis had a shorter spire, but still had a shorter aperture and narrower body whorl than B. forskalii . Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA) showed minimal overlap between B. senegalensis and B. forskalii for 3-whorl and 4-whorl shells, with a clear separation for 5-whorl shells. Overall, B. senegalensis had a consistently shorter aperture size and narrower body whorl than B. forskalii for all development stages. Spire length was variable depending on the stage of development, with 3-whorl and 4-whorl shells having the opposite trends of adult shells. Conclusions Our study demonstrates the applicability of landmark-based morphometrics in distinguishing the medically important, Bulinus senegalensis from its morphologically similar sister species, Bulinus forskalii . We recommend using measurements based on spire length, penultimate whorl length, body whorl width and aperture size to differentiate B. senegalensis and B. forskalii , when used with the appropriate information for each shell’s development stage.",

Methods The work was carried out in vitro on eggs and infective larvae (L3) of H. contortus . The results were analysed with SAS 9.1, applying the ANOVA and Tukey test, and the lethal concentration (LC) values LC50 and LC90 were determined with regression analysis, employing Proc Probit of SAS 9.1. Additionally, the lethal concentration (LC) was calculated with LC 50 and LC 90 to determine the synergistic effect. Results The results demonstrated a high efficacy of the two plants studied on both nematode eggs and L3 larvae as well as of their combinations. The highest egg hatching inhibition was obtained with a 50/50 combination, and the best larvae mortality was obtained with 25% A. cina and 75% T. lucida at 10 mg/mL. Additionally, this combination showed a synergistic effect. Conclusion The two plant species studied here can be applied as natural anthelmintic alternatives due to their high bioactive effect and synergistic response.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose This study aimed to examine the species diversity and structure of the strongylid community in domestic horses in Eastern Slovakia. Also, an analysis of the impact of age, sex, and collection location factors on the strongyid communities was performed. Methods Twenty-seven horses 1.5–21 years old from two farms in eastern Slovakia with different horse-management conditions were studied. Strongylids were collected after horse treatments with Noromectin (0.2 mg ivermectin); 66,170 specimens were collected and identified. Faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) was performed following fenbendazole (FBZ) and ivermectin (IVM) treatments. Results Twenty-four strongylid species were found; horses were infected with 6 to 16 (average = 11.7) species. Six cyathostomin species ( Cylicocyclus nassatus , Cyathostomum catinatum , C. pateratum , Cylicostephanus longibursatus , C. goldi , C. calicatus ) were the most prevalent; C. catinatum was the dominant species in both farms (Berger-Parker index 0.34 and 0.42). The structure of the strongylid community was multimodal with dominant, subdominant, background, and rare species. The Mantel test showed that horse age and sex did not significantly affect the nematode infracommunity composition ( p &gt; 0.05), while the impact of the collection location (farm) was significant ( p = 0.03). Additionally, C. longibursatus was identified as the species contributing significantly to the observed farm differences. Strong resistance to FBZ was documented on both farms (FECRT was 36.4% and 22.7%); IVM resistance was not observed (FECRT = 100%). Conclusion This study presents the first report on the strongylids parasitizing domestic horses in Eastern Slovakia and gives basic information for further studies of horse parasites and their control in the region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Heartworm infection is a chronic disease with clinical signs and effects ranging from an asymptomatic condition to severe disease and death. The prevalence of heartworm disease in the state of Rio de Janeiro has been reported to be high (21.3%). The present study was conducted to evaluate the seroprevalence and risk factors of heartworm infection for the canine population with access to veterinary services in different areas of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. A total of 1787 canine blood samples were obtained from 135 practices across 8 different areas of Rio de Janeiro state (Rio de Janeiro municipality, São Gonçalo municipality, Niterói municipality, Baixada Fluminense, and the northern, southern, eastern, and mountainous areas) and tested for the presence of Dirofilaria immitis antigens and antibodies against several tick-borne disease pathogens using a commercial immunochromatography technique (Vetscan® Flex 4 Rapid Test; Zoetis; NJ USA). Pet owners reported living conditions, physical characteristics, demographics, and clinical signs for evaluation of risk factors for heartworm infection. Only two evaluated risk factors were shown to enhance the risk for D. immitis infection, including having a short hair coat vs. having a medium or long hair coat (OR 2.62) or positive for antibodies to tick-borne disease parasites (OR 3.83). Clinical signs reported for dogs with heartworm disease were typical for that condition. The overall prevalence of heartworm disease in the state was 8.2%, ranging from 2.4% in the mountainous region to 29.4% in the eastern area. It could not be determined if veterinarians were not diligent about dispensing heartworm preventatives or if poor levels of compliance by dog owners were responsible for higher infection rates in some areas of the state.",

The mature spermatozoon of Skrjabinoporus merops is characterized by twisted peripheral microtubules, the presence of a single crested body, periaxonemal sheath and electron-dense rods, and the absence of intracytoplasmic walls and inclusions (glycogen or proteinaceous granules); no peripheral microtubules where nucleus contacts the external plasma membrane. Four morphologically distinct regions of the mature spermatozoon are differentiated. The proximal part (Region I) contains a single crested body, periaxonemal sheath is absent in some (proximal) sections and is present in others situated closer to the nucleus. The central Region II is nucleated, and is followed by Region III that contains a periaxonemal sheath. The distal pole, Region IV, is characterized by disintegration of the axoneme. Spermiogenesis follows the type III pattern (Bâ and Marchand 1995) although in S. merops a slight flagellar rotation is observed. The differentiation zone is characterized by the absence of striated roots and intercentriolar body; two centrioles are present, one of which gives rise to a free flagellum. The latter rotates and undergoes proximodistal fusion with the cytoplasmic protrusion of the differentiation zone. Spermiological characters of S. merops are similar to those of the families Taeniidae and Catenotaeniidae. The mature spermatozoon differs from those of the Dilepididae (where the metadilepidid species have previously been classified) by the lack of glycogen.",

The measurements of these specimens, collected in November 2005, are generally smaller than those reported in the original description of R. cotti, this being probably associated with the nematode’s seasonal maturation cycle or the different host species. As revealed by SEM, the deirids of R. cotti are simple (not bifurcate), in which this species differs from almost all North American congeners. Of these, simple deirids, filamented eggs and a rounded tail tip in females occur only in Rhabdochona longleyi, but it distinctly differs from R. cotti in the smaller number of anterior prostomal teeth (6 vs. 14). Rhabdochona rotundicaudatum is considered a junior synonym of Rhabdochona cascadilla; numerous specimens of the latter were collected from Semotilus atromaculatus, Luxilus cornutus and Notropis rubellus from the type locality (Eramosa River, Ontario, Canada) (unpublished). Rhabdochona paxmani and Rhabdochona salmonis are synonymized with Rhabdochona kisutchi, whereas Rhabdochona californiensis is considered a junior synonym of R. cascadilla. The need of a taxonomic revision of North American species of Rhabdochona is stressed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract European vipers are ambush predators with sporadic feeding events, thereby maintaining the digestive tract empty for long periods. According to previous studies relating lizards’ dietary habits and their helminth faunas, we predict poor gastrointestinal helminth communities in vipers. To test this hypothesis, we have examined the digestive tract of 86 specimens of Vipera aspis (L., 1758) and V. latastei Boscá, 1878, from several localities of the Iberian Peninsula. We found adults of only two nematode species Kalicephalus viperae (Rud., 1819) and Ophidascaris sp. and cysts adhering to the external wall on the stomach in case of two other nematode species Ascarops strongylina (Rud., 1819) and Spirurida gen. sp. All these nematodes are common parasite species in snakes, although Ophidascaris sp. has never before been recorded in Vipera sp. The low prevalence and small number of parasite species in Iberian vipers matched their low feeding rates. However, our results contrast with studies in Poland and Belarus of V. berus species, in which nematodes, as well as trematodes, are common and abundant. Rainfall rates are lower in the Iberian Peninsula than in eastern Central Europe, where amphibians are more available and consumed by V. berus. Amphibians, intermediate hosts for these helminths, have been recorded only sporadically as prey for V. aspis and V. latastei, thus supporting the absence of trematodes in both Iberian viper species. Among populations of Iberian vipers, the prevalence of parasites correlates with the feeding rate (i.e. percentage of vipers with prey), suggesting a linkage between the two parameters. In conclusion, our results suggest that several factors, including climatic characteristics of localities, feeding rates of predators, and type of prey consumed, influence the number and type of parasites in Iberian vipers.",

The vitelline cells of this species measure about 24 μm in length and about 20 μm in width. They have small, elongated, slightly lobulated nuclei, about 4–5 μm in length, with large dense elongated nucleoli and numerous irregularly-shaped dense clumps of heterochromatin. The extensive cytoplasm is rich in numerous cell organelles and cell inclusions. While the perinuclear cytoplasm contains numerous long parallel cisternae of GER, ribo-and polyribosomes, several Golgi complexes and mitochondria, the peripheral cytoplasm contains predominantly three types of cell inclusions: a great number of large lipid droplets, several shell globule clusters, and a very small amount of glycogen-like particles. The most characteristic features of vitellocytes in P. pastinacae are having almost no traces of glycogen and the great number of large, highly osmiophobic lipid droplets representing saturated fatty acids. The presence of large amounts of lipids also in two other trypanorhynchs, Grillotia erinaceus (Beneden, 1858) Guiart, 1927 and Dollfusiella spinulifera (Beveridge et Jones, 2000) Beveridge, Neifar et Euzet, 2004, is in strong contrast to the condition in the most evolved cestodes, Cyclophyllidea, that usually show no trace of lipids.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Between May and September 2006, 640 specimens of the rabbitfish Siganus rivulatus Forsskål (Teleostei, Siganidae) were examined for infections with intestinal helminths. These fishes were caught in the Red Sea off the coast of Sharm El-Sheikh, South Sinai, Egypt, examined in a field laboratory and separated into three size groups of regular length intervals. Only three species of helminths were recovered: the trematode Gyliauchen volubilis Nagaty, 1956 (Gyliauchenidae Fukui, 1929), the acanthocephalan Sclerocollum rubrimaris Schmidt et Paperna, 1978 (Cavisomidae Meyer, 1932) and the nematode Procamallanus elatensis Fusco et Overstreet, 1979 (Cucullanidae Cobbold, 1864). The distribution of these helminths along the intestine of S. rivulatus, in all patterns of single and concurrent infections and the corresponding prevalences and intensities of infection in the different size groups of the fish were recorded. In single infections, each parasite species was found distributed in a well-defined fundamental niche along the intestine of Siganus rivulatus, and a distinct partial overlap between the niches of G. volubilis and Sclerocollum rubrimaris was observed. In concurrent infections with these two species, their fundamental niches were significantly reduced, probably being affected by interactive site segregation and individuals of each species were found segregated in a restricted realised niche. In all other patterns of concurrent infections, each parasite species was normally found in its original fundamental niche. The prevalences of these parasites in the fish examined were relatively low and somewhat similar. In all patterns of single and concurrent infections, the intensity of infection was directly related to fish size. In concurrent infection with G. volubilis and S. rubrimaris, a significant decline was observed in the intensities of both species in the different size groups of the fish, but, in all other patterns of concurrent infections, no significant change in intensity was observed. These observations suggest that the interaction between G. volubilis and S. rubrimaris is probably a negative and symmetrical one. The mode of transmission of these parasites to the fish is also discussed.",

Here, we describe a new species, Sarcocystis arctosi, based on the mature sarcocysts identified in two brown bears (Ursus arctos) from Alaska, USA. Microscopic sarcocysts (37–75 × 20–42 μm) had thin walls (&lt;1 μm). The outer layer of the sarcocyst, the parasitophorous vacuolar membrane (pvm), was wavy in outline and had minute undulations that did not invaginate towards the sarcocyst interior; these undulations occurred at irregular intervals and measured up to 100 nm in length and up to 60 nm width. The ground substance layer beneath the pvm was smooth and lacked microtubules. Longitudinally cut bradyzoites measured 5.6–6.8 × 0.7–1.8 μm. A major portion of nuclear small subunit rDNA sequence obtained from these sarcocysts was similar to that previously obtained from the hepatic schizonts of a S. canis-like parasite from polar bears (Ursus maritimus).",

The discovery of Protomicrocotyle celebesensis Yamaguti, 1953 is the first record for the genus in Australian waters and represents a new geographic location for the species, extending its distribution from Sulawesi, Indonesia and Hawaii to Australia. Furthermore, Caranx ignobilis and Carangoides fulvoguttatus are reported as new host records for P. celebesensis. Carangoides gymnostethus is recorded as a new host for Heteromicrocotyla australiensis Rohde, 1977 from a new geographic location, namely Lizard Island, Queensland. Heteromicrocotyloides mirabilis Rohde, 1977 is reported from the gills of C. fulvoguttatus off Lizard Island, Queensland representing a new geographic record. Heteromicrocotyloides megaspinosus sp. nov. is described from the gills of C. fulvoguttatus from Lizard Island, Queensland and New Caledonia. The new species is distinguished from H. mirabilis by the larger number and size of spines in the male genital corona. Gonoplasius carangis was collected from Pseudocaranx dentex at Heron Island, Queensland. Gonoplasius longirostri is synonymised with G. carangis due to overlap in measurements and similar morphology. The number of ‘dorsal pits’ in this taxon may not be a useful character because they can be cryptic and hard to see. Most hosts from which these two Gonoplasius species have been collected previously have been synonymised as Pseudocaranx dentex except Caranx ascensionis which is now considered to be C. lugubris. Our report of G. carangis from P. dentex at Heron Island, Queensland is a new geographic record.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We made a comparative anatomical study of entobdelline monogenean skin parasites from the blotched fantail ray, Taeniura meyeni (= T. melanospila) from public aquaria and fish-holding facilities distributed widely across the western Pacific Ocean. These facilities were located in Australia (Mooloolaba, southern Queensland; Cairns, northern Queensland), Taiwan and Japan. The capture localities of the aquarium fishes are unknown to us, with the exception of the individual fish from northern Queensland which came from Sudbury Reef, a local inshore reef. Entobdellines from southern Queensland differed morphologically from those from northern Queensland and Taiwan and the 2 new monogenean species are described and named Neoentobdella garneri sp. nov. and N. taiwanensis sp. nov., respectively. We determined that an entobdelline collected by Dyer and co-workers from a ray identified as T. melanospila (= T. meyeni) from an aquarium in Okinawa, Japan and identified by them as Entobdella squamula (Heath, 1902) Johnston, 1929 was misidentified and is tentatively assigned to N. taiwanensis sp. nov. The male copulatory organ of each new species resembles a penis, but evidence that these organs are eversible like a cirrus is presented. Caution is advised in deciding whether the male copulatory organs of capsalids may function as a penis or as a cirrus and we suggest that possession of a penis versus a cirrus may not necessarily indicate wide evolutionary divergence. In N. garneri, spermatophores consist of a sausage-shaped capsule and a long hollow stalk. A spermatophore received from a donor is anchored in the vagina by means of the stalk, with the capsule protruding outside the body.",

These reports showed the highest diversity of digeneans registered in fishes from the study region. The diversity of the digenean fauna of P. brasiliensis could be a consequence of the generalist food habits of this fish.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although multiple vaccine strategy for lymphatic filariasis has provided tremendous hope, the choice of antigens used in combination has determined its success in the previous studies. Multiple antigens comprising key vaccine candidates from different life cycle stages would provide a promising strategy if the antigenic combination is chosen by careful screening. In order to analyze one such combination, we have used a chimeric construct carrying the well studied B. malayi antigens thioredoxin (BmTRX) and venom allergen homologue (BmVAH) as a fusion protein (TV) and evaluated its immune responses in mice model. The efficacy of fusion protein vaccine was explored in comparison with the single antigen vaccines and their cocktail. In mice, TV induced significantly high antibody titer of 1,28,000 compared to cocktail vaccine TRX+VAH (50,000) and single antigen vaccine TRX (16,000) or VAH (50,000). Furthermore, TV elicited higher level of cellular proliferative response together with elevated levels of IFN-γ, IL-4 and IL-5 indicating a Th1/Th2 balanced response. The isotype antibody profile showed significantly high level of IgG1 and IgG2b confirming the balanced response elicited by TV. Immunization with TV antigen induced high levels of both humoral and cellular immune responses compared to either cocktail or antigen given alone. The result suggests that TV is highly immunogenic in mice and hence the combination needs to be evaluated for its prophylactic potential.",

The uterine epithelial lining of these species is thin, except for the perinuclear region of the epithelial cells. Septate junctions occur between adjacent epithelial cells within the uterine wall. The luminal surface of the cells is elevated into microlamellae, which project into the uterine lumen and cover the entire epithelial lining. Basally the uterine epithelium is attached to a basal matrix, and its supporting layers of muscle fibres are weak and composed of scattered circular muscles. Despite the marked similarity in the ultrastructural pattern of the aspidogastrean and two digeneans studied, there is some degree of variation in the secretory activity of their uterine epithelium. The high level of vesicular exocytotic activity in the epithelial cytoplasm of A. lucii may be associated with differences in egg emission and the subsequent life cycle involving a non-ciliated, non-swimming and non-free-living miracidium, as opposed to the free-swimming miracidium of P. angulatum. The similar nature of the uterine epithelium in all three species studied represents an ultrastructural marker possibly supporting a close phylogenetic relationship between the Aspidogastrea and the Digenea.",

The new species look alike to two other species, parasites of mullids (C. steenstrupi and C. mulli) particularly in the body shape and the number, shape, and ornamentation of cephalic, thoracic, and genital processes. The new species, however, can be readily distinguished by having the central cephalic process shorter than lateral ones, the later being bilobed at tip forked, and a relatively larger abdomen. Furthermore, C. steenstrupi possesses relatively wider trunk processes with rounded tips, a short abdominal dorsal process, and attains a larger size (up to 3.6 mm). C. mulli also differs by having all body processes with forked tips, and relatively shorter sixth thoracic somite and abdominal segments 1–3. This is the third record of a species of Colobomatus in South American Atlantic waters.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The first description of vitellogenesis in the Diphyllidea is presented in this paper. Though the type of vitellogenesis and mature vitellocyte in Echinobothrium euterpes appear to be unique among the Eucestoda, however, they somewhat resemble that observed in the two orders of the lower cestodes, Tetraphyllidea and Proteocephalidea. Vitellocyte maturation is characterized by: (1) an increase in cell volume; (2) extensive development of short, parallel, frequently concentric cisternae of GER that produce dense proteinaceous granules; (3) development of Golgi complexes engaged in packaging this material; (4) progressive formation of saturated lipid droplets; their continuous enlargement and fusion; (5) formation of small accumulations of glycogen particles scattered between and among lipid droplets in the cytoplasm of maturing vitellocytes; (6) concentration of dense proteinaceous granules in the peripheral layer of cytoplasm, around the cell plasma membrane; and (7) vacuolization of cytoplasm of mature vitellocytes accompanied by a rapid increase in its volume. A new, unreported type of dense proteinaceous granules, situated around the limiting plasma membranes of mature vitellocytes, is described. Vitellogenesis evidently differs from that with typical shell-globules and shell-globule clusters previously reported in other taxa of lower cestodes. Cytochemical staining with periodic acidthiosemicarbazide-silver proteinate for glycogen indicates a strongly positive reaction for glycogen particles between and around large unsaturated lipid droplets of the maturing and mature vitellocytes. Some hypotheses concerning the interrelationship between this pattern of vitellogenesis, possible mode of egg formation, embryonic development and diphyllidean life cycle, and their phylogenetic implications are drawn and discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Fleas are insects with a high medical and veterinary importance. They may participate in spreading of many pathogenic agents, but still there is limited information about their possible reservoir or vector role for protozoans. The main aim of this study was an attempt of detection zoonotic pathogens, such as Babesia microti and Toxoplasma gondii in fleas Ctenocephalides felis felis and Ctenocephalides canis. Methods In 2013–2017, 155 fleas were captured from domestic dogs and cats in veterinary clinics, animal shelters and pet grooming salons in Upper Silesia Region in Poland. Then, the DNA was extracted from each Ctenocephalides flea by using the ammonia method. Samples were screened for the presence of B. microti and T. gondii using PCR and nested PCR methods. Results B. microti was reported in 6.6% of C. felis felis and 9.1% of C. canis , whereas the prevalence of coinfection with B. microti and T. gondii was 1.9% in cat fleas and 2.3% in dog fleas. Conclusion This study shows the first cases of B. microti occurrence and B. microti and T. gondii coinfection in Ctenocephalides fleas. The estimation of prevalence of examined protozoans may be useful considering the possibility of infection among companion animals, as well as during presentation of the potential risk of infection in humans. In order to clarify the role of C. felis felis and C. canis in transmission of B. microti and T. gondii , the another studies with in vitro cultures and laboratory animals are needed.",

Their distribution range covers almost the entire world, from the Americas to Europe and Asia. Many Bartonella species use rodents as reservoirs, and while much is known about Bartonella infection of rodents in central Europe, its extent is poorly understood in Eastern Europe. Methods The present study examines five rodent species ( Apodemus flavicollis , Myodes glareolus , Microtus arvalis , Apodemus agrarius , Apodemus sylvaticus ) in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in Ukraine. Total of 36 small mammals were captured in September 2017. Results The overall prevalence of Bartonella spp. was 38.9% (14/36) in rodents. Obtained four sequences from Apodemus flavicollis , were identical to Bartonella grahamii and B. taylorii . Conclusion This is the first report to confirm the presence of Bartonella spp. in rodents in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, Ukraine by molecular methods. The sequences show similarity to Bartonella strains occurring in Europe.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Demodex mites infestation, typically asymptomatic, is a problem for patients with weakened immune systems because it often takes the form of symptomatic, massive infection. The Demodex mites play an important role in the occurrence of a range of eye surface diseases such as Demodex blepharitis, Meibomian gland dysfunctions, conjunctivitis and corneal changes. The ocular infection is closely related to the systemic invasion. Our goal was to minimize infestation and alleviate the symptoms of massive demodicosis so as to prevent further damage to the cornea. Methods Our research note involves a 61-year old woman diagnosed with secondary Sjögren syndrome due to rheumatoid arthritis. On the background of the autoimmune disease, corneal perforation of the left eye occurred that was cured by surgery. Then during the follow-up visit the patient was found (microscopically) massively infected with Demodex mites and the developed symptoms were particularly severe. Results Adequate dry eye syndrome and massive demodicosis therapy significantly reduced the number of Demodex mites and improved the patient’s condition. Conclusion We would like to draw the attention of the physicians of different specialties that special care should be taken with respect to the therapy of dry eye syndrome and ocular demodicosis in patients with immunological disorders to achieve therapeutic success and avoid particularly dangerous consequences of these diseases.",

    "abstract": "At present, the chemotherapy for alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is mainly based on albendazole (ABZ). However, more than 20% of patients fail chemotherapy. Therefore, new and more effective treatments are urgently needed. Allicin has been reported to have antibacterial and antiparasitic effects. The objectives of the present study were to investigate the in vivo and in vitro efficacy of allicin against Echinococcus multilocularis (E. multilocularis).The effects of allicin on protoscolex survival and structural changes were evaluated in vitro. The 4-week-old BALB/c male mice used for in vivo modelling underwent inoculation of E. multilocularis protoscoleces by intraperitoneal injection, followed by intragastric administration of allicin for 6 weeks. Then, the effects of allicin on lymphocyte subsets, metacestode growth and host tissue matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2)/MMP9 expression around metacestodes in mice were evaluated. The toxicity of allicin was further evaluated in vivo and in vitro.Att 40 μg/mL, allicin showed a killing effect on protoscoleces in vitro and treatment resulted in the destruction of protoscolex structure. Molecular docking showed that allicin could form hydrogen bonds with E. multilocularis cysteine enzymes. After 6 weeks of in vivo allicin treatment, the spleen index of mice was increased and the weight of metacestodes was reduced. Allicin increased the proportion of CD4+ T cells and decreased the proportion of CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood and spleen. Pathological analysis of the metacestodes showed structural disruption of the germinal and laminated layers after allicin treatment. In addition, allicin inhibited the expression of MMP2 and MMP9 in metacestode-surrounding host tissues. At 160 μg/mL, allicin had no significant toxicity to normal hepatocytes but could inhibit hepatoma cell proliferation. At 30 mg/kg, allicin had no significant hepatorenal toxicity in vivo.These results suggest that allicin exerts anti-E. multilocularis effects in vitro and in vivo and can enhance immune function in mice, with the potential to be developed as a lead compound against echinococcosis.",

    "abstract": "Studies of parasite communities and patterns in the Antarctic are an important knowledge base with the potential to track shifts in ecological relations and study the effects of climate change on host-parasite systems. Endemic Nototheniinae is the dominant fish group found in Antarctic marine habitats. Through their intermediate position within the food web, Nototheniinae link lower to higher trophic levels and thereby also form an important component of parasite life cycles. The study was set out to gain insight into the parasite fauna of Nototheniops larseni, N. nudifrons and Lepidonotothen squamifrons (Nototheniinae) from Elephant Island (Antarctica).Sampling was conducted at three locations around Elephant Island during the ANT-XXVIII/4 expedition of the research vessel Polarstern. The parasite fauna of three Nototheniine species was analysed, and findings were compared to previous parasitological and ecological research collated from a literature review.All host species shared the parasites Neolebouria antarctica (Digenea), Corynosoma bullosum (Acanthocephala) and Pseudoterranova decipiens E (Nematoda). Other parasite taxa were exclusive to one host species in this study. Nototheniops nudifrons was infected by Ascarophis nototheniae (Nematoda), occasional infections of N. larseni with Echinorhynchus petrotschenkoi (Acanthocephala) and L. squamifrons with Elytrophalloides oatesi (Digenea) and larval tetraphyllidean Cestoda were detected.All examined fish species' parasites were predominantly euryxenous regarding their fish hosts. The infection of Lepidonotothen squamifrons with Lepidapedon garrardi (Digenea) and Nototheniops larseni with Echinorhynchus petrotschenkoi represent new host records. Despite the challenges and limited opportunities for fishing in remote areas, future studies should continue sampling on a more regular basis and include a larger number of fish species and sampling sites within different habitats.",

These parasites were assigned to Brachycladium Looss, 1899 and differed from other species of the genus in the relative size of the oral and ventral suckers, the form and size of the eggs and their extremely small body size. A canonical discriminant analysis was used to examine differences between these specimens and the smallest available individuals of B. atlanticum (Abril, Balbuena and Raga, 1991) Gibson, 2005, considered the morphologically closest species. The overall results exhibited significant differences between the two samples and a jack-knife classification showed that 96.2% of the specimens were correctly classified to their group. In view of evidence from morphological data, the specimens from M. europaeus are considered as new to science and are designated as Brachycladium parvulum n. sp.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Classification and identification of muscle-parasitizing didymozoids found in marine fish is difficult because of their novel parasitism and morphology. Recent sequence analysis has helped, but only seven sequences are available. Therefore, the usefulness of molecular methods for differentiation of muscle-parasitizing didymozoids, as well as genetic differences between the muscle and the other site-parasitizing didymozoids are quite unclear. In the present study, six unidentified didymozoid isolates from the trunk muscles of four marine fish species (Diagramma pictum, Plectorhinchus cinctus, Pagrus major and Cypselurus heterurus) were examined genetically using sequence analysis (18S rDNA, 28S rDNA, ITS-2 and coxI). All isolates were placed phylogenetically as a lineage independent of other site-parasitizing didymozoids at 18S rDNA, ITS-2 and coxI. They were grouped into three distinct lineages. The present and the previous unidentified or identified didymozoids from trunk muscles were found to differ clearly for every host species by sequence analysis, suggesting that muscle-parasitizing didymozoids are host-specific. This report is the first describing the molecular characteristics of muscle-parasitizing didymozoids by sequence analysis targeting the nuclear and mitochondrial DNA loci, which is proposed as a superior method for didymozoid differentiation.",

In this review, we examine the history of the echinostomebased studies from the beginnings to the present. For this purpose, we have divided the history of echinostomes into four periods (i.e. 18th and 19th centuries, first half of the 20th century, second half of the 20th century and the late 20th and 21th century) according to the types of studies performed in each of them.

An important diagnostic and prognostic factor for the treatment of infection is a quick and correct diagnosis of amoebae strains. The aim of our study was to develop a rapid method for detection and identification of pathogenic Acanthamoeba spp. strains from diagnostic material collected from water. In this study we analysed five amplification-based genetic markers (Aca 16S, Ac6/210, GP, JDP, Nelson) used for identification of pathogenic Acanthamoeba spp. strains isolated in water sources in Poland, Iceland and Sweden. Our results demonstrated the presence of pathogenic Acanthamoeba strains in tap water. PCR assay appeared to be a more rapid and sensitive method to detect the presence of amoebae than the limited conventional techniques. Based on our observations, we can confirm that the use of four out of five genetic markers (Aca 16S, Ac 6/210, JDP, GP, Nelson) may be helpful in identification of Acanthamoeba spp. strains, but only one Aca 16S primer pair is a highly specific marker that distinguishes between pathogenic strains of Acanthamoeba and other free-living amoeba families.",

Currently, external markers of embryonic development represent a new approach in the evaluation of ovicidal drugs. The objective of this work was to update the morphology of embryonic development and propose novel external markers to differentiate between early, medium, or late P. h. capitis eggs.Using stereoscopic light microscopy, we describe the morphological characteristics of P. h. capitis eggs with a special focus on embryonic development.The morphological analysis of the eggs revealed the presence of an operculum with ten aeropyles, although no micropyles were observed. For the first time, the presence of defective eggs that were non-viable due to the apparent absence of yolk granules was documented. The early eggs presented yolk granules and developing germ bands, while the medium eggs presented an embryonic rudiment and the outlines of the eyes and limbs. In late eggs, the head with eyes and antennae, the thorax with three pairs of legs, and the abdomen with six pairs of spiracles were observed as formed structures. At the end of this stage, the embryos acquired the morphology of the nymph I stage.We propose novel biomarkers (e.g., the presence of spiracles and antennae, the proportion of the egg occupied by the embryo) to facilitate the differentiation between the developmental stages. The updated morphological characteristics of P. h. capitis eggs facilitate the standardization of toxicological tests in the quest for ovicidal drugs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose This study aims to develop and evaluate a cost-effective, user-friendly multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method for detecting multiple tick-borne pathogens associated with human and veterinary diseases. Methods In silico PCR was performed to design and evaluate primer sequences reported for amplifying Rickettsia spp ., Borrelia spp. , and Ehrlichia spp. Single and multiplex qPCR assays were then standardized to detect individual pathogens and multiple pathogens in a single reaction. Positive controls were generated to determine the dynamic range of the methods. In the validation phase, a total of 800 samples were screened for the presence of tick-borne pathogens. Results Identification in a single qPCR reaction (multiplex) of Ehrlichia spp . , and Borrelia spp. with a limit of detection of 10 copies and Rickettsia spp . with 100 copies, a PCR efficiency (E) of 90–100% and a coefficient of correlation ( R 2 ) of 0.998–0.996 for all pathogens. Conclusion The ability to detect three significant pathogens (Ehrlichia spp ., Rickettsia spp ., and Borrelia spp .) in a single qPCR reaction offers a significant advantage in the field of molecular diagnostics for tick-borne diseases. This advancement has a profound impact on public health as it facilitates the selection of appropriate treatment protocols, thereby reducing complications associated with disease progression. The streamlined approach provided by this method simplifies the diagnostic process and enables timely intervention, ultimately improving patient outcomes and mitigating the potential risks associated with untreated or misdiagnosed tick-borne infections.",

    "abstract": "Avian haemosporidians are widespread parasites, occurring in many bird families and causing pathologies ranging from rather benign infections to highly virulent diseases. The state of knowledge about lineage-specific intensities of haemosporidian infection (i.e., parasitaemia) is mainly based on infection experiments conducted under laboratory conditions. The levels and range of parasitaemia in natural host-parasite associations as well as their influencing factor remain largely unexplored.Thus, we explored the parasitaemia of four songbird species (i.e., European Robins, Black and Common Redstarts and Whinchats) during migration by screening individuals upon landing on an insular passage site after extensive endurance flights to (1) describe their natural host-parasite associations, (2) quantify parasitaemia and (3) explore potential host- and parasite-related factors influencing parasitaemia.We found 68% of Whinchats to be infected with haemosporidians, which is more frequent than any other of the studied host species (30-34%). Furthermore, we confirmed that parasitaemia of Haemoproteus infections was higher than average Plasmodium infections. Median parasitaemia levels were rather low (parasite cells in 0.01% of hosts' red blood cells) and varied largely among the different parasite lineages. However, we found four individuals hosting infections with parasitaemia higher than typical chronic infections.Based on the known transmission areas of the respective lineages, we argue that these higher intensity infections might be relapses of consisting infections rather than acute phases of recent primary infections.",

    "abstract": "Malaria is one of the most dangerous infectious diseases in the world. It occurs in tropical and subtropical regions and affects about 40% of the world´s population. In endemic regions, an estimated 200 million people contract malaria each year. Three-quarters of all global deaths (about 600 per year) are children under 5 years of age. Thus, malaria is one of the most relevant tropical and also childhood diseases in the world. Thanks to various public health measures such as vector control through mosquito nets or the targeted use of insecticides as well as the use of antimalarial prophylaxis drugs, the incidence has already been successfully reduced in recent years. However, to reduce the risk of malaria and to protect children effectively, further measures are necessary. An important part of these measures is an effective vaccination against malaria. However, the history of research shows that the development of an effective malaria vaccine is not an easy undertaking and is associated with some complications. Research into possible vaccines began as early as the 1960s. However, the results achieved were rather sobering and the various vaccines fell short of their expectations. It was not until 2015 that the vaccine RTS,S/AS01 received a positive evaluation from the European Medicines Agency. Since then, the vaccine has been tested in Africa. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic, there are new developments in vaccine research that could also benefit malaria research. These include, among others, the so-called mRNA vaccines. Already in the early 1990s, an immune response triggered by an mRNA vaccine was described for the first time. Since then, mRNA vaccines have been researched and discussed for possible prophylaxis. However, it was not until the COVID-19 pandemic that these vaccines experienced a veritable progress. mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 were rapidly developed and achieved high efficacy in studies. Based on this success, it is not surprising that companies are also focusing on other diseases and pathogens. Besides viral diseases, such as influenza or AIDS, malaria is high on this list. Many pharmaceutical companies (including the German companies BioNTech and CureVac) have already confirmed that they are researching mRNA vaccines against malaria. However, this is not an easy task. The aim of this article is to describe and discuss possible antigens that could be considered for mRNA vaccination. However, this topic is currently still very speculative.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Derogenes ruber Lühe, 1900, the type-species of the genus Derogenes Lühe, 1900, is a poorly known derogenid digenean. The original description of this species was not illustrated and aspects of the morphology of the parasite from the type-host remain scarce. Available records of this species were brief and/or lacked illustrations and were based on morphology alone. Additionally, molecular data for Derogenes spp. are warranted to untangle species complexes as they provide a better assessment of interspecific genetic divergence. Methods Derogenes ruber is redescribed based on newly collected specimens from the gall bladder of its type-host Chelidonichthys lastoviza (Bonnaterre, 1788) collected in the Western Mediterranean off the Algerian coast during 2017–2019 and molecular data are provided using a partial fragment of the nuclear 28S ribosomal RNA gene (28S rRNA), the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) and a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 ( cox 1) gene. Results We herein provide a detailed illustrated redescription and morphometric data of D. ruber from its type-host C. lastoviza . We report a new geographical record (off Algeria) for it. Derogenes ruber is also genetically characterised for the first time. Species/lineages of Derogenes were recovered in five strongly supported reciprocally monophyletic clades: (i) D. ruber from C. lastoviza off Algeria; (ii) D. lacustris from Galaxias maculatus (Jenyns) off Argentina; (iii) Lineage “ D. varicus DV1” ( D. varicus sensu stricto) from fish hosts in the White and Barents seas and the North Sea; (iv) Lineage “ D. varicus DV2” from mollusc hosts in the White Sea; and (v) Lineage “ D. varicus DV3” from Eumicrotremus fedorovi Mandrytsa. in the Pacific Ocean. Hence, comparison of the newly generated sequences with other available data for Derogenes species supports the distinction of D. ruber confirming its taxonomic status and helping assess interspecific variation. Comparison of D. ruber with the closely related species Derogenes latus revealed overlaps in morphometric data and the validity of the latter species is questioned. Conclusion The combination of morphological and molecular data provided for D. ruber provides a firm foundation for further investigations of Derogenes spp. Although we do describe herein material of D. ruber from the type-host, given that the occurrence of a single Derogenes species in various hosts has been challenged by molecular data, and both D. lacustris and D. varicus sensu stricto had been genetically proven to occur in various hosts, D. ruber and D. latus may be indeed synonymous. Additional sequencing effort on Derogenes spp. will strengthen systematic comparative studies and evolutionary relationships within the Derogenidae in general.",

Six cestode species were found: Tetraphyllideans Calliobothrium barbarae, C. australis, C. lunae and Orygmatobothrium schmittii, diphyllidean Echinobothrium notoguidoi and trypanorhynch Eutetrarhynchus vooremi. The most common number of parasite species per host was 3. Brillouin’s diversity index ranged from 0.1 to 1.2 Berger-Parker dominance index indicated that C. barbarae was the dominant species, followed by O. schmittii and C. australis. Calliobothrium barbarae, C. australis and O. schmittii presented a broad distribution along the spiral intestine, whereas C. lunae, E. notoguidoi and E. vooremi showed a more restricted niche breadth. In general, the Renkonen’s index showed no evidence of niche overlap in the range of distribution of the different species. In most of the infracommunities, intraspecific aggregation was stronger than interspecific aggregation, indicating that competition may play a little role. The distribution patterns of the Calliobothrium specimens concurs with the predictions of attachment sites for Calliobothrium species made by previous authors.",

    "abstract": "Hydatid cyst is the most common parasitic disease in the Mediterranean region, the Middle East and South America.It is also a medical and economic problem in Turkey.The agents responsible for hydatid disease are Echinococcus granulosus and E. multilocularis.Intracranial extradural localization of a hydatid cyst is very rare.There are only two previously published case reports concerning both supra-and infra-tentorial localization of cysts (Beskonakli et al. 1996, Turgut 1997), but the present case is the first report in the literature of removal of a complete cyst without rupture.A 23-year-old man was admitted to our clinic complaining of headache, nausea, vomiting and imbalance.Physical examination revealed softness in the left occipital region.There was bilateral papilledema, abnormal left cerebellar tests and ataxia.Laboratory tests were normal except for elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (45 mm/h).Plain roentgenograms of the cranium showed a defect in the left occipital bone.Cranial computerized tomography (CT) images revealed a cystic lesion of similar density to cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) in the posterior fossa and a focal defect in the adjacent occipital bone (Fig. 1A,B).Due to the patient's previous trauma history, it was first evaluated as a leptomeningeal cyst.Magnetic resonance (MR) images revealed a hypo-intense cystic mass in the left occipital region in T1(relaxation time)-weighted and hyper-intense in T2-weighted MR projections.The cyst extended above and below the tentorium and had an extradural location (Fig. 2).During surgery, after performing a large parieto-occipital skin flap, the cyst wall was seen through the occipital bone defect.The borders of the defect were carefully extended along the occipital and suboccipital regions.The extradural cyst was removed completely without rupture using Dowling's technique (Carrea et al. 1975).After the cavity was entirely irrigated with hypertonic solution, cranioplasty was performed in the area of the craniectomy defect.",

Here we use a comparative approach to examine the effect of mammals’ diving behavior on the taxonomic richness of their lice. We compared the mean genera richness of lice, and — as potential confounding variables — the mean species richness of host, and the mean body mass of host between diving clades and their non-diving sister clades. Louse genera richness was significantly lower in clades of aquatic mammals than on their non-diving sister clades. Host species richness was not significantly different between these clades. Body mass was significantly higher in clades of aquatic mammals, however, the direction of this difference cannot explain the difference in parasite taxonomic richness. This study suggests that mammals’ diving behavior can effectively shape their ectoparasite communities.",

The phenogram constructed with the RAPD data showed that only three strains isolated from Panstrongylus megistus collected in the Municipality of Arapongas were grouped together in a sub-branch. None of the other 15 strains could be clustered according to triatomine species or geographical origin. The strains were grouped with the T. cruzi I reference sample, indicating closer association with the sylvatic transmission cycle of T. cruzi in the state of Paraná. However, analyses of the rDNA and COII gene polymorphisms revealed the presence of populations from both T. cruzi I and II major lineages. In half of the analyzed triatomines, we found parasites from both lineages coinfecting the same bugs. Of these, most (6/9) were isolated from Triatoma sordida, and 3/9 from Panstrongylus megistus. These results contribute to a better comprehension of the ecoepidemiology of Chagas’ disease in Paraná, and raise questions about the role of studies of polyclonal population dynamics for controlling the transmission of T. cruzi to humans in this region.",

Early vitellocyte maturation is characterised by: (1) an increase in cell volume; (2) extensive development of large, parallel cisternae of GER that produce proteinaceous granules; (3) development of Golgi complexes engaged in packaging this material; (4) continuous enlargement of proteinaceous granules within vacuoles and their transformation into shell-globule clusters composed of heterogeneous material. Cytochemical staining with periodic acid-thiosemicarbazide-silver proteinate for polysaccharides indicated a strongly positive reaction for the presence of α-glycogen rosettes and β-glycogen particles in the advanced stage of vitellocyte maturation. Both protein synthesis for shell-globule formation and carbohydrate synthesis or glycogenesis, important storage of nutritive reserves for the developing embryos, observed during cytodifferentiation of P. trygonis vitellocytes overlap in time to some extent. Mature vitelline cells are very rich in three types of cell inclusions accumulated in large amounts in their cytoplasm: (1) shell-globule clusters, playing an important role in egg-shell formation; (2) numerous large lipid droplets, as well as a high accumulation of lipid and α-glycogen rosettes and β-glycogen particles that undoubtedly represent important nutritive reserves for the developing embryos. Despite the fact that the type of vitellogenesis and ultrastructure of the mature vitellocyte in P. trygonis appears to differ to some extent from those of three other trypanorhynch species, its general pattern and ultrastructure greatly resembles those observed in other lower cestodes. Factors that may have contributed to the qualitative and quantitative variation in lipids during vitellogenesis among the four species of Trypanorhyncha, are identified and discussed.",

No statistically significant differences in the incidence and density of Demodex mites were found between patients with RA and controls.

Little is known about the prevalence of these pathogens in pediatric cases with cancer and diarrhea. Unidentified causes of chronic diarrhea were previously encountered in pediatric cancer patients at the National Cancer Institute in Egypt. Therefore, this study tried to search for the contribution of microsporidia as a causative agent of diarrhea in this population using acid-fast trichrome stain as a specific staining and the PCR in order to evaluate the staining technique in clinical diagnosis of microsporidia. Between January 2008 and June 2009, 271 diarrheic samples from pediatric patients with cancer were studied. Microsporidia were confirmed in 13 (4.8%) cases by both PCR and staining, and additional 2 samples were positive only by staining. As a negative control, stool samples from 60 diarrheic children without malignant cancer and no microsporidia detection were examined by these two methods. So, it can be concluded that adding a diagnostic test for microsporidia to the clinical laboratory work in hospitals concerned with cancer is essential. Acid fast trichrome staining technique as being nearly efficacious as the PCR, but simpler and less expensive, can replace the molecular techniques for the diagnosis of microsporidia.",

Parasites recovered from O. tetraspis included members of the Pentastomida, Trematoda and Nematoda. An undescribed pentastomid belonging to the family Sebekidae was recovered from O. tetraspis. The same parasite was also found to parasitize V. ornatus from the rainforest. Other parasites found in O. tetraspis were Pseudoneodiplostomum thomasi, Dujardinascaris sp. and larva of a Camallanus sp. Varanus ornatus from the rainforest and the derived savanna had some parasites including Duthiersia fimbriata, an unidentified pseudophyllidean cestode and Tanqua tiara in common. Cosmocerca ornata and Oswaldocruzia hoepplii were restricted to hosts from the derived savanna while the unidentified trematode occurred only in lizards from the rainforest. The unidentified pseudophyllidean cestode bears a close resemblance to Probothriocephalus, a cestode previously reported only from deep water teleosts. Pseudoneodiplostomum thomasi and Duthiersia fimbriata are new locality records for Nigeria.",

Two species of camallanid nematodes, adults of Camallanus cotti Fujita, 1927 and a single Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) sp. fourth-stage larva, were also recorded from A. bengalensis. Camallanus cotti, a pathogenic parasite of many species of wild and aquarium-reared fishes in many countries of South and East Asia, Europe, South and North America, West Indies and Australia, is reported for the first time from a representative of the fish family Anguillidae. Descriptions of R. (R.) keralaensis and Indian specimens of C. cotti, based on light and scanning electron microscopical examinations, are provided. Camallanus oxygasterae Gupta et Bakshi, 1983 is considered a junior synonym of C. cotti.",

A type species, NIK-1s_mys was used as control for comparison. Differences in the spore shape, length and width were observed. Of the 30 decamer random primers tested, 22 primers gave repeatable RAPD profiles and yielded a total of 143 fragments, of which 78 were polymorphic (55%). The resulting data was used to derive genetic similarity values for constructing a dendrogram. The neighbour joining method based on Dice coefficients indicate a major cluster comprising NIK-1s_mys, NIWB-11bp and NIWB-12n, whereas NIWB-13md, NIWB-14b and NIWB-15mb appear to be different from each other as well from the major cluster mentioned above which includes the type species (NIK-1s_mys). Based on the reproducibility of RAPD profiles, we are able to identify these microsporidians as different isolates. The RAPD technique may be useful in detecting sources of infection of this economically important domestic insect.",

Three strains of trophozoites from the ATCC (A. castellani T4, A. castellani Neff, and A. polyphaga) and two Acanthamoeba isolates obtained from swimming pools (PT5 and PO1) were placed in monoxenic culture. To test their survival in cleaning solutions for contact lenses, the trophozoites were exposed for 4 and 24 h to two multipurpose solutions (A and B), and were then inoculated into a new monoxenic culture. Amoebic growth on the plates was observed after 72 h of incubation. Trophozoites from all three ATCC strains and one isolate from a swimming pool (PO1) grew in all plates after 4 h of exposure to solutions A and B. After 24 h, the ATCC strains and the PO1 isolate showed growth in most of the plates treated. Only the PT5 isolate showed susceptibility to both solutions over the time intervals tested. The two solutions were not completely effective against most strains and isolates over the time intervals tested. These results are important, since species of Acanthamoeba are widely distributed in the environment and are potential agents of eye pathologies.",

The diversity of the digenean fauna of sparid fishes from this locality is compared to that recorded from the Gulf of Tunis. Prodistomum polonii, not detected before, was found in Sarpa salpa. Aphallus rubalo, Derogenes latus, Holorchis micracanthum and Pachycreadium carnosum previously recorded from sparid fishes on the Tunisian coasts were absent during this study. Allopodocotyle pedicellata, Lepocreadium pegorchis, L. album, Proctoeces maculatus, Magnibursatus bartolii and Macvicaria maillardi were reported in hosts not previously reported for the Gulf of Tunis. Generally, prevalence was higher in fishes from Bizerte Lagoon but abundance and mean intensity were higher in Gulf of Tunis. Except for Lithognathus mormyrus, Sarpa salpa and Sparus aurata from Bizerte Lagoon, which show higher digenean diversity, the other sparid fishes have a lower diversity compared to those from Gulf of Tunis.

(Digenea, Zoogonidae) specimen were collected from the digestive tract of Tylosurus acus imperialis (Teleostei, Belonidae) caught off the eastern coast of Tunisia. L. tylosuri is very similar to its closest relatives, L. retroflexus and L. nitens. It can be easily distinguished from L. retroflexus (Molin, 1859) in having a more extensive vitellarium, with follicles reaching from the posterior margin of the acetabulum and extending beyond the posterior margin of the testes and a coiled seminal vesicle. L. tylosuri differs from L. nitens as illustrated by Linton 1898, in having a longer cirrus pouch (0.7 mm vs 0.36 mm, respectively) overlapping the anterior edge of the ventral sucker and a submarginal genital pore (submedian in L. nitens). It's also different from L. nitens as described by Manter 1947 in the vitelline disposition and in having the greater sucker ratio (1: 1.3-2.1 vs 1: 1.3-1.6, respectively). L. tylosuri differs from L. nitens as reported by Machida and Kuramochi 2000 by the absence of variations in the vitellarium disposition in all specimens. L. tylosuri is more similar to L. nitens from group A (considered synonym of L. ahaaha Yamaguti, 1970 = L. nitens by Bray 1987) by having vitelline follicles extending beyond the testes. L. tylosuri can be distinguished from L. ahaaha by its pedunculate rather than prominent acetabulum and its larger body size (4.10-7.85 mm long and 0.75-1.2 mm large vs 2.1-6 mm long and 0.45-1.1 mm large, respectively). The prevalence of L. tylosuri sp. nov. was negatively correlated with host length (decreasing with host size increasing). Host sex does not seem to affect infection parameters.",

Although it has been recorded in many hosts, its impact on endangered species is poorly understood.

The populations inhabit fragmented habitats and suffer from loss of genetic variation. An IFA test revealed that 35.9% of sampled animals (41/114) was infected with Cryptosporidium and none with Giardia. The prevalence and infection intensity differed among the populations. In areas grazed by cattle it was about 3 folds higher, which suggests a possible transmission route.

The latter species, O. chitwoodae, was studied for the first time by scanning electron microscopy, which enabled to recognize some previously unrecorded morphological details in this species.

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Human cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic parasitic disease that constitutes a public health challenge and a socio-economic burden in endemic areas worldwide. No specific surveillance system of CE infections in humans exists in Lebanon. The incidence and trends over time have not been documented. The current study aimed to assess the demographic and epidemiologic features of human CE surgical cases over a 14-year period in the five main regions of Lebanon. Methods From 2005 to 2018, a total of 894 surgically confirmed cases of hydatidosis were recorded from five anatomy and pathology laboratories. Results The mean annual surgical incidence was 1.23/100,000 inhabitants. Over the span of these years, the incidence increased from 0.53 to 1.94 cases/100,000 inhabitants in 2005 and 2018, respectively. CE is present in Lebanon with an uneven distribution from one region to the other with higher prevalence in Bekaa (29.0%), a rural area where sheep raising is widespread. Human CE cases were more common in females (60.1%) than in males (39.9%) and a high burden of infection was reported for the age group of 30–39 years. Besides, 66.7% of the cases expressed only liver complications whereas, 20.5% showed predilection towards lungs. The 7.8% of cases presented cysts in other organs, and 1.3% showed multiple localizations. Additionally, predominant involvement of Echinococcus granulosus sensu stricto was recorded in human infections. Comparison of Echinococcus granulosus s.s. populations from different Mediterranean countries also revealed high gene flow among this region and sharing of alleles. Conclusion The current study is a step forward to fill the gap of knowledge for the hydatidosis in Lebanon where the lack of epidemiological data and control measures have resulted in higher incidence of human CE.

The vesicula seminalis is enclosed by a prominent layer of circular muscle fibres and has inner syncytial protrusions. The penis bulb is a highly muscular organ with prominent radial and circular muscle fibres, a gutter-shaped large spine and 16 small spines. Two syncytial male accessory glands, and a single reservoir for male accessory secretion were identified. The secretory bodies in the male accessory glands and male accessory reservoir have a unique structure. A large oocyte is situated in a chamber, previously referred to as the \"ootype\" or \"egg-cell-forming region\" (ECFR), which also contains one or two small undifferentiated cells and vacuolated tissue. Mature spermatozoa were abundant in the receptaculum seminis and dispersed in the vacuolated tissue in the ECFR and appeared to be attached to the membrane of the large oocyte. Mature spermatozoa were also seen in the parenchymal tissue near the chamber containing embryos and even in the tissues of the embryo.",

Dirofilariosis is a mosquito-borne parasitic infection that predominantly affects dogs. Human D. repens infections have primarily been reported in Mediterranean countries, but are emerging throughout Central and Northern Europe. Methods The worm was removed surgically and identified using PCR and DNA sequencing. The consensus sequences were compared against reference sequences of Dirofilaria repens from GenBank. Results The 56-year-old woman acquired the infection, which presented as a subcutaneous nodule, in Vienna, Austria. This is the second autochthonous case of human D. repens infection in Austria. Conclusion The reasons for the emergence of D. repens and other parasitic infections in Central and Northern Europe are manifold, including climate change and globalization. This case demonstrates that with the growing number of D. repens infections , health care professionals must place further emphasis on emerging infectious diseases to ensure appropriate diagnostics and treatment in the future.",

In Iran, indigenous cases occur in its south-eastern region. The aim of this study is to assess the environmental risk of malaria transmission in an endemic area of southern Iran.The study was carried out in Minab district (Hormozgan province, southern Iran), with the aim to assess the environmental risk of malaria, based on a spatio-temporal study, using Growing Degree Days (GDD)-based predictions, larval habitat ecology, MaxEnt spatial predictions and malaria transmission data.The Gradient Model Risk index showed the highest malaria transmission risk period to be during January-April and October-December. The ecological conditions of water bodies of larval habitats of the four vector species (Anopheles culicifacies, A. dthali, A. fluviatilis and A. stephensi) were assessed, with A. stephensi being the most prevalent and the most widely distributed species.These findings, together with the MaxEnt Anopheles predictive distribution models, allowed identifying villages in danger of malaria transmission in Minab district. This spatio-temporal prediction of malaria transmission risk should be incorporated in the design of malaria control initiatives towards a local malaria early warning system. Moreover, the proposed transmission risk model can be extrapolated, at local scale, to other malaria endemic areas of tropical and subtropical regions.",

    "abstract": "Ribosome biogenesis is a key process in all living organisms, energetically expensive and tightly regulated. Currently, little is known about the components of the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription machinery that are present in intestinal parasites, such as Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Entamoeba histolytica. Thus, in the present work, an analysis was carried out looking for the components of the rRNA transcription machinery that are conserved in intestinal parasites and if these could be used to design new treatment strategies.The different components of the rRNA transcription machinery were searched in the studied parasites with the NCBI BLAST tool in the EuPathDB Bioinformatics Resource Center database. The sequences of the RRN3 and POLR1F orthologs were aligned and important regions identified. Subsequently, three-dimensional models were built with different bioinformatic tools and a structural analysis was performed.Among the protozoa examined, C. parvum is the parasite with the fewest identifiable components of the rRNA transcription machinery. TBP, RRN3, POLR1A, POLR1B, POLR1C, POLR1D, POLR1F, POLR1H, POLR2E, POLR2F and POLR2H subunits were identified in all species studied. Furthermore, the interaction regions between RRN3 and POLR1F were found to be conserved and could be used to design drugs that inhibit rRNA transcription in the parasites studied.The inhibition of the rRNA transcription machinery in parasites might be a new therapeutic strategy against these microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Neospora caninum is an apicomplexan parasite, which owes its importance to the fact that it represents the major infectious cause of bovine abortion worldwide. Its life cycle is comprised of three distinct stages: Tachyzoites, representing the proliferative and disease-causing stage, bradyzoites, representing a slowly replicating, tissue cyst-forming stage, and sporozoites, which represent the end product of a sexual process taking place within the intestinal tissue of the final canine host. Tachyzoites are capable of infecting a large variety of host cells in vitro and in vivo, while bradyzoites have been found mainly within the central nervous system. In order to survive, proliferate, and proceed in its life cycle, N. caninum has evolved some amazing features. First, the parasite profits immensely from its ability to interact with, and invade, a large number of host cell types. Secondly, N. caninum exploits its capability to respond to alterations in living conditions by converting into another stage (tachyzoite-to-bradyzoite or vice versa). Thirdly, this parasite has evolved mechanisms that modulate its host cells according to its own requirements, and these must, especially in the case of the bradyzoite stage, involve mechanisms that ensure long term survival of not only the parasite but also of the host cell. These three key events (host cell invasion — stage conversion — host cell modulation) represent potential targets for intervention. In order to elucidate the molecular and cellular bases of these important features of N. caninum, cell culture-based approaches and laboratory animal models are extensively exploited. In this review, we will summarize the present knowledge and achievements related to host cell and parasite cell biology.",

The spermiogenesis of Angularella beema is characterised by absence of both flagellar rotation and proximodistal fusion. The differentiation zone is surrounded by cortical microtubules and is delimited by a ring of arching membranes. It contains two centrioles, one of which develops the axoneme that grows directly into the elongating cytoplasmic protrusion. This pattern of spermiogenesis was described as the Type IV spermiogenesis of cestodes. Among cestodes, similar pattern of spermiogenesis is known in the family Hymenolepididae and in some representatives of the family Anoplocephalidae. The mature spermatozoon of A. beema consists of five regions differing in their ultrastructural characteristics. It is characterised by the presence of cortical microtubules (spirally arranged at angle of 30–40° to the spermatozoon axis) and a single crested body. There is a periaxonemal sheath in certain parts of the spermatozoon as well as glycogen-like granules between the periaxonemal sheath and the cortical microtubules. The comparisons of the mature spermatozoon of A. beema with those of other two dilepidid species (Dilepis undula and Molluscotaenia crassiscolex) demonstrate some variation within the family: presence of periaxonemal sheath in A. beema and D. undula and its absence in M. crassiscolex; presence of electron-dense rods in D. undula and their absence in A. beema.",

New diagnoses for Apexolichus and Titanolichus and keys to all known species are provided. We redescribe all species of the genus Protolichus Mégnin et Trouessart, 1884, described by E. Trouessart over a century ago, and which have been transferred to these genera. Two new species are described: Apexolichus psephoti sp. nov. from Psephotus varius Clark A.H., 1910 (type host) and P. haematonotus (Gould, 1838); and Titanolichus triangulifer sp. nov. from Barnardius zonaris (Shaw, 1805) (type host) and Northiella haematogaster (Gould, 1838). New synonymies are proposed: Apexolichus splendens (Favette et Trouessart, 1904) syn. nov. is a junior synonym of A. velifer (Trouessart, 1899); A. distensis (Favette et Trouessart, 1904) syn. nov. is a junior synonym of A. affinis (Mégnin et Trouessart, 1884). Apexolichus platycerci (Mironov, Dabert et Proctor, 2003) comb. nov. is a new combination for this species, which was formerly placed in the genus Titanolichus. Phylogenetic analysis (MP) confirms the monophyly of the genera Apexolichus and Titanolichus. Both of these genera, together with the monotypic genus Sideroferus Gaud et Atyeo, 1996 (being a sister group of Titanolichus), form a clade within the Protolichus generic group and are restricted in their host associations to parrots of the tribe Platycercini (Psittacidae, Psittacinae), members of which occur in the Australia and Indo-Malayan region. Representatives of each genus are restricted to a particular genus or a few genera of Platycercini. Host associations of these genera are briefly discussed.",

The degree of the immunosuppression was confirmed by functional test of phagocytes and proliferation activity test of lymphocytes. The study indicates an association between parasitized animals, and a depression in the immune responses. Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina and Trichuris vulpis were the most prevalent parasite species. During the experiment no anthelmintic treatment was applied. In puppies suffering from immunosuppression significantly lower specific antibody level after antirabies vaccination was demonstrated on day 28. In such case of known immunosuppression it is recommended to repeat antirabies vaccination; primovaccination does not provide satisfactory protection. Anthelmintic preventive treatment may be necessary to improve the immune responses to antirabies vaccination and provide effective protection.",

The prevalence and intensity of infection of C. haemulonis has not previously been evaluated in the Caribbean grunts; during this survey, prevalence was highest in H. sciurus; values are similar to those found in other haemulids. Lernanthropus chacchi sp. nov. can be distinguished from its closest congener, L. rathbuni Wilson, 1922, by its female having a dorsal plate covering the entire urosome and the lack of lateral notches at the base of the modified third legs, the male has relatively longer third legs, different body proportions and ornamentation of the first and second legs. This is the third species of Lernanthropus known from reef grunts in the Caribbean and the second species of the genus described from Mexican waters. The infection prevalence of the new species on H. sciurus (24%) was higher than that known for L. rathbuni from other haemulids. Taxonomic illustrations of females and males of both species are also provided. Other crustacean ectoparasites included the copepod Hatschekia spp. and praniza larvae of a gnathid isopod.",

The proximal ends of the stalks of fully formed spermatophores were open and located in a recess on the ventral surface close to, but not inside, the vagina and the male reproductive opening. Three adult parasites carried spermatophores attached externally to the ventral surface. One individual carried 3 spermatophores and 2 others a single spermatophore. In addition, in 2 adults, short lengths of what appeared to be stalk remnants were observed attached near the reproductive openings. With regard to spermatophore exchange, the evidence in support of the following 2 possibilities is discussed. (1) Adult specimens of D. cairae carrying fully formed spermatophores ventrally are recipients not donors, having received their spermatophores singly during mating events. (2) Spermatophore carrying adults are donors, their spermatophores being freshly made and on offer to a potential mate. The evidence points to the first of these alternatives as the most likely but this is not conclusive and requires observations on mating between living parasites.",

The restricted distribution of the snail Heleobia australis along a 500 m transect in Cangrejo creek (Mar Chiquita, Argentina) provides a good opportunity to test the assumption that a study at spatial scale of 100s meters can detect spatiotemporal fluctuations of a larval digenean assemblage. To analyze that, 3600 specimens of H. australis were collected seasonally during the year 2011. A quantitative variation and a space-time interaction between sampling points and seasons of the year for the total prevalence of larval digeneans and snail’s densities were found, as well as a positive correlation with abiotic factors. These results revealed that the fluctuations in the community of larval digeneans of the snail H. australis can be detected at small spatial scale, using its natural distribution of 500 m. This study also highlights the importance of seasonality as a factor that must be considered in studies focused on the search for patterns structuring the communities of larval digeneans, at medium and large scales.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The intrauterine polylecithal eggs of the spathebothriidean cestode Didymobothrium rudolphii (Monticelli, 1890) were examined by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Each unembryonated egg is composed of a fertilised oocyte or ovum and several vitelline cells, all surrounded by a newly formed shell. The lumen of the proximal uterus is packed with unutilised vitelline material and eggs at different stages of shell formation. In the proximal region of the uterus, the fertilised oocytes, initially surrounded by dense, discontinuous islands of eggshell material and containing long axonemes of spermatozoa in their cytoplasm, were frequently observed. Sperm axonemes also remain in the oocyte cytoplasm of eggs surrounded by a thick electron-dense shell until the sperm nucleus is transformed into a male pronucleus. Despite the fact that the two-pronuclei stage and cell divisions within the eggs of D. rudolphii were never observed, individual eggs containing several blastomeres of different sizes were seen in the middle and distal regions of the uterus. This provides indirect evidence that at least a few initial cleavage divisions must take place in the intrauterine eggs and direct evidence that the early embryonic development of D. rudolphii starts in utero. The several vitellocytes present in each egg contain nutritive reserves for the developing embryos; these are composed mainly of numerous lipid droplets and a moderate amount of glycogen. In the eggs containing early embryos composed of several blastomeres, the cytoplasm of the degenerating vitellocytes exhibits the presence of so-called ‘foci of cytoplasmic degradation’, which appear to be involved in the autolytic process of the vitellocyte cell components and inclusions, such as a high accumulation of lipids and glycogen. This progressive degeneration of the vitellocytes, considered as an example of programmed cell death or apoptosis, likely contributes towards the resorption of nutritive reserves by the developing embryo. Some of the results of this study are commented upon in relation to the affiliation of the spathebothriideans with other lower cestode groups.",

The brain homogenate of a naturally Neospora-infected dairy cow (positive in ELISA and Western blot) was intraperitoneally inoculated into Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). The brain of gerbils on day 60 post-inoculation was homogenized, and, after trypsin-digestion, cultured on Vero cells. Neospora-like tachyzoites were first observed after 77 days of cultivation. The parasite was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Neospora-specific primers Np21 and Np6. The PCR product of the first Slovak isolate (NC-SKB1) was subsequently sequenced and published in GenBank under accession number GU300774. Sequencing and BLAST search identified the isolate as N. caninum.",

The new species belongs to the Falcaustra group that possesses a pseudosucker. It resembles F. andrias in the distribution pattern of caudal papillae (six precloacal, four adcloacal, 12 postcloacal, one unpaired median anterior to the cloaca) but differs from F. andrias in the following characters: the longer size of males and females (11.17-13.45 mm and 10.1-15.5 mm, respectively); the longer size and form of the gubernaculum (0.17-0.23 mm, triangular form); the arrangement of postcloacal papillae (three pairs on the ventral side, two pairs on the lateral side, one pair on the subventral side) and unpaired papilla anterior to the cloaca located on the protuberance. The species description is based on light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Falcaustra sanjuanensis sp. nov. represents the 12th Neotropical species assigned to the genus. Also, we added a key to Neotropical species of Falcaustra.",

The former species (H. ahiri), rediscovered from eels in India after 82 years from its original description, has been redescribed and revalidated based on its specific feature (presence of groups of minute denticles in the mouth) distinguishing it from other congeners; its finding in A. b. bicolor represents a new host record. The latter species (P. anguillae) has been recorded in India for the first time. SEM examination of its first-stage larvae from uterus has shown that P. anguillae is another species of Procamallanus whose larvae possess a crown of digit-like processes at the tail tip.",

Acuaria skrjabini (Ozerskaya, 1926) is redescribed by LM and SEM on the basis of specimens from Passer domesticus (type host) and P. hispaniolensis (Passeriformes, Passeridae) from Bulgaria. Contrary to previous opinions recognizing A. skrjabini as a junior synonym of A. subula, the present study confirms that they are distinct species. They can be distinguished on the basis of the ratio between the length of cordons and the body length, the ratio between the length of muscular oesophagus and glandular oesophagus, and the ratio between the total length of oesophagus and the body length. In addition, the plates forming the cordons in these two species exhibit different morphological characters. Another difference between these two species is associated with the particular irregular mosaic ornamentation of the cuticle on the ventral and lateral sides of body around the region of vulva of A. subula and its absence in A. skrjabini. Data on their host and geographical ranges are surveyed. The type series of Acuaria buttnerae Chabaud et Petter, 1961, described as a parasite of Calandrella brachydactyla (Passeriformes, Alaudidae) in France, is re-examined; the latter species is recognized as a junior synonym of A. skrjabini (new synonymy).",

G. wallabiae is distinguished from its closest congener, G. macropodis Yorke et Maplestone, 1926, by the spicules (length and tip) and pattern of the bursal rays. G. wallabiae occurs commonly in Macropus dorsalis (Gray, 1837) in north-eastern Queensland, but is also present in Petrogale mareeba Eldridge et Close, 1992 and P. assimilis Ramsay, 1877. By contrast, G. macropodis is found commonly in M. agilis (Gould, 1842) and P. persephone Maynes, 1982 in the Northern Territory and north-eastern Queensland, and occurs incidentally in other hosts, probably as a result of host-switching ((Aepyprymnus rufescens (Gray, 1837), P. brachyotis (Gould, 1841), P. inornata Gould, 1842, M. dorsalis, M. parryi Bennett, 1835, M. giganteus Shaw, 1790 and Largochestes conspicillatus Gould, 1842)).

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Endoparasitic nematodes of six harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena and four grey seals Halichoerus grypus , stranded at the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea in Germany in winter 2019, were analysed in order to identify nematode parasites and to compare with recent studies from the same area. Methods Endoparasitic nematodes were identified by using both morphological and molecular characters. The successfully obtained sequences of the rDNA marker regions ITS-1, 5.8S, ITS-2 from 29 anisakid and the rDNA marker region ITS-2 of 11 pseudalid nematodes were amplified. Results Analyses revealed the presence of three parasite species, the anisakid nematode Contracaecum osculatum from grey seals and the pseudalid nematodes Pseudalius inflexus and Stenurus minor from the harbour porpoises. Other anisakid nematodes regularly occurring in the Baltic Sea, e.g. Anisakis simplex or Pseudoterranova decipiens , were not found. Conclusions The prevalence of 100% and a severe parasite load in grey seals demonstrated a very high C. osculatum infection of Baltic Sea fish as their regular prey. Prevalence of 33% for parasites in harbour porpoises and minor infection rates, combined with a distinct lack of anisakid nematodes, are typical for the current situation of the porpoise parasite fauna in the Baltic Sea. Invasive parasite species as possible indicators for climate change could not be detected.",

Results were compared with previously published data from 14 localities of the eastern Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, using non-parametric univariate and multivariate analyses, and the whole parasite fauna of S. colias was compared with that of the congeners (S. australasicus, S. japonicus and S. scombrus). Parasites showed to reflect the biogeographical and phylogenetic history of host. From a methodological point of view, the use of both non-parametric univariate and multivariate techniques proved to be effective tools to detect dissimilarities between parasite assemblages.",

According to the results, the infection was not found in most animals, except for rats, in which some oocyst shedding was detected, and there was no significant difference in infectivity among mouse strains. Additionally, oocyst shedding was hardly detectable in a secondary infection to immunocompetent mice, although it was found in immunodeficient mice. These results indicated that only immunocompetent mice could develop adaptive immunity against reinfection by stimuli of the primary infection. Furthermore, the infection experiments were performed with splenic macrophage (Mφ)-depleted mice with a reagent and Beige (Bg) mice known to be a strain of mice with low NK cell activity. No significant effect was found in primary or secondary infections in the Mφ-depleted mice, whereas the mortality rate was clearly increased in Bg mice inoculated with a large number of oocysts. Their oocyst shedding was similar to that of immunocompetent hosts. Taken together, these results suggested that Mφ has only a minor role in the immune response, but the NK cell has an important function in resistance to primary infection of E. krijgsmanni.",

Light and scanning electron microscopical examination made it possible to study in detail the morphology of this so far little-known species. In contrast to the original species description, no cuticular bosses are found on the body surface; in addition to the previously reported eight large cephalic papillae of the external circle, the cephalic end also bears six (2 lateral and 4 submedian) small papillae of the internal circle and a pair of inconspicuous amphids; no oesophageal teeth are present and the anterior oesophageal lobes are slightly elevated; two large, lateral, papilla-like caudal projections are present. To date P. parasiluri has been found only in Japan and the present finding represents the third documented record of this species. Philometra parasiluri probably has a pronounced annual maturation cycle with the period of the production of larvae in the late spring and summer.",

The flagellate is resistant to many disinfectants and anti-protozoan drugs. Therefore in this study we have synthesized three novel 4,5,6,7-tetrabromobenzimidazole (TBBI) derivatives carrying a polyfluoroalkyl substituent in position 2 of the benzimidazole scaffold, namely 2-trifluoromethyl-TBBI (CF3-TBBI), 2-nonafluorobutyl-TBBI (C4F9-TBBI), and 2-nonadecafluorononyl-TBBI (C9F19-TBBI), that next we tested for their in vitro activity against P. hominis.Widely applied anti-protozoal drug, metronidazole as a reference was used. All the investigated agents were added to 24 h P. hominis cultures; each of them was administered at three different concentrations. Number of the moving trichomonads was determined and compared with the control cultures. Different anti-trichomonal activity occurred depending on a kind of compound and its concentration. C4F9-TBBI was the most effective TBBI derivative tested: the agent, at the highest concentration 24.2 μg/ml, after 72 h reduced the number of viable trichomonads to 44.3%; C9F19-TBBI, at the concentration 24 μg/ml reduced the number of the flagellates to 58.5%. Paradoxically, metronidazole after the same time given at the highest concentration increased trophozoite counts by 464.6% in comparison with the control cultures (100%).",

All species vary in the spatial position of their four nuclei and the presence or absence of refractile, blue-staining globules. All of the described species differ from P. vaughani Novy et Mac Neal, 1904 and its siblings (example: P. vaughani merulae Corradetti et Scanga, 1973) in their number of merozoites (always four versus four to eight in the latter) and their spatial arrangement in the schizont.",

    "abstract": "Prevention of ocular surface (OS) Demodex infestation plays an important role in OS hygiene and variety of factors may be associated with it, in which diabetes mellitus (DM) or dry eye disease (DED) has caught the attention of most scholars. However, there has been no research on whether there was a potential interaction between DM and DED in the process of OS Demodex infestation. This cross-sectional study was implemented in Zhujiang Hospital of Southern Medical University.Ophthalmologic interviews, questionnaires, and examinations were conducted. Factors including general information, DM status, dry eye condition, etc. were collected to study the correlation of DM and DED on OS Demodex infestation.After statistical analysis, we found that both DM (P < 0.001) and DED (P = 0.013 < 0.05) are closely associated with OS Demodex infestation. Compared with DED, DM has higher priority association with OS Demodex infestation, and patients with both diseases have a significant higher risk of OS Demodex infestation (R = 0.197, P < 0.001). Meanwhile, age (R = 0.299, P < 0.001) and hypertension (P < 0.05) were also correlated with OS Demodex infestation.This study provides a new evidence-based basis for clinical prevention and management of OS Demodex infestation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose In the fight against anthelmintic resistance, targeted selective treatments (TSTs), where only a small percentage of a flock receives treatment, have become increasingly popular. Overall, implementation of such treatments can be based on various parameters including Body condition score (BCS). As infection with non-bloodsucking nematodes, frequently encountered on sheep farms in the central Mediterranean basin, commonly causes bodyweight reduction, the aim of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of BCS as a parameter for the implementation of TSTs in lactating dairy sheep with subclinical gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) infections from the island of Sardinia, Italy. Methods Faecal samples from 1012 ewes divided into 2 groups (third and fifth month of lactation) were collected and their BCS recorded. Faecal egg counts and coprocultures were performed for the assessment of the GIN burden and identification of present species. Results An overall GIN prevalence of 85.4% with a mean eggs per gram (EPG) of faeces of 210.1 ± 347.3 was found. Teladorsagia spp. and Trichostrongylus spp. were the GIN genera most identified. Overall, animals with the lowest BCS had the highest EPG values and a negative correlation ( r = − 0.163) between the EPG values and BCS of the studied animals was found, which was most significant for older sheep. Conclusion This research confirmed BCSs and EPG values for GIN in sheep to be negatively correlated, particularly in older ewes. Application of TSTs for lactating sheep with a BCS &lt; 2.25, especially to older ewes, could be beneficial in case of subclinical GIN infections, although further studies are needed to work out precise recommendation.",

In this study, we describe the effectiveness of the prime-boost strategy by immunizing dogs with a recombinant plasmid followed by vaccinia virus, both of which expressed the glutamic acid-rich protein (BgGARP) of Babesia gibsoni. The dogs immunized with the prime-boost regime developed a significantly high level of specific antibodies against BgGARP when compared with the control groups. The antibody level was strongly increased after a booster immunization with a recombinant vaccinia virus. Two weeks after the booster immunization with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing BgGARP, the dogs were challenged with B. gibsoni parasite. The dogs immunized with the prime-boost regime showed partial protection, manifested as a significantly low level of parasitemia. These results indicated that this type of DNA/rvv prime-boost immunization approach may have use against B. gibsoni infection in dogs.",

The outer layer is an external anucleate, cytoplasmic region connected to a second region composed of nucleate perikarya (cytons) deeply embedded in the surrounding cortical parenchyma. The surface layer of the tegument is covered by a plasma membrane with many deep invaginations, which are apparently pinocytotic. This layer also bears numerous large, electron-dense spines of two types, which are intracellular and attached to the basal plasma membrane. Its cytoplasm is rich in free ribosomes, contains numerous mitochondria, disc-shaped granules frequently arranged in a rouleau, and several large, moderately electron-dense, membranous bodies. The subtegumentary perikarya and their nuclei, which are both flattened, are described in detail, as are their connections with the surface tegument. These perikarya appear to be the source of the disc-shaped granules and some of the other inclusions present in the surface layer. The main characteristics of the tegumental structure of M. feliui are commented upon in relation to the findings of previous publications and their suggested functions.",

Upon contact with a permissive host, third-stage larvae (L3) residing in the environment become activated larvae (ssL3), a process associated with changes in the profile of gene expression. Ancylostoma secreted proteins (ASPs) are the major proteins secreted during larvae activation and play a crucial role in hookworm adaptation to parasitism. Here we report the cloning using RACE-PCR technique of three novel ASPs from the hookworm A. ceylanicum (Ace-asp-3, Ace-asp-4, and Ace-asp-5) and computational analysis of the protein sequences. All three proteins contain SCP (Sperm Coating Protein) domain characteristic for previously described ASP proteins. Real-time PCR analysis shows significant up-regulation of Ace-asp-3 and Ace-asp-5 expression in adult worms and correlated down-regulation in ssL3 larvae. On the other hand, expression of Ace-asp-4 was increased in ssL3 stages and decreased in adult parasites.",

    "abstract": "The increase of the serum urea to creatinine ratio (UCR) was observed in dogs infected with Babesia canis. Previous studies have suggested that decrease of blood pressure can be one of the reasons for this phenomenon. In this work statistically significant increase of the UCR was observed in dogs with babesiosis. Comparison of the UCR between 23 azotaemic dogs and 25 non-azotaemic dogs infected with Babesia canis showed statistically significantly higher mean of the UCR in azotaemic dogs. Correlations between UCR and systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressure (SAP, DAP and MAP) in 48 dogs infected with B. canis were negative (UCR and SAP: r = -0.3909; UCR and DAP: r = -0.3182; UCR and MAP: r = -0.3682) and statistically significant (p < 0.05). This result may indicate contribution of hypotension in the increase of the UCR in canine babesiosis. However, the correlations were not high, and there was no statistically significant correlation between UCR and arterial pressures in azotaemic dogs. Thus, it seems that decrease of blood pressure in dogs with babesiosis explains only partially the cause of increased UCR in infected dogs. The other authors suggested hyperureagenesis and myocardial injury as a potential reason for the increased UCR in canine babesiosis. Thus, further studies are needed to determine causes of increased UCR in dogs with babesiosis, especially on the connection between UCR changes and the concentrations of plasma cardiac troponins and ammonia, and the occurrence of occult blood on fecal examination.",

Epidemiological studies have identified several genetic regions involved in the schistosomiasis susceptibility. However, it is not well known what physiological traits are predisposing to the disease. The study of experimental infections in inbred mouse strains with variable genetic susceptibility to the disease offers a good opportunity to tackle this question. F1B6CBA hybrid between the most divergent strains was infected in order to characterize the immunophenotypes that correlate with the susceptibility of schistosomiasis disease in mice. Complete blood counts and immunophenotype were determined at 0, 3, 6, and 9 weeks post infection. Nine weeks after cercariae exposure, animals were perfused and worm recovery was assessed. A large number of hepatic lesions, a reduction in the eosinophil and basophil count in the acute phase of infection and the decreased number of monocytes, neutrophils and B-lymphocytes are phenotypes associated with increased susceptibility to S. mansoni infection.",

    "abstract": "A parasitological investigation was performed on a total of 5380 Atlantic cod larvae, post-larvae and small juveniles sampled from the North Sea during a period of five years. The copepod Caligus elongatus (Von Nordmann, 1832) and the nematode Hysterothylacium aduncum (Rudolphi, 1802) were found at a relatively high prevalence of infection (4.6% and 5.2%, respectively). The infection by both parasites showed annual and spatial variability. C. elongatus showed a higher prevalence in 1992 compared to the following years, whereas the prevalence of H. aduncum increased from 1992 to 2001.We observed a relation between parasite distribution and parameters such as latitude and water depth. Adult digeneans (Lecithaster gibbosus and Derogenes varicus) and larval cestodes were also found with lower infection rates. Since changes of infection levels coincided with increasing North Sea water temperature in the studied period, it is hypothesized that temperature may affect parasite population levels. However, it is likely that other environmental factors may contribute to the observed variations. Absence of infection intensities higher than one nematode per fish in small larvae and post-larvae suggests that host survival may be affected by a high infection pressure. The relatively high levels of infection in the younger stages of cod, and the annual/spatial variability of these infections should be considered in the understanding of the early life dynamics of the species.",

The execution of this research was based on 119 host specimens collected between March 2011 and September 2012, and the results were compared to studies performed on periods before the reservoir's construction, when 110 fishes were collected between March 1992 and February 1993. Five parasite species still remain on the environment, despite the environmental modifications: Choanoscolex abscissus, Spasskyelina spinulifera, Nomimoscolex pertierrae, Harriscolex kaparari and Contracaecum sp 2. The Berger-Parker dominance index, calculated to the parasite fauna of 1992, did not show the dominance of any species, while, on the present days, this same index accused the dominance of Nomimoscolex pertierrae (49%) and Choanoscolex abscissus (50%). The present study reports the disappearance of Megathylacus travassosi, Contracaecum sp. 1, Contracaecum sp. 3, Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) sp. and Cucullanus pseudoplatystomae, suggesting the possibility of a local extinction or a host switch of these species. It has also been registered an Acanthocephala specimen, a genus not observed on this host yet. The results here presented show that the antropic influences on natural systems alter the environmental conditions, what is reflected on the richness and diversity parasite levels.",

Infections as Giardia may act as a triggering or promoting factor for oxidative stress, particularly in children with compromised immunity. Besides, the effect of Giardia genotype on oxidative stress status is yet to be explored. Therefore, we sought to compare the oxidative stress status between Giardia positive cases (case group) and Giardia negative cases (control group), and to explore the association between Giardia genotype and the level of oxidative stress markers in Giardia-infected children, especially those receiving immunosuppressive therapy.Pediatric patients attending Mansoura University Children Hospital in the period from April 2015 to October 2016 were enrolled. Both case (n = 50) and control (n = 50) groups were further subdivided into immunosuppressive therapy recipients (ITR) and non-immunosuppressive therapy recipients (NITR). Genotyping of Giardia from positive stool samples by PCR was carried out, and oxidative stress markers were measured from venous blood samples.Giardia positive cases had higher levels of Malondialdehyde (MDA) and lower levels of total antioxidant capacity (TAC). MDA highest level was associated with mixed genotypes A and B, while the highest TAC level was associated with Giardia genotype A in both ITR and NITR cases.Elevated oxidative stress biomarkers in pediatric patients infected with specific Giardia genotypes should receive considerable attention, because if prompt treatment is not conducted, oxidative damage may occur in patients with giardiasis, especially those receiving immunosuppressive therapy.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The relationship between the genetic diversity of Blastocystis and immune surveillance in precancerous colons with blastocystosis is still under investigation. This study aimed to identify the genetic Blastocystis variants among 54 symptomatic human isolates and their relationship to mucosal immune surveillance in the precancerous polyps of experimentally infected rats. Methods Polymerase chain reaction and high-resolution melting (PCR/HRM) curves discriminated human symptomatic Blastocystis isolates into subtypes (STs)/intrasubtypes, which were orally administered to rats to induce experimental infection. Then, the mucosal immune responses of the infected colons were evaluated in relation to polyp formation through immunostaining to identify mucus MUC2 and determine mucosal immune cell (goblet, lymphocyte and mast) counts, secretory IgA levels and parasitic intestinal invasion. Results ST1, ST3, and ST4 were found in 18.5% (10/54), 54.7% (29/54), and 27.8% (15/54) of the samples, respectively. Then, the HRM curve discriminated ST3 into the wild, mutant, and heterozygous [17/54 (31.5%), 5/54 (9.3%), and 7/54 (12.9%)] intrasubtypes. ST1 and ST4 had no genetic variations. Precancerous polyps were detected in the colons of 40.5% of the infected rats. ST1 constituted 14.7% of these cases, while the wild, mutant, and heterozygous intrasubtypes of ST3 showed polyps in 12.9%, 5.5%, and 5.5% of cases, respectively. Only 1.9% of the polyps were related to ST4. MUC2 showed weak immunostaining in 44.5% of the infected colons, and 38.9% were polyp inducers. Low goblet cell numbers and high interepithelial lymphocyte counts were significantly associated with polyp formation, particularly with ST1 and wild ST3. Among the polyp inducers, high numbers of mast cells were detected in wild ST3 and ST4, while a low number was found with heterozygous ST3. The level of secretory IgA was low in polyp-inducing STs. Most of the results were statistically significant. Conclusion Immunosurveillance showed a potential relationship between ST1 and the ST3 intrasubtypes and precancerous polyps. This relationship may provide insight into the prevention and/or development of new immunotherapeutic strategies to combat colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The parasites’ virulence is labile after jumping to a new host species, and it might derivate in gaining virulence against a new host as a side effect of living in a non-host environment (coincidental evolution of virulence hypothesis). Methods To test this hypothesis, we monitored the experimental evolution of the Rhabditis regina nematode for over 290 generations (4 years) in three environments (strains): (1) the natural host, Phyllophaga polyphylla , (2) an alternate host, Tenebrio molitor , and (3) saprophytic medium (beef; the food that may provide evidence for the coincidental evolution of virulence). Each strain was exposed to P. polyphylla , T. molitor , or Galleria mellonella . We compared the host survival and immune response (proPO, PO, and lytic activity) of infected versus uninfected hosts. Results The saprophytic nematodes gained virulence only against G. mellonella. However, the P. polyphylla strain was more effective in killing P. polyphylla than T. molitor , and the T. molitor strain was more effective against T. molitor than P. polyphylla . Additionally, one dauer larva was sufficient to kill the hosts. Finally, the immune response did not differ between the challenged and control groups. Conclusion The coincidental evolution of virulence partially explains our results, but they might also support the short-sighted hypothesis. Additionally, we found evidence for immunomodulation because nematodes passed unnoticed to the immune response. It is crucial to analyze the virulence of entomopathogens from the point of view of the evolution of virulence to be aware of potential scenarios that might limit biological control.",

    "abstract": "Fascioliasis is caused by Fasciola hepatica of almost worldwide distribution and F. gigantica in wide regions of Asia and Africa. Their adult stage develops in the biliary canals and gallbladder. Infection follows an initial, 3-4 month long invasive, migratory or acute phase, and a several year-long biliary, chronic or obstructive phase.The unexpected finding of a fasciolid inside the gallbladder during a cholecystectomy for obstructive lithiasis suspicion in a patient is reported from an area of Iran where human infection had been never reported before and studies on fascioliasis in livestock are absent.The fluke obtained was phenotypically classified as F. hepatica by morphometry and genotypically as F. gigantica by mtDNA cox1 fragment sequencing, although with F. hepatica scattered mutations in species-differing nucleotide positions. The clinical, radiological, and biological signs observed at the acute and chronic phases often lead to some misdiagnosis. Serological methods may be useful in cases of negative coprology. Diagnostic techniques with insufficient resolution leading to unnecessary invasive interventions are analyzed. The way to avoid unnecessary surgery is described, including analyses to be made, diagnostic tools to be used, and aspects to be considered.Reaching a correct diagnosis in the confusing presentations avoids procedure delays and unnecessary surgery. A correct drug treatment may be sufficient. Except in extreme pathological presentations, lesions decrease in number and size and finally disappear or calcify after a successful treatment. Finally, the need to increase awareness of physicians about fascioliasis is highlighted, mainly in non-human endemic areas.",

The first confirmed finding of E. multilocularis in Slovakia was recorded in 1999 in the area adjacent to the Polish border. At present, this serious zoonosis occurs almost across the whole territory of Slovakia. The occurrence of these tapeworms in red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) at the border regions of Slovakia and Poland has been monitored. In these districts, out of 152 faecal samples examined, 36.2% were positive for the coproantigen-ELISA. With the sedimentation and counting technique the prevalence of E. multilocularis in red foxes was up to 38.8%. The examination of foxes from neighbouring districts revealed worm burden ranging from 1–15,000 specimens, but the majority of animals harboured medium number of tapeworms. In the Small Carpathian and Sub-Carpathian regions of Poland, out of 65 samples examined, 13.8% were coproantigen positive. Using the small intestine scraping method only 6.1% prevalence of E. multilocularis in red foxes was determined, mostly with a high worm burdens over 1,000 specimens. The results suggest possible transborder transmission of E. multilocularis, the causative agent of serious alveolar echinococcosis.",

Scolex and genital primordia changes through four stages of juvenile development are described. Longitudinal ridges do not appear on the scolex until the cestode has well defined genital primordia. This is in stark contrast to other caryophyllidean genera in which the basic morphology of the adult scolex becomes evident at the procercoid stage in the oligochaete intermediate host. The scolex of the adult has 13 to 19 prominent longitudinal ridges and deep furrows that come together at the apex to form an apical ring, a protrusible terminal introvert within the apical ring that forms a deep apical pouch when fully retracted, and a central group of Faserzellen. The scolex of W. virilis appears similar to the rugomonobothriate scolex of another African caryophyllid, Monobothrioides chalmersius (Woodland, 1924). Comparisons are made with other caryophyllideans having a scolex with a terminal structure: Monobothrium Diesing, 1863, Djombangia Bovien, 1926 and Caryoaustralus Mackiewicz et Blair, 1980. The terminal introvert may be responsible for attachment in early juvenile stages, but may be supplemented by the longitudinal ridges and furrows later in development. Host tissue appears to be drawn into these furrows that function as weak organs of attachment. We could not determine how the introvert of adult worms functions in attachment. At the site of attachment, the mucosa showed necrosis and degeneration and the submucosa exhibited vacuolization and infiltration with lymphocytes and leucocytes.",

On dissection these proved to be plasmodia of a species of the myxosporean genus Henneguya. This is the first record of a member of this genus from a marine or euryhaline fish in the south-west Atlantic. A comparison of the spore of our species with other species in the genus convinced us that our species is new. This paper describes it as Henneguya shackletoni sp. nov. after the Shackleton Fund which funded the study.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Paranoplocephala kalelai (Tenora, Haukisalmi et Henttonen, 1985) is an anoplocephalid cestode that primarily parasitizes the grey-sided vole Myodes rufocanus (syn. Clethrionomys rufocanus) in northern Fennoscandia. In a preliminary molecular phylogenetic analysis, the cytochrome oxidase I (mtDNA) sequences of P. kalelai formed two divergent sublineages originating from two different localities in northern Finland and northern Norway. The present data confirm the existence of two strongly supported clades and show that their geographic distributions are overlapping in northernmost Finland. Relatively deep genetic divergence and coexistence of the two main clades at one of the localities suggest that the material may include two biological species. However, because the specimens representing the two mtDNA clades of P. kalelai are not morphometrically sufficiently differentiated and because the mtDNA clade of the specimens from the type locality is unknown, they are not assigned to different species. Comparison with the existing phylogeographic data of M. rufocanus suggests that the genetic structure of this host-specific cestode reflects the glacial and post-glacial history of its primary host. A redescription is presented for P. kalelai.",

This spermatozoon presents five regions characterized by several ultrastructural elements: an apical cone, a crested body, two axonemes of 9 + “1” pattern, electron-dense granules, a nucleus and cortical microtubules. In the present study, three of these features were the subject of a detailed attention. The first is the presence of two axonemes, which confirms that the Tetraphyllidea, Oncobothriidae possess two axonemes whereas the Tetraphyllidea, Phyllobothriidae possess only one axoneme. The second is the presence of one crested body, a criterion homogeneous in the Tetraphyllidea but heterogeneous among the different orders of Cestoda. The third is the number and the disposition of cortical microtubules. These three criteria seem to be interesting for phylogeny.",

Two main genospecies typically occur in the Czech Republic Borrelia garinii and Borrelia afzelii, transmitted generally by Ixodes ricinus (L., 1758) ticks. The aim of our study was to identify spirochaete isolates focusing on Borrelia burgdorferi acquired from different sources: vectors (ticks), potential vectors (mosquitoes, small mites) and hosts (wild rodents). In the years 1996–2001 a total of 2398 ticks, 72 mites (from wild rodents), 2700 mosquito adults, 1798 mosquito larvae and organ parts (kidney and spleen) of 216 wild rodents were collected from seven localities in the Czech Republic. A total of 31 spirochaete strains were isolated: 13 strains from ticks, 1 strain from mite (Haemogamasus sp.), 15 strains from rodents, 1 strain from mosquito adults and 1 strain from mosquito larva. For the genospecies identification of these isolates PCR, PCR-RFLP was used and their characterization was also performed by SDS-PAGE. By nested PCR method all except one isolated strains were detected as Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. Following PCR-RFLP molecular analysis results, tick isolates were identified as B. garinii and B. afzelii, the strain isolated from the mite was identified as B. afzelii. This is the first isolated strain of B.b.s.l. from a different mite of infraorder Parasitiformes than tick. All of rodent isolates were identified as B. afzelii; mosquito adult isolate was identified as B. afzelii. Larval isolate from mosquito is spirochaete, but does not belong to Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato group.",

The results showed that egg development was inhibited in both tests. Exposed larvae showed a decrease in their infective capacity, which resulted almost null at 40.5°C. Adults exposed to 38.5°C showed mortality ≤10%, at 40.5°C the mortality was 100% and the adult’s mortality at 3°C below zero was 89%. Results indicate that free living stages of Chordodes nobilii are susceptible to extreme temperatures.",

Since 2011, a rebound of malaria morbidity has been observed in this country, while no survey evaluating ACT efficacy was performed. During the same period, parasite resistance against artemisinin has been reported in Asia. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of these two drugs in two sentinel sites of Gabon 10 years after their implementation. Methods Children aged from 12 to 144 months with uncomplicated malaria were recruited at the Regional Hospital of Melen, Libreville and in the Urban Health Center of Franceville between March 2014 and September 2015. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated according to the WHO 2008 protocol of 28-day follow-up and PCR-uncorrected/corrected treatment outcomes were assessed. Results One hundred and eighty-five children (98 ASAQ and 89 AL) were followed up until day 28. The PCR-corrected ACPR was 98.9% for AS–AQ and 96.4% for AL. Late therapeutic failure rate was 3.6% and 1.1% for AL and AS–AQ, respectively ( p = 0.2). Adverse events and serious adverse events were rarely observed with both treatments.

Wild and domestic ruminants such as red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, cattle, sheep and goats may act as intermediate hosts for many Sarcocystis species, some of which are significant pathogens causing sarcocystosis in livestock and humans. The purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence of Sarcocystis species in fallow deer farmed in an open pasture system. Samples of heart and oesophagus tissue taken from five fallow deer were examined by light microscope for the presence of sarcocysts. Genomic DNA was extracted from individual sarcocysts. ssu rRNA was successfully amplified using their DNA as templates. Analysis of the ssu rRNA identified the presence of two S. morae sarcocysts in the heart tissue; similarly, S. gracilis sarcocysts were identified in the heart and oesophagus, and Sarcocystis sp. most closely related to S. linearis and S. taeniata were detected in oseophagus. These findings confirm the presence of Sarcocystis spp. in farmed fallow deer in Poland; however, more molecular studies are needed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Anisakis simplex s. s. is a parasitic nematode with a complex life cycle in which humans can become accidental hosts by consuming raw or not fully cooked fish containing L3 larvae. The growing popularity of raw fish dishes has contributed to an increase in the incidence of anisakiasis, which has spurred scientific efforts to develop new methods for diagnosing and treating the disease and also to investigate the gene expression at different developmental stages of this parasite. The identification of reference genes suitable for the normalization of RT-qPCR data has not been studied with respect to A. simplex s. s. Methods In the present study, eight candidate reference genes were analyzed in A. simplex s. s. at two different developmental stages: L3 and L4. The expression stability of these genes was assessed by geNorm and NormFinder softwares. Results In general, our results identified translation elongation factor 1 α ( ef-1α ) and peptidyl-prolyl isomerase 12 ( ppi12) as the most stable genes in L3 and L4 developmental stages of A. simplex s. s. Validation of the selected reference genes was performed by profiling the expression of the nuclear hormone receptor gene ( nhr 48 ) in different developmental stages. Conclusions This first analysis selecting suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR in A. simplex s. s. will facilitate future functional analyses and deep mining of genetic resources in this parasitic nematode.",

    "abstract": "The Anaplasma genus includes a Gram-negative bacterium infecting the blood cells of wild and domestic mammals, causing tick-borne fever. Infection with pathogenic Anaplasma phagocytophilum strains may cause Human Granulocytic Anaplasmosis. Wild boars (Sus scrofa) may act as natural wild reservoir hosts for potentially zoonotic A. phagocytophilum strains; however, there is still little data to confirm this statement. The aim of this study was to verify whether wild boars can be classified as natural reservoirs of Anaplasma spp. and to compare the suitability of spleen and liver samples for such analysis.Liver and spleen samples were collected from 59 wild boars (2017-2019). The organs were tested for Anaplasma phagocytophilum using short (partial) fragments of three markers: 16S rRNA, groEL, ankA.Anaplasma spp. DNA was detected in 12 out of 59 samples, with a prevalence of 20.34%. The presence of A. phagocytophilum was confirmed by sequencing of the partial 16S rRNA gene. Positive individuals were tested for the characteristic markers: groEL and ankA. The analysis of the nucleotide sequences of 16S rRNA, groEL and ankA, indicated that the strains of A. phagocytophilum detected in these studies are potentially zoonotic for humans.Wild boars from Poland can be classified as a natural reservoir of the zoonotic strain of Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Both the spleen and the liver tissues were found to be suitable materials for the detection of A. phagocytophilum.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Gastric infection with Strongyloides stercoralis ( SS ) usually occurs in immunocompromised patients. The unexpected observation of this parasite in an otherwise healthy young lady who had undergone upper endoscopy and biopsy sampling of the gastro-duodenal mucosa, prompted us to review the literature to ascertain the conditions favouring gastric colonization by SS. Methods Pathology files of gastroduodenal biopsies received at St. Mary’s hospital, Northern Uganda, between 2007 and 2017 were reviewed. Pubmed search was performed under the headings “ Strongyloides stercoralis ”, “Gastric parasitosis”. Results Histology of the only gastroduodenal biopsy with SS infection showed parasite eggs, immature rhabditiform larvae, and numerous adult worms in gastric pits and rhabditiform larvae in interepithelial parasitic tunnels, causing reactive changes of the glandular epithelium. There was no significant acute inflammatory cell infiltrate surrounding the parasites. Literature review showed that gastric SS infection appears to be very uncommon and was, as expected, largely prevalent in immunodeficient individuals (84.2% of published cases). The rare gastric SS infection is a complication of systemic strongyloidiasis, either hyperinfective, or disseminated form. It is also commonly associated with duodenal infection at microscopical examination. Conclusion Involvement of gastric mucosa in the absence of duodenal strongyloidiasis appears to be quite rare and false-negative histopathological exams are reported if only the stomach is biopsied.",

Parasite comparison of similar hosts between lakes revealed highly abundant Ichthyocotylurus spp. in perch and bream of Lake Malchin while Aspidogaster limacoides was most common in roach from Lake Tollense. Diversity indices of roach showed significant variation between localities. However, NMDS graph revealed separation of the three freshwater habitats based on the parasite fauna of perch, bream and roach.Based on the multivariate statistical analysis, the three natural inland water bodies could be distinguished based on the parasite communities of perch, bream and roach. The potential to utilise fish parasites as biological indicators in freshwater ecosystem is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate if there is specific host-parasite association in Chilean populations of Trypanosoma cruzi. For this purpose, two groups of parasites were analyzed, one from chronic chagasic patients, and the other from Triatoma infestans triatomines in three regions of the country. The first group consisted of four types of samples: parasites from peripheral blood of non-cardiopathic T. cruzi infected patients (NB); parasites from their corresponding xenodiagnosis (NX); parasites from peripheral blood of T. cruzi infected cardiopathic patients (CB) and parasites from their xenodiagnostics (CX). The T. infestans sample in turn was from three regions: III, V and M (Metropolitan). The genetic differentiation by the Fisher exact method, the lineage distribution of the samples, the molecular phylogeny and the frequency of multiclonality were analysed. The results show that not only are the groups of T. cruzi clones from Chagas disease patients and vectors genetically differentiated, but also all the sub-groups (NB, NX, CB and CX) from the III, V and M regions. The analysis of lineage distribution was concordant with the above results, because significant differences among the percentages of TcI, TcIII and hybrids (TcV or TcVI) were observed. The phylogenetic reconstruction with these Chilean T. cruzi samples was coherent with the above results because the four chagasic samples clustered together in a node with high bootstrap support, whereas the three triatomine samples (III, V and M) were located apart from that node. The topology of the tree including published T. cruzi clones and isolates was concordant with the known topology, which confirmed that the results presented here are correct and are not biased by experimental error. Taken together the results presented here are concordant with a specific host-parasite association between some Chilean T. cruzi populations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract An undescribed species of Microsporidia Balbiani, 1882 was isolated from the muscularis mucosa of the intestinal mucosa of the reared Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus). Transmission electron microscopy showed that the pyriform unikaryotic microsporidium, measuring 3.6 μm ± 0.08 in length and 1.8 μm ± 0.04 in width (inferred from TEM sections), had two layers of 14–17 coils of polar filament and a robust manubrium of the filament. No developmental stages were observed in xenoma. Phylogenetic analysis of the small subunit rRNA showed closest similarity with Kabatana spp. (88.4%), clustering the microsporidium together in a sister group with K. takedai and Kabatana sp. (JI-2008)/K. newberryi clade. While recognized Kabatana members show ovoid, rounded to pyriform spore, lack of sporophorous vesicle or xenoma, 3–10 coils of polar filament in 1–2 rows and are localized within cytoplasm of trunk muscle, the new species is markedly pyriform, xenoma forming, with many filament coils in 2 rows and parasitizing smooth intestinal muscle. Since morphological features were not typically congruent with any of Kabatana spp. so far described and molecular clustering indicated paraphyletic position within Kabatana clade, we suggest assigning described species to collective group Microsporidia, as Microsporidium milevae sp. nov., until more evidence permits potential formation of the new genus.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sexually transmitted diseases are a major cause of acute disease worldwide, and trichomoniasis is the most common and curable disease, generating more than 170 million cases annually worldwide. Trichomonas vaginalis is the causal agent of trichomoniasis and has the ability to destroy in vitro cell monolayers of the vaginal mucosa, where the phospholipases A2 (PLA2) have been reported as potential virulence factors. These enzymes have been partially characterized from the subcellular fraction S30 of pathogenic T. vaginalis strains. The main objective of this study was to purify a phospholipase A2 from T. vaginalis, make a partial characterization, obtain a partial amino acid sequence, and determine its enzymatic participation as hemolytic factor causing lysis of erythrocytes. Trichomonas S30, RF30 and UFF30 sub-fractions from GT-15 strain have the capacity to hydrolyze [2-14C-PA]-PC at pH 6.0. Proteins from the UFF30 sub-fraction were separated by affinity chromatography into two eluted fractions with detectable PLA A2 activity. The EDTA-eluted fraction was analyzed by HPLC using on-line HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry and two protein peaks were observed at 8.2 and 13 kDa. Peptide sequences were identified from the proteins present in the eluted EDTA UFF30 fraction; bioinformatic analysis using Protein Link Global Server charged with T. vaginalis protein database suggests that eluted peptides correspond a putative ubiquitin protein in the 8.2 kDa fraction and a phospholipase preserved in the 13 kDa fraction. The EDTA-eluted fraction hydrolyzed [2-14C-PA]-PC lyses erythrocytes from Sprague-Dawley in a time and dose-dependent manner. The acidic hemolytic activity decreased by 84% with the addition of 100 μM of Rosenthal’s inhibitor.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Schizophrenia is a serious neuropsychiatric disease of uncertain etiology. Previous studies have demonstrated that antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii infection are associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. The objective of this study was to analyze anti-T. gondii antibodies in 477 Chinese schizophrenia patients using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on recombinant surface antigen 1 (rSAG1), recombinant bradyzoite antigen 1 (rBAG1) and the soluble tachyzoite antigens (STAg) of T. gondii RH strain. Results showed that among the sero-positives (IgG and/or IgM) for T. gondii infection examined in schizophrenia patients, sero-positive samples for rSAG1, rBAG1 and STAg were 20.5% (98/477), 20.5% (98/477) and 23.5% (112/477) respectively, while compared to 210 blood donors, sero-positive (IgG and/or IgM) samples for these antigens (rSAG1, rBAG1 and STAg) were only 5.7% (12/210), 6.2% (13/210) and 5.7% (12/210), respectively. Furthermore, when IgG antibody reaction in the schizophrenia sera was compared with the rBAG1 and rSAG1, results demonstrated that beside the cases which can be detected by both rSAG1 and rBAG1, some sero-positive for T. gondii in schizophrenia sera can only be detected either by rSAG1 or rBAG1. This phenomenon was also observed in the detection of IgM with rSAG1 and rBAG1. 5.9% (28/477) of cases of schizophrenia which are positive for IgG or IgM by rSAG1 are negative for STAg, while 9.2% (44/477) of the schizophrenia cases which are positive for IgG or IgM by rBAG1 are negative for STAg. Although STAg can also be used to diagnose T. gondii infection from schizophrenia patients, it may not actually indicate the infection as some positive samples may be mistakenly considered to be negative. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the sero-positive rate for T. gondii in the Chinese schizophrenia patients was higher than blood donors. More importantly, our results provide evidence that the combination of rSAG1 and rBAG1 antigens in the diagnosis of T. gondii infection could closely reflect the actual infection of this parasite in schizophrenia patients.",

With the former, three different organisms were detected: Hepatozoon, a trichodinid protozoan ciliate and a possible Stramenopile. Using the latter set of primers, a single unknown spirurid nematode was also detected. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that Hepatozoon detected within amphibian hosts appear to form a clade, although relationships of these parasites do not match the vertebrate intermediate host phylogeny. Regarding the possible Stramenopile, it is unclear whether this organism was actually present on the amphibian or in the water on the surface of the tissue sample. Our findings highlight that many different organisms can be detected with these primers and that they can be used to screen introduced host populations to detect parasites that have been brought with them.",

A 50 miracidia dose was not used because such a high level of exposure caused severe snail mortality by 3 weeks post-exposure (PE). Lipids were determined in the digestive-gland gonad complex (DGG) of the exposed snails and in the uninfected matched controls at 2 and 4 weeks PE. Extraction of lipids from DGGs was carried out by the Folch method with chloroform-methanol (2:1), and extracts were analyzed on Analtech HPTLC-HLF pre-adsorbent silica gel plates with measurement of separated bands using a CAMAG Scanner 3. For neutral lipids the mobile phase was petroleum ether-diethyl ether-glacial acetic acid (80:20:1) and the detection reagent was 5% ethanolic phosphoric acid, and for polar lipids chloroform-methanol-deionized water (65:25:4) mobile phase and 10% cupric sulfate in 8% phosphoric acid detection reagent were used. No significant differences in the concentrations of free sterols, free fatty acids, triacylglycerols, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine were seen at 2 weeks PE in any of the groups. At 4 weeks PE, the free fatty acid concentration increased significantly in the snails exposed to 25 miracidia compared to that of the 5 miracidia/snail group or the controls. Elevation of the free fatty acid fraction in the high dose snail group suggested that some changes occurred in the lipid metabolism of the snails in that group as a function of miracidia dose.",

The results showed that the glycogen with high activity was widely distributed in snails. DNA showed its strongest reaction in testis. The histone was distributed in sites of the radula, parenchyma of penis and ovary. LDH and SDH were widely distributed in snails and all were abundant. Sites of the strongest enzyme activities of G-6-PDH were evident in the reproductive system together with central ganglia. Only the ovary showed a strong enzyme activity of G-6-Pase. Most tissues and organs contained CCO, and the activity of this enzyme was very strong. 5′-NT showed a strong enzyme activity in the ovary and testis. Mg2+-ATPase was localized in sites of the liver, stomach and reproductive gland. A strong enzyme activity of ALP appeared in the digestive system. ACP showed a low activity in snails. The central ganglia, nervous stem, liver, branchial duct, epithelia of the head and foot regions showed a very strong enzyme activity of CHE. The findings could provide a theoretical basis for development of highly effective molluscicides with low toxicity to other biota, as well as means for novel snail control strategies.",

(Acariformes, Syringophilidae) is described from feather quills of Phalaropus fulicarius (Linnaeus) (Charadriiformes, Scolopacidae) from USA. Females of the new genus differs from those of the genus Bochkovia Skoracki et OConnor, by having the rounded posteriorly stylophore, edentate movable cheliceral digits, propodonotal setae arranged 2-1-1-2, thin and smooth dorsal setae of the idiosoma, smooth dorsal setae of legs I and II, and by the presence of setae vsI; males are distinguished by the presence of the propodonotal setae arranged 2-1-1-1-1. Additionally, two new syringophilid species recorded from aquatic birds in North America and three new host associations of these mites are recovered.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mammalian serum is essential for the growth of Giardia duodenalis cultivated under axenic conditions. Unfortunately, some factors present in bovine serum used as supplement in the culture medium may inhibit protozoal growth and activity. TYI-33-PACSR is a TYI medium supplemented with a serum replacement (PACSR) made up of Earle’s amino acid solution, Diamond’s vitamin-tween 80 mixtures and LCR (a lipid-cholesterol — rich mixture). PACSR was previously used in the culture media for axenic cultivation of Entamoeba histolytica and Trichomonas vaginalis. The main objective of this work was to demonstrate that TYI-33-PACSR is useful for axenic cultivation of G. duodenalis. Additionally, the activity of phospholipase A2 (PLA A2) in the sub-cellular vesicular fraction (P30) of G. duodenalis grown in TYI-S-33 and TYI-33-PACSR was compared. All strains of Giardia grown in TYI-33-PACSR reached relative cellular densities of 91 to 95% compared to controls growing in serum-supplemented TYI-S-33 medium. Additionally, PLA A2 activity was similar in the P30 sub-cellular fraction obtained from trophozoites growing in TYI-S-33 and TYI-33-PACSR. Thus, TYI-33-PACSR could be useful in analyzing the biological properties of G. duodenalis in the absence of serum.",

Maxvachonia ingens sp. nov. represents the 7th species assigned to the genus and the 5th from the Australo-Papuan Region. The new species differs from other species assigned to Maxvachonia by the position of the vulva in the female (the only species with a post-oesophageal position) and the spicule/gubernaculum ratio of the male (the only species with ratio greater than 1). Females of the new species are most similar to M. dimorpha and M. ewersi in that the posterior ends of these three species are rounded. These species are easily separated: M. ewersi possesses lateral alae, the other 2 do not; the posterior end of M. dimorpha terminates in a mucro, M. ingens sp. nov. lacks terminal ornamentation.",

Neohypocreadium gibsoni sp. nov. is similar to the other four species of the genus, but is unique in having a distinctly pear-shaped body and a much smaller egg size, and differs significantly from each in several other characters: from N. longisaccatum, it differs in having a cirrus sac not reaching the testes and a pretesticular ovary; from N. dorsoporum in having an external seminal vesicle much shorter than the cirrus sac, a longer cirrus sac extending posteriorly to the level of the posterior margin of the ventral sucker and a pretesticular ovary; from N. chaetodoni in having a smaller body size, symmetrical testes, a longer cirrus sac extending posteriorly to the level of the posterior margin of the ventral sucker and a trilobed ovary; and from N. aegyptense in having a smaller body size, symmetrical testes, a longer cirrus sac extending posteriorly to the level of the posterior margin of the ventral sucker, a trilobed ovary and vitelline follicles terminating anteriorly at the level of oesophagus.

The objectives of this study were to determine HLA allele-CE association in patients, and relate its presence to high anti-Echinococcus antibody titers and the presence of circulating immune complexes (CIC). Thirty patients and 20 controls were included. HLA profiles were determined by DNA-SSP typing. Relative risk and P-values were determined for each allele using Statcalc (EpiInfo, Version 6). Linkage disequilibrium was determined for associated alleles using SPSS 12.0 for Windows. Antibody titers were determined by indirect hemagglutination (IHA) and CIC by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. HLA-B*14 and HLA-DRB1*01 appeared to associate with protection against CE (P1 = P2 = 0.007 and P1 = P2 = 0.0007, respectively). However, it appeared that linkage disequilibrium did not exist between these 2 alleles (P = 0.250). HLA-B*35 was found to associate with susceptibility to disease (RR = 1.70, P = 0.02). Twenty five patients had anti-Echinococcus antibodies and 9 patients had CICs. However, there did not appear to be a correlation between the presence of HLA-B*35 and high antibody titers, or the presence of CICs. In conclusion, 2 HLA alleles that associate with resistance and 1 that associates with susceptibility to E. granulosus infection have been identified. The joint pain reported by some of the patients might be attributed to CIC deposits.",

Two types of glands, with different morphological types of secretory granules and mechanisms for discharging their glandular secretion, were observed. Both types of gland cell bodies are localized in the parenchyma of the pseudoscolex. The syncytial glands of type I are characterized by the production of small (all ∼0.25 μm in diameter), rounded, dense secretory granules which pass though thin projections into the distal tegumental layer of the pseudoscolex. This type of gland has a unique method of discharging its secretory granules, which we call tumulogenesis. The elimination of the secretory products is realized by an encroachment of the basement membrane and underlying tegumental muscles into the surface region of the distal cytoplasm of the tegument, resulting in the formation of a ‘glandular stalk’ above which develops a superficial glandular tumulus. In the region of the glandular material of the tumulus, the basement membrane of the stalk forms a dilation, and the appearance of a membrane-bound area serves to separate the tumulus from the distal cytoplasm of the tegument. Unicellular glands of type II are characterized by large granules (0.4–0.9 μm in diameter), the presence of peripheral microtubules in the terminal region of their ducts and an eccrine mechanism for the discharge of their secretory granules. A comparative analysis of the distribution and morphology of the types of scolex glands among members of the different families of the ‘Pseudophyllidea’ (currently believed to represent two distinct orders, Bothriocephalidea and Diphyllobothriidea) is presented.",

Major differences between the two species include oval cirrus sac in M. bivittata, a spherical cirrus sac in M. panamaensis; ovary compact consisting of 10–15 short lobules in M. bivittata, ovary bilobed with each lobe consisting of 3–4 lobules in M. panamaensis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Mites of the family Syringophilidae are small and uniformly shaped arthropods, inhabiting feather quills of many birds species. Anomalies of setae arrangement are frequently observed in this mite group. Detailed investigation of nymphs and adults Torotrogla merulae Skoracki et al., 2000, reveals the most considerable variability of chaetotaxy aspect in this family. The purpose of our examination is to document anomalies in number and configuration of setae and to hypothesize the possible factors inducing them. As an explanation, a theory based on ‘fluctuating asymmetry’ is proposed.",

A description of female specimens based on light-microscopy and SEM studies is presented. On the basis of the observations of the cephalic end, the position of the genus is considered to be in the subfamily Acuariinae, not in the Seuratiinae where it was previously placed. The host range of Aviculariella spp. is recognised as restricted to birds of the family Alcedinidae. A new morphological peculiarity described in A. alcedonis is the presence of a pair of sublateral ribs at the anterior end of each pseudolabium.",

S. tripectinata is widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean and North Africa as a parasite of Muridae rodents. To date, Gran Canaria is the only island of the archipelago where S. tripectinata had been found. In this report, S. tripectinata has appeared parasitizing 116 specimens of Mus musculus out of a total of 660, and only 2 Rattus rattus of 215 captured. All the trapped Muridae hosts found to be parasitized by S. tripectinata came from humid biotopes. The results showed that S. tripectinata is present on all the western Canary Islands and on one of the eastern islands, Gran Canaria, the only island already reported. The detection of S. tripectinata on El Hierro, La Palma, La Gomera and Tenerife represents the first records of this flea species on those Canary Islands.",

Clearly, there is a need to understand the role of cats as vectors of human toxoplasmosis in the city and as a first step we assessed the extent of patent Toxoplasma-like coccidial infections among feral cats. Oocysts in cat faeces were detected between June 2008 and April 2010, from a range of locations radiating out of the city centre in concentric semi circular/elliptic rings and by north, west and south divisions within each of the rings. In total 4,652 cats were sampled and overall prevalence of oocysts was 9.1%. Prevalence was 10.1% in the first summer, and then dropped to 8.4% in the following winter and further to 6.8% in the next summer before rising to 10.6% in the final winter of the study; this interaction between annual period and season was significant. There were also significant changes in prevalence across each of the consecutive months of the study, but no clear pattern was evident. Prevalence did not vary significantly by city sector and there was no difference in prevalence between the host sexes. We conclude therefore, that despite minor and significant perturbations, the prevalence of patent Toxoplasma-like coccidial infections among cats in Doha is remarkably stable throughout the year, across years and spatially within the city’s districts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Transmission of lymphatic filariasis is mediated through microfilariae (L1 stage of the parasite) which is encased in an eggshell called sheath. The sheath protein Shp-1 stabilizes the structure due to the unique repeat region with Met-Pro-Pro-Gln-Gly sequences. Microfilarial proteins could be used as transmission blocking vaccines. Since the repeat region of Shp-1 was predicted to carry putative B epitopes, this region was used to analyze its reactivity with clinical samples towards construction of peptide vaccine. In silico analysis of Shp-1 showed the presence of B epitopes in the region 49–107. The polypeptide epitopic region Shp-149–107 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. Antibody reactivity of the Shp-149–107 construct was evaluated in filarial endemic population by ELISA. Putatively immune endemic normals (EN) showed significantly high reactivity (P &lt; 0.05) when compared to all the other categories. Antibody reactivity of Shp-1 repeat region was similar to that of whole protein proving that this region carries B epitopes responsible for its humoral response in humans. Thus this can be employed for inducing anti-microfilarial immunity in the infected population that may lead to reduction in transmission intensity and also it could be used along with other epitopes from different stages of the parasite in order to manage the disease effectively.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Live Anisakis simplex third-stage larvae (L3) penetrate gastrointestinal mucosa after they are ingested in raw or undercooked seafood, thereafter causing gastrointestinal manifestations and allergic manifestations such as urticaria and anaphylaxis. These allergic reactions are mediated by specific IgE to L3 allergens, especially excretory-secretory (ES) allergens. Recent evidences suggest that only live larvae can cause allergic reactions, although cases attributable to ingestion of cooked, frozen seafood have been reported. Therefore the risk of Anisakis-associated hypersensitivity by ingestion of properly cooked and frozen fish remains controversial. No prior report describes the kinetics of antibody production in experimental animals after oral inoculation with dead L3. This study used ELISA to assess antibody production in rats inoculated orally with dead L3. Positive absorbance value in IgG, IgM, and IgE specific to ES antigen from L3 were found in rats inoculated with live L3 but not with dead L3 (frozen, heated, cut, or homogenized). At one week post re-inoculation with live or frozen L3 to the initially sensitized rats, the absorbance value of the specific IgM and IgE to ES antigen elevated quickly and highly in rats that had been re-inoculated with live L3, but they decreased slightly or did not change in rats inoculated with frozen L3. These results suggest that only ingestion of live L3 can produce the specific antibody and induce initial and secondary sensitizations to L3.",

Due to economic and social setup most of the people have habit of sleeping in open air thus playing role in high malaria prevalence and Plasmodium vivax remains the prevalent species. Genetic study performed on 110 Blood samples showed less genetic diversity for both Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum. Eight alleles were distinguished both for Pvmsp 3α and Pvmsp 3β in total of 20 and 39 amplified samples of P. vivax respectively. Out of 17 samples amplified for P. falciparum 11 showed genotype K1 and 10 for MAD at Pfmsp-1 while 14 alleles were identified for 3D7/1C and two for FC27 of corresponding families of Pfmsp-2 gene. This shows that Plasmodium parasites are not genetically diverse in Khyber agency.",

This research was conducted to assess the effect of some Egyptian herbal extracts against Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) tachyzoites in vitro.The methanol extracts of Withania somnifera, Cyper rotundus, Acacia nilotica, Chrysanthemum cinerariae folium, Anethum graveolens, Raphanus sativus, Ceratonia siliqua, Elettaria cardamomum and Cuminum cyminum were tested against T. gondii tachyzoites.Among the tested plants, the extracts from Raphanus sativus, Cuminum cyminum, and Ceratonia siliqua exhibited high anti-Toxoplasma activities at 50 µg/ml, relative to sulfadiazine. They showed low IC50 values on T. gondii (7.92, 9.47 and 13.52 µg/ml, respectively) and high selectivity index values (100.79, 59.19, and 29.05, respectively). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) findings indicated evident morphological changes in tachyzoites treated with these three herbal extracts.Raphanus sativus, Ceratonia siliqua, and Cuminum cyminum methanol extracts could be promising sources of new medicament for toxoplasmosis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cystic Echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonotic infection caused by the larval form of Echinococcus granulosus in humans. Emerging evidence suggests an intriguing inverse association between E. granulosus infection and the occurrence of cancer. This study aimed to investigate the influence of diverse host-derived hydatid cyst fluids (HCF) with distinct genotypes on human liver hepatocytes (HC) and hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2). Specifically, we examined their effects on cell proliferation, apoptosis sensitivity (BAX/BCL-2), apoptosis-related p53 expression, and the expression of cancer-related microRNA (hsa-miR-181b-3p). Cell proliferation assays, real-time PCR, and ELISA studies were conducted to evaluate potential anti-cancer properties. The findings revealed that animal-origin HCF (G1(A)) induced direct cell death by augmenting the susceptibility of HepG2 cells to apoptosis. Treatment with both G1(A) and G1(H) HCF sensitized HepG2 and HC cell lines to apoptosis by modulating the BAX/BCL-2 ratio, accompanied by upregulation of the p53 gene. Additionally, G1(A) HCF and human-derived HCFs (G1(H), G7(H)) reduced the expression of miR-181b-3p in HepG2 cells. Consequently, this study demonstrates the potential anti-cancer effect of HCF in HepG2 cells and provides the first comparative assessment of HCFs from human and animal sources with diverse genotypes, offering novel insights into this field.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction To date, a total of 2574 validated flea species have been discovered. Vermipsyllidae is a family of fleas that comprises at least eight species. Vermipsylla is a genus of the family Vermipsyllidae within the order Siphonaptera of fleas. Here a novel Vermipsylla species was described, and rickettsial agent was also detected in it. Methods A total of 128 fleas were collected directly from 260 pastured sheep in China. Of these, eight representative fleas (four males and four females) were identified by key morphological features. Meanwhile, 120 flea DNAs, including six flea samples for molecular taxonomy, were subjected to Rickettsia spp. DNA detection. The molecular identity of fleas was determined by amplification and sequenmce analysis of four genetic markers (the 28S rDNA genes, the 18S rDNA genes, the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and subunit II). In addition, five Rickettsia -specific gene fragments were used to identify the species of the rickettsial agents. The amplified products were sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. Results The morphological characteristics of the flea species identified in this study were similar to Vermipsylla alakurt , but presented difference in hair number of the metepimeron, the third tergum, the genitals and the tibiae of hind leg. The 18S rDNA, 28S rDNA and CO II genetic markers from fleas showed the highest identity to those of V . alakurt , shared 98.45% (954/969), 95.81% (892/931) and 85.86% (571/665) similarities, respectively. However, the COI sequence showed the highest identity to that of Dorcadia ioffi with 88.48% (576/651) similarity . Rickettsia raoutii tested positive in 14.17% (17/120) flea DNA samples. Conclusion Our study reports the detection of R. raoultii in V. alakurt -like fleas infesting sheep in China.",

Traditionally restricted to rural areas with diverse routes of transmissions from vectorial to oral with acute manifestations but being more common diagnosed in chronic stages. The aim of this investigation was to characterize the Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) related to Chagas disease (CD) in two rural settlements of the Colombian Caribbean with previous records of the disease and/or the parasite. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study was made in two rural settlements in Colombia and surveillance instrument was developed to measure Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices (KAP) related to Chagas disease (CD). Results In a population with &gt; 60% women and access to social security around 66.5%; 81,6% were homeowners with access to water and electricity &gt; 90% but only 9% of sewerage. The level of knowledge about CD was around 62% but lack of specificity about comprehension of transmission routes (74,6%), and symptoms (85,3%) were found; concluding that 86% of the surveyed sample had very poor level of knowledge about the disease despite preventive campaigns carried out in the two communities studied. Conclusions Despite of a low frequency of CD in this Caribbean areas, the presence of vector, risk factors plus poor level of knowledge about the disease justify that public health intervention strategies should be implemented and monitored over time to maintain uninterrupted surveillance of Chagas Disease.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purple-spotted bigeyes Priacanthus tayenus Richardson (Priacanthidae) and bartail flathead Platycephalus indicus (Linnaeus) (Platycephalidae) were collected from the Arabian Gulf and examined for species of Monogenoidea (Polyonchoinea) from February to December 2020. Diplectanum robustitubum Wu &amp; Li, 2003 and an undescribed species of Platycephalotrema Kritsky &amp; Nitta, 2019 were recovered from the gill lamellae of these hosts, respectively. Diplectanum robustitubum from Iraq was redescribed and transferred to Oliveriplectanum Domingues &amp; Boeger, 2008 (Diplectanidae) as Oliveriplectanum robustitubum (Wu &amp; Li, 2003) n. comb. Platycephalotrema parile n. sp. (Dactylogyridae) from Iraq and Kuwait was described and differentiated from the similar species, Haliotrema indicum Tripathi, 1959, Platycephalotrema ogawai Kritsky &amp; Nitta, 2019, and Platycephalotrema platycephali (Yin &amp; Sproston, 1948) Kritsky &amp; Nitta, 2019, based primarily on the comparative morphologies of the vaginal sclerites. Haliotrema indicum was transferred to Platycephalotrema as Platycephalotrema indicum (Tripathi, 1959) n. comb. and Haliotrema swatowense Yao, Wang, Xia, &amp; Chen, 1998 was considered a junior subjective synonym of P. indicum . The finding of O. robustitubum in the Arabian Gulf represents a new geographic record for the species. Background The present paper represents the third installment concerning the monogenoids collected during surveys to explore their diversity on the marine and freshwater fishes of Iraq. Previous installments on the monogenoids emanating from the surveys included the dactylogyrid and gyrodactylid species parasitizing mugilid fishes. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to further document the diversity of monogenoids infecting the fishes of Iraq. Methods Marine fishes were necropsied for parasites, and standard procedures for collecting, mounting, drawing, and measuring of monogenoids were employed. Results Oliveriplectanum robustitubum n. comb. (Diplectanidae) and Platycephalotrema parile n. sp. (Dactylogyridae) were collected. The occurrence of O. robustitubum in the Arabian Gulf represented a new locality record for the species. Conclusion The recorded presence of O. robustitubum and P. parile n. sp. suggests that the diversity of monogenoids in Iraq is under estimated in the literature.",

The differentiation of these cells from the mesenchyma cells and the accompanying systhesis of lipids began in very young, blastula-shaped larvae. Both the number of the cells and the amount of their lipids increased gradually during further development of the parasites. In the pre-encystment stage of the cysticercoids the cells concentrated around the cavity of the prospective cyst. Following encystment, the scolex and the inverted neck became surrounded by a compact mass of the cells, which started using the stored lipids as a source of energy indispensable for the formation of the cyst tissues and of the definitive multilayer lining of the cyst cavity. No neutral lipids were detected in the mature 23-day-old cysticercoids as well as in the experimentally excysted scoleces. Beside a low level of uniformly distributed phospholipids apparently associated with cell membranes, no local accumulations of these substances were observed at any step of the development of the larvae. The utilization of neutral lipids proves both the presence of a lipase-type enzyme(s) and an operative β-oxidation pathway in the cells of the cysticercoids, the latter feature being highly indicative of oxidative metabolism of these larvae.",

Major structural alterations in intestinal wall include lesions of the mucosa, fusions of villi, damage of the epithelial layer and its replacement by flattened cells with pycnotic nuclei. In addition, tunica muscularis and tunica submucosa become thicker and there are numerous lymphocytes among enterocytes. At moderate infections, the changes in the spleen indicate activation of the lymphopoiesis and enhanced protective functions while, in heavily infected rats, the B zone of the spleen showed signs of emaciation. Liver histology of infected rats showed dilatation of sinusoids and the presence of destructive alterations in the parenchyma, necrotic cells and cells with pycnotic nuclei; in heavily infected animals, the necrotic cells were grouped in foci. In adrenal glands, alterations concern mostly zona fascicularis, which is interpreted as mobilization of cytoplasmic lipid inclusions in order to increase the intensity of the steroid hormone synthesis. The degree and character of histopathological changes depended on the intensity of infection.",

In this study we characterize an intact DNA transposon (NbTc1) from the microsporidian Nosema bombycis. This transposable element encodes a 337 amino acid transposase sequence, which contains the D,D34E functional motif required for transposition. A Southern blot of N. bombycis DNA separated by pulsedesis shows that copies of the NbTc1 transposon are present on 10 of the 14 chromosomes of N. bombycis. Amino acid sequence variation among copies of the NbTc1 is low, suggesting a conserved function for this transposon within N. bombycis. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that NbTc1 is a new member of the Tc1 family lineage, quite distinct from all previously described Tc1 elements, including those from fungi, indicating that NbTc1 forms a unique clade of the Tc1 superfamily. However, the Tc1 transposon is too divergent to resolve the major phylogenetic relationships among these superfamilies. Reverse transcriptase PCR and Solexa sequencing suggest that NbTc1 possesses transcriptional activity. Considering the interest in Microsporidia as biological control agents, the NbTc1 transposon may be a useful vector for the efficient transfection of these important parasites into host species.",

Following the treatment of SCN, a marked loss occurred in the activity of the five enzymes mentioned above. LDH and SDH showed their strongest activity in the buccal mass and muscular fibers, CCO in buccal mass and liver, CHE in pellicle and ganglia, and NOS in muscular fibers and pharyngeal canal. The results indicate that SCN impairs the activities of the enzymes influencing the transfer of neurotransmitter and energy supply in O. hupensis, ultimately leading to the loss of various physiological functions, which is considered to be a cause of death in O. hupensis.",

The new species is morphologically most similar to Proctocaecum atae, P. elongatum, P. crocodili, P. gairhei and Acanthostomum slusarskii. It differs from all of these species in having a much longer prepharynx, and differs from both P. atae and P. crocodili in having a much longer body and posteriorly situated vitelline fields. Proctocaecum blairi sp. nov. differs from P. elongatum in having a shorter body, a greater forebody to hindbody ratio, a much smaller ventral sucker, and a higher number of circumoral spines (23 vs 21 in P. elongatum). The new species differs from P. gairhei in possessing a much larger body length:width ratio and an ovary separated from the anterior testis by a seminal receptacle. Acanthostomum slusarskii lacks a gonotyl and has fewer circumoral spines than the new species.

    "abstract": "Abstract Seriolella porosa (Silver warehou) is an important fish resource in the Argentine Sea. No previous studies have been carried out to date on its parasite fauna. The present study aims to (i) identify the digenean trematodes that parasitize Silver warehou, (ii) estimate parasite frequency and abundance, and (iii) establish their relationship with fish size and sex. A total of 100 specimens of S. porosa from San Matías Gulf, Argentina were examined between September and October 2006. Host size and sex were determined. Parasites extracted from the stomach lumen were fixed, conserved in 5% formalin, and stained with Langeron’s hydrochloric carmine. The following parameters were also determined: dispersion coefficient, prevalence, intensity, and parasite abundance. Differences in parasitism were assessed using non-parametric tests. Four adult digenean species were found in the stomach, namely Lecithocladium cristatum, Aponurus laguncula, Elytrophalloides oatesi and Gonocerca cf. phycidis. L. cristatum was not only dominant but also the most prevalent and abundant species. None of the digeneans showed interspecific association with each other and therefore they might follow different patterns of colonization (i.e., different intermediate hosts, seasonal and/or spatial distribution of the infective stages). Significant differences were observed among the digeneans analyzed in respect to the sex of the host. Results from this study show that Silver warehou plays a key role as a final host of a significant number of digeneans in the ecosystem. This study is the first step in an attempt to further determine the larval stages in intermediate hosts in San Matías Gulf.",

    "abstract": "Aonchotheca annulosa and Eucoleus bacillatus are two capillariin nematodes parasitizing the intestinal and stomach mucosa, respectively, of various rodent species, and two, among others, component species of the helminth fauna of the wood mouse, Apodemus sylvaticus. A capillariin each was found in the liver parenchyma of two wood mice in a post-fire regeneration enclave in Serra Calderona Natural Park (Valencian Community, Spain). Due to their location, the preliminary identification of the helminths corresponded to Calodium hepaticum, a hepatic capillariin with rodents as its main host. So far, this species had never been found in Serra Calderona. To verify the preliminary identification, a comparative morphometric study between the specimens from Serra Calderona and a preserved individual of C. hepaticum from another enclave was carried out. Morphometric analysis revealed that the adult helminth as well as the eggs found in the liver of the first mouse belonged to A. annulosa, whereas the second one was identified as a male E. bacillatus. Moreover, the liver from both hosts showed a visible pathology, being the consequence of aberrant migration of the parasites. This is the first evidence that A. annulosa and E. bacillatus may migrate erratically and thus produce ectopic foci in other organs.",

The assembly pheromone, in defined ratio, was encapsulated using poly-ɛ-caprolactone by water-in-oil-in-water double emulsion solvent evaporation technique. In the in vitro bioassay, percent mortality with test microspheres was 95.6, 64 and 44 among the unfed larvae, unfed nymph and unfed adults respectively, 24 hours post-exposure. Field trials were carried out to evaluate the efficacy of microspheres in luring and killing environmental stages of R. sanguineus in dog houses/kennels. Engorged and unfed stages in the environment were found adhered and dead on the specially designed lure.",

In order to increase the protection efficacy by stimulating the cell mediated immunity, MPLA a detoxified derivative of LPS known to induce the cellular response, was used in this study as an adjuvant on mice models. ALT-2+MPLA formulation elicited a high titer of total IgG antibody, with profoundly increased levels of IgG2b. Reduced splenocyte proliferation was observed in immunized group when compared to control groups which could be attributed to many in vivo factors. The levels of IFN-γ were high in unstimulated MPLA group compared to ALT-2 stimulated MPLA group, suggesting that the ALT-2 antigen suppressed the IFN-γ levels. A high level of IL-10 was induced by the ALT-2+MPLA formulation, which inhibited the production of Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5) and also reduced the Th1 cytokine (IFN-γ, IL-2) levels which are not in vogue with the classical MPLA adjuvant formulation. We propose a mechanism for this immunomodulation which involves a diminished expression of TLR-4, by which the filarial parasites have evolved to evade host immune mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The association of fever, focal hepatic lesions and peripheral hyper-eosinophilia (FHLH) can be observed in both infectious and non-infectious conditions. Fascioliasis, capillariasis, toxocariasis, all causes of visceral larva migrans (VLM), represent most of the former, whilst lymphomas, eosinophilic leukemias and mastocytosis belong in the non-infectious conditions.We prospectively followed a young patient presenting with FHLH in the Tuscany region of Italy.The patient was subject to serological and parasitological examination in an attempt to clarify the origin of the lesions. Serologies for both Fasciola hepatica and Toxocara spp. were positive, with the latter presenting a higher index. We opted for treatment with a prolonged course of albendazole due to the serological results and being toxocariasis more frequent in our setting. The patient was then subject to radiological follow-up. The patient responded to treatment with albendazole as shown by a decrease in eosinophils, seronegativization for Toxocara spp., clinical and radiological improvement. Toxocariasis was hence considered the most likely diagnosis.Parasitic infections cannot be disregarded in the presence of FHLH. Differential diagnosis between these parasitic infections can be challenging due to the presence of similar clinical presentations and serological cross-reactions, and follow-up of the patient is needed to ensure optimal treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background and Objective Giardia is a parasitic hard protozoan that causes a variety of parasitological and pathological changes in gastrointestinal epithelial cells and is resistant to a variety of disinfectants and treatments. This study used experimental animals infected with Giardia Lamblia to assess the potential therapeutic effect of Lactobacillus casei , Lactobacillus bulgaricus (Lactobacillus in yoghurt) and curcumin in comparison to one of the commonly used drugs (metronidazole). Methods The study included 54 Syrian hamsters ( Mesocricetus auratus ) that ranged in weight from 80 to 100 g and were divided into six groups: The effect of the used preparations was assessed in terms of parasitological and histopathological aspects in Group I non-infected healthy control, Group II infected non-treated, Group III infected treated with metronidazole MTZ, Group IV infected treated with Lactobacillus casei , Group V infected treated with curcumin, and Group VI infected treated with, Lactobacillus bulgaricus (Lactobacillus in yoghurt). The number of G. lamblia cysts per gram of stool was counted during the parasitological examination. Results The difference between the infected non-treated group and all the treated groups was statistically significant (P0.05). When compared to the infected untreated group, Lactobacillus casei and, Lactobacillus bulgaricus (Lactobacillus in yoghurt) produced a 100% reduction in G. lamblia cyst shedding, curcumin produced an 87.80% reduction in number of cysts, and metronidazole produced a 78.4% reduction in number of cysts. Conclusion Our results highlight the potentially effective therapeutic effect of different preparations of probiotics and curcumin against Giardiasis.",

Individuals from the Black Sea differ from the descriptions based on Mediterranean specimens in having 4–5 proboscis hooks per row in the former and 5–6 in the latter. The size of the cuticular spines is rejected as a diagnostic character for A. propinquus because their length varies in a wide range (3.0–7.5 µm). The diagnostic characters for identifying A. propinquus include the presence of small culticular spines, the testes located in the central part of the body and an acanthor having a single hooklet lacking a root.",

Twenty-three (46%) and 12 (20%) of these fishes, respectively, were found to harbour intestinal trematodes. Siganus spinus was parasitized by Helicometra marmoratae Nagaty et Abdel-Aal, 1962 (Opecoelidae Ozaki, 1925) and S. spiniferum by Helicometra aegyptense sp. nov. (Opecoelidae Ozaki, 1925). Based on a large number of specimens collected from its type host and locality, H. marmoratae is broadly redescribed for the first time, and its type specimen is re-examined. The validity of this species is discussed and considered a new synonym of H. fasciata (Rudolphi, 1819) Odhner, 1902 (type species of the genus). Helicometra aegyptense sp. nov. is similar to H. equilata (Manter, 1933) Siddiqi et Cable, 1960, H. nasae Nagaty et Abdel-Aal, 1962, H. pteroisi (Gupta, 1956) Fischthal et Kuntz, 1965 and H. interrupta Hassanine, 2005 in having a short forebody and a long cirrus sac extending posterior to the ventral sucker, but differs significantly from them or unique in having a distinctly elongate pharynx, a larger sucker ratio and vitelline follicles grouped in small clusters arranged in two lateral rows on each side of the body. The valid species of Helicometra are listed in four principal groups.",

For most surgeons, splenectomy is the primary treatment in such cases which aims at eradicating the disease while decreasing the chances of recurrence by removing the intact cyst. While this is true, the risks of other two parasitic infections are increased, namely malaria and babesiosis. In the case presented here, the spleen was preserved after extirpating the cyst to keep the patient’s immunity against malaria, which is endemic in our region.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Alveolar echinococcosis is a severe helminthic disease in humans caused by larvae of the fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. Austria is considered an endemic area with hotspots having up to 45% prevalence (Bagó et al. in Proceedings of the Zoo and Wildlife Health Conference 2019, Berlin, p. 91, 2019). At our facility, we have registered a notifiable increase of animals submitted for the diagnosis of E. multilocularis since 2016. Therefore, we investigated high throughput diagnostic methods to provide rapid and reliable results in comparison with our current method. Methods We have developed and compared a novel method of detection using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) combined with previous target specific extraction according to Maas et al. (Vet Parasitol 230:20–24, 2016), with our current macroscopic method “Shaking in a Vessel Technique” (SVT) by Duscher et al. (Parasitol Res 95(1):40–42, 2005). We investigated 77 wild canids (72 red foxes, 5 golden jackals) using both methods. The data were analyzed using a non-Bayesian approach, applying bootstrapping to create confidentiality intervals. Results Sensitivity for droplet digital PCR was 90.51% with the 95% credibility interval ranging from 82.50 to 96.92%, whereas mean sensitivity for SVT was 92.04% with a 95% credibility interval ranging from 84.75% to 98.36%. Additionally, a non-linear regression similar to R 2 could be pointed out between the counted worms and the results gathered from ddPCR. Conclusion Magnetic capture extraction followed by ddPCR shows strong potential as a high throughput method for diagnosing E. multilocularis prevalence in diverse canid populations as well as infection intensities of individual animals, giving valuable epidemiological insights of the distribution amongst wild canids as an alternative to conventional qPCR or macroscopic methods.",

    "abstract": "Alloglossidium demshini sp. nov. is described based on specimens from leeches Haemopis grandis collected in northwestern Minnesota. The new species is morphologically closest to Alloglossidium schmidti. The two species can be readily differentiated based on several morphological characters. The cirrus sac in A. schmidti is almost entirely situated anterior to the ventral sucker while in A. demshini sp. nov. it is situated dorsal to the ventral sucker and its proximal end almost reaches the posterior end of ventral sucker or extends posterior to it. The new species has a prepharynx that is substantially longer than the esophagus while in A. schmidti the situation is the opposite. The two species also differ in the position of the ovary and the position of the testes and vitelline fields in relation to the ends of the ceca. Hirudineatrema oschmarini described from leeches in Eastern Palaearctic and Alloglossidium richardsoni described in North America demonstrate great morphological similarity. Nevertheless, Hirudineatrema cannot be synonymized with Alloglossidium at this point because of several peculiar morphological features of H. oschmarini such as a V-shaped excretory bladder and the apparent presence of a true seminal receptacle in the latter species. These features need to be re-evaluated before any taxonomic decision can be made.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Chlorazol Black E (CBE) stain has been used for the detection and identification of intestinal parasitic protozoa. In recent years, genotyping of protozoa has been performed to examine pathogenicity and for epidemiologic analysis. In this study, protozoan DNA was amplified from preserved human fecal specimens stained with CBE that were positive for Giardia intestinalis (syn. G. lamblia and G. duodenalis), Chilomastix mesnili, Pentatrichomonas hominis, and Entamoeba histolytica. DNA was amplified from 11 of the 12 (91.6%) samples examined. DNA from CBE-stained smears of G. intestinalis, E. histolytica, and P. hominis was amplified, whereas any amplification product could not be obtained from one of three smears of C. mesnili. Storage term and protozoan number had no association with results of PCR amplification. In genotyping of G. intestinalis, four out of six (66.7%) samples were of genotype AI, while the remaining two (33.3%) samples were of genotype B. The amplified DNA sequences showed high similarity (&gt;99%) with that of G. intestinalis in the GenBank database. These results suggest that DNA remains stable in CBE-stained smears for long term. The present study demonstrates that nuclear extracts from specimens stained with CBE can be amplified by PCR and suggests that specimens stored for extended periods could be applied to genetic and prospective epidemiologic analyses.",

The use of swine manure in agriculture renders the eggs of this ascaridida an accessible source of infection, thus posing a significant risk factor for human health. With the objective of proving the prevalence of infection with A. suum nematodes in the territory of Serbia, investigations were carried out in the period between 2007–2011 in the territories of five districts: North Bačka, South Banat, Braničevo, Zlatibor and Nišava. The investigations covered coprological examinations of 1031 feces samples of swine originating from farms owned by individual breeders. The samples were examined using the standard flotation method with a saturated water solution of NaCl. The established prevalence of ascariasis infection amounted to 47.62% (1031/491). The biggest prevalence of infection was determined in the territory of the Braničevo District, 65.78% (301/198), and the smallest in the territory of the Nišava District, 32.24% (183/59). In spite of its prevalence and vast economic importance, there is still insufficient information about the key aspects of the biology and epidemiology of A. suum. Viewed from the aspect of epizootiology, it is very important to know the prevalence of swine infections with Ascaris because of the possible infection of humans by its migrating larvae.",

After 112 days of infection, animals were killed and adult worms were extracted from lungs and muscles. The morphology of adult worms was characterized by microscopy and molecular identification was done by polymerase chain reaction, followed by sequencing of cox1 and ITS2 genes. Phylogenetic analysis was done by maximum parsimony method.A total of 447 crabs were captured from the streams of Tongchang Town, Jinping County, Yunnan Province, China. The infection rate was found to be 41% (186 out of 447 crabs). The metacercariae of Paragonimus skrjabini was identified by the characteristics round or spherical encysted form measuring 410 to 460 × 400 to 460 µm. After animal infection in SD rats, adults were presumptively confirmed to be P. skrjabini, which was also confirmed by gene amplification and sequence analysis of cox1 and ITS2 regions. Paragonimus skrjabini clustered with previously reported P. skrjabini from Yunnan and Vietnam. The confidence values of their branches were > 95%. Phylogenetic analysis of the ITS2 region revealed two distinct clusters with distinct geographical grouping. Phylogenetic analysis with the combined data sets reiterated the geographical grouping with P. skrjabini from Yunnan clustering with strains from Vietnam.Metacercariae of P. skrjabini was discovered in freshwater crabs in Yunnan province, China, and the strains were phylogenetically related to P. skrjabini from Vietnam.",

Subtotal resection of the mass was performed and the histopathological diagnosis of gemistocytic astrocytoma was made. He received postoperative radiotherapy of remnant mass. Six months post-surgery, new multiple lesions were developed on the left cerebellum and the lesion yielded radiological findings that were quite similar to those of the lesion previously observed in the left frontal lobe. Total resection was performed with the aid of neuronavigation and a live yellow 10-cm-long worm with an active scolex was found. A pathologist identified the worm as a sparganum of Spirometra mansoni. This suggests that the live worm may have moved to the ipsilateral cerebellum due to the stimulus from the surgery and radiation on the frontal lobe. Although this case presented characteristic MRI findings of sparganosis, we did not conduct a serological test; therefore, we misdiagnosed sparganosis as gemistocytic astrocytoma. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the ipsilateral transtentorial migration of cerebral sparganosis.",

    "abstract": "The tumbu fly, Cordylobia anthropophaga (Diptera: Calliphoridae), is widely distributed in continental tropical and subtropical Africa, being the most common cause of furuncular myiasis in Sub-Saharan Africa. The aim of the present work was to analyze the role of rodents as possible reservoirs of C. anthropophaga in Cape Verde, considering the zoonotic character of this fly species.A total of 150 peridomestic rodents were studied in Santiago island. For the obtained larvae, morphological and molecular characters were analyzed.Cordylobia anthropophaga was found in 6.4% of the peridomestic Rattus rattus analyzed. The present work unveils the presence of C. anthropophaga in rodents of the African archipelago of Cape Verde, introduced probably with West African humans and/or animals.The presence in peridomestic animals, and the wide range of species that this fly can affect, entails a zoonotic risk of myiasis by tumbu fly.",

    "abstract": "The stomachs and spiral valves of sharks and rays were examined for their trypanorhynch (Cestoda) parasite fauna and dietary items to infer feeding ecology. In Indonesia, sharks and rays have been experiencing increasing awareness and conservation in the recent years due to high fisheries activities and to avoid future species extinction.The samples were collected in 2009 from two different sampling sites at the southern coasts of Java and Bali in Indonesia. The parasite fauna was studied for 41 elasmobranch fishes. Amongst these, three shark species, Carcharhinus sorrah, Carcharhinus sp. I and Squalus megalops and seven ray species, Brevitrygon heterura, B. cf. heterura, Gymnura zonura, Maculabatis gerrardi, Mobula kuhlii, Neotrygon cauruleopuncatata and Rhinobatos penggali were studied. Four additional specimens, belonging to the shark species Carcharhinus sp. II and Mustelus cf. manazo and the ray species Maculabatis gerrardi were studied from the waters of South Bali.Analyses of the feeding ecology of the ray M. gerrardi revealed distinct differences between both sampling sites, indicating the presence of ecological differences between the geographically independent regions. A total of 11 different trypanorhynch species/taxa belonging to the five families Eutetrarhynchidae (5), Gilquiniidae (1), Lacistorhynchidae (1), Pterobothriidae (1) and Tentaculariidae (3) were found. Ten trypanorhynch species from Penyu Bay and four species from South Bali could be identified. Two taxa that might represent new species were collected: Dollfusiella sp. from Brevitrygon heterura and Prochristianella sp. from Maculabatis gerrardi.The present paper gives insights in using the trypanorhynch cestode community in combination with feeding ecology analyses to support conservation of elasmobranchs in Indonesian waters.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of Dicrocoelium infection and to predict the ecological niches and climatic variables that support dicrocoeliosis in the Himalayan ranges of Pakistan.Dicrocoelium was detected in 33 of 381 liver samples and 238 of 6060 blood samples taken from sheep and goat herds in the area. The prevalence of dicrocoeliosis was higher in sheep than in goats and highest in females aged more than 3 years. An environmental risk map was created to predict active zones of transmission and showed the highest probability values in central parts of the Chitral district in the northwest of Pakistan. Climatic variables of the mean monthly diurnal temperature range (Bio2), annual precipitation (Bio12), and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) were found to be significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the presence of Dicrocoelium infection.Together, the findings of this study demonstrate the most suitable ecological niches and climatic variables influencing the risk of dicrocoeliosis in the Himalayan ranges of Pakistan. The methods and results could be used as a reference to inform the control of dicrocoeliosis in the region.",

Only mature sarcocysts, measuring up to 950 μm in length and up to 75 μm in width, were observed. By light microscopy the sarcocyst wall was thin (&lt; 1 μm thick) and smooth. The villar protrusions on the sarcocyst wall were up to 4.0 μm long and up to 0.6 μm wide; they were folded over the sarcocyst wall giving a thin-walled appearance. The microtubules in villar protrusions were smooth and confined to villar protrusions. Bradyzoites in sections were 4.0–5.9 × 0.8–1.8 μm in size. Structurally, sarcocysts from the macaw appeared different from sarcocysts of other avian species. This is the first report of Sarcocystis infection in this host.",

The fishes were netted in the Três Marias Reservoir (18°12′59″S, 45°17′34″W) of the upper São Francisco River, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The new species differs from its congeners by the following characters: the specific setation on the antennule; the terminal barb of the antenna; the deeply bifurcate distal segment of the mandible; the chalice-shaped genital complex; a conspicuous external indentation of the second segment of the first endopod and a very short terminal segment of the first exopod.",

In this study, fifteen genes encoding secreted or membrane binding protein were identified with the signal sequence trapping method by retrovirus mediated expression screening (SST-REX) of cDNAs from the egg of Schistosoma japonicum (Chinese strain).",

Trophozoites of Q. cloptoni attain a maximum length of 944 μm and their epimerites are either a simple knob or cauliflower-like without any digitiform process; gamonts are solitary and, spherical gametocysts, 390 μm, release ovoid oocysts by a simple rupture, the latter being provided with four characteristic spines, two at each pole. Trophozoites of Q. caudata are much smaller, 578 μm in maximum length, and the epimerite in this gregarine is short and cone like. Spherical gametocysts, 365 μm, also dehisce by a simple rupture releasing ovoid oocysts having four typical spines, characteristic of the genus Quadruspinospora Sarkar et Chakravarty, 1969. The validity of Quadruspinospora as a distinct genus is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The adaptation and immunogenisity of Cryptosporidium parvum isolated from Siberian chipmunks (SC1 strain) in immunocompetent (ICR) mice were examined. The oocysts were received to the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice by repeated passage. The oocysts collected from the 18th SCID mice were inoculated to 5 ICR mice. The mice began to shed oocysts from 6 days after inoculation, the patency was 5 days, and the maximum oocysts per gram of feces (OPG) value was 104. The maximum of OPG value was gradually increased by successive passage, and finally that in the 22nd mice reached 106 (patency: 11 days). It is considered that these results indicate completion of their adaptation to ICR mice. To examine the immunogenicity of C. parvum to ICR mice, 8 groups of 5 mice each were inoculated with 1.3 × 106 oocysts of SC1 strain, which were collected after adaptation to SCID mice. All groups shed oocysts from 6th day, and their patency was from 8 to 12 days. On the 21st day after the primary infection, these mice were challenged with 1.3 × 106 oocysts. No oocysts shed from any groups, although 2 control groups shed oocysts from the 6th day, and their OPG values were more than 106. These results suggest that this strain has strong immunogenicity against ICR mice. Therefore, the immunological healthy mice were considered a useful experimental model to investigate immunological and drug treatments in the strain of C. parvum.",

The detailed measurements of several male and female specimens are given in a table. In the original description, using light microscopy only, the authors had described 3 pairs of pedunculated papillae in the male of L. vauceli. The present study establishes the precise number, shape and disposition of the end of the male tail to include only two pairs of pedunculated papillae, 2 pairs of sessile papillae, and 1 pair of phasmids. As the same pattern was observed in all descriptions and recent redescriptions of species classified in the Enterobiinae, the present work confirms that the number and disposition of the caudal papillae observed in the subfamily is constant.",

Nanotrema niokoloensis sp. nov. is distinguished primarily by possessing a copulatory organ composed of a long thin tube with median portion usually coiled into about 2.5 rings and an accessory piece resembling a braid lying within the rings. Based on the presence of the dorsal anchors modified into paired haptoral spikes, which lack an associated bar, species of Nanotrema phenotypically appear to be related to those of Neotropical Rhinoxenus Kritsky, Boeger et Thatcher, 1988 and Indian Spicocleidus Agrawal, Tripathi et Shukla, 2005.",

The diagnostic characters of F. czaplinskii are commented and updated from an original erroneous description. The most reliable distinguishing character is the structure of the copulatory part of the vagina, which is funnel-shaped and usually has smooth internal surface. The characters associated with the cirrus size and armament and the number of genital primordia per segment are not considered reliable differentiating characters. A lectotype and paralectotypes of F. czaplinskii are designated.",

Pigments were extracted from the snails using acetone and separated on EMD Millipore reversed phase C-18 plates with concentration zone using petroleum ether-acetonitrile-methanol (1:1:2) mobile phase. After development, two yellow pigment zones, lutein and β-carotene, were identified with respective R f values of 0.55 and 0.13 and then quantified by densitometry. Statistical analysis of the weight percentages of each pigment showed a significant decrease (P &lt; 0.05) in the concentration of β-carotene in the DGGs of infected B. glabrata at 6 and 8 weeks post-infection compared to the uninfected snails. No significant differences were seen in the concentrations of β-carotene in the whole body of the uninfected versus infected snail samples. Changes in the lutein concentration of the infected DGG and whole snail bodies were insignificant compared to the uninfected controls. In conclusion, larval S. mansoni infection caused a significant decrease in the β-carotene concentration of the DGG at 6 and 8 weeks post infection.",

The new species are assigned to genera based on presence or absence of cuticular spines; absent in Batrachotrema, present in Opisthioparorchis. Five species are assigned to Batrachotrema, which are separated by position of genital pore, location of testes and host; B. korbaensis differs from previously described species in that it is the only species from an anuran host with testes in the 4th quarter of the body. Ten species are assigned to Opisthioparorchis, which are separated by testes position, extent of vitellaria, and oral sucker-acetabulum ratio. O. nanoranae sp. nov. is the only species possessing tandem testes. Two species, O. dehradunensis sp. nov. and O. yaanensis, possess oblique testes, the remaining 7 species have symmetrical testes.

The enzyme was localized in the nervous system and in some non-nerve cells of these larvae. In oncospheres AChE was detected in hook muscles and in the binucleated medullar center that is known to enclose two neurons. At early developmental stages of the cysticercoids the enzyme was localized in the post-oncospheral hook muscles and in subtegumental muscle fibers of the cercomer. At medium and late stages of development the activity of AChE was detected in the developing nervous system and in two and, subsequently, in four populations of cells, which gradually spread over the whole internal wall of the cyst, thus forming a thin multilayer AChE-positive lining of the cyst cavity. Following withdrawal of the scolex the lining separates the parenchyma of the turned neck from the cyst tissues and remains AChE-positive during the whole life of the parasite, i.e. up to the death of the infected host. The role played by non-neural AChE associated with the cyst cavity lining is unknown, but seems to regulate both the transport of nutrients and minerals into the scolex and waste substances in the opposite direction.",

Ten (33%) and 12 (24%) of these fishes, respectively, were found to harbour intestinal trematodes. L. nebulosus was parasitised by Pachycreadium lethrini sp. nov. (Opecoelidae) and D. noct by Pseudometadena aegyptensis sp. nov. (Cryptogonimidae). P. lethrini sp. nov. is unique in having distinctly unequal testes, contiguous gonads arranged obliquely in the right side of hindbody and a small egg size. However, it differs from each of the other three species of the genus in several other features: from P. gastrocotylum (Manter, 1940) Manter, 1954 in having a smaller sucker ratio and vitelline follicles terminating anteriorly at the level of intestinal bifurcation; from P. carnosum (Rudolphi, 1819) Cortini et Ferretti, 1959 in having a smaller body, a smaller sucker ratio, a genital pore situated ventrally to the anterior border of pharynx, a pretesticular ovary and vitelline follicles extending anteriorly to the level of intestinal bifurcation; and from P. lerneri Sogandares-Bernal, 1959 in having a larger body, a smaller sucker ratio and an unlobed ovary. P. angolensis Aleshkina et Gaevskaya, 1985 is considered an invalid species in Pachycreadium. P. aegyptensis sp. nov. is similar to P. celebesensis Yamaguti, 1952, but mainly differs in having a larger pharynx, a much shorter oesophagus, extensive vitelline acini and a shorter seminal vesicle. Pachycreadium Manter, 1954 and Pseudometadena Yamaguti, 1952 are briefly reviewed.",

We reported a rare case of cysticercosis involving the whole spinal canal in China. Case Presentation A rare case of cysticercosis involving the entire spinal cord, in a 52-year-old Chinese man, was detected in 2021. Epidemiological investigation, clinical and etiological examination was performed. Conclusion Since spinal cysticercosis is a rare but potentially life-threatening disease, clinicians should always consider the differential diagnosis of space-occupying lesions.",

Nested PCR was used to amplify fragment of mitochondrial large subunit rRNA of the fungus in samples of oropharyngeal swabs. Nineteen (12.8%) of the 148 examined samples were positive for DNA of P. jirovecii. The samples collected from children were more often positive than the samples from young adults (p = 0.003) or from both groups of adults (p = 0.0029). Moreover, among adults (n = 99) proportion of infected women (n = 6; 12.5%) was significantly higher than men (n = 1; 2%). Results of the research confirm the high prevalence of Pneumocystis infection in children and indirectly point out to children as a possible source of infection for older people.",

One of them is described as Anomotaenia barusi sp. nov. The new taxon is distinguished from related congeneric species by the different shape and size of the rostellar hooks, the number of testes and the morphology of male and female reproductive organs. The other species was identified as Anomotaenia alata Spassky et Konovalov, 1969. The validity of this species has formerly been questioned because of its striking morphological similarity to the type-species of the genus, A. microrhyncha (Krabbe, 1869), described from the same host, Philomachus pugnax (L.). Present data revealed differences in the number and measurements of the rostellar hooks, the size of the cirrus-sac, the armament of the cirrus and the presence or absence of setae at the polar ends of the inner egg envelope, which supported the validity of A. alata. The finding of A. alata in C. dubius from Slovakia represents a new host and geographical record.",

In the present work, we analyze the sequence, structure and phylogeny of TCTP orthologs in a group of human parasitic protozoan species.The complete sequences of TCTP orthologs in protozoan parasites were identified with the NCBI BLAST tool in the database of the EuPathDB Bioinformatics Resource Center. The sequences were aligned and important regions of the protein were identified, and later phylogenetic trees and 3D models were built with different bioinformatic tools.Our results show evolutionarily and structurally conserved sites that could be exploited to create new therapeutic strategies given the increase in the number of strains resistant to current drugs.TCTP orthologs in protozoan parasites have been little studied but have been shown to be important in parasite growth, proliferation, reproduction, and response to changes in the environment. For all this, TCTP can be considered as a possible therapeutic target.",

The disease is caused by the biting fly-transmitted subspecies Trypanosoma brucei evansi, which is very closely related to the tsetse-transmitted subspecies T. b. brucei and the sexually transmitted subspecies T. b. equiperdum. At least two phylogenetically distinct groups of T. b. evansi can be distinguished, called type A and type B. These evolved from T. b. brucei independently. The close relationships between the T. brucei subspecies and the multiple evolutionary origins of T. b. evansi pose diagnostic challenges.Here we use previously established and newly developed PCR assays based on nuclear and mitochondrial genetic markers to type the causative agent of recent trypanosome infections of camels in Southern Algeria.We confirm that these infections have been caused by T. b. evansi type A. We also report a newly designed PCR assay specific for T. b. evansi type A that we expect will be of diagnostic use for the community.",

Incidence density represents how quickly a disease or a condition is occurring amongst a group of individuals at risk.The longitudinal and prospective study design took place in south, centre, east, west and north of Côte d'Ivoire. Cattle have been followed for 12 months. At the end of each month, each animal has been RT-PCR tested for new infection by Babesia bovis, Babesia bigemina, and PCR-RFLP tested for new infection by Anaplasma marginale.Findings show for the study area that incidence densities of Babesia bovis, Babesia bigemina and Anaplasma marginale infections in Côte d'Ivoire are, respectively, 15.3 new infections [95% CI 13.1-17.88] per 100 cattle, 32.2 new infections [95% CI 28.5-36.3] per 100 cattle, and 25.9 new infections [95% CI 22.5-29.6] per 100 cattle.Finally, there is increasing of infection incidence density following the region distance from the coast or elevation.",

Percent recovery was not directly related to initial dose. Final yields also did not change with the initial dose. However, percent yields was highly negatively correlated with initial dose of nematodes and was the highest with the 50 IJs dose. Additional point of the study was to investigate whether the nematodes are able to produce progeny from one hermaphroditic individual. The results showed that the invasive larvae resumed growth and transformed into hermaphroditic individuals that reproduced without cross-fertilisation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Schistosomiasis significantly impacts public health, as it causes severe morbidity. Infections caused by Schistosoma mansoni ( S. mansoni ) can be treated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). This study aims to determine the most effective route of AuNPs administration and the magnitude of its anti-fibrotic effect. Methods In the five groups' in vivo assay design, AuNPs were administered intraperitoneally (1 mg/kg) and orally (1 mg/100 g) to S. mansoni -infected mice. Biochemical parameters (serum levels of albumin and liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured. The histological changes of the liver in distinct groups were evaluated using Hematoxylin and Eosin, Masson's trichrome, and immunohistochemical stains. Results Infection with S. mansoni was associated with substantial changes in the histological architecture of liver tissue and abnormal levels of hepatic function tests (albumin, AST, and ALT). Schistosoma infected hepatocytes exhibited an abnormal microscopic morphology, granuloma formation and aggressive fibrosis. AuNPs restored the liver histological architecture with a highly significant anti-fibrotic effect and significantly corrected hepatic function test levels. Intraperitoneal administration of AuNPs resulted in the most significant anti-fibrotic effect against hepatic S. mansoni infection as observed in all histological sections with Masson's trichrome being the best stain to represent this fact. Conclusion For treating S. mansoni -induced chronic liver fibrosis, intraperitoneal administration of AuNPs is a successful and effective route of administration that can be recommended.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Cryptosporidium is an intestinal zoonotic protozoan parasite that infects domesticated and wild animals. There are no reports on the prevalence and molecular characterisation of Cryptosporidium in the endemic Cyprus mouflon. The mouflon is strictly protected by national and international legislation. Its main distribution is Paphos State Forest and surrounding areas, where it may share the same water sources as free-ranging domestic goats. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidium spp. and genotypes in mouflon and free-ranging goats within the mouflon range. Methods Faecal samples of 70 mouflons and 34 free-ranging goats were screened for Cryptosporidium by PCR amplification and sequencing. Results Only one sample (1/70) belonging to a mouflon was PCR positive for Cryptosporidium . Based on sequencing of the 18S rRNA locus, this species was identified as Cryptosporidium parvum ( C. parvum ). No positive sample was detected in the free-ranging goats (0/34). Conclusion This is the first report on the molecular identification of this Cryptosporidium species in a Cyprus mouflon.

The male, first studied by SEM, possesses the same number (14) of cephalic papillae as the gravid female, but these are comparatively larger and somewhat differently arranged; four slit-like depressions located near the inner base of male dorsolateral and ventrolateral cephalic papillae of the external circle are present. The inner margin of the female oral aperture is smooth, without papilla-like formations. The male caudal end is provided with a right-side ventral ala. The transverse cuticular striae on the male ventral surface bear minute ornamentations (rows of papilla-like formations) in the pre-and postcloacal region.

The blood samples of cows were collected monthly. Anti-Neospora antibodies in blood sera were detected by indirect ELISA (ID-VET, France). During whole period of the study cows remained seropositive; with S/P% values (iELISA) ranging from 94 to 214%. The antibody kinetics determined by iELISA showed a significant increase (P&lt;0.0059) of specific IgG antibodies in the third trimester of both pregnancies. The monitored cows gave birth to 10 healthy calves (4 steers and 6 heifers). To confirm the occurrence of vertical transmission of Neospora from mothers to offspring in the herd, dam-daughter serology was performed. Anti-Neospora antibodies was found in 4 from 6 heifers (&gt;6 months old). Study presents original data reporting on the very similar persistent pattern of anti-Neospora antibody levels during the third trimester of pregnancies in all five dairies. Based on the high seropositivity of female offspring, the reactivation of a latent infection of cows rather than a re-infection can be supposed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Neospora caninum is transmitted from a cow to its foetus by vertical transmission and the timing of infection in gestation is an important factor in determining the disease outcome. Few studies have explored the role of the placenta in the outcome of N. caninum infection during pregnancy. Here, we described the N. caninum presence, parasite load, local immune response, and histopathological lesions at the materno-foetal interface after infection of BALB/c mice at early and late stages of gestation. In mice infected at early gestation, N. caninum DNA was detected in foetoplacentary units 7 days post-infection (PI) and in the placenta, but not in viable foetuses on day 14 PI, indicating that the parasite was multiplying primarily in the placental tissues without reaching the foetus. Moreover, parasite DNA was detected in resorptions, suggesting that foetal death could be a consequence of infection. An increase in IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-10 expression was observed in N. caninum PCR-positive placentas, which could favour N. caninum foetal transmission and be harmful to both the placenta and the foetus. Histopathological analysis revealed necrosis affecting both the maternal and foetal sides of the placenta. At late gestation, transmission occurred rapidly following infection (day 3 PI), but parasite were rarely found. In addition, an increase in cytokine expression was observed in spleen and placental tissues from infected animals, while a downregulation in IL-4 expression was only observed in the spleen. Finally, necrosis in the placenta was limited to the maternal side, suggesting that the parasite is mainly multiplying in the placental tissue at this stage. Thus, the results of the present study indicate that the placenta may be actively involved in N. caninum pathogenesis.",

Once such interactions are better understood in the laboratory, it will be more feasible to extend the findings to infected hosts in nature. The flukes recovered from laboratory-infected Akodon cursor at 63 days post-infection were stained with hydrochloric carmine and individually mounted on glass slide as whole-mounts. Light and laser scanning confocal microscopy studies of adult male and female Schistosoma mansoni are reported. The parasites were examined morphologically and biometrically, which was obtained in a digital system for image analysis. Parameters used were: tegument thickness, digestive, excretory and reproductive systems. The overall conclusion of this experiment is that the morphological features of adult worm were similar to laboratory mice. It has been confirmed that the grass mouse is a permissive host to S. mansoni infection.",

There is also a substantial body of evidence that anti-oxidant enzymes facilitate the survival of parasitic helminths, including gastrointestinal nematodes, within the host. Superoxide dismutase has been shown to be released by a variety of parasitic helminths and may protect them from host mediated oxidative immune responses. As it may play a parasite protective role during infections SOD has been investigated as a vaccine candidate in a range of helminth parasites including Schistosoma mansoni, Acanthocheilonema viteae and Haemonchus contortus. Here, we sought to evaluate the protective potential of SOD against the rat hookworm Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, a commonly utilised laboratory infection, as a vaccination model. A cytosolic SOD from this parasite, with high sequence homology to a putative extracellular form of the enzyme was cloned and then expressed in bacteria. The resultant recombinant protein was assessed for enzyme activity and used to immunise rats prior to a single challenge infection with the parasite. No protection was observed and monitoring systemic and mucosal antibody responses and mast cell protease levels in superoxide dismutase vaccinated rats suggested that this recombinant SOD was only weakly immunogenic.",

The new species is similar to the type species of the genus, Gamidactylus jaraquensis Thatcher et Boeger, 1984, but differs from it in the following respects: the cephalothorax is shorter, the free thoracic segments are usually longer, leg 5 is reduced to a simple seta and a spine on the second antennal segment is lacking. Gamidactylus bryconis Varella, 1995 and Gamidactylus hoplius Varella et Malta, 1996, do not closely resemble the new species because they are much larger and both present leg 5 reduced to a double seta.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Larvae of the parasitic nematode Trichinella spiralis migrate via the bloodstream or the lymphatic system to the skeletal muscle cells where they induce multiple alterations in the intracellular environment leading to the formation of nurse cells. The “nurse cell-T. spiralis larva” complex is composed of a transformed fragment of a skeletal muscle cell and the wall of the larva. The pathological process responsible for the formation of this complex, known as basophilic transformation, is essential for the development of T. spiralis larvae, but it still not known how newborn larvae penetrate the transformed fragment of the muscle cell. In this study, we aimed to characterize the ultrastructure of the region of the nurse cell in direct contact with the larval wall, after one and two weeks of T. spiralis infection in mice. For this purpose, a transmission electron microscope fitted with a goniometer was used to make observations of samples tilted at an angle of ±40° relative to the axis of the electron beam. Examination of electron micrographs revealed the continuity of the nurse cell membrane adjacent to the larval surface and the presence of a large quantity of glycogen particles close to the inner surface of this membrane. Our results showed that death of the T. spiralis larvae was associated with destruction of the contact region between the larval wall and the adjacent surface of the nurse cell. We conclude that the T. spiralis larva does not penetrate the nurse cell, but a morphological “junction” is formed between the larval wall and the cell membrane.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The studies were undertaken to investigate the development of some cell-mediated immune responses in experimental toxocarosis in mice and to assess the influence of these responses on the course of infection. Mice were infected orally with 350 eggs of Toxocara canis and reinfected with the same dose of parasites after 8 weeks. Groups of infected animals were killed each week of the experiments to obtain spleens, livers and brains for further studies. Lymphocytes from removed spleens were analysed by flow-cytometry for CD4 and CD8 expression and cultured in vitro to measure their responses to Concanavalin A and excretory-secretory (ES) antigen of T. canis in a lymphocyte transformation test. Pieces of livers were used to prepare paraffin sections to be stained later with haematoxylin and eosin, whereas whole brains of the infected animals were examined for the presence of parasite larvae. The results of the studies showed depression of T-cell responses to ConA in early stages of infection and significant increase in the blastogenic responses to the ES antigen from week 4 following infection. The depression of T-cell responses was accompanied by lowered CD4+/CD8+ ratio resulting from increased percentages of CD8+ T cells. Histopathological examination of liver sections revealed trapping of larvae in T. canis reinfected mice. The intensity of infection as measured by larval recoveries from the brains of mice increased gradually up to the 8th week of infection, but did not show significant changes after reinfection, testifying to the development of long-lasting protective immunity during primary infection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Giardia lamblia (syn. G. intestinalis , G. duodenalis ) is a primitive opportunistic protozoon, and one of the earliest differentiated eukaryotes. Despite its primitive nature, G. lamblia has a sophisticated cytoskeleton system, which is closely related to its proliferation and pathogenicity. Meanwhile, α giardin is a G. lamblia -specific cytoskeleton protein, which belongs to the annexin superfamily. Interestingly, G. lamblia has 21 annexin-like α giardins, i.e., more than higher eukaryotes. The functional differences among α giardin members are not fully understood. Methods We took α-4 giardin, a member of α giardin family, as a research object. A morpholino-mediated knockdown experiment was performed to identify the effect of α-4 giardin on G. lamblia trophozoites biological traits. A yeast two-hybrid cDNA library of G. lamblia strain C2 trophozoites was screened for interaction partners of α-4 giardin. Co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescent colocalization confirmed the relationship between G. lamblia EB1 (gEB1) and α-4 giardin. Results α-4 Giardin could inhibit the proliferation and adhesion of G. lamblia trophozoites. In addition, it interacted with G. lamblia EB1 (gEB1). Conclusions α-4 Giardin was involved in proliferation and adhesion in G. lamblia trophozoites, and EB1, a crucial roles in mitosis, was an interacting partner of α-4 giardin.",

    "abstract": "The study attempted to identify possible overlap between serum cell-reactive proteins (C-rp) and hematological indices as predictors of comorbidity of malaria and septicemia among children attending primary healthcare facilities in Ilorin, Nigeria. One hundred and ninety-three children (aged: ≤ 1–15 years) presenting with symptoms suggestive of malaria were enrolled. Blood specimens were collected and screened for: Romanowsky, culture, serum C-RP and hematological indices. One hundred and fifteen (59.6%) children had Plasmodium falciparum infections (female 69.0% and male 34.1%). Septicemia was common among 52 (26.9%), but malaria and septicemia co-infection was 42 (36.5%). C-rp levels were low (< 10 mg/L) in 41 (35.7%, OR 4.594, CI 2.463–8.571) and high (> 10 mg/L) in 74 (64.3%, OR 2.519, CI 1.681–3.775) among the malaria positives (p < 0.05). Children with low C-rp, 8 (15.4%, OR 9.413, CI 4.116–21.531) were positive for septicemia and high C-RP 44 (84.6%, OR 1.694, CI 1.396–2.055), but without malaria, respectively. Similarly, increased C-rp levels were significantly associated with clinical malaria; > 10,000 parasites/μL (OR 1.486, CI 1.076–2.054, P < 0.001). Malaria-positive versus negative showed that PCV, C-rp, hemoglobin, platelet, WBC, and neutrophil were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Two bacteria species were identified, viz; Staphylococcus aureus 39 (54.9%) and Escherichia coli 32 (45.1%). The trade-off between sensitivity and specificity occurred at 16.475 cut-off using C-rp and degree of malaria severity as the standard for AUROC. C-rp are inflammatory markers, though non-specificity may be associated with malaria prognosis and severity during malaria–septicemia co-infection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Iran is among the high-risk leishmaniasis regions in the world. WHO recommends the use of GIS as an ideal tool for healthcare authorities to predict the evolution of a disease, delimit the risk of outbreaks and identify critical areas. The aim of this research is to find the association between the main species of Leishmania ( L. major , L. tropica , L. infantum ) dispersion and climatic variables in Iran. Methods All molecular-based reports of leishmaniasis from Iran between 1999 and 2021 were gathered from reliable medical sources. Meteorological data (air and soil temperatures, annual rainfall and humidity) of the country along the study period were obtained from the Iranian Climatological Research Centre. The data concerning species distribution and climatic conditions during this period were moved to a base-map through raster layers using ArcGIS 10.4.1 software. The relationship between parasitological and climatic models was examined using ANOVA. Results High risk area maps, based on the cut-off thresholds, were generated for Leishmania major, L. tropica and L. infantum. According to the molecular-based reports, the L. major distribution was significantly related to all climatic variables, while L. tropica was merely related to rainfall and humidity, and the L. infantum distribution was significantly associated with rainfall, soil and air temperatures. Conclusion The association between climatic conditions and Leishmania species distribution in Iran has been confirmed. Consequently, both, the relationship between climatic conditions and the geographical distribution of Leishmania species, and the use of GIS to better understand the spatial epidemiology of leishmaniasis, have been reaffirmed.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Ascariasis caused by the helminth Ascaris suum is the most common parasitosis of swine worldwide and it may involve all age categories of pigs. The present study reports an unusual localization of A. suum worms in the biliary system of a piglet slaughtered for human consumption. Methods The liver was subjected to ultrasound scan and pathological examination. The isolated worms were morphologically examined and the DNA was extracted for the molecular identification of the species involved. Results A total of 43 preadult nematodes were found within the gallbladder and the bile ducts. Parasites were morphologically identified as belonging to the genus Ascaris and molecularly as A. suum . At gross examination, the liver was moderately enlarged, with the bile ducts severely dilated. A chronic inflammatory infiltrate was noted, often centered around ectatic bile ducts (up to 5 mm in diameter), lined by hyperplastic epithelium and filled with sections of nematodes. The worm sections showed smooth cuticle, coelomyarian musculature, and an intestinal tract lined by columnar, uninucleated cells within a pseudocoelom. The ex vivo ultrasonographic examination of the liver allowed the visualization of several nematodes in the bile duct lumen and could be suggested for in vivo diagnosis. Unfortunately, the absence of the intestine did not allow to define the pathogenesis of the infection. Conclusion Although, given the unusual nature of this finding, it is difficult to identify predisposing factors for this A. suum localization, it suggests that ascariasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pigs with hepatobiliary disease.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The present paper describes two new genera and species of the parasitic copepod family Chondracanthidae Milne Edwards, 1840 based on specimens collected from two species of deep-sea fishes at a depth of 212 m off Suruga Bay, Japan. Avatar nishidai gen. et sp. nov. is described from the host fish Chaunax abei Le Danois, 1978 (Chaunacidae). Kokeshioides surugaensis gen. et sp. nov. is described from the host fish Setarches longimanus (Alcock, 1894) (Setarchidae). Methods Fresh specimens of chondracanthids were collected from the buccal cavity of two species of deep-sea fishes (fish hosts were frozen), Chaunax abei Le Danois, 1978 (Lophiiformes: Chaunacidae) and Setarches longimanus (Alcock, 1894) (Perciformes: Setarchidae), caught at a depth of 212 m in Suruga Bay, Japan (34° 37′48.87″ N, 138° 43′2.958″ E). Both the species are described and illustrated based on ovigerous females. Results The genus Avatar gen. nov. can readily be distinguished from all other chondracanthid genera by the following combination of features: cephalothorax slightly wider than long with anterior pair of large and posterior pair of small lateral lobes, and two pairs of ventro-lateral processes; the very posteriormost part of the first pedigerous somite contributes to the neck; cylindrical trunk with two pairs of blunt proximal fusiform processes; antennule with small knob terminally; antenna bearing distal endopodal segment; labrum protruding ventrally; two pairs of biramous legs each with 2-segmented rami. Kokeshioides gen. nov. has the following combinations of features that distinguish it from other chondracanthid genera: body flattened, without lateral processes; cephalothorax much wider than long, with paired anterolateral and posterolateral lobes, folded ventrally; the very posteriormost part of the first pedigerous somite contributes to the neck; mandible elongate; legs unique, heavily sclerotized, represented by two pairs of acutely pointed processes. Conclusion With the addition of two new genera presently reported, the family Chondracanthidae currently includes 52 valid genera. Among the described genera Avatar gen. nov. seems to be very primitive, while Kokeshioides gen. nov. is highly advanced. The deduced evolutionary history of chondracanthid genera is also discussed.",

Methods In order to prepare the immunochromatography lateral flow strip (ICLFS), antibodies purified from schistosomiasis were conjugated passively with gold nanoparticles using a potassium carbonate buffer. Results The novel ICLFS was able to correctly identify 64 out of 67 samples of schistosomiasis, 6 out of 90 samples of other parasites, and 0 out of 27 control samples. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) were 95.5%, 93.3%, 90%, and 91.4% respectively. Comparatively, the sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV of sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) conjugated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were 91.1%, 88.8%, 85.9%, and 84.4% respectively. The increased sensitivity and specificity of ICLFS produced superior results to those of sandwich ELISA. Conclusion In conclusion, ICLFS is more beneficial and precise than sandwich ELISA for detection of S. haematobium infection at early stage.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The identification of the external attaching fish parasitic cymothoid, Nerocila phaiopleura Bleeker 1857, is still based on the brief description of Australian specimens provided by Bruce (1987). The present study aimed to provide a redescription and molecular characterisation of Indian specimens of N. phaiopleura . Materials and Methods Morphological identification was carried out based on microscopic examinations and taxonomic drawings. mitochondrial DNA cox1 was selected as the target gene for sequencing and molecular identification. Nucleotide genetic divergence (p-distance) and base-pair differences among the different species were determined using MEGA11. Results Nerocila phaiopleura can be well separated from its congeners by the following combination of characteristics: Body about 2.4 times as long as wide, cephalon broadly rounded anteriorly; coxae posteriorly directed, acute and extending beyond their corresponding pereonite; pereonite 7 posterior angle produced, extending to the pleonite 1; pleonites 1 and 2 ventrolateral process posteriorly directed; uropod exopod straight and elongate, 1.7–2.0 times longer than endopod; uropod endopod lateral margin not serrate, no notch on medial margin; pereopods with short ischium; pleotelson triangular. The p-distance among N. phaiopleura and other available Nerocila spp. ranged from 21 to 19%. Conclusion This study represents the first detailed taxonomic redescription of Indian specimens of N. phaiopleura . Key taxonomic features of the life stages and molecular data are provided here to identify the species properly. Interspecific genetic divergence between N. phaiopleura and other Nerocila spp. is assessed for the first time. Studies in cymothoid life histories, genetics, and morphology are necessary to understand one of the least understood parasite families.",

Methods Toxicity of papain on snails by making series of concentrations to calculate LC 50 , and then study its larvicide effect on the free larval stages of S. mansoni and infection rate of snails. Results Papain has a molluscicidal activity on adult snails of Biomphalaria alexandrina with a lethal concentration LC 50 equals to 43.1 mg/L. In addition, it has activity on miracidia with half Lethal time (LT 50 ) of 16.11 min., and on cercariae with 12.1 min. compared to control ones. The sub lethal concentration LC 10 and LC 25 (6.9 or 24.1 mg/L, respectively) decreased the survival rate of snails at the first cercarial shedding, the rate of infection, the average total number of cercariae per snail, the shedding period and the life span of snails, while the prepatent period was significantly increased than the control ones. The morphological alterations in cercariae after exposure to papain were occurred where the cercariae lacked motility and some had a dark tail with complete detachment of head and tail. Compared to the control group, the levels of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and (ND1) genes significantly decreased in snails after exposure to papain. Conclusions Papain could be used as a potential molluscicide for elimination of schistosomiasis and decrease its transmission and deterioration of host-parasite interaction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The objective of the present work was to evaluate the effect of an ethyl acetate extract of Artemisia ludoviciana on the viability of adult Fasciola hepatica parasites and eggs. Methods The collection of plant material was performed as described in previous reports. The dried material was macerated with ethyl acetate. Ovicidal assays were performed at concentrations of 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mg/L A. ludoviciana extract. Bioassays of fasciolicidal efficacy in adult specimens of F. hepatica were performed at extract concentrations of 125, 250, 375 and 500 mg/L. The effects of triclabendazole, a reference drug, and artemisinin were also evaluated. Results The ovicidal effectiveness of the extracts obtained after 16 h of incubation at concentrations of 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500 mg/L was 48%, 52%, 87%, 89% and 92%, respectively ( p &lt; 0.05), and the fasciolicidal efficiencies during the first 24 h post-treatment ranged from 82 to 100% ( p &lt; 0.05). In both cases, scanning electron microscopy revealed damage to the shells of the eggs treated with the extract, compromising their stability. In adult fasciolae, alterations to the integument that resulted in its erosion and detachment were observed. Histopathological studies of the affected specimens revealed damage to the tegumentary and subtegumentary cells and alterations in the ovaries, testicles and intestine. This damage was more severe after treatment with the extract than after treatment with the other compounds. Methods Extract of A. ludoviciana causes damage to the tegument, intestine, ovaries, testes and eggs of F. hepatica .",

Morphological preparations of the parasites were examined and photographed under a microscope at magnifications of × 100–1000 and morphometric analyses were carried out on 22 specimens using ImageJ2 software. Eight of the specimens used for the morphological comparisons were also subjected to molecular analyses by sequencing a region of the ribosomal DNA spanning partial 18S, the internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS1 and 2), 5.8S and partial 28S and comparing this with other species through a BlastN-search in GenBank and through phylogenetic analyses. The morphology of the species from T. nybelini was markedly different to that of any of other species of Gyrodactylus. It is characterized by having relatively long hamulus roots, a character that it shares with two other species described from marine sculpins (Cottidae); G. armatus and G. maculosi. It also has a narrow rectangular ventral bar membrane with a posterior notch which it shares with G. maculosi only. Compared with all the seven species from marine Cottidae described so far, it has the smallest opisthaptoral hard parts. A comparison of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA sequence with available sequences in GenBank and a phylogenetic analyses also showed it to be highly divergent from other sequences. Therefore, a new species is proposed, Gyrodactylus triglopsi n. sp. Both the morphological and molecular analyses support the status of G. triglopsi as a new species. This is to our knowledge the first species of Gyrodactylus described from Triglops nybelini and the description extends the list of Gyrodactylus species found on fish in the Barents Sea to 17.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose The main aim of our study was to examine morphological differentiation between and within sex of hen fleas— Ceratophyllus gallinae (Schrank, 1803) population collected from Eurasian blue tit ( Cyanistes caeruleus Linnaeus, 1758), inhabiting nest boxes and to determine the morphological parameters differentiating this population. Methods A total of 296 fleas were collected (148 females and 148 males), determined to species and sex, then the following characters were measured in each of the examined fleas: body length, body width, length of head, width of head, length of comb, height of comb, length of tarsus, length of thorax and length of abdomen. Results The comparison of body size showed the presence of two groups among female and male life forms of the hen flea, which mostly differed in length of abdomen, whereas the length of head and tarsus III were less variable. Conclusion Till now, the only certain information is the presence of two adult life forms of C. gallinae . The genesis of their creation is still unknown and we are not able to identify the mechanism responsible for the morphological differentiation of fleas collected from the same host. In order to find answer to this question, future research in the field of molecular taxonomy is required.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose A ventral heart positioned posterior to the branchial basket and equipped with a pericardium is homologous in tunicates and their sister group, the craniates, yet the tunicate model organism Ciona intestinalis features a pericardial body, a structure peculiar to few ascidian species. Here, we set out to distinguish between two competing hypotheses regarding the function of the pericardial body found in the literature: (H 1 ) The pericardial body performs a role in the removal of dysfunctional myocardial cells, and (H 2 ) it is a specialized niche of the immune system involved in defense against parasites. Methods We used histological techniques, transmission electron microscopy, and PCR-based gene sequencing to investigate whether individual ascidians parasitized with apicomplexan protists show signs of infections within the pericardial body. Results In individuals of C. intestinalis from the German North Sea infested with apicomplexan protists, the pericardial body contains numerous myocardial cells in various stages of degeneration while no remnants of parasitic cells could be identified. Conclusion Thus, we conclude that H 2 —the pericardial body is a specialized niche of the immune system involved in defense against parasites—can be refuted. Rather, our observations support H 1 , the hypothesis that the pericardial body performs a role in the removal of dysfunctional myocardial cells.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Crenosoma vulpis (Dujardin,1845) is a lungworm which has spread worldwide in canines and is associated with upper respiratory infections. In a majority of cases, the infections are accompanied with chronic cough. Diagnosis of lungworms is often underdiagnosed and can be misinterpreted as other respiratory diseases. Methods The Small Animal Clinic of the University Veterinary Hospital admitted an 11-month-old dog presented with persistent cough associated with difficulty in breathing and even asphyxia. Based on clinical symptoms, the patient underwent radiological and bronchoscopic examination. Bronchoscopy revealed the presence of lungworms obturating the branches of the tracheobronchial tree. Larvae were collected by bronchoscopic lavage and subjected to parasitological and molecular examination. Results Microscopic detection and morphological identification of the worms removed during the bronchoscopy confirmed the presence of female adult worms. The subsequent molecular characterisation of the mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (cox1) and 12S ribosomal DNA (rDNA)), nuclear (18S rDNA) genes, as well as the analysis of the second internal transcribed spacer (ITS-2) region of the ribosomal DNA, confirmed the Crenosoma vulpis species . Faecal samples were processed using the Baermann method, which confirmed the presence of the larval stage 1 of C. vulpis . The therapy with fenbendazole at a dose of 50 mg/kg of live weight once daily for the period of 7 days was initiated for the patient. Conclusion This paper presents the first molecularly confirmed clinical case of a Crenosoma vulpis infection in an 11-month-old female dog of the Miniature Schnauzer breed in Slovakia.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose Coccidiosis caused by eimerian parasites results in lethal watery or bloody diarrhea in hosts, and markedly impairs the growth of and feed utilization by host animals. We previously investigated detailed the life cycle of Eimeria krijgsmanni as a mouse eimerian parasite. Only second-generation meronts, as an asexual stage, were morphologically detected in the epithelium of the host cecum for at least 8 weeks after infection, even though oocyst shedding finished approximately 3 weeks after infection. The presence of zoites was of interest because infection by eimerian parasites is considered to be self-limited after their patent period. Methods To clarify the significance of residual second-generation meronts in E . krijgsmanni infection, we performed infection experiments using immunocompetent mice under artificial immunosuppression and congenital immunodeficient mice. Results The number of oocysts discharged and the duration of oocyst discharge both increased in immunosuppressed mice. In immunodeficient mice, numerous oocysts were shed over a markedly longer period, and oocyst discharge did not finish until 56 days after inoculation. Conclusions The present results suggest that the second-generation meronts survived in the epithelial cells of the cecum after the patent period, thereby contributing to extended infection as an asexual stage. The results obtained on E . krijgsmanni indicate that infections by Eimeria spp. are not self-limited and potentially continue for a long period of time.",

    "abstract": "The genus Stilestrongylus (Freitas, Lent, and Almeida, 1937) is defined by having 24 or more subequal cuticular ridges, an asymmetrical caudal bursa, and a hypertrophied genital cone. It comprises 25 recognized species, mainly parasitizing cricetids, and shows significant diversification linked to the evolution of its hosts. Stilestrongylus magnumspiculum n. sp. is a newly described nematode species identified in the small intestine of the rodent Euryoryzomys russatus (Cricetidae, Sigmodontinae) from the Atlantic Forest of Northeast Brazil. This study aims to characterize the new species and its prevalence in host populations. A total of 43 Euryoryzomys russatus individuals were collected and analyzed for parasitic infections. Morphological features of Stilestrongylus magnumspiculum n. sp. were examined, focusing on the number of ridges, synlophe characteristics, caudal bursa type, lobe hypertrophy, and the spicule length to body length ratio. The new species exhibited a prevalence of 21% among the sampled hosts. Distinctive morphological features were observed, including:the synlophe structure exhibited specific ridge patterns that differentiate it from other species within the genus; the caudal bursa was identified as a type 2-2-1; hypertrophy of the right lobe was observed, indicating notable morphological adaptation; rays 4 and 5 were found to be equivalent in size and diverged at the distal end; the spicule length to body length ratio (SpL/BL) was measured at 30–36%, representing the largest ratio recorded for the genus. In comparison, other Stilestrongylus species displayed the following ratios: S. rolandoi (21–33%), S. lanfrediae (25–29%), S. kaaguyporai (20–24%), S. inexpectatus (20–23%), and S. stilesi (26–28%). This report presents Stilestrongylus magnumspiculum n. sp. as a new species of nematode, contributing to the diversity of the genus Stilestrongylus. The findings underscore the importance of studying host-parasite interactions within the Atlantic Forest ecosystem and provide a basis for future ecological and parasitological research.",

It harboured an eimerian that we describe here as new. Oocysts of Eimeria macarthuri sp. n. were spheroidal to subspheroidal with a bi-layered wall and measured (length × width, L × W) 18.2 × 17.0 μm, with an L/W ratio of 1.1. A micropyle, oocyst residuum and polar granule were absent. Sporocysts were ovoidal, 9.0 × 6.4 μm, with an L/W ratio of 1.3. A nipple-like Stieda body was present as well as a substieda body. A granular sporocyst residuum was present. To our knowledge, E. macarthuri represents the only coccidian ever described from a rodent of the Philippines.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This is the first report on the ultrastructure of eggs in the cestode family Amabiliidae Braun, 1900. The gravid proglottides of Tatria biremis easily detach from the strobila. Their thick-walled saccate uterus contains numerous rounded or oval eggs measuring about 30-32 μm in diameter. In the early preoncospheral phase, three primary embryonic envelopes are formed around the developing and differentiating embryos, namely: (1) vitelline capsule originating from vitellocyte material; (2) outer envelope formed by two macromeres, and (3) inner envelope originating from a fusion of three mesomeres. Thus, both the outer and inner envelopes of T. biremis eggs are cellular in origin and syncytial in nature. During egg maturation, the three primary embryonic envelopes undergo differentiation into fully formed oncospheral or egg envelopes. Most significant changes were observed in the inner envelope which becomes progressively subdivided into 3 sub-layers: the extra-embryophoral sub-layer, the embryophore, and the intra-embryophoral sub-layer, containing mesomere nuclei. The mature hexacanth is covered by a thin layer of the oncospheral tegument. Within the infective hexacanth larva, five cell types were distinguished: (1) a binucleated subtegumental cell; (2) U-shaped penetration gland; (3) nerve cells; (4) somatic cells representing the myocytons of both somatic and hook musculature, and (5) large germinative cells. Ultrastructural characteristics of T. biremis eggs are compared with those described in representatives of other cestode taxa. Since the functional ultrastructure of cestode egg envelopes is defined by multiple factors such as the type of life cycles, habitats and behaviour of the intermediate hosts, mode of the intermediate host infection, etc., ultrastructural studies of the greater diversity of cestodes are needed to obtain comparative data for fruitful analysis of cyclophyllidean cestode adaptations to their diverse life cycles.",

    "abstract": "The ultrastructure of gamonts and sporulated oocysts of Goussia metchnikovi in the spleen of gudgeon, Gobio gobio from the river Lee, England is described. In developing microgamonts, small amylopectin granules were grouped centrally and nuclei were often arranged peripherally, close to the surface membrane. Nuclear chromatin condensed into peripheral dense portions that became the nuclei of flagellated microgametes, released to the parasitophorous vacuole. The cytoplasm of macrogametes had larger, scattered amylopectin granules, lipid globules and small electron-dense bodies, but no obvious wall forming bodies; peripheral vesicular structures with the appearance of mitochondria were also present and the parasitophorous vacuole contained flocculent material, but was otherwise free of structures. Sporulated oocysts contained four sporocysts and oocyst walls appeared to consist of a single membrane. Sporocyst walls showed a dehiscence suture, characteristic of the genus Goussia, which had filamentous extensions in places. The sporocyst wall comprised a dense inner layer and a thin outer layer with a fuzzy coat, separated by an electron lucent layer. Groups of oocysts were encapsulated by fibrous layers and inflammatory cells, and many sporocysts and their contained sporozoites showed evidence of elimination by the host.",

At the apex of the scolex, resembling a beret, an apical disc is present (oval, flattened and with a sinuous edge). Our results are compared with those previously reported in other species of Clestobothrium. This study represents the first report which highlights the presence of an apical disc in the scolex of C. crassiceps.

Here, the author presents a 23-year-old female with a hydatid cyst of more than 15 years’ duration in her right quadriceps muscle. The cyst did not cause any complaints for years and grew very slowly, but eventually became infected and perforated. A large hot abscess was formed at its site. The patient was managed successfully by surgical and medical treatments. She was assessed carefully for clinical, radiological, surgical and histopathological findings. Investigations were made to differentiate the condition from classical hot abscesses and other soft tissue masses. In T1-and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images, a hypointense membranous structure (the perforated rim) within the mass of the lesion was significant for its differential diagnosis. In conclusion, especially in endemic regions, magnetic resonance imaging is a valuable tool in differentiating soft tissue cystic echinococcosis in the presence of infected and rapidly enlarging masses after long periods of dormancy.",

Only 4 isolates showed no mutations in the three analyzed gene fragments. In the remaining isolates from one to six mutations in one or more examined genes were found. Different mutations in the pfcrt, dhfr and dhps genes were found in ca. 76%, 80% and 70% of P. falciparum isolates, respectively. About forty our patients used chloroquine or pyrimethamine + sulfadoxine as malaria chemoprophylaxis and/or antimalarial treatment, but without success. In all but 5 of the P. falciparum isolates obtained from these persons, mutations associated to resistance of the parasite to chloroquine and the antifolate drugs were found.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Hookworms are blood-feeding nematodes that infect millions of people and animals worldwide. The most common species infecting dogs in Europe are representatives of the family Ancylostomatidae, which differ in invasiology, biology and morphological features. However, the differentiation of invasions of species such as Uncinaria stenocephala and Ancylostoma caninum based on a coproscopic examination is problematic. For this reason, it is recommended to use molecular diagnostics for this purpose. The authors of the article investigated the prevalence of U. stenocephala in dogs kept in various living conditions in Slovakia and developed a two-step morphology–molecular analysis-based strategy to identify the genus and the species of eggs and larvae of the Ancylostomatidae family in dogs. Conclusions In our opinion, this work is very much needed as it shows how to effectively diagnose hookworm infestations. However, we do not agree with the information in the title of the article because such studies have already been carried out in Central Europe by other authors.",

This study had the objective of evaluating the clinical, epidemiological and laboratory criteria in human CC. An epidemiological questionnaire was applied, and indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and ELISA-IgG were utilized together with computerized tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging on 90 patients with clinical signs suggestive of neurocysticercosis (NCC). Most patients had previously lived under deficient basic sanitary conditions. The imaging techniques showed that 92.2% of the cysticerci were in the cerebral parenchyma, 5.5% had a ventricular location, 1.1% were periventricular and 1% was ocular. The cysticerci were observed to be predominantly in the inactive phase. Seropositivity to the IFAT and/or ELISA was shown by 32.2% (29/90). Of the 29 seropositive patients, 72.4% presented cysticerci in the inactive form, and of the 61 seronegative patients, 78.7% also presented cysticerci in the inactive form. There was no correlation between active CC and seropositivity, since 72.4% of the seropositive patients presented calcified cysticerci. The results demonstrated that imaging techniques contributed significantly to elucidate the laboratorial diagnosis and to evaluate the stage of cysticercus development.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose To date, little is still known on parasite infections affecting free-living large whale populations worldwide. Data presented should be considered as a baseline study for future monitoring surveys on endoparasites affecting whales, thereby enhancing investigations on impacts of zoonotic parasitoses not only on vulnerable or endangered baleen whale population health but also on public health. Methods The presented study is a first report on gastrointestinal parasites infecting different free-living baleen whales inhabiting East Canadian waters using non-invasive methods. Individual faecal samples from fin ( n = 3; Balaenoptera physalus ), humpback ( n = 4; Megaptera novaeangliae ) and North Atlantic right whales ( n = 1; Eubalaena glacialis ) were collected without animal disturbance, within their natural habitats on an ecological expedition during annual surveys in summer 2017. Faecal samples were assessed by standardized diagnostic methods, such as sodium acetate acetic formalin (SAF) technique, carbol fuchsin-stained faecal smears, Giardia / Cryptosporidium coproantigen ELISAs and were applied for further identification. Results Parasitological infections included three different potentially zoonotic parasite species, one protozoa ( Entamoeba spp . ) and two metazoans (Diphyllobothriidae gen. sp., Ascaridida indet.). No positive Giardia / Cryptosporidium coproantigen ELISA could be found in the studied whales. Conclusion This study adds to the current knowledge of intestinal and zoonotic parasite infections of vulnerable to partly endangered free-ranging baleen whales. Only few or no parasitological studies exist for these whale species, usually dealing with only one dead specimen. We call for more research in this field especially for the importance of conservation of free-living marine mammals using non-invasive methods.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Purpose To date, ten validated Arthrostoma species were reported. Here, a new hookworm species was found from Asian badger ( Meles leucurus ). Methods Nineteen hookworms (9 males and 10 females) were collected from the small intestine of two Asian badgers in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, northwestern China. The hookworms were morphologically examined according to key taxonomic characters, such as anterior extremity direction, structures of oral opening (cutting plates or teeth), vulva location, buccal capsule anatomy (integrated or formed by articulating plates), the length of spicule and gubernaculum, number of plates of buccal capsule, and presence or absence of vulvar papillae. Results The hookworm species from Asian badger, here named as Arthrostoma leucurus sp. n., was different from the previously described ten Arthrostoma species. The phylogenetic tree based on the cox 1 gene showed that Arthrostoma leucurus sp. n. formed a separate clade, as a sister group to Ancylostoma and Uncinaria species. Conclusion Arthrostoma leucurus sp. n., the eleven validated Arthrostoma species, was identified from Asian badger in China.",
