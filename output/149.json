    "abstract": "While I was on duty with the Naval Institute of Tropical Hygiene at Macassar, Celebes, during World War Ⅱ, I had the opportunity to examine various wild and domestic animals for parasites, these animals being taken mainly from Celebes. Since the parasitic worms of this island had not yet been worked out at any length, an opportunity for collecting in this part of the world yielded much interesting material. I collected a fairly large amount of material from monkeys, buffaloes, birds, lizards, snakes and fishes, the latter being examined very carefully from the stand-point of prevention of parasitic infections transmitted from fish to man. Domestic fowl and small wild birds were also examined for intestinal parasites during my study on avian malaria carried out at the institute. Unfortunately I managed to bring back to Japan by air only a part of the collection before the termination of the war. The greater part of the collection shipped to me subsequently by air mail suffered serious damage in transit, and for this reason description and illustrations are based almost exclusively on mounted slides.",

    "abstract": "From the histochemical studies of succinic dehydrogenase on the striated muscle of the fish, frog, bird and mammal, the following results were obtained. (1) The red muscle fiber shows a higher succinic dehydrogenase\nactivity, while the white muscle fiber a lower activity. The third type of muscle fiber which is intermediate in the succinic dehydrogenase activity between the red and white muscle fiber, is observed practically in all of the striated muscle of mammals. (2) There is a good parallelism between succinic dehydrogenase activity and stainability to Sudan black B among the three types of muscle fibers. (3) From the nature of the constituent fibers, muscles can be divided into three groups, i. e., gastrocnemius type, soleus type and diaphragma type. (4) Those belonging to the gastrocnemius type are composed of three types of fibers, i. e., those of large size, low in activity of succinic dehydrogenase\nreaction and low in sudanophilicity; those of small size, high in enzymatic activity and in sudanophilicity; and those of medium size, moderate in enzymaticactivity and in sudanophilicity. (5) Those belonging to the soleus type, are composed of fibers almost equal in size which can be divided into two by the enzymatic activity and sudanophilicity, excepting the few with low enzymatic activity. (6) Those belonging to diaphragma type, are composed of three kinds of fibers showing different enzymatic activity as in the case of gastrocnemius type, but there is no correlation between the size and the enzymatic activity and sudanophilicity differing from the latter. (7) The difference in succinic dehydrogenase reaction as demonstrated among three types of fibers is due to the difference in number or in activity of mitochondria. (8) The pigeon breast muscle is composed mostly of red muscle fibers, and a few white muscle fibers, while the sparrow breast muscle is composed only of red muscle fibers. (9) The bloody colored muscle of the fish corresponds to the red muscle of the mammals. The white muscle of the fish is composed of three types of fibers. (10) The frog muscle is cmposed of three types of fibers.",

    "abstract": "We previously showed that inhibition of repeated electroconvulsive shock (ECS)-induced seizures through 7-day administration of anti-epileptic drugs suppressed the impairment of spontaneous alternation behavior in the Y-maze test in rats. To clarify the precise mechanism(s), we investigated the effect of valproate on such impairment and examined the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and c-Fos protein in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus 24h after the last administration of ECS. Seven-day intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of valproate (400mg/kg) suppressed the impairment of spontaneous alternation behavior. Repeated ECS increased the BDNF protein levels in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex in the presence or absence of valproate, indicating that the increase in BDNF protein levels resulted from electrical stimulation. c-Fos protein levels were significantly decreased in the hippocampal dentate gyrus after repeated ECS, but valproate had no significant effect on decreased c-Fos protein levels. Valproate＋ECS significantly increased the c-Fos protein levels of the prefrontal cortex compared with the ECS group. These findings suggest that the inhibitory effect of valproate on repeated ECS-induced impairment of spontaneous alternation behavior may be linked to the prefrontal cortex.",

In this study, we investigated changes in prehospital EMS activity and transport times during the COVID-19 pandemic. All patients transported by EMS in the city of Okayama from March-May 2019 or March-May 2020 were included. Interfacility transports were excluded. The primary outcome was the time from a patient's first emergency call until hospital arrival (total prehospital time). Secondary outcomes included three segments of total prehospital time: the response time, on-scene time, and transportation time. Total prehospital time and the durations of each segment were compared between corresponding months in 2020 (COVID19-affected) and 2019 (control). The results showed that total prehospital times in April 2020 were significantly higher than those in 2019 (33.8 ± 11.6 vs. 32.2 ± 10.8 min, p < 0.001). Increases in total prehospital time were caused by longer response time (9.3 ± 3.8 vs. 8.7 ± 3.7 min, p < 0.001) and on-scene time (14.4 ± 7.9 vs. 13.5 ± 6.2min, p < 0.001). The COVID-19 pandemic was thus shown to affect EMS and delayed arrival/response even in a minimally affected region. A system to minimize transportation delays should be developed for emerging pandemics.",

For further characterization, we investigated the capillary architecture in slow and fast muscles. The rat soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were used as representatives of slow and fast muscles, respectively. To investigate capillary density, sections of both types of muscle were stained with alkaline phosphatase; the soleus muscle showed more intense reactivity, indicating that it had a denser capillary structure than the EDL muscle. We then injected fluorescent contrast medium into samples of both muscle types for light and confocal-laser microscopic evaluation. The capillary density and capillary-to-fiber ratio were significantly higher, and the course of the capillaries was more tortuous, in the soleus muscle than in the EDL muscle. Capillary coursed more tortuously in the soleus than in the EDL muscle. Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity, an indicator of mitochondrial oxidative capacity, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression were also significantly higher in the soleus muscle. Thus, we conclude that slow oxidative muscle possess a rich capillary structure to provide demanded oxygen, and VEGF might be involved in the formation and/or maintenance of this highly capillarized architecture.",

In malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), we previously reported that expression of miR-34b and miR-34c (miR-34b/c) was frequently downregulated by methylation in MPM cell lines and primary tumors. The forced overexpression of miR-34b/c showed significant antitumor effects with the induction of apoptosis in MPM cells. In this study, we examined the in vivo antitumor effects of miR-34b/c using adenovirus vector on MPM. We subcutaneously transplanted NCI-H290, a human MPM cell line, into BALB/C mice and injected adenovirus vector expressing miR-34b/c, luciferase driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter (Ad-miR-34b/c or Ad-Luc), or PBS control into tumors over 5mm in diameter. A statistically significant growth inhibition of the tumor volume was observed in the Ad-miR-34b/c group from day 6 onward compared to the Ad-Luc group. The inhibition\nrate of Ad-miR-34b/c, compared to the tumor volume treated with Ad-Luc, was 58.6% on day 10 and 54.7% on day13.

In this study, we compared the signal transduction pathways between TNFalpha-and oridonin-induced L929 cell death. Oridonin and TNFalpha initiated apoptotic morphologic changes, but DNA fragmentation was found in TNFalpha-treated L929 cells but not in oridonin-treated ones. The pan-caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk), caspase-8 inhibitor (z-IETD-fmk) and caspase-3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk) augmented oridonin-and TNFalpha-induced cell death. However, the caspase-9 inhibitor (z-LEHD-fmk) only increased oridonin-induced L929 cell death. Moreover, poly (ADPribose) polymerase (PARP) was cleaved in oridonin-treated L929 cells but not in the TNFalpha-treated groups, and the caspase-3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk) failed to inhibit PARP cleavage. These results showed that only oridonin-induced L929 cell death required PARP degradation in a caspase-3 independent manner. In addition, oridonin increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 protein expression, but TNFalpha did not. TNFalpha induced p38 and ERK activation, whereas oridonin triggered only ERK activation. We also investigated the effect of oridonin on intracellular TNFalpha expression, and found that oridonin augmented endogenous pro-TNFalpha expression and its upstream protein IkB phosphorylation. These results indicated that although oridonin promoted endogenous pro-TNFalpha expression, a great difference existed between the signal pathways through which TNFalpha-and oridonin-induced cell death.",

In the Malay, G6PD Viangchan (871GA, 1311CT, IVS11 nt93TC) and G6PD Mahidol (487GA) types, which are common in Cambodia and Myanmar, respectively, were detected. The Malay also had both subtypes of G6PD Mediterranean:the Mediterranean subtype (563CT, 1311CT, IVS11 nt93TC) and the Indo-Pakistan subtype (563CT, 1311C, IVS11 nt93T).

Indian Malaysians possessed G6PD Mediterranean (Indo-Pakistan subtype) and G6PD Namoru (208TC), a few cases of which had been reported in Vanuatu and many in India. Our findings indicate that G6PD Namoru occurs in India and flows to Malaysia up to Vanuatu. We also discovered 5 G6PD-deficient cases with 2 nucleotide substitutions of 1311CT and IVS11 nt93TC, but without amino-acid substitution in the G6PD molecule.

The term \"seasonal influenza\" refers to the typical increase in the number of influenza patients in the winter season in temperature zones. However, it is not clear how environmental factors within a single flu season affect influenza infection in a human population. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of temperature and humidity in the 2006-7 flu season on the onset of seasonal influenza using a case-crossover study. We targeted patients who attended one pediatric clinic in Okayama city, Japan and who were diagnosed as being infected with the seasonal influenza virus. Using 2 references (time-stratified and symmetric bidirectional design), we estimated the effects of average temperature and relative humidity from the onset day (lag0) to 10 days before (lag10). The total number of subjects was 419, and their onset days ranged from 26 December 2006 to 30 April 2007. While the onset was significantly associated with lower temperature, relative humidity was not related. In particular, temperatures before the 3-day incubation period had higher-magnitude odds ratios. For example, the odds ratio and 95% confidence interval for average temperature at time lag 8 was 1.12 (1.08-1.17) per 1.0℃ decrease. Low environmental temperature significantly increased the risk of seasonal influenza onset within the 2006-7 winter season.",

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer usually arises in middle-aged to older patients, and is rarely found in younger patients. The clin-ical characteristics, etiology, prognosis, preventive methods and treatment of gastric cancer in young patients have not been fully investigated because of its low prevalence. In this review, we discuss the current under-standing and clinical problems associated with gastric cancer in young patients. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), which is a major cause of gastric cancer, especially in older populations, is closely associated with gastric cancer in young patients as well as in older patients. Gastric cancer in young patients tends to be diagnosed at an advanced stage with alarm symptoms. However, young patients with advanced gastric cancer tend to have a favorable general condition and organ function, so they can tolerate intensive systematic chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the prognosis of gastric cancer in young patients with an advanced stage is not favorable. We should not take this rare disease lightly, given its poor prognosis if patients are diagnosed at an unresectable stage. The evaluation of the H. pylori infection status and performance of H. pylori eradication therapy to prevent gastric cancer in young patients as well as the development of more intensive chemotherapy regimens for unre-sectable gastric cancer in young patients are warranted.",

    "abstract": "The following conclusions were arrived at on the terminal distribution of the hepatic artery and its microscopical structures in the experiments conducted with the livers from human adult, fetus, dogs and toads, to which were given plastics, Indian ink and Indian-ink shock injections into their hepatic blood vessels. 1. There are arterial anastomotic networks of vasa vasorum in the portal\nwall. 2. The intralobular arterioles (Elias) and the extralobular arterioles (WEATHERFORD) often arise as direct branches without passing through the periductal arteriolar plexus. In the peripheral zone of the liver, this constitutes the main type of origin. 3. Besides the between the intralobular arterioles of the adjacent lobules (Fig. 5), the periductal arteriolar plexus of the bile ducts to the neighboring lobules are interconnected by arterial branches surrounding the interlobular vein (neighboring arteriolar anastomoses by the author) (Figs. 2, 5). 4. The terminal arterioles reveal a curve and an isthmus (Figs. 1, 3, 5), where they are supposed to have epithelioid cells in the media. 5. The hepatic vein wall is supplied by the branches of the internal thoracic and phrenic arteries. These anastomose with the interlobular arteries in the interdigitation area of vessels. 6. In the toad the terminal distribution is of a simpler form, in which the arterial capillaries, with an S or a parabolic curve, being constricted by the marginal hepatic cells, join the sinusoid in capillary form. 7. In human fetus of the middle stage (Figs. 6, 7), most of the terminal arterial capillaries open directly to the interlobular hemopoietic tissue, and from there the blood flows into the sinusoid. The precapillaries have an S curve and an isthmus, where they have 3 or 4 primordial epithelioid cells. In other portion, the precapillaries form endothelial canals with little adventitia and open infundibularly to the hemopoietic tissue. These have been proved by the Indian-ink shock injection method. 8. In the fetus of the later stage (Figs. 8-11), with the reduction of interlobular hemopoietic tissue, its arterial branches become fewer, and many branches are connected directly to the hepatic sinusoid. They form a sharper S curve and an isthmus, where 4 or 5 epithelioid cells are differentiated. The arterial terminal branches are precapillaries of endothelial canals having little adventitia and no media muscle. 9. The subcapsular branches of the peripheral interlobular arteries anastomose\nwith one another. Besides these, subcapsular branches come around the hilar region from the hepatic artery, furthermore some are derived from the biliary, inner thoracic, diaphragmatic, intercostal, subcostal, suprarenal\nand renal arteries. Anastomoses are found between all the subcapsular branches of different origins.",

The reaction of neotetrazolium reduction by tissue homogenate\nusing sodium succinate as substrate is mainly the succinoxidase system reaction; and the reaction takes place conjugating about 50 per cent in the step of the succinic dehydrogenase system (succinic dehydrogease, cytochrome b and cytochrome C1), of these about 15 per cent conjugates in the step prior to the antimycin A sensitive step and 35 per cent in the step itself; and about 50 per cent in the step of cytochrome c oxidase. 2. In the case using p-phenylenediamine as substrate the reaction of neotetrazolium reduction is the reaction due to the activity of cytochrome c-cytochrome oxidase system; and when p-phenylenediamine is used with the sufficient amount of cytochrome c, the reaction appears to be dependent on cytochrome c oxidase activity. Neotetrazolium reduction in all these reactions takes place conjugating in the step of cytochrome c oxidase. 3. In the case where DPN and substrates taking DPN as a coenzyme are used, the reaction of neotetrazolium reduction is mainly the reaction\nconjugating at the step below antimycin A sensitive step in the DPNHcytochrome c reductase system (flavoprotein, cytochrome b and cytochrome c;), probably with the flavoprotein of DPNH-dehydrogenase. 4. Endogenous dehydrogenase reactions are the sum total reactions conjugating at the steps prior to the antimycin A sensitive step in the terminal electron transport system and with other various reduction systems which are not inhibited by antimycin A.",

The swelling of rat liver mitochondria is induced by fatty acid. The extent of this uncoupling action is in the descending order of myristate, laurate, parlmitate, stearate and behenate in saturated fatty acid and linoleate, linoleneate, richinoleate and oleate in the unsaturated fatty acid. This swelling action is stronger with unsaturated fatty acids than that of saturated ones and cis form is stronger than trans form. 2. The uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation of rat liver mitochondria is also observed with these fatty acids and the activities are proportional to the degree of the swelling action. 3. The degree of swelling of rat liver mitochondria is proportional to the concentration of oleate and is inhibited by anaerobiosis and respiratory inhibitor except amytal. 4. The mitochondria swollen by fatty acid can be recontracted reversibly by ATP, Mg++ and bovine serum albumin. 5. The swelling action of sodium oleate is the strongest on mitochondria from rat liver, followed by those from the liver of Ehrlich ascites tumor bearing mouse, Ehrlich ascites tumor cells and solid Ehrlich tumor cells. 6. Sodium oleate inhibits the incorporation of 32p into ATP, ADP, GTP and UDPG in mitochondria.",

(2) The peculiarities of the vomitng volley consist in the simultaneous\ndischarges of both the inspiratory and the expiratory muscles, resulting in the so-called retching movement.\n(3) The vomiting volleys, in their rhythm, seem to arise independent of the respiratory center, but the former are capable of affecting the respiratory centers at any respiratory phase.

In this study, we analyze a database of personal and background characteristics of 824 cases (605 men, 219 women) who completed suicide in Okayama Prefecture in 2002 and 2003. The data were obtained with cooperation from the police. Using the methodologies in a previous European study as a model, we classified the suicide methods into 8 categories. To examine the generational and regional differences in the choice of methods, we stratified the sample into 4 age groups (< or =24, 25 approximately 44, 45 approximately 64, and > or =65) and 2 regional groups (Okayama/Kurashiki vs. other areas). Our results on gender differences in 7 of the suicide methods were mostly similar to the European data. However, our data showed a remarkably higher proportionate male-to-female mortality ratio for poisoning by other substances (ICD-10, X65-X69 codes) (1.83, 1.15-2.92). In terms of generational differences in the choice of suicide methods, the Mantel-Haenszel test of homogeneity was significant for most of the categories in our study, suggesting an impact of age on how people commit suicide. There were no remarkable regional differences in our sample. An epidemic curve for suicides via carbon monoxide poisoning using charcoal briquets revealed a trend of time clustering not observed in the other 6 means. The database constructed and used in this study contains richer information than conventional death statistics and is expected to provide helpful knowledge and insights for future epidemiological studies.",

    "abstract": "According to BUCHTHAL the histogram of duration and voltage from the motor unit of biceps brachii muscles gives only one peak respectively as can be seen in Fig. 14 in his paper which reports the data covering the experiment on 1,268 motor units. However, his histogram seems to be made of the spikes led off from several motor units because the histogram shows no much fluctuations in voltage as 50μV to 1,000μV and in duration as 1\nmsec to 20 msec. Therefore, if observations are actually based on a single motor unit, two peaks may reasonably be expected on the histogram, because two kinds of the motor units, kinetic (phasic) and tonic, have respective individual characteristics of their own shikes The histological observation shows that many white and red muscle fibers are intermingled with each other even in one single fasciculus, and it is supposed that the fasciculus does not correspond to a single motor unit. Moreover, the shape of the spikes, which was formerly considered as a motor unit, is not a pure diphasic form, but irregular and polyphasic ones, and also electromyographically a single motor unit controls the area of more than 10mm in width (BUCHTHAL). From these facts, it is probable that the histogram by BUCHTHAL was made of the spikes composed of muscle fibers belonging to several different motor units.\nOur observations done by the above stated method showed clearly the pure diphasic spikes. Therefore, we are of the opinion that these spikes obtained by our method are led off from only one or from a few muscle fibers belonging to the same motor unit. These spikes are lower than 550μV\nin voltage and shorter than 5.5 msec in duration and every individual spikes show uniform diphasic pattern. There exist two kinds of spike groups, in the histogram one which is composed of high voltage with short duration (1.0-1.5 msec.), and the other of low voltage with long duration\n(2.0-4.0msec.). The former may be of kinetic (phasic) motor unit and the latter is of tonic motor unit, because the white muscle fibers with a larger diameter may have a higher voltage than the red and the white fibers that perform rapid contraction may show shorter duration in wave form. In the two cases having spinal cord tumors, two kinds of spikes with respective and individual characteristics were observed in the same EMG. These will be two different kinds, kinetic (phasic) and tonic motor units. In the case of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, two kinds of spikes appeared, but since both of them were of short duration, they might be considered to be of kinetic (phasic) motor unit (or its intermediate motor unit). Furthermore, since its histological findings revealed that the red muscle fibers were all atrophied and degenerated and showd only white muscle fibers to be normal, it is obvious that the kinetic (phasic) motor unit with a shorter\nduration is derived from white muscle fibers. Therefore, in our opinion the widely accepted concept that spikes including even irregular wave forms all belong to the motor unit seems not to be true, but these spikes seem to represent a combination of several pure spikes though not so many, and those muscle fibers belonging to the same motor unit appear to be intermingling themselves in a relatively wide area. The reason for this contention may be explained as follows. If the muscle fibers belonging to the same motor unit were agglomerated, clearcut diphasic\nspikes should appear even with a fairly big electrode, and if the accepted concept be true, these spikes can never be picked up at the distance so far apart as 2.0cm. or 2.5cm. (0.5-1.2cm. by BUCHTHAL) as has been possible in our experiments. Furthermore, the histogram composed only of these pure spikes reveals two peaks, and therefore, we believe it is reasonable to say that these two peaks indicate the existence of kinetic (phasic) and tonic motor units. As a small number of motor units located in between these two peaks can be recognized, these are believed to be\nthe muscle fibers possessing an intermediate stainability as revealed in the histological examination. However, further studies are required before giving any definitive conclusion on this point.",

These drugs and a small dose of phenergan potentiated the inhibition by dextran of egg-white edema and inhibited the release of histamine by dextran. These actions lasted for\nover 24 hours with the exception of guaiazulene. 4. Irgapyrin and a large dose of phenergan, which possess actions of histamine release and of histamine release inhibition and also antihistaminic action, caused a slight reduction of skin histamine and a comparatively marked inhibition of the edema. 5. In adrenalectomized or hypophysectomized rats, the edema-inhibiting effect of salicylate and aminopyrine decreased but that of cortisone\nincreased. The effect of guaiazulene remained unchanged. 6. The observations that inhibition of egg-white edema is caused by (a) histamine releasers, (b) histamine-release inhibitor, and (c) drugs exerting both histamine release and inhibition of the release were discussed with the consideration to a relationship between egg-white edema and\nskin histamine.",

By compound 48/80, the rates were especially marked from the liver and muscle and only slight from the skin, while those by sinomenine, tween 20 and PVP were largest from the skin, followed by those from the liver and muscle, in that order. The rate of histamine release from the skin by PVP was characteristic in that it was far larger than that by other releasers. 3.

We found that several fluorescent dyes, including fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), Cy3 and Cy5, were resistant to heating at 90 degrees Celsius for 15 min, whereas the antigenicities of the primary antibodies were lost completely. This novel method, which uses heat treatment between staining steps, has great advantages for multicolor immunofluorescence because unlabeled primary antibodies from the same species can be used. Therefore, by using this method not only 3 unlabeled mouse monoclonal antibodies but also 3 unlabeled rabbit antisera can be used as primary antibodies for multicolor immunofluorescence.",

This study further examines limb load asymmetries during quiet bipedal stance. During voluntary frontal-plane weight shifting for 2 min, 300 centre-of-pressure displacements on 14 blindfolded right-handed young adults were recorded. Four biomechanical indices were used to assess postural behaviour. These were the bias of time and the magnitude of the partial ground reaction forces from both legs, and the bias in the number and magnitude of microshifts influencing stability. Our study identifies a significant level of asymmetry in the quiet bipedal stance of right-handed people. This asymmetry is associated with the right-sided bias of the ground reaction force and the angle of inclination to the upright (vertical) centroidal line. We found that the initial lateralisation of the partial ground reaction forces from both feet, as well as the period of ground reaction force bias, are important elements in any clinical tests involving quiet bipedal stance.",

We developed a newly kind of flap for vaginoplasty, the M-shaped perineo-scrotal flap (M-shaped flap), using skin from both sides of the scrotum, shorn of hair by preoperative laser treatment. We applied this new type of flap in 7 MTFTS patients between January 2006 and January 2007. None of the flaps developed necrosis, and the patients could engage in sexual activity within 3 months of the operation. The M-shaped flap has numerous advantages: it can be elevated safely while retaining good vascularity, it provides for the construction of a sufficient deep vagina without a skin graft, the size of the flap is not influenced entirely by the length of the penis, and it utilizes skin from both sides of the scrotal area, which is usually excised.",

A 57-year-old Japanese man had been followed up for 2 years because of diabetic nephropathy and sarcoidosis. On admission for pneumonia, imaging studies revealed an unexpected hepatic tumor. Histology revealed a hepatocellular carcinoma accompanied by T-lymphocytic infiltration and marked granulomatous inflammation, which was surrounding some tumor nodules. The background liver parenchyma exhibited a moderate degree of fibrosis with granulomatous inflammation. The patient had no other apparent liver disease such as viral hepatitis, steatohepatitis, or primary biliary cirrhosis.

He called this, of spasm and reported that it spreads according to the arrangement of motor representations in Rolando's area of the cerebral cortex. Since then, many important studies concerning the cerebral motor cortex were performed and reported. Recently, when Erickson had brought out a method in measuring electroencephalographic waves, Jackson's theory has been acknowledged. In Japan, Hayashi and his school has made an extensive study on epileptic convulsion. They used nicotine, cardiazol and others as chemical stimulations and decided the conduction tract of epileptic convulsion in dogs. The characteristic part of chemical stimulation is that, the nelve cells excite themselves when it is injected directly among them in certain concentrations and do not excite themselves when performed among nerve fibers. This was proved by Ishizuka. We used this method in dogs to see what was the mechanism of this phenomenon, which is seen in epileptic convulsions and what tracts they took for conduction. And as its result, we found new facts that the presence of the motor cortex was needed for the march of spasm, and the conduction tract descending from the lenticular nucleus were quite different from Hayashi and his school had previously reported.",

In the present studies, we examined the behavioral changes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, and investigated the effects of physical and psychological stress on the hippocampal BDNF levels and on the serotonin 2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor-mediated wet-dog shake responses. The streptozotocin (60 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced diabetes had no significant effects on the immobility time in the forced swim test or on locomotor activity in the open-field test. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the wet-dog shake responses induced by DOI, a 5-HT(2A) receptor agonist, between nondiabetic and diabetic rats. Five-day exposure to physical (electric footshock) and psychological (non-footshock) stress had no significant effect on the hippocampal BDNF level in diabetic or nondiabetic rats. The 2 types of stress had no significant effect on the DOI-induced wet-dog shake responses in nondiabetic rats. In diabetic rats, the repeated exposure to physical stress markedly increased the DOI-induced wet-dog shake responses, but the repeated exposure to psychological stress had no effect. These results suggest that exposure to physical stress augmented the susceptibility to the wet-dog shake responses to 5-HT(2A) receptor stimulation in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.",

However, how NMDA receptor activation differs between LTP and LTD induction is unclear. In the present study, we examined the effects of the magnitude and duration of NMDA receptor activation on the induction of LTP and LTD. Partial blockage of NMDA receptors by a low concentration of aminophosphonovaleric acid (APV) (2 microM) prevented the induction of LTP, but not LTD. In contrast, a high concentration of APV (25 microM) blocked both LTP and LTD. Tetanus stimulation-induced LTP was impaired when hippocampal slices were given the tetanus stimulation for more than 5 min. Under partial blockage of NMDA receptors, the prolonged-tetanus stimulation induced LTD but not LTP. This phenomenon was mimicked by the application of glutamate to the slices. Finally, LTD induced by prolonged activation of NMDA receptors was not affected by inhibition of the desensitization of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors. These results suggest that critical differences exist between the induction of LTP and that of LTD in terms of both the magnitude and the duration of NMDA receptor activation. The duration of the increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration may be critical for determining whether LTP or LTD induction occurs.",

The mosquito produces a vaccine protein in the salivary gland (SG) and deposits the protein into the host's skin when it takes the host's blood. We chose circumsporozoite protein (CSP), currently the most promising malaria vaccine candidate, to be expressed in the SG of Anopheles stephensi. To transform the mosquitoes, plasmid containing the CSP gene under the promoter of female SG-specific gene, as well as the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene under the promoter of 3xP3 as a selection marker in the eyes, was injected into more than 400 eggs. As a result, five strains of GFP-expressing mosquitoes were established, and successful CSP expression in the SG was confirmed in one strain. The estimated amount of CSP in the SG of the strain was 40 ng per mosquito. We allowed the CSP-expressing mosquitoes to feed on mice to induce the production of anti-CSP antibody. However, the mice did not develop anti-CSP antibody even after transgenic mosquitoes had bitten them several times. We consider that CSP in the SG was not secreted properly into the saliva. Further techniques and trials are required in order to realize vaccine-delivering mosquitoes.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a field survey of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenese (G6PD) deficiency in the eastern Indonesian islands, and analyzed G6PD variants molecularly. The incidence of G6PD deficiency in 5 ethnic groups (Manggarai, Bajawa, Nage-Keo, Larantuka, and Palue) on the Flores and Palue Islands was lower than that of another native group, Sikka, or a nonnative group, Riung. Molecular analysis of G6PD variants indicated that 19 cases in Sikka had a frequency distribution of G6PD variants similar to those in our previous studies, while 8 cases in Riung had a different frequency distribution of G6PD variants. On the other hand, from field surveys in another 8 ethnic groups (Timorese, Sumbanese, Savunese, Kendari, Buton, Muna, Minahasa, and Sangirese) on the islands of West Timor, Sumba, Sulawesi, Muna and Bangka, a total of 49 deficient cases were detected. Thirty-nine of these 49 cases had G6PD Vanua Lava (383T＞C) of Melanesian origin. In our previous studies, many cases of G6PD Vanua Lava were found on other eastern Indonesian islands. Taken together, these findings may indicate that G6PD Vanua Lava is the most common variant in eastern Indonesian populations, except for Sikka.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the carotid arterial intima-media thickness (IMT) and its relation to clinical parameters in Japanese children. Fifty-two healthy children (39 boys and 13 girls), aged 6-14 years, were enrolled in this cross-sectional investigation study. IMT of the common carotid artery was determined using ultrasonography. We also investigated anthropometric parameters, blood pressure (BP), lifestyles and blood examinations. The mean value of IMT was 0.4 ± 0.1mm, which was lower than the normal value (1.0mm) in adults. IMT was positively correlated with age (r=0.340) and height (r=0.346) in boys, while it was positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) (r=0.584) and diastolic BP (DBP) (r=0.563) in girls. In addition, IMT was associated with sleeping hours and hours of watching television (TV) by using stepwise regression analysis. In conclusion, IMT increased with aging, and it was linked to some clinical parameters of atherosclerosis and lifestyles in children. Therefore, this reference data will be helpful for future assessment of age-related change in Japanese children in clinical practice, and IMT might be a good predictor of atherosclerosis in Japanese children.",

STAT6 nuclear stain is approved as a highly sensitive and specific marker to diagnose SFT/HPC from other tumors with similar histology. As the next step, detection of fusion variants that may predict clinical malignancy of SFT/HPC has been attempted. However, no fusion variants with a clear relation to malignancy have been identified. In this study, the clinical and histological backgrounds of 23 Japanese patients diagnosed with SFT/HPC from 2000 to 2019 at Kochi University Hospital were examined to identify factors potentially related to recurrence. A significant relationship to recurrence was detected for mitosis ≥ 1/10 HPF (400×), necrosis, and Ki-67>5%. These findings indicate that a deliberate investigation of histological features such as mitosis and necrosis is crucial for the clinical observation of SFT/ HPC patients. In addition, Ki-67 was revealed to be a useful parameter to predict recurrence in SFT/HPC patients.",

Effects of various kinds of adequate stimuli such as touching, pinching, heating and cooling to various skin areas as well as repetitive electrical stimulations to a nerve branch innervating the skin areas upon the unitary discharges of the expiratory or the inspiratory muscle units of the intercostal muscles were studied on the spinal dogs. Effects of pinching upon the intercostal nerve action potentials elicited in reflex by single\nelectrical shock to the adjacent intercostal nerve were also studied. 2. Excitatory skin area for the expiratory discharges roughly exhibits a triangle, one of whose vertex faces the sternum, the side against the vertex corresponds to the apical line of the spine and includes the spot from where the discharges of a muscle unit are led off. The triangular area is surrounded by a belt-shaped zone having no reflex response. All the other wide area is the inhibitory one. 3. Both the excitatory and the inhibitory skin areas for the discharges of the inspiratory muscle unit are exceedingly narrow in contrast to those for the expiratory discharge, having a tendency to be limited to the small localized area involving the spot from where the discharges are led off. In the other extensive area, however, any reflex effect is not provoked.\n4. The more intense and noxious the adequate stimuli become, the more prominent the effect come to be. 5. When the repetitive electrical stimuli to the skin nerve innervating the excitatory area are weak in intensity or low in frequency, an increasing discharge of the respiratory muscle unit results, whereas when the stimuli are sufficiently raised in either of the two factors above described, a remarkable inhibition preceded by a momentary acceleration ensues. In the case of stimulation of the skin nerve innervating the inhibitory area, however, the inhibition alone is obtained throughout.\n6. Reflex action potentials in the intercostal nerve elicited by single shock stimuli to the adjacent intercostal nerve show a shortening of latency and an increase in size by pinching the excitatory skin area, while the reverse effects to those above described are obtained by pinching the inhibitory one.",

It is well known that tight regulation of glucose metabolism is essential for successful gestational outcomes (e.g. fetal growth), and that abnormal insulin resistance is associated with preeclampsia (PE). To investigate the possibility that CNTF might be involved in the regulation of insulin resistance during pregnancy, circulating levels of CNTF were assessed in non-pregnant, normal pregnant, postpartum, and pregnant women with PE. Sera from healthy non-pregnant women (n = 10), pregnant women (n = 30:1st trimester; n = 10, 2nd trimester n = 10; 3rd trimester; n = 10), postpartum women (n = 10), and patients with PE (n = 11) were studied with Western blotting. Circulating CNTF was detected by Western blotting, and the levels of CNTF in pregnant women were decreased as compared with those in non-pregnant women, and tended to decrease as pregnancy progressed. A significant decrease was found in PE as compared with normal pregnancy. Circulating CNTF might be associated with physiological and abnormal insulin resistance during pregnancy.",

Habits of cigarette smoking were obtained during interviews by well-trained staff. The influence of cigarette smoking on eGFR was evaluated. In the first analysis, there was no significant difference in eGFR between subjects with and without cigarette smoking. In the second analysis, eGFR was significantly reduced after 5 years in all subjects. Changes in eGFR in subjects with cigarette smoking (-1.90±12.31 ml/min/1.73 m²) were significantly smaller than those in subjects without cigarette smoking (-4.97±12.05 ml/min/1.73 m²). At follow-up, we found that eGFR was weakly and negatively correlated with the number of cigarettes smoked (/day).

This study proposes a novel method for estimating carrying angles using computed tomography that can enhance the reliability of the angle measurement. Data of CT scans from 25 elbow joints were processed to build segmented three-dimensional models. The cross-sectional centerlines of the ulna and the humerus were traced from the 3D models, and the angle between 2 vectors formed from the centerlines of the humerus and the ulna was defined as the \"three-dimensional carrying angle.\" These angles were compared with those measured by simple radiograph. Two cases of angular deformity were underwent surgery based on this preoperative surgical planning, and the postoperative 3D carrying angles were evaluated using the proposed method. The mean value of the calculated three-dimensional carrying angle was 20.7 degrees +/-3.61, while it was 16.3 degrees +/-3.21 based on simple radiography without statistical difference. Based on the 3D carrying angle estimations, 2 surgical cases of cubitus deformities were planned by comparison with the normal contra-lateral elbow. Postoperative angle estimations confirmed that the corrected angles were nearly identical to the planned angles for both cases. The results of this study showed that the carrying angle can be accurately estimated using three-dimensional CT and that the proposed method is useful in evaluating deformities of the elbow with high reliability.",

The patient's symptoms improved with anticoagulant treatment. Antiphospholipid syndrome with elevated serum anticardiolipin IgG levels was diagnosed, and ischemic peripheral polyneuropathy with axonal degeneration was determined by sural nerve biopsy. In antiphospholipid syndrome, elevated anticardiolipin antibodies appear to be the most common acquired blood protein defect causing thrombosis. Disseminated vascular thrombosis in catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome can result in multiorgan failure with increased morbidity and mortality. It rarely occurs secondary to various infections as in the case of our patient, who suffered postoperative intraabdominal infection.

    "abstract": "Antithrombotic therapy is a major risk factor for delayed bleeding after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for gastric neoplasia. A potassium-competitive acid blocker, vonoprazan, is expected to prevent delayed bleeding better than conventional proton pomp inhibitors (PPIs), but the evidence is controversial. We sought to clarify the efficacy of vonoprazan for prevention of delayed bleeding after gastric ESD in patients under antithrombotic therapy. We prospectively registered 50 patients who underwent gastric ESD while receiving antithrombotic therapy and vonoprazan in our institution between October 2017 and September 2018. The incidence of delayed bleeding was compared with that in a historical control group of 116 patients treated with conventional PPI. We also evaluated risk factors associated with delayed bleeding. Delayed bleeding was observed in 8 of 50 patients (16.0%), which was not dissimilar from the incidence in the historical control group (12.1%) (p=0.49). In the univariate analysis, age (> 70 years) (p=0.034), multiple antithrombotic drug use (p<0.01), procedure time (> 200 min) (p=0.038) and tumor size (> 40 mm) (p<0.01) were associated with delayed bleeding after gastric ESD, but vonoprazan was not (p=0.49). Vonoprazan may not be more effective than conventional PPIs in preventing delayed bleeding after gastric ESD in patients receiving antithrombotic therapy.",

The movements of the stomach, small intestine, and proximal colon are always inhibited by the distension or the contracture of the muscular coats of the small intestine but no responses are produced by a mechanical or chemical stimulation of the mucosa; and those of the distal\ncolon are in most cases also inhibited, whereas in rare instances are they augmented. 2. The afferent impulses are transmitted through the great and small splanchnic nerves and the lumbar sympathetic nerves to the inhibitory as\nwell as the excitatory (pelvic nuclei) centers of the intestinal movements located within the spinal cord, whereas the vagal nuclei remain unaffected. The efferent impulses are transmitted through the thoraco-lumbar sympathetic nerves as well as through the pelvic nerves. The latter are involved in the augmentative effect produced in the distal colon. 3. The threshold producing the extrinsic muscular reflex is higher than that eliciting the intrinsic muscular reflex.",

Patients received a daily dose of 560 mg ECT in combination with 1.2 g/m2 IFM on days 1 to 5 and 70 mg/m2 CDDP on day 1. This combination therapy was given every 3 to 4 weeks. An objective response of more than 50% reduction in prostate-specific antigen was observed in 9 of 18 patients (50%), and a more than 50% reduction in bi-dimensionally measurable soft-tissue lesions was observed in 2 of 7 patients (29%). The median duration of response among the cases showing partial response was 40 weeks, while the median duration of response of overall partial-response plus stable cases was 30 weeks. The median survival duration of all cases was 47 weeks. Toxicity was modest and acceptable. In conclusion, the ECT, IFM and CDDP combination chemotherapy regimen is a viable treatment option for HRPC. However, in comparison with our previous chemotherapy regimen of IFM and CDDP, no additional long-lasting effects resulting from the inclusion of ECT could be affirmed.",

Cell apoptosis was detected by Annexin V-propidium iodide (PI) staining. The DNA-binding activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Results showed that 7-KC-stimulation in J774A.1 cells activated NF-kappaB, which is involved in cell apoptosis, in a time- and dose-dependent manners. 7-KC was also found to increase the binding activity of NF-kappaB to specific DNA binding sites, a possible mechanism for the induction of the cell apoptosis. Moreover, these effects were partially inhibited by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an NF-kappaB inhibitor. Taken together, 7-KC may be an important factor in atherosclerosis due to the ability of 7-KC to induce cell apoptosis, which is at least partially mediated through the activation of NF-kappaB.",

By the classification of the World Health Organization, this patient was categorized as class I (very severe G6PD deficiency). When we investigated the G6PD gene of the patient, we found that he had a replacement of G to A at nucleotide 1339. As a result, the amino acid at position 447 should change from Gly to Arg. This replacement is known as G6PD Santiago de Cuba, because it was first discovered in a Cuban boy who showed heavy chronic anemia. Today, 28 G6PD variants have been reported in the Chinese population, and all are categorized as class II (severe deficiency) or class III (mild deficiency); in class II or III deficiency, anemia is not present in daily life, but hemolytic attack can occur when the carrier ingests certain oxidative medicines or foods. This is the first report of a G6PD-deficient Chinese patient in the category of class I. We intended to find other G6PD-deficient cases in northeastern China and tested several hundred blood samples, but no cases of G6PD deficiency were found (0/414). In central China, where falciparum malaria was endemic from the 1950s to 1970s, we found two G6PD-deficient cases (2/27) and the other members from their families whose variant type was G6PD Kaiping (1388G > T), which is a common variant in the Chinese population.",

Subcutaneous or intraperitoneal administration of carbon tetrachloride to the mouse produced a significant increase in the liver glucuronyl transferase activity 12 or 24 hours after the treatment regardless of histological and enzymatic evidences of liver-cell necrosis. This increase was not attributed to the increase in the 'activator' of glucuronide formation but to the increase in the enzyme activity itself. 2. In Ectromelia virus mouse hepatitis, the glucuronyl transferase activity of the liver tissue was markedly reduced in severe cases. In moderate or milder cases, a slight increase in the activity was observed in a few of them in the early stage of the disease, and the activity was significantly decreased on the recovery in all of the cases which survived. 3. In the early stage of carbon tetrachloride injury when the glucuronyl transferase activity of whole mouse liver was increased and the decomposition of uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid by the liver tissue was also enhanced, the glucuronide formation in vivo was rather increased. It was thus considered that the whole liver glucuronyl transferase activity rather than the uridine diphosphate glucuronic acid content was responsible for the glucuronide formation in vivo as a rate-limiting factor.",

Here, we report a case of an ALT of the tongue, with a review of the literature. A 68-year-old man was referred to our hospital because of a tumor on the left side of his tongue. Upon palpation, the tumor was 12mm in diameter, circumscribed, elastic and hard, well demarcated, movable, and painless. We diagnosed the lesion as a lipoma and extirpated the tumor under local anesthesia. Because the specimen was histopathologically diagnosed as an ALT, as a precaution, we excised an additional 5mm from the area surrounding the original tumor under general anesthesia. Three years after the operation, the tongue demonstrated good healing without paresthesia or dysfunction, and to date there has been no evidence of recurrence.",

And the data were compared with those reported in the first report. In the normal liver histochemically demonstrable cytochrome c oxidase\nactivity and succinic dehydrogenase activity can be seen in parenchymal cells. In both cases the cells lying in the peripheral area show a more intense activities than those in the central part of liver lobules. The activity of cytochrome c oxidase falls markedly 5 to 6 hours after the CCl4, administration, while the activity of succinic dehydrogenase is retained almost at normal level for about\n20 hours. Quantitative estimation of the succinic dehydrogenase activity of tissue\nhomogenate revealed a transient rise in the activity 90 minutes after the CCl4, administration, and thereafter the values have been kept in almost normal level by 20 hours though a gradually fall has been seen in this period with a marked degree at 22nd hour. Taking the changes of minute structure occurring at each stage into consideration,\nwhich have been reported in the previous paper, the author concludes that the activity of succinic dehydrogenase is closely correlated with the maintenance of double membraneous structure of mitochondria, but the activity of\ncytochrome c oxidase is reduced by the swelling of mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "From these experimental results, the author has reached the following conclusion: The choroid possesses abundant blood vessels, and inasmuch as they carry a large amount of blood on account of their large tubular space, they\nalso have such structural formation as to enable their distension or contraction greatly to influence the volume of intraocular contents. Moreover, as the autonomic nerves distributed in the eye are connected with the wall of vessels in a compact network of nerve fibers, the width of the choroidal vessel can be regulated by the autonomic center ; and thus the intraocular pressure seems to be regulated by an increase or a decrease in the amount of intraocular circulating blood. On the other hand, the\nciliary body likewise seems to take a part in the adjustment of the eyepressure as the width of vessels, the permeability of blood vessel walls, and the aqueous production are all controlled by the autonomic nerve,\nand because the contraction of ciliary muscles, as already mentioned, also exerts a great influence on the intraocular pressure. Therefore, the author believes that a regional adjustment of eye pressure is being performed by these mechanisms, working as they are in conjunction with each other, and maintaining a harmonious relation among themselves under the control of the autonomic center.",

In rats injected with aminoguanidine, the skin and local histamine contents increased in similar degree as those in rats receiving histamine injection, but the inflammatory tissue reactions were severer than in the control. The total histamine of the pouch wall during inflammation reached the maximum four days after the injection of croton oil and decreased thereaftcr. The prcliferative processes indicating the recovery of injured tissues in later stages of the inflammation were the most vigorous in rats treated with histamine and this was in contrast to the extreme weakness of this tendency in animals in which the local histamine had been depleted. These observations not only suggests the fairly close relationship of histamine to carly reaction of inflammation but also indicates the role of histamine in its recovery processes.",

    "abstract": "Protein transduction therapy using poly-arginine peptide can deliver the biologically active proteins. A previous study showed that 11 poly-arginine fused p53 protein (11R-p53) effectively penetrated across the plasma membrane and inhibited the proliferation of oral cancer cells. However, the intracellular half-life of the delivered protein was less than 36 h. Previous studies also showed that 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME), an endogenous non-toxic estrogenic metabolite, induces the stabilization of the wild-type p53 protein in human cancer cells posttranscriptionally. In the present study, we examined whether 2-ME induced the stabilization of 11R-p53 and had an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of oral cancer cells. The application of 2-ME significantly enhanced the inhibitory effect of 11R-p53 on the proliferation of oral cancer cells. However, 2-ME had no effect on the intracellular half-life of 11R-p53 in oral cancer cells. Of interest is the finding that 2-ME suppressed the transcriptional activity of NFkappaB, which has an important role in tumorigenesis, but did not affect p53 transcriptional activity. These results suggest that 2-ME synergistically enhances the 11R-p53-induced inhibition of the proliferation of oral cancer cells through the suppression of NFkB transcription.",

    "abstract": "The process of hemoglobin sythesis in erythroid cells have been traced mainly by observing cells under the light of 4,060 A. To scrutinize the theory of hemoglobin synthesis in the nucleus of erythroblasts, several\ncytochemical and morphological observations were also carried out. The conclusions derived from them are as follows: 1 The absorption at 4,060 A of the cell, which indicates the location of heme, appeared in the nucleus as early as in the develpmental stage of basophilic erythroblasts. The absorption of hcme in cytoplasm likewise appeared in this stage showing nearly the same intensity of the absorption. The absorption picture of heme in the nucleus, which is coincidental\nwith that of interchromatin, increased along with the progess of maturation as well as in the cytoplasm. The absorption in the nucleus disappeared at the orthochromatic stage where the picture of interchromatin\ndisappeared, while the intensity of absorption in the cytoplasm continued to increase till the stage of reticulocyte. 2 The pseudoperoxidase reaction of hemoglobin, the appearance of acidophlic protein and masked lipids detectable in the location of hemoglobin\ngave an exactly identical picture with that of the absorption of heme in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm. 3 Permeability test performed by supravital staining with Nile blue revealed that the nucleus of erythroblasts from the basophilic to the orthorchromatic\nstages has increased its permeability being stained selectively as in the case of dead cells. 4 The mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum proved to be\nretained well in the entire course of hemoglobin synthesis, even after the denucleation, the reticulocyte stage. From these observations the authors believe that the hemoglobin syntheis will take place in the cytoplasm throughout the life cycle of erythroid cells, pointing out that the absorption picturebf heme appearing in the nucleus will be in all likelihood due to the infusion of the hemoglobin from the cytoplasm.",

    "abstract": "Histopathological investigations were carried out on five fatal cases of a type of polyneuritis of unknown etiology diagnosed as Landry-Guillain-Barre syndrome, which endemically occurred in children in the regions surrounding the Inland Sea of Japan. The most characteristic pathologic feature in the nervous system was pronounced patchy degenerative changes with slight or moderate degree of inflammatory cell response of focal type\nin the peripheral and cranial nerves, predominantly in the nerve fibers of the spinal and cranial roots. In the spinal cord, medulla, pons, and in some portions of the cerebrum and cerebellum, engorgement of the small blood vessels as well as edema and the less predominant scattered degenerative changes of ganglioncells\nand nerve fibers with extremely slight degree of glial response and sparse perivascular cell collections were encountered. The cerebrospinal meninges displayed edema and congestion of the pial blood vessels with focal collections of a small number of lymphocytes and/or monocytes. No advanced involvement of the anterior horn of the spinal cord in a strict sense of anterior poliomyelitis was, however, recognized. These changes may\nlead the histopathologic diagnosis of the present disease to infectious encephalomyelo-polyradiculoneuritis or a type of infectious polyneuritis. The main histopathologic changes in the visceral organs were a moderate degree of engorgement of the small blood vessels, degeneration of parencymatous organs such as the liver and kidney, hyperplasia or follicular atrophy of the lymphatic\ntissues, interalveolar pneumonia, focal myositis, and slight degree of round cell infiltrations in the interstitial tissues of the other viscera, such as the liver, heart, and gastrointestinal canal. Based upon the observations on the histopathological changes as well as clinical manifestations, discussions were made on\nthe pathogenesis and etiologic factor of the present endemic disease with critique on the literatures.",

The following induced hepatic hemodynamic changes are suggested: hepatic arterial flow increases, and the portal vein acts as a draining vein with slow reversed flow. These unique hemodynamic changes enhance the effect of hepatic interventional therapies. In transcatheter arterial infusion, increasing hepatic arterial flow and absence of portal inflow can bring about a high concentration of drugs, the presence of which is greatly protracted due to outflow blockage. In transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, reversed portal flow can allow portal embolization in addition to arterial embolization. In microwave coagulation therapy and radiofrequency ablation therapy, decreasing portal flow can cause larger areas of coagulation. Further, the technique of hepatic venous occlusion has potential therapeutic applications.",

Dkk3/REIC is expressed by mouse and human adrenal glands, but the understanding of its roles in this organ is still limited. To determine the functions of Dkk3 in the mouse adrenal gland, we first identified that the mouse Dkk3 protein is N-glycosylated in the adrenal gland as well as in the brain. We performed proteome analysis on adrenal glands from Dkk3-null mice, in which exons 5 and 6 of the Dkk3 gene are deleted. Twodimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of adrenal proteins from wild-type and Dkk3-null mice revealed 5 protein spots whose intensities were altered between the 2 genotypes. Mass spectrometry analysis of these spots identified binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone. To determine whether mouse Dkk3 is involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR), we carried out a reporter assay using ER-stress responsive elements. Forced expression of Dkk3 resulted in the induction of distinct levels of reporter expression, showing the UPR initiated by the ER membrane proteins of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and inositol-requring enzyme 1 (IRE1). Thus, it is possible that Dkk3 is a physiological ER stressor in the mouse adrenal gland.",

The detailed mechanism of action of ketamine in treatment-resistant depression remains unclear. We examined the effects of ketamine on the immobility times of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-treated rats during the forced swim test, and we explored the mechanism by which ketamine acts in this model. We investigated the neuroanatomical site of action by microinjecting ketamine into the medial prefrontal cortex of rats. A significant reduction of the rats’ immobility during the forced swim test was observed after the intraperitoneal injection of ketamine in both saline- and ACTH-treated rats. The microinjection of ketamine into the medial prefrontal cortex also decreased immobility during the forced swim test in both saline- and ACTH-treated rats. The immobility-decreasing effect of intraperitoneally injected ketamine was blocked by administering WAY100635, a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, into the medial prefrontal cortex. These findings contribute to the evidence that ketamine can be useful against treatment-resistant depressive conditions. The immobility-reducing effects of ketamine might be mediated by 5-HT1A receptor activity in the medial prefrontal cortex.",

Thoracoscopic examination revealed a swollen LN posterior to the descending aorta. Fat and metastatic LNs posterior to the aorta were dissected from the aortic arch level to the diaphragm while preserving intercostal arteries. For the right-side approach, two working ports were inserted and a routine thoracoscopic esophagec-tomy was performed. Gastric conduit reconstruction was achieved laparoscopically.

There are several surgical options for approaching No. 112aoP, including transhiatal, left thora-cotomy, and thoracoscopy. Although a wide dissection of the posterior thoracic para-aortic area has not been reported, it may be feasible and safe if the artery of Adamkiewicz and intercostal arteries are preserved. A min-imally invasive bilateral thoracoscopic approach for a thoracoscopic esophagectomy is safe and useful for esophageal cancer patients with solitary No. 112aoP metastasis.",

To investigate whether ND2-237 Leu/Met polymorphism is associated with yearly changes in serum lipid levels, we conducted a longitudinal study of 107 healthy Japanese male subjects. Analysis of covariance revealed that the interaction between the ND2-237 Leu/Met genotypes and habitual drinking was significantly associated with yearly changes in serum total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) levels (p=0.036 and p=0.006, respectively). In multiple regression analysis, daily drinking was significantly and positively associated with yearly changes in serum LDLC levels in men with ND2-237Met (p=0.026). After adjusting for covariates, yearly changes in serum LDLC levels were significantly lower in non-daily drinkers with ND2-237Met than in those with ND2-237Leu (p=0.047).

    "abstract": "To investigate the effect of exclusive breastfeeding on the likelihood of Japanese preschool children being overweight, population-based cross-sectional survey data from M town in Japan were used. Using the population registry of this town, all 616 preschool children were identified, and a self-administered questionnaire was sent to their parents. The exposure variable of interest was exclusive breastfeeding from birth to 6 months, and the outcome variable of interest was the children being overweight at preschool age. Statistical analyses used included logistic regression and sensitivity analyses. In the final analyses, we included 448 preschool children. Although all point estimates indicated a protective effect, logistic regression analyses showed no significant reduction in being overweight due to exclusive breastfeeding in the unadjusted model (odds ratio (OR)0.70, 95% confidence intervals:0.30-1.64), the model adjusted for birth weight (OR0.70, 95% CI:0.30-1.63), the model adjusted for child lifestyle (OR0.71, 95% CI:0.30-1.67), or the model adjusted for parental factors (OR0.46, 95% CI:0.15-1.37). In sensitivity analyses, point estimates were not significant, but a protective effect was observed. In conclusion, our results suggest that breastfeeding might have a protective effect on Japanese preschool children against being overweight, although statistical significance was not observed due to the limitation of the statistical power of the findings.",

For comparison, the same parameters were also investigated in 10 cancer patients not undergoing dialysis. Items investigated included (1) plasma concentrations of SN-38, SN-38G and CPT-11 at 0, 1, 12, 24, 36, 48 and 72 h after administration, together with a comparison of mean AUC values for 3 dose levels of CPT-11 (50, 60 and 70 mg/m2) in dialysis patients and controls; and (2) occurrence of adverse events. Several findings emerged from this study: (1) No significant difference was observed in the AUC for SN-38 or CPT-11 between the dialysis and control groups; (2) The AUC for SN-38G at each dose was significantly higher in dialysis patients; and (3) Grade 1-4 leucopenia was observed in 11 of the dialysis patients. One patient developed grade 4 leucopenia and died due to sepsis. Anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, alopecia and interstitial pneumonia occurred in 6 dialysis patients. We found changes in drug dispositions of CPT-11, SN-38 and SN-38G in dialysis patients, suggesting that hepatic excretion, especially that of SN-38G, was increased. No significant difference in occurrence of adverse events was observed between the 2 groups. This indicates that CPT-11 can be administered safely in patients on dialysis.",

An electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that Sp1/Sp3 and CBF/NF-Y bound to a GC-rich domain (194/186) and a CCAAT box (134/130) in the Col5a3 gene, respectively. Introduction of mutations or deletion into a GC-rich domain, the CCAAT box, or both elements decreased the transcription activity. Overexpression of Sp1 increases the transcription activity and interferes with Sp family binding to the GC-rich domain to decrease promoter activity. Therefore, the transcription of the mouse Col5a3 gene is cooperatively regulated by Sp1 and CBF/NF-Y in osteoblastic cells.",

We explored how patients with mild dementia in Taiwan may still make self-determined decisions concerning advance directives for their healthcare and end-of-life care choices as the disease progresses. We examined 260 respondents with mild dementia at a Taiwan medical center: 199 patients who agreed (and 61 patients who disagreed) with the concept of advance directives completed a structured questionnaire. Multiple logistic regression models to determine the between-group differences revealed that the following were positively associated with approval of end-of-life directives: maintaining one's quality of life (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.44; 95% CI: 1.07-5.53), discussion with family members (AOR, 3.50; 95% CI: 1.49-8.26), and friend support networks (AOR, 3.36; 95% CI: 1.34-8.43). Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (AOR, 0.27; 95% CI: 0.09-0.79) was negatively associated with approval. There was also a positive association between the support of the legal validity of end-of-life directives (OR, 1.93; 95% CI: 1.07-3.48), without other confounding factors. In Taiwanese society, we remain mindful of cultural influences that may impact patients, including maintaining one's quality of life, discussion with family members, and friend/support networks. These influences may help dementia patients complete their advance directives.",

In the Contra group, the concordance rate between the first and second types of hip fracture was 65.2%, and the second hip fracture's morphology indicated that the trochanteric fracture had a cam deformity in terms of the femoral head-neck ratio.

And the data were compared with those reported in the first report. In the normal liver histochemically demonstrable cytochrome c oxidase\nactivity and succinic dehydrogenase activity can be seen in parenchymal cells. In both cases the cells lying in the peripheral area show a more intense activities than those in the central part of liver lobules. The activity of cytochrome c oxidase falls markedly 5 to 6 hours after the CCl4, administration, while the activity of succinic dehydrogenase is retained almost at normal level for about\n20 hours. Quantitative estimation of the succinic dehydrogenase activity of tissue\nhomogenate revealed a transient rise in the activity 90 minutes after the CCl4, administration, and thereafter the values have been kept in almost normal level by 20 hours though a gradually fall has been seen in this period with a marked degree at 22nd hour. Taking the changes of minute structure occurring at each stage into consideration,\nwhich have been reported in the previous paper, the author concludes that the activity of succinic dehydrogenase is closely correlated with the maintenance of double membraneous structure of mitochondria, but the activity of\ncytochrome c oxidase is reduced by the swelling of mitochondria.",

The survey containing 22 items concerning matters such as 'QOL' and 'health problems' was posted to parents and guardians in advance, and then collected on the day of the medical check-up. The collected data was analysed using the t-test and Pearson's correlation coefficient, following which we conducted a covariance structure analysis. The results showed that dental health behaviour was directly affected by reinforcing factors, and indirectly associated with enabling and predisposing factors influenced by reinforcing factors. It was also shown that predisposing factors and oral health behaviour were associated with attendance at scheduled oral health check-ups. The results indicated that strengthening oral health education by sharing knowledge that acts as predisposing factors and introducing adaptations of oral health behaviour that that fit individual lives will lead to improved attendance at scheduled dental health check-ups.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of the present study is to reveal the precise mechanism of nervous and humoral regulations of lipid and carbohydrate metabolisms in the adipose tissues. Histochemical and biochemical observations were made on the innervated and denervated interscapular brown adipose tissues and partly on the liver and adrenal cortex of male mice during starvation with or without carbohydrate introduction with special consideration to the changes of the lipid and glycogen contents and to the activities of several important enzymes as well as to pH values in the\ntissues. In a state of absolute starvation, the animals died in a few days showing a gradual discharge of stored lipids from the innervated brown adipose tissues, while in the denervated tissues the stored lipids increased gradually even in a state of slight or moderate starvation as well as in the cases of normally fed animals. The increase of lipids continued before the stage of severe starvation and the stored lipids being rapidly discharged\nbecame nil at the terminal stage of life. Introduction of glucose into starved animals caused also a more marked deposition of glycogen in the denervated than in the innervated tissues in proportion to the degree of starvation, although it did not cause the deposition in both tissues at the terminal stage of life. These facts represent that the nervous regulation is essential for the mobilization of lipids and carbohydrates from this tissue.\nAdrenalectomy also caused the death of animals within a few days with a gradual decrease of depot lipids. In this case denervation likewise caused a marked depositon of lipids in the brown adipose tissues, showing a sudden escape of lipids at the end of life. Experiments on transplanted adipose tissues taken from the animals at the terminal stage of starvation, proved that the tissue cells retain the ability to deposit lipids until the end of life.\nChemical estimation elucidated that the serum glucose and lipids fall markedly at the terminal stage of life.\nThe innervated tissues showed increased activities of succinic dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, ATPase and lipase during starvation with a gradual discharge of lipids. Glucose injection increased the degree of the activities of all these enzymes, though in the terminal stage of starvation the ATPase activity declined again. The activity of total cholinesterase declined slightly in severe starvation. The pH value fell gradually with the progress of starvation. On the other hand, in the denervated tissues the activity of succinic dehydrogenase fell with an increased deposition of lipids, though in the final stage of starvation the activity rose with the discharge of lipids; while the activities of phosphatase,\nATPase and lipase rose during starvation and total, unspecific and specific cholinesterase activities declined slightly. The pH value in the denervated tissues rose slightly during mild starvation and fell markedly in severe starvation. Observations proved that the activities Df these enzymes and pH, which are under the control of the autonomic nervous system, have close relationships to the deposition and the discharge of lipids and glycogen\nfrom the adipose tissues, and that the rapid discharge of lipids from the denervated tissue at the terminal stage of life is an expression of the onesided progress of oxidative process which may mean a complete loss of regulation of metabolism.",

It is therefore essential in malaria-endemic areas for malaria patients to be confirmed for their G6PD activity before taking primaquine. The WST-8 method, a newly established screening method for G6PD deficiency, has been demonstrated to be suitable for field conditions, particularly for on-site malaria surveys. Here we report a laboratory evaluation by this method of the reactivity of blood-spotted filters. A time-course experiment was conducted to evaluate the reactivity of blood samples spotted onto 4 types of filter paper, Whatman 31ET Chr (ET), 3MM Chr (3MM), P81, and Advantec No. 2 (AD2). The rank of the relative reaction intensity was ET > 3MM = AD2 > P81. Blood-spotted filters stored at 4 degrees C gradually decreased G6PD reactivity with the passage of storage time, whereas those stored at room temperature rapidly reduced their reactivity. Unexpectedly, saponin supplementation reduced the reactivity of blood-spotted filters. In conclusion, 1) ET is the most suitable filter for the WST-8 method; 2) blood-spotted filters stored in cold condition can be assayed within 14 days, or those stored at room temperature should be tested within 3 days; and 3) reaction mixtures should not contain saponin.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated the plasma homocysteine (tHcy) and nitric oxide metabolites (nitrite plus nitrate; NOx) data of consecutive patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography (n=79) with respect to the presence and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD), the presence of acute coronary syndromes (ACS), and the risk status of patients. Hyperhomocysteinemia (>15 micromol/L) was detected in 11% of the controls (n=19) and 37% of CAD patients (n=60) (p=0.03). Plasma tHcy in CAD patients was not significantly different from controls, but those with 3-vessel disease had a significantly higher tHcy concentrations than did controls (p=0.049). The patients with 3-vessel disease and ACS had the highest concentrations of tHcy (16.9 +- 4.4 micromol/L), and the difference from the ACS patients with 1- and 2-vessel involvement was significant (p=0.03). In patients with 1-vessel involvement, tHcy was correlated with NOx (r=0.62, p=0.005); in patients with 2- and 3-vessel disease this correlation could not be observed. The high-risk patients (n=51) had a higher mean number of vessel involvement and tHcy (p<0.001, p<0.05, respectively) but lower NOx (p<0.05) when compared to the low-risk patients (n=28). It appears that in the early stages of atherosclerosis hyperhomocysteinemia causes an increase in NOx production, but with progression of the disease this compensatory increase disappears.",

Face-to-face household surveys were carried out in 7 areas, and a total of 2,436 persons participated (overall response rate: 58.4%) from 2002 to 2004. The WHO Composite International Diagnostic Interview 3.0 was used to diagnose major depression according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and additional interviews assessed the presence of circulatory diseases. Using data from a random subsample of the respondents (n=832), we conducted Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios for the onset of major depression with comorbid circulatory diseases as a time-dependent covariate. Heart attack was significantly associated with the onset of major depression (hazard ratio [HR], 7.51 [95% Confidential Interval (CI), 1.36-41.45]) after adjusting for sex, birth cohort, smoking, alcohol intake, and education. Heart disease (HR, 2.12 [95% CI, 0.79-5.70]), diabetes (HR, 2.36 [95% CI, 0.42-13.34]) and hypertension (HR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.37, 2.50]) were not significantly associated. There were no subjects who developed major depression after stroke. These results suggest that heart attack, and maybe also heart disease and diabetes, affect the onset of major depression.",

Donryu male albino rats were fed diets containing 0.064% 3'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene (3'-MDAB), 4'-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene (4'-MDAB) or 2-methyl-4-dimethylaminoazobenzene (2-MDAB) for 10 weeks. During the experiment, body mass, food and water intake and volume of urine were documented. Methylglyoxal, D-lactate and formate in the urine samples were determined. On the first day of the eleventh week, methylglyoxal, D-lactate, glutathione and enzymatic activities of demethylation and glyoxalase I and II in liver were measured. Methylglyoxal, D-lactate and clinical chemistry parameters of blood plasma were also measured. The levels of methylglyoxal and D-lactate in livers of rats fed 3'-MDAB were very high, while those of 2-MDAB fed-rats and the control group were the same. The fact that glyoxalase I activity and the level of glutathione, a cofactor of glyoxalase I, were high in the livers of the 3'-MDAB-fed rats can explain the elevated levels of methylglyoxal and D-lactate in the liver. The most striking results were the elevated formate levels in the urine of rats fed 3'- and 4'-MDAB in a precancerous state. The degradation of D-lactate, an end product of the methylglyoxal bypass, into acetaldehyde and formate was suggested as a possible way to explain the results.",

However, it remains unknown which antigen is closely associated with thyroid MALT lymphoma. We examined whether B cell response to thyroglobulin (Tg), which is a common thyroid-specific autoantigen, is related etiologically to the pathogenesis of thyroid MALT lymphoma. Expression of human Tg antigens and Cluster of differentiation (CD) 35 was examined immunohistochemically in 15 cases of thyroid MALT lymphoma using paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissue specimens. In all cases of thyroid MALT lymphoma, human Tg was detected immunohistochemically in the follicular epithelial cells and follicular dendritic cells (FDCs). These FDCs were positive by double immunostaining for anti-human Tg rabbit polyclonal antibody (Ab) and for CD35. Results showed that the Tg, a thyroid autoantigen, had immunostained the germinal center of the thyroid MALT lymphoma. The Tg was present in the FDCs, as revealed by the staining pattern of the germinal center;this fact was confirmed by double immunostaining of anti-human Tg mouse monoclonal Ab and anti-CD35 mouse monoclonal Ab. The results of our study suggest that Tg is an autoantigen that is recognized by thyroid MALT lymphoma cells.",

As for the culture method we have devised a method of silicon oil coating on the blood containers, a method which will least affect the cell function as compared with the conventional culture method. As the results we have found that the tissue growth in the case of peripheral leucocyte culture of normal persons ceases after six-hour culture and also we have recognized a peculiar finding, a growth like a corona-shape, in which an empty space appears in the inner part of growth area along with the lapse of time. In every\nleukemic case, without presenting growth area like a corona, the cell density is high and the outer zone of growth area becomes sharply demarcated as in the case with bone-marrow culture and also the growth continues even after 12 hours. At this instance we have noticed many mitoses of immature cells. Moreover, the maturation of immature cells has been observed and it has also been possible to distinguish to what type these immature cells belonged. In the leukemoid reaction no growth pattern Characteristic to the leukemia can be recognized, and at a glance it can easily be differentiated from the leukemia. In the case of hypoplastic anemia although the growth area is like that of the normal presenting a corona-like shape, the cell density is lower and the function of leucccytes is lesser than the normal. From these results we believe that the peripheral leucocyte culture is clinically useful.",

Paperelectrochromatography proved the iron\ncan mainly be detected in β-globulin fraction in bovine serum and in &#945-globulin and albumin fractions in human and rabbit sera. But the absorption spectrum proved that there is no formation of any new compound, giving almost the same absorption curve as in the serum protein itself. And by lowering the pH of media below 5.4, the solution gives immediately the positive reaction of ferric iron. From these rerults it is suggested that iron will be maintained in a colloidal state keeping the stability of this state in the presence of protein molecules. Freezing and drying are the procedures quite useful for keeping this material for a long period of time without changing the chemical characteristics.",

In a repeated analysis (after 6 months), DM chromosomes were still present. To rule out the possibility that the patient was overexposed to ionizing radiation at work, her blood test was compared with a group of coworkers as well as with a group of professionally unexposed people. The data rejected this possibility, but the retroactive analysis showed that the patient even at the time of employment had a moderately increased number of chromosomal aberrations (3.5%) consisting of 3 isochromatids and 4 gaps, suggesting that her initial genomic instability enhanced the later development. The finding of a continuous presence of rare DM chromosomes in her PBL (4 and 10 months after radiochemotherapy) was considered as an indicator of additional risk, which might have some prognostic significance.",

The virus could be transmitted by transfusion with 15-20 ml of whole blood (7/7) or irradiated blood (1/6) from the EBV-related virus-infected rabbits, but there was no transmission with transfusion of cell-free plasma (0/6) from the infected rabbits. Passive anti-EBV-VCA IgG (x 20 approximately x 10) titers decreased during the first 1-2 weeks in the transfused rabbits. The virus-transmitted rabbits showed a gradual increase in antibody titers ranging from peak titers of x 640 to x 2560 after 3 weeks of transfusion. The recipient origin of malignant lymphoma that developed in the first rabbit transfused by infected blood was confirmed by chromosomal analysis. This rabbit model thus shows that EBV-related herpesvirus is serially transmissible by blood transfusion and that transmission can not be completely prevented by irradiation of blood, but removal of blood cells is the best way to prevent transmission of EBV-related virus. Therefore, this animal model provides a convenient in vivo system for studies of the prevention and therapy of transfusion-related transmission of EBV and EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases in immunocompromised human beings.",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, the liquor industry in Japan has strived to address alcohol-related problems through initiatives such as warnings in the various media. In this study, we conducted an Internet-based questionnaire survey to examine general consumer awareness of such warnings, and the media by which they are conveyed, on the consumption of alcoholic beverages. A total of 985 subjects (males: 487, females: 498) in age groups ranging from 20s to 70s responded (response rate: 22.4%). The awareness rates for warnings regarding underage drinking, drunk driving, and drinking during pregnancy, and those for messages encouraging moderation in drinking, were 96.4%, 83.7%, 59.6%, and 45.5%, respectively. Logistic regression analysis adjusted for habitual alcohol consumption demonstrated significant gender- and/or age-based differences in the rates of awareness of warnings and the media publicizing them. For example, the odds ratio of awareness among women of warnings against underage drinking was significantly higher than that of awareness among men. Issues that must be addressed in the future include:(1) increasing public awareness about messages regarding drinking during pregnancy and drinking in moderation;(2) reviewing the wording of warnings to make them more effective;and (3) devising and employing, on a regular basis, more effective means of transmitting messages in consideration of gender and age.",

Significant differences were found in metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis of the primary site, and in lymph node maximum standardized uptake value, between patients with and without extranodular spread (p<0.05). Combining primary site total lesion glycolysis and lymph node maximum standardized uptake volume at their respective optimal cutoffs, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for predicting extranodular spread were 89%, 92%, and 92%, respectively.

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are effective for patients with the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-ALK fusion gene. Several ALK-TKIs have been established: the first-generation ALK-TKI, crizotinib; second-generation ALK-TKIs, alectinib and ceritinib; and third-generation ALK-TKI, lorlatinib. Some ALK-TKIs are effective for tumors that are resistant to other ALK-TKIs; however, as is known in epidermal growth factor receptormutant lung cancer, tumor resistance is inevitable. ALK-positive NSCLCs acquire resistance via various mechanisms, making it a heterogeneous disease. Therefore, it is necessary to develop next-generation treatment strategies, such as the use of next-generation ALK-TKIs for secondary mutations, or combination therapies with ALK-TKIs and other TKIs.

We conducted a comprehensive prospective analysis of the factors contributing to post-ESD aspiration pneumonia in early gastric neoplasms in this study, with special focus on whether pre-treatment oral care can prevent aspiration pneumonia. Sixty-one patients who underwent ESD for gastric neoplasms were randomly assigned to the oral care or control groups. ESD was performed under deep sedation. Of 60 patients whose data were available for analysis, 5 (8.3%) experienced pneumonia confirmed either by chest radiography or computed tomography. Although no difference in the rate of pneumonia was found between the control and oral care groups, the post-oral care bacteria count was significantly higher in the saliva of patients who developed pneumonia compared to those without pneumonia. In addition, the presence of vascular brain diseases and the dose of meperidine were also significantly associated with the occurrence of pneumonia. These results suggest that the number of oral bacteria as well as pre-existing vascular brain diseases and high-dose narcotics can affect the incidence of post-ESD pneumonia.",

The BAP/ALP ratio was found to be negatively correlated with age, a cor-relation that has not been found in other ethnicities. The serum BAP/ALP ratio was inversely correlated with serum CRP levels but was positively correlated with serum albumin levels and hemoglobin concentrations. Collectively, our results suggest that the BAP/ALP ratio could be a useful predictor for important geriatric con-ditions seen in general practice.",

    "abstract": "The insertion of a self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) for nonpancreatic cancer is a factor predicting the risk of post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis (PEP). We evaluated the efficacy of endo-scopic pancreatic stenting (EPS) to prevent PEP after SEMS insertion in patients with malignant distal biliary stricture and without main pancreatic duct (MPD) obstruction. We performed a single-center, retrospective, historically controlled investigation to assess the outcomes of 33 consecutive patients who underwent SEMS insertion. From March 2013 to June 2015, 13 patients did not undergo EPS (Non-EPS group). The other 20 patients underwent EPS (EPS group) between July 2015 and August 2018. The background data demonstrated no signiﬁcant differences. Except for one patient in the Non-EPS group, all patients underwent biliary sphinc-terotomy. The EPS group’s PEP incidence was signiﬁcantly lower (n = 1, 5%) than that of the Non-EPS group (n = 4, 31%) (p = 0.04). The median serum amylase and lipase levels after the procedure were signiﬁcantly lower in the EPS group than in the Non-EPS group (amylase: 104 vs. 262 U/L; p < 0.01, lipase: 102 vs. 666 U/L; p = 0.01). The use of EPS decreased the incidence of PEP after SEMS insertion in individuals with malignant distal biliary stricture and without MPD obstruction.",

    "abstract": "In our studies on the hypotensive effect of Diamox by intravenous injection, we have arrived at the following conclusions. 1. Ocular tension falls and the flow of aqueous humor becomes sluggish. 2. Diamox inhibits the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and the concentrations\nof HCO3-, K+, Cl- and glucose are markedly altered.\n3. Protein increases both in blood and aqueous humor, but no change in protein fraction can be observed in blood.\n4. Diamox in no way affects the metabolism. 5. It seems that Diamox brings about the change in the specific gravity\nof blood, making the latter either more diluted or more concentrated. From these, we conclude that the mechanism of the loweing of ocular tension by Diamox seems to lie in the fact that it inhibits the activity of carbonic anhydrase, and that consequent alteration in the concentrations of HCO3- and other ions accompanied by the change in osmotic pressure as well as a slight decrease of water in tissue all bring about the fall in the ocular tension. However, Diamox seems to have nothing to do with\naqueous humor in so far as active transport or permeability are concerned.",

    "abstract": "Within the range of our investigations the most important biochemical characteristics in the brain of idiopathic epileptic patients seem to be defect in the production of and the attendant decrease in free amino acids of the brain. On account of these phenomena there seem to occur the acceleration of the ChE activity and a poor utilization of glucose. Of the free amino acids in the brain the combined amount of glutamic acid, glutamine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) will occupy the major portion of the total free amino acids found in brain, and thus diminution in the contents of glutamic acid and GABA in the brain of idopathic epileptic patients has quite an important meaning. At the present stage it is not yet possible to give any definitive answer to the question why such decrease occurs but it is believed that the most urgent problem facing us today is the amino acid metabolism that is associated with glutamic acid and the comparative studies of the amino acid metabolism in the epileptic brain to that in the non-epileptic brain are required. The fact that γ-amino-β-hydroxybutyric acid (GABOB), the substance that suppresses the central excitation, is decreased seems to indicate biochemically the existence of a defect in the processes of excitation in the brain of idiopathic epleptic patients.",

Our experiences with these patients are only what might be called an introductory phase in the study and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis when compared with those in Europe\nand America. In estimating the incidence of rheumatoid arthritis in Japan from various available data, although it would not reach the level of England and U.S.A., it will be about 100 cases per 100,000 population, matching\nmore or less the incidence in the northern Europe. As regards sex and the predisposing age we find no great difference from those in Europe and America. One striking difference that we find is the fact that patients in our\ncountry have very little resistance against salicylic acid drug used in treatment. Therefore, it is unreasonable to expect a good anti-inflammatory action by administering a large dosage of 5-10g of such a drug as aspirin per day. It must be limited within a comparatively small dosage of 1.0 to 2.0 g or with concomitant administration of prednisolone and aspirin in the hope of utilizing its analgesic effect. Furthermore, it is not feasible to introduce the results of studies made in Europe and America on the salicylic drug and its prescription all of them showing the concentration in blood 35 mg%, which is on the borderline of intoxicating dosage. This is only one example, and with some more experiences we shall undoubtedly encounter many dissimilar points. Therefore, it is essential that rheumatology specific to Japan needs to be established.",

On the contrary, when the tumor is regressing or\ndisappears, the level elevates or reverts to that before transplantation. Strong A and R III mice with spontaneous mammary cancer have markedly low serum properdin levels as compared with those of healthy mice. 2. The properdin levels are less than 2 units per milliliter of the serum in\n44.4 per cent of patients with gastric cancer, in 18.2 per cent of ones with non-malignant tumor and in 18.2 per cent of ones with gastric or duodenal ulcer. The abnormal low level has been found in 33.3 per cent of patients\nwithout recurrence, who had undergone extended radical gastrectomy combined with radical lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer. 3. Some correlation can be seen between the serum properdin levels and the degree of progress of gastric cancer. 4. The cancer patients with low total serum protein have lower serum properdin levels than those having nomal protein. 5. As for influence of surgical operation on the serum properdin levels, there is observed a tendency that a minor operation causes the levels to increase and a major operation causes the levels to fall. 6.

On administration of hemolysed blood, bile pigments in bile demonstrate a remarkable increase, while as compared when injected into the auricle veins in cases of administration through the\nportal vein a decline in the functions of the liver reticulo-endothelial system is seen, causing a decrease in biliverdin amount.

In patients with highly impaired functions of the parenchymal cells of the liver, neither absolute nor relative hyperbilirubinemia occurs on similar imposition of hemolysed blood. 4.

Furthermore, we were able to type DRB1 alleles of the minor component in mixed samples at a proportion of 1/1,000 or 1/10,000. In a criminal case, DRB1 alleles detected from mixed bloodstains on a sword found at the scene enabled us to explain the case. This method is expected to be useful for forensic medicine.",

Therefore the author attempted, in the first place, to determine the optimum dose of X-rays in the proteolytic action of papayotin; in the second place, the relation between the effects of activator and\ninhibitor respectively and of X-rays; and finally the activity of papayotin after the papayotin substrate mixture as well as after the substrate in the mixture was irradiated.",

Data for 140 patients (M/F: 42/98) were analyzed after excluding patients lacking detailed records and patients taking dopaminergic agents. Median serum PRL levels were significantly lower in males than females: 6.5 ng/ml (IQR: 4.2-10.3) versus 8.1 ng/ml (5.9-12.9), respectively. Pain and general fatigue were the major symptoms at the first visit, and past histories of hypertension and dyslipidemia were frequent. Male patients with relatively high PRL levels (≥ 10 ng/ml) had significantly lower levels of serum albumin and significantly higher levels of serum LDH than those with low PRL (< 10 ng/ml). There were significant correlations of male PRL level with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (R=0.62), serum LDH level (R=0.39) and serum albumin level (R=−0.52), while the level of serum CRP (R=0.33) showed an insignificant but weak positive correlation with PRL level. Collectively, these results show that PRL levels had gender-specific relevance to various clinical factors, with PRL levels in males being significantly related to inflammatory status.",

The results were as follows: 1. The repeated intravenous injection of a vast amount of carbon particles induced a severe anemia. The anemia was always normo- or hyperchromic, showing not any disturbance in iron metabolism or hemoglobin formation. The data suggested that anemia is due to the arrest of reproduction of erythroblast or differentiation of the stem cells to erythroblasts, but not due to inhibition of the iron metabolism. 2. R.E.S. had no relation to the proliferation or the differentiation of granulocytes.\n3. The functions of R.E.S. related to erythropoiesis and lymphopoiesis are affected by blocking independently of its phagocytic potency. In spite of a severe anemia, the phagocytic potency of R.E.S. could never be lowered and\nliver and spleen grew much larger in size and weight, showing that the phagocytic\nability of R.E.S. is extremely resistant against such a blocking. 4.

Patients with a history of X-ray exposure in the last 6 months or of any virus disease as well as continuous drug users and smokers were excluded, leaving a total of 49 patients. Acetylcholine esterase (Pseudocholinesterase) enzyme (AchE), sister-chromatid exchanges (SCE), the mitotic index (MI), and the replication index (RI) were evaluated. Blood samples were cultured for SCE evaluation and sera separated for AchE levels. Insecticide exposure was generally intentional for suicide in adolescents and at older ages, but accidental for children. AchE levels were found to be significantly lower in organophosphorus (OP) and carbamated (CB) insecticide poisoning groups in comparison with the control group (p<0.001), while the pyrethroid (PY) group was not statistically different for the AchE effect (p>0.05). SCE was found to be significantly higher in OP and CB groups (p<0.001), while the PY and control groups were statistically similar for SCE levels (p>0.05). This study showed an increase in SCE in response to orally ingested insecticides. These findings indicate that insecticide exposure results in cell abnormalities, with resulting impediments to the division and replication of cells, as suggested by MI decreases and RI increases, while the speed of the division cycles of stimulated cells increases.",

Molecular cytogenetic techniques, such as spectral karyotyping (SKY) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), can help to detect chromosomal aberrations precisely. We analyzed the karyotypes in 6 cases of multiple congenital abnormalities and 1 case of spontaneous abortion (case 2). Three cases (cases 1, 6, and 7) had marker chromosomes, and 4 cases (cases 2-5) had chromosomal rearrangements. The karyotypes in cases 1, 2, and 3 were determined using FISH with probes based on the clinical findings and family histories. Spectral karyotyping (SKY) analysis in cases 4-7 showed that this method is useful and saves time. The combination of SKY and FISH analyses defined the range of the ring chromosome in case 7. We demonstrated that a combination of G-banding, FISH, and SKY can be applied effectively to the investigation of chromosomal rearrangement and to the detection of marker chromosome origins. We suggest the use of these methods for prenatal diagnosis, in which the inherent time limitations are particularly important.",

Colloidal iron was prepared within tissues or cells, and was observed in the form of electron dense fine granules (1-2 nm in diameter) by transmission electron microscopy. Collagen fibrils in the connective tissue showed colloidal iron deposition at regular periodical intervals. Cells in the splenic tissue showed that fine colloidal granules were deposited on the ribosomes but not on the nuclear chromatin. This finding suggests that ferric ions could not diffuse into the nucleus, which was surrounded by the nuclear envelope. The podocyte processes of the renal glomerulus were stained diffusedly.

The cell damage seems to initiate at the nucleus, finally leading to the\ncomplete cytolysis. The inhibiting effect of this substance on the mitosis of Yoshida sarcoma cells can be observed, especially marked from prophase up to metaphase giving almost the same results obtained after X-ray irradiation. From these results and the observations reported by several authors on the cell damage by X-ray irradiation, weshould call special attention to the fact that the essential mechanism of X-ray irradiation can be\nattributed to the cell toxin produced after the irradiation.",

The results are summarized as follows: (1) Atropine exerts an excitatory action on the pace maker ganglion cells in a concentration of 1-2 per cent. resulting in an increase of the heart rate. No effect is recognized on the heart beats, where the drug is applied to the heart muscle. (2) Acetylcholine exerts an excitatory action in a lower concentration (0.001-0.10 %) and produces a transitory excitation followed by an inhibition in a higher concentration (1-5 %). No effect is perceptible on the heart beats, when the drug is applied to the heart muscle.\n(3) Where atropine has been previously applied to the median nerve trunk, acetylcholine applied to the same spot produces always an inhibition of the heart beats. Conversely, when the ganglion cells activated previously by acetylcholine, a subsequent administration of atropine suppresses the activity of the ganglion cells, resulting in an inhibition of the heart beats.",

In blood diseases the proportion of sideroblasts in the case of low erythropoietic condition is higher and in the case with accelerated erythropoietic\ncondition and of iron deficiency it tends to be lower than that in normal persons. Further, obtaining sideroblastogram and sideroblast ratio (S. r.) from the classification of Types I, Ⅱ, and Ⅲ according to the iron granule content, it has been proven that abnormal conditions can be clearly distinguished from the normal, indicating that sideroblasts are closely associated with erythropoietic function. This is proven to be a far superior method for the diagnosis as well as for the prognosis of blood diseases than the determination of serum\niron. 2. In experimental anemic rabbits the relationship of sideroblasts to the condition of erythropoietic function is still more clearly recognized, and it has been found that variations in the sideroblast count is dependent\nupon the condition of the equilibrium between the iron supply from serum iron and the iron utilization controlled by the erythropoietic function. 3. In addition, in the iron-treated rabbits under various erythropoietic conditions we have been able to confirm that there are a certain mechanism and a limitation to the iron intake by erythroblasts, and that erythroblasts take essentially three steps of metabolic processes, namely, intake, retention, and utilization of iron almost simultaneously, in the latter half of the maturation stage.",

The spiral formation or corkscrew-like formation presented by blood vessels in the bands in the surrounding tissues of cancer seems to be the characteristic of arteries. 3. As for the direction of flow of arteries in the tissues surrounding\ncancer, the arteries in the normal case generally run slanting towards the surface of the cervix in the direction of the periphery, but the arteries in the surrounding tissues of cancer run towards the cancer tissue. 4. Apart from mother blood vessels, the blood vessels in the cancer tissue all present an imperfect capillary·like construction and there is none that possesses the normal arterial or venous con struction. Some part is dilatated and other part is narrow, suggesting an imcomplete blood supply. The direction of the flow is also irregular. Mother blood vessels grow rapidly large once they are taken into the cancer tissue.\n5. All blood vessels other than the mother vessels reveal an imperfect capillary-like coustruction in the cancer tissue, and in places the walls of these blood. vessels are indistinct; and consequently it is but natural that they bleed so easily.",

It could be noticed that this increase had an increasing tendency in proportion to the degree of inflammatory pathologic changes in the gingiva. 3. In the gingivae of A. P. an increase of mast cells and their morphologic changes, particularly disintegration, were seen and the grade of changes was almost parallel to an increase of histamine. 4. When a histamine solution was repeatedly injected into the mucobuccal folds of animals, a remarkable increase of histamine and mast cells in the injected gingivae were recognized with inflammatory changes. An increase of gingival histamine could be hardly recognized by means of a simple mechanical stimulation or local anaphylaxis alone. However, in the combination of two, the increase of histamine was seen and relatively\nremarkable inflammatory changes suggestive of A. P. were macroscopically and microscopically noticed. 5.

The twice-monthly programme included 46 participants (male/female = 7/39, average age: 65.8 years)and the monthly programme consisted of 48(male/female = 9/39, age: 66.4). At the beginning of the study, all subjects belonged to the 'contemplation' stage of diet and exercise habits within the Transtheoretical Model of Change. The stage-matched intervention helped many participants move to the 'action ' stage by 6 months after the last session, especially in the twice-monthly group. The change rate of exercise from the 'contemplation' stage to the 'action' stage was significantly higher in the twice-monthly group (76.1 percent) than in the monthly (54.2 percent ). In both monthly and twice-monthly formats, participants' satisfaction and understanding levels at the end of the programme were high, but were significantly higher in the twice-monthly group. Through favorable lifestyles and higher levels of satisfaction and learning, the twice-monthly format may produce more positive results in cholesterol management than the monthly format, as the shorter period of time makes the programme more intensive.",

    "abstract": "Percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS) has been applied for cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA). We have developed a novel method of cardiopulmonary resuscitation using PCPS combined with liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin (TRM645) to improve oxygen delivery to vital organs. Ventricular fibrillation was electrically induced to an adult goat for 10 min. Next, PCPS (30 ml/kg/min, V/Q: 1) was performed for 20 min. Then, external defibrillation was attempted and observed for 120 min. The TRM group (n5) was filled with 300 mL of TRM645 for the PCPS circuit. The control group (n5) was filled with the same volume of saline. The delivery of oxygen (DO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) decreased markedly by PCPS after CPA, compared to the preoperative values. DO2 was kept at a constant level during PCPS in both groups, but VO2 slowly decreased at 5, 10, and 15 min of PCPS in the control groups, demonstrating that systemic oxygen metabolism decreased with time. In contrast, the decreases in VO2 were small in the TRM group at 5, 10, and 15 min of PCPS, demonstrating that TRM645 continuously maintained systemic oxygen consumption even at a low flow rate. AST and LDH in the TRM group were lower than the control. There were significant differences at 120 min after the restoration of spontaneous circulation (p<0.05).",

The grafts (n7) were allocated into groups I-IV according to the storage temperature:4, 10, 16, and 23, respectively. Forty-eight h after orthotopic transplantation, the arterial blood gas was analyzed and the peak airway pressure (PAP) and the level of LacZ protein production in the grafts were measured by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. After reperfusion, the grafts were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The grafts in groups III and IV showed more deterioration as evidenced by decreased arterial oxygen tension, increased PAP, and predominant infiltration of inflammatory cells compared with groups I and II. The level of LacZ production was significantly lower in group I than in groups II-IV. The optimal temperature of lung graft preservation after ex vivo gene transfer was determined to be 10, balancing considerations of lung injury and efficiency of transgene expression.",

Routine laboratory values were unremarkable except for the white blood cell count (15,000/micro litter) and the C-reactive protein (CRP) value (22.5 mg/dl). A Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed air collection in the middle of the anterior pararenal space. One day later, CT revealed air collection in the anterior pararenal space spread to the right side and abscess in the sigmoid mesentery. Because an intramesocolic perforation of the sigmoid colon was suspected, an emergency operation was performed. Abscess formation was recognized in the sigmoid mesentery, and sigmoidectomy including the contaminated mesentery and Hartmann.s procedure were performed. The perforation was 3 cm in diameter, and some diverticula were present in the vicinity of the perforated site. The specimen microscopically revealed perforation at the edge of the diverticulum in association with sudden disruption of the proper muscle layer. Based on pathological findings, intramesocolic diverticular perforation of the sigmoid colon was diagnosed. The present case is a very rare condition. However, it was possible to make a diagnosis preoperatively by detecting air collection in the anterior pararenal space on CT scan. If a sigmoid perforation occurs between the leaves of the mesocolon, air extends into the root of the sigmoid mesocolon and within the anterior pararenal space.",

    "abstract": "For the purpose to clarify the control mechanism of erythroid cell differentiation, the author observed morphologic changes in bone-marrow cells and circulating\nred cells in phenylhydrazine anemia of rabbits by introducing a mass of red cells into vein at one time and reached the following conclusions. 1. After red cell transfusion in a mass to animal showing a marked hematopoietic activity, anisocytosis or macrocytosis becomes distinct with the appearance of big reticulocytes and red cells as large as four times the normal in\nvolume. This suggests, judging from their volume, the accelerated denucleation of erythroblast as early as at the late basophilic stage. 2. Observations on bone marrow at this stage revealed the reduction in the number of erythroblasts of undifferentiated type with the increase of rather differentiated ones. In erythroid islet, undifferentiated cells are found surrounding\na reticulum cell located in the center, while well differentiated ones in the outskirt area are situated near the sinusoid. Such a cell arrangement suggests that the erythroid cell requires a high oxygen tension for its differentiation. 3. From these observations and other results obtained from the studies on reticulocyte maturation and RNA synthesis of erythroblast, the author stresses that erythroid cells can differentiate as long as it is provided with a certain level of oxygen, even though it may develop m-RNA for differentiation. In other words, there should be two steps in the differentiation of erythroblast, the first is m-RNA synthesis induced by the information and the second is the somatic\nprotein synthesis with oxygen supply. This seems to be directly connected to the control mechanism of hematopoiesis by oxygen.",

The antitumor effect of 5-FU (10(-4) M) was slightly enhanced by combination with hyperthermia (42 degrees C) for 2h, and the effect was determined to be additive. Synergistic enhancement of antitumor activity was obtained by the concurrent use of hyperthermia (42 degrees C, 2h) and 5'-DFUR (10(-4) M) or HCFU (10(-5) M). However, the antitumor effect of FT-207 (10(-4) M) in combination with hyperthermia was comparable that of hyperthermia alone. The synergistic enhancement of antitumor activity was not obtained for all drugs when the cells were preheated at 42 degrees C for 2h. On the other hand, when cells were pretreated with drugs before heat exposure, weak interactions were obtained after 5-FU and 5'-DFUR treatment, and a synergistic interaction was obtained after HCFU treatment. It is speculated that the metabolites of 5'-DFUR and HCFU enhance the cytotoxicity of 5-FU, or might change the threshold concentration for a cytotoxic effect of 5-FU in cancer cells.",

In addition, the AIs were compared with those in the Stenosis group before and after revascularization in both FAIR-HASTE and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), calculated with DSC-pMRI. A statistically significant difference was recognized between the AIs in the Normal and Stenosis groups (AI = 2.25 +- 1.92, 8.09 +- 4.60, respectively ; p < 0.0001).

We evaluated the REIC/Dkk-3 protein-induced anticancer effects on Huh7 and Hep3B cells (HCC cell lines) in the presence of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and found that combination treatment with REIC/Dkk-3 protein and PBMCs reduced the proliferation of HCC cells (Hep3B: 82.0%±16.3%; Huh7: 72.6%±9.1%). We also studied 194 HCC patients who underwent primary liver resection or primary radiofrequency ablation from 2008 to 2017. Serum REIC/Dkk-3 protein levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared to the prognostic data. The 3-year disease-free survival of the REIC/Dkk-3 high group was significantly higher than that in the REIC/Dkk-3 low group. In conclusion, this is the first study investigating the relationship between HCC patient survival and serum REIC/Dkk-3 protein levels in a large population.

We examined the relationship between preoperative or intraoperative factors and the occurrence of POPF after DP using statistical methods in 23 males and 21 females with a mean age of 73. The mean L/E ratio was significantly lower in the POPF group than the non-POPF group (p=0.035). The L/E ratio had moderate diagnostic accuracy, with a calculated optimal cutoff value of 0.77. In univariate analysis, a significant association was noted between POPF and stump\nthickness ≥ 16.9, body mass index ≥ 27.5, and L/E ratio ≤ 0.77. In the multivariate analysis, the L/E ratio (odds ratio, 5.96; p=0.036) was an independent risk factor for POPF.

We retrospectively investigated prognosis and factors including sex, reason for discovery, treatment, pathological factors and treatment progress to clarify the risk factors. All patients underwent curative surgical treatment. Pathologically, lymph node metastasis was identified in 25 patients (75%). Thirteen patients (39%) had bilateral cervical metastasis. In addition, 9 (27%) had more than 10 metastatic lymph nodes. The 2 patients with more than 20 metastatic lymph nodes were treated with radioactive iodine (RAI). Five patients (15%) had local recurrences and received surgery. There have been no further recurrences or deaths. However, no factors were determined to significantly predict the recurrence of juvenile DTC. Local recurrent disease was treated with surgery and/or RAI until remission, and survival was excellent in juvenile DTC.",

It is indeed not too difficult to imagine, that, under the same acoustic condition, such individual variation of the acoustic impairment owes to the inherent disposition of each man. But at the same time, this individual variation may more or less owe to the patency of the ear tube; the normal tube having a physiological function to control the unnecessary acoustic stimuli, and on the contrary, the stenosed tube being devoid of this function, induces more impairment of the hearing organ.

Nine women received therapies such as dilation and curettage, and 26 received non-surgical therapies such as methotrexate and topical administration of potassium chloride. Among 9 women who chose to con-tinue with their CSP, 7 successfully delivered newborns, 2 had uterine ruptures in the second trimester, and all women required transabdominal hysterectomy. Diagnosis and therapy in the first trimester of pregnancy are important in the management strategy of a CSP.

    "abstract": "In such animals not having any organic changes in their brains during the initial stage showed a descendence of convulsive threshold. abnormal findings in their electroencephalogram and ascending activity of ChE. But what is the cause of these functional changes? First, from the fact that though there was no organic changes, they were sensitized and reiniected by a known antigen, which is obviously an antigen-antibody reaction. Second, from the\nfact that we got a histological.change, which was acknowledged as C.L.A. changes by increasing the concentration of these solution and the number of injections, it could be thought that these functional changes were caused by what I called latent C.L.A.. That is, it seems it could be thought that it would give functionally a permanent hypersensitivity, which is called convulsive arrangement. Furthermore, a similar histological findings as seen in old epileptics were made experimentally after prolonged and repeated injections of very diluted antigens. I believe it can be said, also from this histological point that they are experimental epileptics. But I am not trying to say that idiopathic epilepsy is the same allergic disease as asthma. If it was so, it should offer clinically a problem of eosinophilia in the blood of epileptics. But actually there is no eosinophilia in epileptics. Also, in adult epileptics, convulsive attacks is not often seen soon after introduction of antigens. Consequently, my theory that epilepsy is allergic, does not mean that allergy is the direct cause of epileptic attacks. What I mean is, the causal genesis of idiopathic epilepsy is hypersensitivity of nerve cells in the brain. This hypersensitivity was\nattained as a tissue reaction by some allergic mechanism without any organic changes. This functional change gives the nerve cell a hypersensitive state, which becomes the base of the beginnihg of convulsion. Its inducement of attack could be water stagnation in the body, anemic state of the brain, alkalosis, or introduction of allergens. In short, the cause of attack does not always come from allergic reactions.",

    "abstract": "1. The results of 245 pleural biopsies perfomed in 108 patients including 219 pleural needle biopsies and 26 pleural open biopsies were reported. The method of pleural biopsy seems to be superior to any other currently available diagnostic procedures for the etiological diagnosis of pleurisy. 2. When the pleural needle biopsy is compared with the pleural open biopsy, the former method has definite advantages over the open biopsy. The pleural needle biopsy is simple, repeatable and has almost no complication. The method of pleural needle biopsy is the initial method of choice as Donohoe correctly stated and should be employed in every cases of the pleurisy to confirm the etiological diagnosis. The open biopsy should be reserved only for those cases in whom the needle biopsy had not proved satisfactory. 3. Utilizing the method of needle biopsy, the pathological diagnosis was made in 86 per cent of our cases at the initial biopsy. By repeated\nneedle biopsies, the results have improved to 91-92 per cent. 4. Most of the failures of the pleural needle biopsy were noted at the early stage of the study due to the unfamiliarity of the biopsy technique and later due to the incooperation of the patients. 5. The presence of the free pleural fluid serves as a convenient guide for the performance of the needle biopsy but successful needle biopsy was easily done without presence of pleural fluid when there is adequate pleural thickening. 6. 63-75 per cent of our diagnosed cases were proved to have granulomatous pleuritis, 13-31 per cent and 5.4-5.8 per cent eosinophilic due to paragonomiasis. The distribution of this pathological diagnosis seems to reflect quite well the actual picture of incidences of pleurisy of various different etiology in young adults in Korea. 7. The relationship of the success in obtaining adequate tissue by needle biopsy and interval between onset of symptom and biopsy was discussed. It was found that the interval has no significant effect on the production of adequate tissue by needle biopsy if the time elapsed is 4 weeks or more from the onset of symptom. 8. The significance of the pathological findings of ranulomatous at one biopsy and at another biopsy in the same patient was discussed. It is concluded that the single finding of nonspecific at one needle biopsy cannot rule out the presence of granulomatous and it is recommended that pleural biopsy be repeated whenever necessary. 9. The diagnostic significance of the chemical analysis of the pleural fluid was discussed in correlation with the results of the pleural needle biopsies. It is concluded that the number of examinations are not quite sufficient to draw any definite conclusion at the present stage of our study. 10. The finding of sanguinous pleural fluid in the patient of granulomatous is quite high (72.7 %) and it was found that the sanguinous pleural fluid was most frequently found in the patients with granulomatous in non-cancerous age. 11. Two groups of pleurisy patients with or without parenchymal lung lesion on chest X-ray were discussed in correlation with the results of the needle biopsy. It was found that the incidence of the pathological evidence of granulomatous inflammation on the biopsy specimens in these two groups is almost the same regardless of the presence of the demonstrable parenchymal lung lesion.\n12. Histopathological finding of granulomatous was discussed in conjunction with the significance of two types of tubercles, the soft tubercles and hard tubercles. In all specimens diagnosed as granulomatous granulomas were demonstrated ranging from large, conglomerate tubercles with central caseation or giant cells to small granulomas without central caseation or Langhans' giant cells. 13. Histopathological significance of the finding of on the biopsy specimens was discussed and the existence of a specific entity of non-specific pleuritis which is equivalent to the inflammation of the pericardium. 14. Cases of pleurisy due to paragonomiasis were discussed and the need of specific attention for search of new cases was emphasized.",

The basal metabolism of the patients with cervical carcinoma of either stage I or stage II as compared with that of the normal women is\nmore accelerated; while the basal metabolism of the cervical carcinoma of stage II. is more augmented than that of the cervical carcinoma stage I. 2. The basal metabolism at the completion of operation is markedly\nlower than that before the operation. 3.

The basal metabolism of those who received the operative castration continues increasing up to the 8th month after the operation and thereafter it returns to a rather balanced state. 5. From the aspects of the fluctuations of the basal metabolism, it has been recognized that the autotransplantation as compared with the castration exerts less influences on the somatic system and for a shorter period of time, and also the endocrine system of the former returns to the balanced condition earlier.",

Acting directly on eosinophils, cortisone markedly decreases the\nwandering velocity of these cells and also brings about the diminution in the number of the cells. Likewise from the movement patterns of eosinophils, this drug markedly impedes the motive function of the cells. 3. ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), when acting directly on eosinophils, enhances the wandering velocity of eosinophils but it in no way affects the number of eosinophils. Judging from the eosinophil movement patterns, this drug markedly promotes the motive function.\n4. Although adrenalin brings about a decrease in the number of peripheral eosinophils in hypophysectomized dogs, the rate of the decrease is less than that observable in the case of normal dogs. 5. Cortisone brings about no significant change in the number of peripheral eosinophils in hypophysectomized dogs, but is induces a decrease in peripheral eosinophils of normal dogs. 6. ACTH acts as to decrease the number of peripheral eosinophils to\nan equal. degree in both hypophysectomized and normal dogs.\n7. When cortisone is administered simultaneously with Adrex, a marked decrease in peripheral eosinophils is brought about in hypophysectomized dogs. 8. By means of the bone-marrow tissue culture of hypophysectomized dogs it has been confirmed that the blood plasma of hypophysectomized dogs lacks an essential factor for cortisone to induce eosinopenia in perpheral blood. 9. The decrease in eosinophils of peripheral blood induced by cortisone has been proved to be dependent upon the presence or absence of the pituitary body. 10.

Despite curative tumor treatments, HCC recurrences sometimes occur with rapidly growing humped or ruptured HCC in small sized tumors. The aim of this study was to clarify the characteristics of humped HCC clinically and radiologically associated with tumor progression, liver damage, and treatment. The subjects were 179 consecutive HCC patients who underwent angiographic examination. Dynamic studies, using helical computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were assessed, and the HCC area were measured. The tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage differed significantly between the humped and non-humped HCC groups. Humped HCC was more frequently observed in the right lobe (29.3% of right-lobe HCCs) than in the left (10.1%; p=0.003). Analysis of recurrent HCC revealed that patients with multiple treatments of >4 sessions had more humped HCC (33.8%) than those with 1-3 sessions (16.7%; p=0.042). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that tumor invasion in the portal vein, rather than large tumor size, was significantly associated with tumor protrusion. HCC recurrence with humped HCC occurs often in patients with multiple treatments. Tumor factors of the TNM classification, especially tumor invasion in the portal vein, might be associated with the mechanisms of tumor protrusion.",

Er untersuchte mit den neuen, durch ihn 1950-52 konstruierten Apparaten, dem Neo-Myographen, wie auch dem Myotonometer den Effekt des Vitamin E auf Herz und Kreislauf. Er teilte seine Falle in 3 Gruppen ein: 1. Resultat mit Hilfe der Myoapparate registrierbar; 2. Behandlung erfolgreich, doch nicht registrierbar und 3. Behandlung ergebnislos. Er dosierte das Praparat nur fur kurze Zeit und erzielte verhaltnismaBig gute Resultate. Bei gesunden, in guter Kondition befindlichen, im\nTraining stehenden Personen haben sich die Funktionen nach seinen Beobachtungen in minderem Grade verschlechtert. Er erklart dies damit, daB das Medikament hier die ohnedies ad optimum gute Funktion pathologisch steigerte, worauf dann die Reaktion (schnelle Ermudung und schlechtere\nFunktion) eintrat. Seiner Meinung nach entsteht die Wirkung des Vitamin E durch die Verbesserung der peripheren Zirkulation und durch die Verbesserung der\nBlutversorgung des Herzmuskels. Auf diese Weise, durch Verbesserung der Gewebsanoxamie bessert sich die Funktion eines jeden Organs und Gewebes und Schmerzen jeder Art, auch jene bei Geburten konnen gestillt werden; der Gewebs- bzw. Muskeltonus verringert sich (z. B. Rheuma musculorum). Es ist auf Grund seiner auf jedes Organ durch\ndie Zirkulation erzielten Wirkung verstandlich, wieso die verschiedenen Verfasser bei einander gegensatzlich scheinenden Erkrankungen gute Wirkung beobachten konnten. In einzelnen Fallen kann eine sehr schnelle Wirkung eintreten, doch durfte hier zum Teil der psychische Effekt eine Rolle spielen. Es kann jedoch von Vitamin E keine systematisch schnelle Wirkung erwartet werden wie. z. B. bei Morphium und Coffein. Die gegensatzliche Auffassung der Autoren durfte sich in der Weise gebildet haben,\ndaB einzelne bei solchen Erkrankungen abweichende Resultate sahen, bei denen entweder das Medikament auf die Zirkulation keine erfolgreiche Wirkung ausuben konnte. bzw. bei denen der Kranke auf das Medikament individuell nicht reagierte oder auch deshalb, weil einzelne Autoren die vielleicht etwas ubertriebenen, zu guten Resultatenanderer nicht entsprechend einzuschatzen vermochten.

    "abstract": "Pathologic, anatomical, and histological findings of 5 autopsy cases and one biopsy case of cryptococcosis have been described. Macroscopically the foci of the lung are grayish white or yellowish white in color and range in size from the small acinous-nodular ones to the larger lobular-nodular ones. In the brain the meninx appears gelatinous and edematous showing many small spots with indistinct boundary and with grayish white color. Lymph nodes infected with fungi are swollen in various degrees.\nHistologically the foci are mainly consisted of granulomatous inflammation containing giant cells. Besides, there are small degenerative foci having no inflammatory response and the lesions of marked fibrosis; the former will be newly formed foci and the latter the old ones. The size of C. neoformans found in tissue ranges from 3 to 30 μ, and the majority of fungi possess thick gelatinous capsule, but some of them in granulative lesions often possess no capsule. From the staining properties the capsule of C. neoformans is believed to be a kind of acid mucopolysaccharide. As for the staining method including general fungi, GOMORI's methenamine\nsilver method is best, especially for the detailed examination of fungus structures, and for the differential diagnosis mucicarmine stain is the most suitable one.\nIn tracing the distribution of the foci in the various organs, it seems that the first attack of this fungus occurs in the lung. The authors have called general attention, through their own experiences, to the fact that\nthe small granulomatous foci caused by Cryptococcus infection, especially in the lung, may often escape the detection at autopsy.",

The summary findings of the present experiments are described in the following. 1) In ten out of the fifteen rabbits emloyed, the bronchial artery originates from the right supreme intercostal artery; in three cases, in addition to this origin, it originates also from the left supreme intercostal artery; and in another case from the intercostal thoracic artery; while in the remaining one from the arc of the aorta. 2) The bronchial veins are divided into the extra-pulmonary and the intra-pulmonary veins. The former arises from the submucous blood vessels\nlocated in the proximal part of the third bronchus, and running along with the bronchial artery, finally empties into the superior Vena cava; while the latter, originating from the submucous capillaries in the distal part of the third bronchus, and after anastomosing with one another in\nthe capsule of the bronchus, is communicated with the pulmonary veins. 3) In the caseous foci, although blood vessels are obliterated, capillaries are newly formed around the main trunks of the pulmonary artery and vein as well as around their residual branches. 4) These caseous foci are supplied with arterial blood from the bronchial\narteries, the blood vessels in the bronchial wall, and the newlyformed vessels of pulmonary arterial origin. 5) The capillaries in the cavity wall are classified into three types according to their origins; namely, Type I, those regenerating from fine branches of the pulmonary vessels; Type Ⅱ, those regenerating from the main trunk of the pulmonary vessels; and Type Ⅲ, those regenerating from the bronchial artery situated in the orifice of the drainage\nbronchus. 6) The tuberculous cavities only in the orifice of the drainage bronchus receive an abundant supply of arterial blood directly from the bronchial artery, but those in other regions receive a scanty blood supply indirectly from the anastomoses between the bronchial artery, its sister vessels and the pulmonary artery. 7) The regeneration of blood vessels in tuberculous foci has been confirmed to occur not only in the bronchial artery and its sister blood vessels but also in the pulmonary artery and vein as well. 8) The constructions of blood vessels in the cavities treated with streptomycin or isoniazide present no significant difference from those of\nthe control. 9) The regeneration of blood vessels and hyperemia in the cavity wall of the cases treated with streptomycin present no significant difference from those observed in the control, but the cases treated with isoniazide show marked hyperemia, newly-formed vessels, and occasional bleedings.",

The latter, therefore, can be called as a cytochemical diagnosis. Since, by the T.P.T. method, even a beginner can obtain the result of approximately 80% in correct and the skilled ones as high as 95%, the clinical diagnosis can be made all the more accurate by using Papanicolaou's test in combination with T.P.T. method. As for the entity of these granular cells, there remains a room for discussion, but Misonou feels that Cell Type A arises from necrobiosis\nof the carcinomatous tissues while Type B would be a certain wandering cell. This reaction, however, should not be employed to the cases in the puerperium, because the similar cells are exfoliated from the puerperal uterus. Thus, I can say that the T.P.T. is not a specific reaction to cancer. From this study, I wuld recommend T.P.T. as a method that is quite simple and is servicable for saving a great deal of effort and time on the part of clinicians, and I would like to encourage you to use it as one of tools for the diagnosis of carcinoma of the uterus, especially for an early diagnosis.",

In addition observations were carried on the 245 subjects who had no\ncomplibation throught pregnancy, delivery and puerperium to see what influences the blood loss during delivery might exert on blood picture during puerperium, particularly the changes of hemoglobin concentration (Hb), and the author arrived at the following conclusions: 1) By the continuous examinations of pregnat women the existence\nhas been recognized of physiological anemia which recovers close to the level of healthy non-pregnant women within one month after delivery. Namely, it has been found that already by the fifth month of pregnancy a considerable decrease both in erythrocyte counts and Hb values is recognized as compared with those of healthy non-pregnant women (the control), but starting around the eighth month the values of both keep on increasing month after month until reaching their maximum at delivery yet still a\nlittle below those of the control, and particularly Hb values as compared with those of the control show a significant fall. During puerperium erythrocyte counts and Hb values recover rapidly and by the sixth post partum week they reach close to the level of the control. 2) By the latter part of pregnancy both in multipara and primipara\nHb values shew a marked decrease as compared with erythroyte count. Gradually presenting hypochromic-anemia picture, even in the sixth post partum week a delay in the recovery of Hb values can still be recognized,\nthe delay being particularly striking in primipara.\n3) It has been noticed that there is a greater tendency of delay in the recovery of Hb values along with increase in blood loss during delivery. Namely, though in the groups with blood loss of less than 10g./kg. at delivery the recovery of Hb values during puerperium is smooth and\nhematopoietic functions seem to be undisturbed. However, with increase in blood loss the recovery is proportionately delayed and in the groups with over 12.5 g./kg. loss a marked delay in the recovery of Hb has been\nrecognized. 4) In primipara groups with under 7.5g./kg. blood loss and in multipara with under 12.5 g./kg. loss, the recovery of Hb values during puerperium is smooth; but in primipara with blood loss of over 10 g./kg. and in\nmultipara with the loss of over 15 g./kg. the delay has been quite marked. In other words, in the groups with blood loss of over 7.5 g./kg. the rate of recovery in Hb values tends to be faster in multipara than in primipara.\n5) Along with increase in the frequency of labor, the rates of increase have tended to increase by degrees.",

    "abstract": "1. After spinal transection at the medulla-spinal junction the thoracic respiratory movements no longer appear in the adult animals, nevertheless the sporadic spike discharges can be recorded from the intercostal muscles. 2. Both in the acute and chronic experiments the spinal cord is transected at the two levels of Th7 and Thl1 respectively and all the dorsal rootlets coming into that part of the cord lying between the transections are severed. The sporadic spike discharges with irregular intervals varying about 0.5 to 3.0 sec. can be recorded from intercostal muscles in the 8th to 10th segments of the spinal cord isolated. There can never be found any reflex influence of the skin stimulation upon the discharges, which also disappear provided the intercostal nerves innervating the muscles are severed. 3. From these results it may be concluded that the spinal cord is endowed\nwith an ability to initiate the impulses autochthonously to excite the intercostal muscles, even though it is only poorly developed in the adult animals.",

When virus of an acute infections disease was inoculated on embryonated eggs, not only the egg membrane but also the chick embryo were infected more or less, and when the number of virus increased the chick embryo died, terminating the development of the egg. However, the tumor inducing virus which represents the Rous virus does not cause heavy disturbances in the embryo and it is well known that chick hatched from this egg can long maintain health unless it is subjected to a provocative factor. HST virus is no exception to this example and though it is inoculated on an embryonated egg it does not cause any serious disturbance on the embryo. The tissue changes of the chorio allantois infected by the Virus were the focal proliferation and necrosis of ectodermal epithelium, the proliferation of the mesenchymal cells of the mesodermal layer adjacent to these foci, accompaning infiltration\nof lymphoid cells and leukocytes with edema, especially\neosinophilic leukocytes. By these tissue changes a terrace-shaped thickening of the membrane was the result. In the viscera of the chick embryo a special change in the liver was seen, i. e., along the edge of the liver greyish white\nnodules submacroscopic to miliary in size appeared. The principal pathologic change of the foci is the coagulation necrosis of the liver parenchyma and only a slight infiltration about the periphery of the foci was observed. Moreover, proliferation of mesenchymal cells occurred next to the walls of the large blood vessels of the liver (principally, the portal veins) and with the added infiltration of a small number of lymphoid cells and leukocytes sharply defined nodular foci were formed. Though this was a rare instnace, similar pathologic changes were seen also in the walls of the blood vessels of the cerebrum stem of the embryo and along the periphery local gliosis was observed.",

In the stage later than the middle stage of pregnancy, morphological differences appear between the amniotic epithelial cells of placenta and those of the free part and the majority of cases the amniotic epithelial\ncells of placenta present more marked columnar shape than those in the surrounding area of ruptured orifice or those in the vicinity of placenta. However, there still remains a question whether or not such a phenomena is directly related to the secretory function of the placenta amniotic epithelium. 2. It seems that amniotic epithelial cells divide and multiply themselves by mitosis at least in the early and middle stages when their functions are at height.\n3. Even in the stage later than the middle stage generally the amniotic epithelium of placenta is consisted of a single layer of columnar epithelial cells, and therefore, the author cannot agree to Forssell's theory. 4. In glycogen and lipid stainings, the amniotic epithelial cell layer shows more striking changes with the progress of gestational month when compared with those cells in other layers. 5. Glycogen in the amniotic epithelial cell layer is abundant in the early and middle stages of pregnancy, and it rapidly decreases near the late stage. Lipid granules on the contrary are less in the early stage, and\nstart to appear in the middle stage, increasing rapidly towards the late stage. In general, the regressive degeneration picture of the late stage is not distinct histologically, but assuming glycogen to represent the cell\nactivity and the lipid deposit to mean just the reverse, the amniotic epithelium functionally seems to fall into regressive degeneration from the middle stage. Other layers of fetal membranes likewise undergo fatty degeneration as the pregnancy progresses from the middle stage to the late stage. 6. There still remain problems to be solved on the question what role this regressive degeneration of the amniotic epithelial cell layer plays in\nde Watteville's theory, Labor originates from the fetal membranes. However, granular PAS-positive substances in the amniotic epithelium are glycogen, and it seems difficult to connect simply the existence or non-existence of PAS-positive granules or Sudan-positive granules directly with the continuation or interruption of pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Blood cells of schizophrenics differ in many points from\nthose of normal subjects. First of all the shape of them is flat and thin. This tendency is more marked in old group than in new group; the volume is small; flat corpuscles are more numerous in them in the normal; and the blood resistance against diluted saline solution is stronger than that of the normal. It has long since been known that the rate of corpuscle sedimentation is being accelerated in schizophrenics. A simple physical cause that blood corpuscles are flat and numerous can explain\nthis phenomenon. It is said that there is an antisphering substance among the factors controlling the thickness and roundness of blood corpuscles. Yet it has not been determined whether this substance on the surface of the blood of schizophrenics is large or small. Blood corpuscles are said to lose their peculiar disc-shape and to be completely destroyed at the pH of 9.2 when the antisphering substance is removed from the surface of blood\ncorpuscles. The lower the pH is the better is the absorption of this substance on the surface of blood corpuscles; and it seems that the more this substance attaches itself to blood corpuscles the greater is the degree of flatness and in this connection it is\ninteresting to note that the pH of schizophrenic blood is low in low in general. On the other hand, however, sphericity is increased at the time when the acidity of blood is increased due to a sudden movement of acidic substances immediately after ECT. Again in the case of coma of insulin treatment, blood tends to be alkaline and even then an increase in the sphericity of corpuscles is indicated. Consequently it seems tnat the roundness\nof blood corpuscles is not solely dependent upon antisphering substance and pH.",

    "abstract": "The analgesic effects of morphine and some related compounds, such as meperidine, observed by the conventional method, are supplemented by the release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla. It is assumed\nthat this action of epinephrine is not due to an additive synergy in the analgesic effect but to the face that the action of epinephrine on a definite higher center or centers effects synergistically in the reflex depressant\naction of these analgesic agants. This assumption is based on the following evidences. Prolongation of reaction time in mice by morphine and meperidine (but not by ohton), determined by the hot-plate method, was significantly\nreduced by adrenalectomy and this reduction was normalized by the concurrent use of epinephrine, in a small dose which in itself cannot prolong the reaction time. No such action was found in cortisone and DOCA. The effects of morphine and meperidine in prolonging the reaction time\nwere reduced by priscol and dibenamine, as well as by tetraethylammonium salt. A large dose of pyrazolone derivatives causes, not the prolongation of reaction time but a jumping reflex response in the early stages, indicating central excitation, in part of the mice. The ratio of mice exhibiting such an early reflex increases with adrenalectomy or the administration of dibenamine, and is markedly decreased by epinephrine, insufficient to\nshow any analgesic response by itself, and by cortisone. This action of cortisone indicates some difference in the natures of central excitation by pyrazolones and by morphine. Judging from the work of SCHAYER18, the distribution in the brain of epinephrine injected in the dose to normalize the reduced effect of morphine in the adrenalectomized mice, may also be anticipated by the\nepinephrine which might be released from the adrenal medulla by morphine in an amount much smaller than the near·lethal doses9 .",

    "abstract": "Oxytocin (OT) is one of the neuropituitary hormones and is synthesized in the neurons of the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON). Previous studies have shown that the mRNAs encoding OT are delivered from the soma to both dendrites and axons of the neurons in the PVN and SON. However, it has not been elucidated whether a translational regulation mechanism to enable local synthesis of the hormone exists in the axons of the neurons of PVN and SON. Elongation factor 2 (EF2) is essential for polypeptide synthesis during protein translation. Moreover, phosphorylation of EF2 by EF2 kinase enhances the translation of certain mRNA species. In the present study, in order to shed light on the mechanisms involved in the translational regulation of OT synthesis, we investigated the localization of phosphorylated EF2. Phospho-EF2 was localized in the soma of the neurons in PVN and SON, and in the swellings of the median eminence where axonal tracts of the neurons in the PVN and SON exist. The phosphorylated form was also observed in the rat hypophysis. Moreover, phospho-EF2 and OT were colocalized in a part of the neurons in the PVN and SON. These results suggest that OT may be partially translated in the axons of neurons in the PVN and SON, and then secreted from the pituitary.",

And also biochemical and electron microscopic observations were carried out to study the influences of cytoplasmic organellae in the cancer cells (AH 130), the livers of\ncancer bearing animals, and normal liver on the catalase activity of the liver. The results obtained are as follows : Cytoplasmic organellae of various cells do not affect so markedly the hexose metabolism of the liver.\nAs for the amino-acid pattern of cytoplasmic organellae of various cells studied by paperchromatography, it is interesting to note that the pattern of the liver of cancer bearing animals, shows lack in histidine, while in can~er tissue and in the liver of cancer bearing animals an increase in phenylalanine can be observed. The decrease in the liver catalase activity is caused by the primary factor of cancer cells, especially their microsomes, and also by the secondary factor of the liver mitochondria in cancer bearing animals. On the other hand, the mitochondria of cancer cells, instead of reducing the catalase activity in the liver, markedly increases the catalase activity. By the morphological changes observed with light microscope and electron microscope, liver cells revealed marked morphological differences, proving that\nthe microsomes of hepatoma cell induce considerably marked changes in the liver, while the mitochondria of hepatoma cell, on the contrary, induce the hypertrophy of liver cells. Sirriilarly in the electron microscopic observations the mitochondria of mouse liver injected with cancer mitochondria are enlarged, but no destruction of\ncellular structures such as cristae can be recognized. Also microbodies and the growing process of mitochondria can be observed, but no marked changes in endoplasmic reticulum.",

    "abstract": "1. An attempt has been made to find the diagnostic criteria for early gastric cancer. It is most important to detect the evidences or suspected features of the malignant growth in incipient stage in order to attain the radical cure by surgical operation. 2. Twelve patients with early gastric cancer (groups A and B) were selected out of 476 patients who had undergone gastrectomy during the past three years in the Okayama Saiseikai General Hospital. The other 6 patients in the precancerous group (group C) were also studied, who had abnormal epithelial\nproliferation in the resected stomach membrane during the same period. 3. The processes of discovery of early cancer have been described. Fairly precise diagnosis can be made in the mucosal carcinoma, but it is not in the ulcer-carcinoma. It was generally difficult to estimate the degree of the malignancy and the extension of the growth preoperatively. 4. The details of the diagnostic aids are as follows. i. Negative occult blood of stool does not always mean the definite diagnostic aid. ii. The malignant gastric change may occur even in non-anacidity. Further\ninvestigations should be followed up on gastric ulcer patients if malignant alteration is under the consideration. iii. Minor roentgenological findings, such as the absence or irregularity of mucosal folds, rigid and/or overlapped contour, localized absence or decrease of the peristaltic waves and absence or bow-shaped deformity of the angulus, are of important significance. Such changes should be minutely sought for by X-ray film examination. iv. On gastroscopy and gastrocamera photography, such changes as erosion or irregular granular thickening of the membrane with abnormal reddening and edematous appearance, irregularity of ulcer edge, uneven swelling on ulcer margin with reddening and unsharpness of the edge of adherent coat on ulcer floor, must be noted in the early gastric cancer. v. It is not safe to leave a patient having stomach ulceration under a mere conservative management because it is often quite difficult to dissolve the question of malignancy of the lesion with all sorts of examinations. vi. So far as clinical examinations have indicated malignancy, histological examination must be carried out immediately at the time of operation, even when malignant lesion is absent in inspection and palpation on the exposure of the stomach. vii. On the gross observation of the resected stomach, a particular attention must be paid to erosion, depression or atrophy, irregular granular thickening and abnormal reddening on the restricted areas of the mucosal surface.",

Clinical and histological evaluation of so-called chorioepithelioma malignum and hydatidiform mole has been made on the cases treated at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Okayama University Hospital during the 20year period friom 1939 to 1958. 2. CC has been confirmed to be a poor risk in the treatment than CA and SE. 3. The two-year cure rate and the five-year cure rate yield an approximate value in each of CC, CA and SE, so that the two-year survival would be an ideal index for determination of the prognosis. 4. It may be pointed out that CC would indicate a tendency of a higher gonadotropin content suggestive of the poor prognosis, provided the disease contain a greater number of La-cells comparing to Sy-cells. 5. Metastasis of CA is not so infrequent as has been formerly believed, and there were two cases, which proved to be a typical SE and had metastasis to the vaginal wall. 6. Concerning the last labor preceding the chorioepithelioma, it has been clarified that the disease occurs more frequently following spontaneous abortion rather than after artificial abortion. 7. It is noted that the mole showing a marked proliferation of the trophoblasts entailed CC. However, in order to evaluate a correlation of the histological findings of the mole with chance occurrence of the subsquent CC, further study on the cases is required.",

    "abstract": "This study examined whether switching from amlodipine and atorvastatin treatment using two pills to an equal dose of single-pill therapy is useful in Japanese outpatients. We retrospectively reviewed data obtained from 94 outpatients for whom treatment with two pills, namely amlodipine and atorvastatin, was switched to an equal dose of single-pill therapy in 11 hospitals. The criterion for enrollment in this study was that patients had switched their medication without changing other anti-hypertensive or anti-cholesterol drugs. Neither systolic nor diastolic blood pressure changed significantly after switching to an equal dose of single-pill therapy, whereas low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels significantly decreased after the medication was switched from 94±24 mg/dl to 89±17 mg/dl (p=0.015). A switch from medication with two separate pills of amlodipine and atorvastatin to an equal dose of single-pill therapy resulted in an overall decrease in LDL cholesterol. The results indicated that the switch to single-pill therapy might be a useful treatment.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to derive new formulas to provide an optimal surgical procedure and optimal amount of recession-resection (RR) surgery in intermittent exotropia (IXT) with a disparity in angle of deviation depending on the fixation distance. The records of 117 consecutive patients with IXT who underwent RR surgery between March 2008 and December 2011 at Okayama University Hospital were retrospectively examined. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed using the observed corrective angle of deviation at distance or near fixation as the dependent variable, and amounts of lateral rectus muscle (LR) recession (mm) and medial rectus muscle (MR) resection, and age at surgery (years) as independent variables. Two simultaneous formulas were derived: corrective angle of deviation at distance fixation (°)=1.8×recession (mm)+1.6× resection (mm)+0.15×age (years)-6.6, and corrective angle at near fixation (°)=1.5×recession (mm)+1.7× resection (mm)+0.18×age (years)-3.8. Comparisons of coefficient values of the formulas between distance and near fixation revealed that LR recession was more affected by the corrective angle in distance than near fixation. MR resection was more affected at near than distance fixation. We found that our new formulas estimated the appropriate amount of unilateral RR surgery.",

Subjects were 43 patients (ACL tip aimer: 20 knees; PLD guide: 23 knees) who underwent double-bundle ACL reconstruction between September 2014 and December 2017. In all cases, the tibial tunnel position, tunnel edge distance and tunnel angles were evaluated based on CT images. Clinical outcome was evaluated using the Lachman test, pivot-shift test, and Lysholm score. Tibial tunnel positions were similar between the conventional and PLD guide groups, while tibial tunnel edge distance was significantly less in the conventional group. Tunnel coalition was observed in 5 knees in the conventional and no knees in the PLD guide group. Distance between two tibial tunnel centers was 9.1 mm for the tip aimer, and 10.5 mm for the PLD guide. Creation of the PL tunnel tended to involve insertion from a more medial aspect for the PLD guide group than the conventional guide group. No differences in clinical outcomes were noted. The PLD guide can be used to create anatomically-positioned PL tunnels, and reduce the probability of occurrence of tunnel coalition.",

    "abstract": "Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a promising method for controlling tumors, although it does not entirely eliminate recurrence. Oxidative stress is associated with the progression of hepatocarcinogenesis, while also acting as an anticancer response. The objective of the present study was to investigate the factors influencing post-RFA outcomes. We recruited 235 newly diagnosed HCC patients who received RFA for single tumors. The patients with recurrence were sub-grouped into early and segmental recurrence groups. The characteristics of the sub-grouped patients were evaluated, including by measuring oxidative stress marker reactive oxygen metabolites and antioxidant marker OXY-adsorbent tests. The factors associated with poor survival were a high Child-Pugh score and early recurrence within 2 years in the same segment. The patients who experienced recurrence within 2 years in the same segment showed a larger tumor diameter than did others. According to a multivariate analysis, the OXY values were also significantly low in these patients. In conclusion, maintaining the antioxidant reservoir function with a high OXY value might be necessary to prevent early recurrence within the RFA-treated segment.",

In this study, we investigated the associations between partial carbon dioxide pressure (pCO2) and each of sodium ion (Na+) concentrations, chloride ion (Cl-) concentrations and their difference (SIDNa-Cl). Blood gas data were obtained from patients in a teaching hospital intensive care unit between August 2013 and January 2017. The association between pCO2 and SIDNa-Cl was defined as the primary outcome. The associations between pCO2 and [Cl-], [Na+] and other strong ions were secondary outcomes. pCO2 was stratified into 10 mmHg-wide bands and treated as a categorical variable for comparison. As a result, we reviewed 115,936 blood gas data points from 3,840 different ICU stays. There were significant differences in SIDNa-Cl, [Cl-], and [Na+] among all categorized pCO2 bands. The respective pCO2 SIDNa-Cl, [Cl-], and [Na+] correlation coefficients were 0.48, -0.31, and 0.08. SIDNa-Cl increased and [Cl-] decreased with pCO2, with little relationship between pCO2 and [Na+] across subsets. In conclusion, we found relatively strong correlations between pCO2 and SIDNa-Cl in the multiple blood gas datasets examined. Correlations between pCO2 and chloride concentrations, but not sodium concentrations, were further found to be moderate in these ICU data.",

    "abstract": "The importance of centralizing treatment services for severely ill children has been well established, but such entralization remains difficult in Japan. We aimed to compare the trauma and illness severity and mortality of children admitted to two common types of ICUs for children. According to the type of management and disposition of the medical provider, we classified ICUs as pediatric ICUs [PICUs] or general ICUs, and analyzed differences in endogenous and exogenous illness settings between them. Overall, 1,333 pediatric patients were included, with 1,143 patients admitted to PICUs and 190 patients to general ICUs. The Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category score (PCPC) at discharge was significantly lower in the PICU group (adjusted OR: 0.45; 95%CI: 0.23-0.88). Death and unfavorable neurological outcomes occurred less often in the PICU group (adjusted OR: 0.29; 95%CI: 0.14-0.60). However, when limited to exogenous illness, PCPC scores (adjusted OR: 0.38; 95%CI: 0.07-1.99) or death/unfavorable outcomes (adjusted OR: 0.72; 95%CI: 0.08-6.34) did not differ between the groups. PCPC deterioration and overall sequelae/death rates were lower in PICUs for children with endogenous illnesses, although the outcomes of exogenous illness were similar between the 2 unit types. Further studies on the necessity of centralization are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Vascular-access interventions are necessary for the continuation of hemodialysis, and they are performed under X-ray guidance. During interventions, patients' accidental falls from the bed are a serious problem, and spe-cialized fixation systems for hemodialysis patients to prevent their falls from the bed have been lacking. We developed a new fixation plate made of polypropylene homopolymer and tested its ability to prevent such falls retrospectively. This plate, which we named the 'vascular-access intervention assistance plate,' offers functional features such as the concurrent fixation of the body and either arm and an arm space with serrations for fixing a forearm strap. We performed computer simulations to examine the strength of the plate, and we evaluated the efficacy of fall prevention by reviewing patients' medical records. The results demonstrated that the functional design of the plate provides good operability via accurate concurrent fixations of the body and arm. The com-puter simulation analysis results indicated the plate's sufficient strength. The medical records analysis revealed three accidental falls before the plate's introduction (401 patients, 1,437 interventions), and none after plate introduction (683 patients, 1,872 interventions). Accidental falls were significantly prevented by use of the plate (p < 0.05). The dementia rate and type of procedure were not significantly different between the patients who fell and those who did not. This vascular-access intervention assisted plate provides good operability and safety by preventing accidental falls among hemodialysis patients.",

Enhanced transcapillary passage of anionic ferritin was observed in experimental rats. Purified glomerular basement membranes of control and experimental rats were examined by electron microscopy after negative staining. The glomerular basement membrane of experimental rats had enlarged pores. The results suggest that an increase in the radius of glomerular pores may be responsible for proteinuria in glomerulonephritis.",
