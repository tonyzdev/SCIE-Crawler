    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease is the most common cause of dementia and the fifth leading cause of death in adults older than 65 years. The estimated total healthcare costs for the treatment of Alzheimer disease in 2020 is estimated at $305 billion, with the cost expected to increase to more than $1 trillion as the population ages. Most of the direct costs of care for Alzheimer disease are attributed to skilled nursing care, home healthcare, and hospice care. Indirect costs of care, including quality of life and informal caregiving, are likely underestimated and are associated with significant negative societal and personal burden. Managed care organizations are in a unique position to develop utilization strategies that would positively impact early diagnosis and treatment to lead to better outcomes and lower costs for patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system. Additionally, the recent inclusion of Alzheimer disease diagnoses into risk corridor calculations by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services may encourage Medicare Advantage organizations to invest in programs that aid in its early detection and diagnosis.",

It has a negative impact on vulnerable patient groups, including active military personnel and veterans, patients with coexisting psychiatric and medical disorders, those in life transitions such as menopause, and elderly persons. Although cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI) is first-line treatment for insomnia, its high cost and a lack of trained providers has prevented widespread uptake. Now, digital CBTI (dCBTI) is emerging as a scalable option with the potential to overcome these barriers in managed care. The first part of this article reviews the epidemiology and pathophysiology of insomnia with a focus on vulnerable patient groups. The second part explores the rapidly evolving landscape of nondrug therapy for insomnia. The underlying concepts and supporting evidence for CBTI and dCBTI are presented, including their utility in vulnerable patient groups.",

However, since the publication of the ACC/AHA/TOS document, several relevant pharmacotherapies have been approved by the FDA, a medication was withdrawn from the market, and several procedures and device types for weight loss have been recommended or FDA-approved. Simultaneously, research in obesity treatment has advanced, and leaders in the field have issued complementary guidance. This article summarizes and synthesizes the 2013 ACC/AHA/TOS and the 2016 AACE/ACE guidelines and includes updates from more recent professional association guidance. Measurement of body mass index is recommended to initiate evaluation for overweight and obesity and determine disease classification. To stage disease severity, weight-related conditions should be assessed. Although lifestyle therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment for this disease, both pharmacotherapy and metabolic and bariatric surgery produce greater and more sustained weight loss in treatment-approved populations as compared with lifestyle modifications alone. An ongoing partnership between the patient and clinician is highly recommended to manage this serious, progressive, chronic disease.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Today, more than 6 million Americans are living with AD and that number is expected to increase to 13.8 million by 2060. The progressive debilitating nature of this illness and the absence of disease-modifying treatments contributes to a substantial economic and societal burden on the healthcare system. In 2022, the estimated healthcare costs associated with AD treatment were $321 billion, with costs projected to exceed $1 trillion by 2050. These cost-of-care projections are based on direct healthcare costs and are likely underestimated because indirect costs associated with AD treatment are usually not included. Indirect costs such as loss in productivity, diminished quality of life, and an increasing dependence on informal unpaid care provided by family caregivers augments the economic and societal burden of this disease. As drug development continues to evolve, the emergence of disease-modifying therapy may help to offset the burden associated with AD-related dementia. Managed care organizations are uniquely positioned to mitigate costs and positively impact outcomes through the promotion of disease awareness, early diagnosis, and treatment and disease management programs focused on multidisciplinary care coordination and caregiver support.

PGx medical policies as of February 1, 2024, were ascertained through Policy Reporter for top national insurers, LBMs, and the Palmetto GBA Molecular Diagnostic Services (MolDX) Program, which determines whether a molecular diagnostic test is covered by Medicare. Data elements included date of last policy update, coverage status for each drug-gene pair, and evidence cited for or against coverage. A drug-gene pair was considered covered if the policy indicated that a PGx test was deemed medically necessary and/or meets coverage criteria. Policies from 8 insurers, 3 LBMs, and MolDX were available and reviewed. MolDX covered all 65 individual drug-gene pairs, followed by Avalon Healthcare Solutions (n = 50) and UnitedHealthcare (n = 45); these 3 also covered multigene panels. Eight policies covered 10 or fewer drug-gene pairs. HLA-B*57:01 testing prior to abacavir initiation and HLA-B*15:02 testing prior to carbamazepine initiation were covered across all policies. Drug-gene pairs with Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium guidelines and/or included in the FDA's Table of Pharmacogenetic Associations Section 1 were more commonly covered. Society guidelines were the most frequently cited evidence (413 times), and cost-effectiveness studies were infrequently cited (43 times). We found significant variability in medical policy determinations and evidence cited for clinically relevant PGx tests among major US health insurers and LBMs. A collaborative effort between payers and the PGx community to standardize evidence evaluation may lead to more consistent coverage and improve patient access to PGx tests meeting evidence requirements.",

Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Using billing data from 8 acute care hospitals, we identified 9 principal medical diagnoses from International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes across 4 medical specialties (cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, and urology). In addition, we defined a combined obstetrical falsification end point. We compared daily admission rates during the pandemic period (3/1/2020-4/30/2020) with the same dates in 2019 (3/1/2019-4/30/2019). As a reference, we also compared a prepandemic period in the same years (1/1/2019-2/28/2019 and 1/1/2020-2/29/2020). We compared admission rates between years using t tests. Results There were 3219 admissions for the conditions of interest during the study period in 2019 and 2661 in 2020. There was no difference in prepandemic daily admission rates in 2020 compared with 2019 (29.04 vs 27.63 admissions per day; -4.9%; P = .50). During the pandemic period, there was a 33.7% decrease in admission rates for all conditions combined in 2020 compared with 2019 (24.68 vs 16.37; -33.7%; P = .03). By specialty, the combined gastroenterology (10.22 vs 7.20; -29.6%; P = .02) and cardiovascular (2.34 vs 1.29; -44.7%; P = .05) end points demonstrated reduction in daily admission rates. Conclusions Daily admission rates during the COVID-19 pandemic were lower for these acute medical conditions. Public awareness campaigns are urgently needed to reassure the public about the safety of presenting for care.",

Educational ObjectivesUpon completion of this activity, participants will be able to: • Classify the pathophysiology, etiology, prognosis, and quality of life burden associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).• Explore the current treatment landscape, updated safety and efficacy data, and new and emerging therapies for PAH.• Identify the costs associated with PAH and opportunities to slow progression and improve outcomes in this patient population.

The primary exposure was the combination of individual behavior changes, state stay-at-home orders, and the Independence expansion of billing policies for telemedicine. The comparison population consisted of telemedicine visits in the prepandemic period.Telemedicine increased rapidly from a mean (SD) of 773 (155) weekly visits in prepandemic 2020 to 45,632 (19,937) weekly visits in the pandemic period. During the pandemic period, a greater proportion of telemedicine users were older, had Medicare Advantage insurance plans, had existing chronic conditions, or resided in predominantly non-Hispanic Black or African American Census tracts compared with during the prepandemic period. A significant increase in telemedicine claims containing a mental health-related diagnosis was observed.Telemedicine expanded rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic across a broad range of clinical conditions and demographics. Although levels declined later in 2020, telemedicine utilization remained markedly higher than 2019 and 2018 levels.

    "abstract": "Background The close association of type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) suggests that they share a common physiologic antecedent, postulated to be tissue resistance to insulin. Insulin resistance is associated with a cluster of risk factors recognized as the metabolic syndrome. Objective To describe the epidemiology of the insulin resistance syndrome, also known as the metabolic syndrome. Methods Overall obesity, central obesity, dyslipidemia characterized by elevated levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hyperglycemia, and hypertension are common traits that, when they occur together, constitute the metabolic syndrome. The World Health Organization and the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III have proposed working definitions for the syndrome based on these traits. Cross-sectional and longitudinal epidemiologic studies provide an emerging picture of the prevalence and outcomes of the syndrome. Results National survey data suggest the metabolic syndrome is very common, affecting about 24% of US adults who are 20 to 70 years of age and older. The syndrome is more common in older people and in Mexican Americans. People with the syndrome are about twice as likely to develop CVD and over 4 times as likely to develop type 2 diabetes compared with subjects who do not have metabolic syndrome. While this syndrome may have a genetic basis, environmental factors are important modifiable risk factors for the condition. Conclusions The metabolic syndrome is very common and will become even more common as populations age and become more obese. Treatment for component traits is known to reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes and CVD; whether risk is reduced by treatment of the syndrome, specifically, remains uncertain. Primary care physicians must recognize that the co-occurrence of risk factors for type 2 diabetes and CVD represents an extremely adverse metabolic state warranting aggressive risk factor intervention.",

Two-thirds (66.6%) were 65 years and older, 71.6% were women, and 41.2% were commercial (not Medicare Advantage) enrollees. The most common fracture sites were spine (21.9%), radius/ulna (19.5%), and hip (13.7%). Mean (SD) total all-cause healthcare cost was $34,855 ($56,094), with most paid by health plans ($31,863 [$55,025]) versus patients ($2992 [$2935]). Most healthcare costs were for medical ($31,766 [$54,943]) versus pharmacy ($3089 [$6799]) services. Approximately 75% of patients received rehabilitation services (mean [SD] cost = $18,025 [$41,318]). Diagnosis of index fracture during an inpatient stay versus an outpatient visit (cost ratio, 2.16; 95% CI, 2.13-2.19) and fractures at multiple sites (cost ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.21-1.26) were the leading predictors of cost. Kaplan-Meier estimated cumulative second-fracture rates were 6.6% at 1 year, 12.3% at 2 years, 16.9% at 3 years, and 20.9% at 4 years after index fracture.These findings suggest a significant economic burden associated with fractures, including a high total all-cause cost of care. Early identification and treatment of patients at high risk of fractures are of paramount importance to reduce fracture risk and associated healthcare costs.",

The aggregate total of direct and indirect insomnia healthcare costs has been estimated to be as high as $100 billion US dollars per year. In addition to the societal cost burden, insomnia also negatively affects patients' quality of life (QOL), including social and occupational functioning or productivity as well as impaired cognition or mood. Insomnia may also exacerbate and increase morbidity and complications from psychological disorders, such as depression, as well as have serious consequences, such as increased risk of suicide. Comorbidities, medications, and/or psychosocial contributors may negatively influence QOL. Many medications for the treatment of insomnia have adverse effect (AE) profiles that increase the risk of falls and related injuries, cognitive impairment, and motor vehicle accidents. These AEs place additional burden on the already vulnerable older adult population and those with comorbidities. Managed care organizations must evaluate clinical considerations, including safety profiles and the negative impact of disease on patients' QOL, to develop strategies for cost-effective treatment plans for patients with insomnia and to ensure appropriate use of these medications.",

Biosimilars could lower biologic prices through competition, but barriers to increasing both supply and uptake remain. We projected US biosimilar savings from 2021 to 2025 under different scenarios. Study Design:, We projected US spending on biologics over a 5-year period under 3 scenarios: (1) a baseline scenario holding quarter 4 (Q4) of 2020 market conditions constant; (2) under main assumptions allowing for biosimilar market growth and entry; and (3) an upper-bound scenario assuming greater biosimilar uptake, more robust price competition, and quicker biosimilar entry. Methods:, We first analyzed 2014-2020 US volume and price data from IQVIA’s MIDAS database for biologics already facing biosimilar competition to inform model parameter values. We used these inputs to project biosimilar entry, biosimilar volume shares, biosimilar prices, and reference biologic prices. We calculated 2021-2025 new savings from biosimilar competition vs the Q4 2020 baseline. Results:, Estimated biosimilar savings from 2021 to 2025 under our main approach were $38.4 billion, or 5.9% of projected spending on biologics over the same period. Biologics first facing biosimilar competition from 2021 to 2025 accounted for $26.1 billion of savings, with $12.2 billion from evolving market conditions for already-marketed biosimilars. Furthermore, $24.6 billion of savings under our main approach were from downward pressure on reference biologic prices rather than lower biosimilar prices. Savings were substantially higher ($124.5 billion) under the upper-bound scenario. Conclusions:, Biosimilar savings from 2021 to 2025 were $38.4 billion under our main assumptions. Greater savings may be feasible if managed care and other settings increase biosimilar utilization and promote competition.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Telemedicine use expanded greatly during the COVID-19 pandemic, and broad use of telemedicine is expected to persist beyond the pandemic. More evidence on the efficiency and safety of different telemedicine modalities is needed to inform clinical and policy decisions around telemedicine use. To evaluate the efficiency and safety of telemedicine, we compared treatment and follow-up care between video and telephone visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study Design: Observational study of patient-scheduled telemedicine visits for primary care. Methods: We used multivariate logistic regression to compare treatment (medication prescribing, laboratory/imaging orders) and 7-day follow-up care (in-person office visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations) between video and telephone visits, adjusted for patient characteristics. Results: Among 734,442 telemedicine visits, 58.4% were telephone visits. Adjusted rates of medication prescribing and laboratory/imaging orders were higher in video visits than telephone visits, with differences of 3.5% (95% CI, 3.3%-3.8%) and 3.9% (95% CI, 3.6%-4.1%), respectively. Adjusted rates of 7-day follow-up in-person office visits, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations were lower after video than telephone visits, with differences of 0.7% (95% CI, 0.5%-0.9%), 0.3% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.3%), and 0.04% (95% CI, 0.02%-0.06%), respectively. Conclusions: Among telemedicine visits with primary care clinicians, return visits were not common and downstream emergency events were rare. Adjusted rates of treatment measures were higher and adjusted rates of follow-up care were lower for video visits than telephone visits. Although video visits were marginally more efficient than telephone visits, telephone visits may offer an accessible option to address patient primary care needs without raising safety concerns.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Use of telehealth has been on the rise since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there has been much investigation of telehealth use in the context of replacing in-person visits, there has been limited study of patients' motivations for using telehealth. The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate patient characteristics associated with telehealth use and (2) evaluate patients' motivations for using telehealth. Study Design: We conducted a cross-sectional secondary data analysis of the 2022 nationally representative Health Information National Trends Survey. Methods: We conducted logistic regression models estimating the relationship between demographic and health characteristics and (1) use of telehealth services in the previous 12 months and (2) each of 5 motivations for using telehealth among telehealth users. Results: The most common reason for using telehealth was recommendation or requirement by a clinician (73.6%). Respondents with depression were more likely to use telehealth than those without depression (OR, 2.73; ,P, < .001) and were more likely to be motivated by convenience (OR, 1.80; ,P, < .01), and Hispanic respondents were more likely to use telehealth to avoid exposure to infection (OR, 1.58; ,P, < .05). Conclusions: Identifying patients' motivations may help decision makers better understand the perceived value of telehealth among patients and may help policy makers and administrators create opportunities for increased patient choice around visit modality to maximize health care access, value, and quality. Consideration of patient motivations for telehealth use may support practitioners in making tailored and person-centered decisions when recommending telehealth vs in-person visits.",

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2020 estimated that 25% of participants had at least 1 CKM condition. It is proposed that CKM syndrome originates in excess and/or dysfunctional adipose tissue, which secretes proinflammatory and prooxidative products leading to damaged tissues in arteries, the heart, and the kidney, and reduction in insulin sensitivity. CKM syndrome is classified into 4 stages based on the presence of risk factors and clinical signs. Risk factors associated with progression of CKM syndrome include chronic inflammatory conditions, family history of diabetes or kidney disease, mental health and sleep disorders, increased levels of elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and sex-specific risk enhancers. There are substantial racial and ethnic differences, although they are likely due to social determinants of health (SDOH). The American Heart Association suggests that CKM syndrome screening should include both biological factors and SDOH. Interventions in patients with stages 0 to 3 CKM syndrome focus on preventing future cardiovascular events by management of excess adiposity, mainly through diet and exercise in the early stages, then through pharmacological treatment of metabolic syndrome components in later stages. There is a general acceptance that treatment of CKM syndrome should involve a holistic approach to prevention, screening, and management to improve outcomes and reduce long-term morbidity and mortality.",

Adjustment was made for under-reporting of pure cash prescriptions in the data.Elderly patients' utilization in the first year of Part D increased compared with that of near-elderly patients by 8.1% for days' supply and 4.8% for the number of individuals filling prescriptions, and their OOP costs declined by 17.2%. Although elderly patients' OOP costs in the second year were reduced an additional 5.8%, days' supply increased by only an additional 1.0%. Correcting for the under-reporting of pure cash prescriptions yielded effects of 8.1% and -3.5% for days' supply and -15.6% and -7.2% for OOP costs in 2006 and 2007, respectively. A standardized comparison with previous estimates from Walgreens data showed that our utilization estimates were 2.6 times larger.Part D lowered elderly patients' OOP costs and increased utilization, primarily during the first year of the program.

The study investigated the ability of machine learning models to predict risk using only publicly available and purchasable SDH data. A total of 138,115 patients were analyzed from a deidentified database representing 3 health systems in the United States.A hold-out methodology was used to ensure that the model's performance could be tested on a completely independent set of subjects. A proprietary decision tree methodology was used to make the predictions. Only the socioeconomic features-age group, gender, and race-were used in the prediction of a patient's risk of admission.The decision tree-based machine learning approach analyzed in this study was able to predict inpatient and emergency department utilization with a high degree of discrimination using only purchasable and publicly available data on SDH.This study indicates that it is possible to risk-stratify patients' risk of utilization without interacting with the patient or collecting information beyond the patient's age, gender, race, and address. The implications of this application are wide and have the potential to positively affect health systems by facilitating targeted patient outreach with specific, individualized interventions to tackle detrimental SDH at not only the individual level but also the neighborhood level.",

Despite their widespread use, relatively little is known about the impact of these programs in Medicaid populations. This study evaluated the impact of a complex care management program on spending and utilization for high-need, high-cost Medicaid patients.Randomized quality improvement trial conducted at CareMore Health in Memphis, Tennessee. A total of 253 high-need, high-cost Medicaid patients were randomized in a 1:2 ratio to complex care management or usual care.Intention-to-treat analysis compared regression-adjusted rates of spending and utilization between patients randomized to the complex care program (n = 71) and those randomized to usual care (n = 127) over the 12 months following randomization. Primary outcomes included total medical expenditures (TME) and inpatient (IP) days. Secondary outcomes included IP admission, emergency department (ED) visits, care center visits, and specialist visits.Compared with patients randomized to usual care, patients randomized to complex care management had lower TME (adjusted difference, -$7732 per member per year [PMPY]; 95% CI, -$14,914 to -$550; P = .036), fewer IP bed days (adjusted difference, -3.46 PMPY; 95% CI, -4.03 to -2.89; P <.001), fewer IP admissions (adjusted difference, -0.32 PMPY; 95% CI, -0.54 to -0.11; P = .014), and fewer specialist visits (adjusted difference, -1.35 PMPY; 95% CI, -1.98 to -0.73; P <.001). There was no significant impact on care center or ED visits.Carefully designed and targeted complex care management programs may be an effective approach to caring for high-need, high-cost Medicaid patients.",

The Migraine Impact Model (MIM) is an interactive calculator developed to estimate the economic burden of migraine on United States-based employers. We demonstrate use of the model with 4 case studies from different industries (education, manufacturing, retail/trade, and entertainment). The MIM estimates migraine prevalence among employees and the employer's annual migraine-associated costs by applying published, licensed, and publicly available data and several underlying assumptions to employee population information that is inputted by users. User inputs include the employer's industry, geographic location, and workforce characteristics (number of employees, gender distribution, and average age and compensation). Model outputs include estimated migraine prevalence, annual workdays affected by migraine, and annual migraine-associated indirect and direct costs to the employer. In the case studies presented, workforce size ranged from 18,800 to 250,000, representing midsized to larger employers. Employee gender distribution ranged from 29% to 74% women, and mean employee age was either 41 or 44 years. The model-estimated percentage of employees with migraine ranged from 14% to 19%. The model projected approximately 60,000 to 686,000 annual workdays to be affected by lost productive time due to migraine (often referred to as \"absenteeism\" and \"presenteeism\") and estimated annual indirect costs to total between 6.2 and 8.5 times the annual direct costs. The MIM estimates the economic burden of migraine on a company's workforce, which may aid employers in making data-driven decisions to reduce that burden for employees and business.",

The mean (SD) age of our cohort was 53.8 (15.8) years, 61% were female, 9% were Black, 38% were Hispanic, and 87% reported speaking English. The statistically significant β coefficients in the FRS model corresponded to being born outside of the United States, being a racial minority, living alone, having a high social isolation score, and having a low geocoded median household income (P < .01). Increasing quartile of SDOH score was significantly associated with higher systolic blood pressure, FRS, glycated hemoglobin, and smoking pack-years (P < .05). It was also associated with fewer minutes spent exercising weekly (P < .01).The addition of self-reported SDOH data has a dose effect on CVD risk factors.

    "abstract": "During a surge of COVID-19 cases, the majority of care delivery at a large academic medical center moved to virtual care. Due to COVID-19-associated regulatory changes, virtual care is now delivered through telephone and videoconferencing platforms. Although virtual platforms allow patients to access care while socially distancing, patients with limited English proficiency (LEP) face structural barriers to these platforms, including lack of access to technology, need for medical interpreters, unfriendly patient portals, and increased privacy concerns. Strategies for increasing access to virtual platforms and technology for patients with LEP included offering patient education in multiple languages, reducing barriers to patient portal enrollment, and addressing the technology literacy gap through the use of tablets and bilingual interns. Strategies for addressing privacy concerns for patients with LEP included developing a low-literacy script and other actions that address patient concerns about Immigration and Customs Enforcement and mitigate perceived risk, as well as identifying a virtual platform that meets privacy regulations and does not require a patient to download an application to their phone or computer to join. Strategies for integrating medical interpreters into virtual visits included assessing existing virtual platforms for the ability to host a third party, changing the electronic health record software (Epic) interface, and convening directors of interpreter departments at each site to ensure comprehensive system rollout. Health care organizations that rely heavily on virtual visits to provide patient care will need to take all these challenges into consideration for patients with LEP.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between Medicare Advantage (MA) risk payment arrangements and outcomes for patients in traditional Medicare (TM) has not been empirically examined. The objective of this study was to determine whether providers with greater exposure to MA risk payments are associated with superior outcomes for their TM patients. Retrospective, cross-sectional regression analysis. Using 2016-2019 Medicare claims, this analysis of TM beneficiaries compared quality and efficiency when care is provided by physicians with high exposure to MA risk payments vs physicians with lower risk exposure. The exposure was physician group exposure to MA risk payments, and the main outcomes were 26 quality and efficiency measures. Our overall sample comprised 22,257,955 TM beneficiary-years. After we adjusted for demographic differences and risk scores, receiving care from a physician with high risk exposure was associated with higher quality and efficiency across 22 of 26 measures. Improvements in the 22 measures ranged from 3% to 82%. Our study is the first to examine the association between providers' exposure to MA risk payments and the outcomes they achieve beyond MA, specifically for their TM patients. We found that quality and efficiency outcomes for TM patients were higher under physician groups with high MA risk exposure. Although our study is not causal in nature, to the extent that such a relationship exists, it suggests that the benefits of MA risk payment arrangements extend beyond MA. Consequently, if more MA lives become subject to risk payment arrangements, the magnitude of potential benefits to the TM program could further increase.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic propelled telemental health utilization among children seeking mental health (MH) services. We examined racial and ethnic disparities in telemental health use among publicly insured children before and following COVID-19. We identified 36,877,141 child-year observations among publicly insured children aged 3 to 17 years with MH-related encounters in a given year from 2016 to 2020. Multivariable linear regressions controlling for individual- and county-level confounders estimated changes in telemental health use before (2016-2019) and following the pandemic (2020) and how these changes differed by individual- and county-level race and ethnicity. The percentage of publicly insured children using telemental health increased from 2.74% pre-COVID-19 to 35.90% in 2020. Among non-Hispanic White children, 3.41% used telemental health care pre-COVID-19, which increased by 36.49 percentage points (PP) in 2020. Non-Hispanic Black children had a lower percentage of telemental health use (2.50%) pre-COVID-19, which increased by 31.20 PP in 2020, resulting in a 5.39 PP smaller increase than non-Hispanic White children (P < .001). Similarly, Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian, and non-Hispanic Pacific Islander children had 6.19 PP, 15.45 PP, and 12.10 PP smaller increases in telemental health use in 2020 compared with non-Hispanic White children (all P < .001). Moreover, children in counties with the highest (vs lowest) quartiles of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic populations had lower pre-COVID-19 telemental health use and smaller increases in 2020 (all P < .001). Racial and ethnic disparities in telemental health use widened following COVID-19. Future research should evaluate how telemental health use impacted MH care quality and outcomes among publicly insured children.",

According to the American Medical Association, 94% of patients experience delays in care and 78% abandon treatment altogether. These delays in care are often for lifesaving treatments and can result in adverse events. Additionally, PAs place an extensive administrative and financial burden on both patients and providers, often requiring several hours of seeking approval from insurance companies or requiring patients to try one or more other therapeutic avenues before an insurance company will approve the original course of treatment. This is all while insurance companies are making record profits each year. Frustrations with this system are leading to a rise in the number of physician practices switching to a cash-only business model, which increases autonomy, enables price transparency, and benefits both physicians and patients.",

Expenditure and utilization measures were compared with those for a control group covered by employers in the same industry and geographic location, while controlling for patient characteristics.The HSA-eligible plan was associated with significantly lower total expenditures (-17.4%), fewer and less costly office visits (-13.6% and -20.3%, respectively), fewer emergency department (ED) visits (-20.1%), lower pharmacy expenditures (-29.2%), lower expenses per drug (-27.9%), a reduced likelihood of mammograms (odds ratio [OR] = 0.55, P <.05) and Papanicolaou tests (OR = 0.66, P <.05), and a borderline significant reduction in routine physical exams (OR = 0.76, P <.10). The HSA-eligible plan also was associated with increased outpatient facility expenditures (5.1%, P <.05).Employer-sponsored HSA-eligible plans appear to be associated with lower healthcare expenditures and/or utilization, particularly for office visits, ED visits, and pharmacy. However, they also may discourage preventive care, leading to increased long-term medical costs. Employers offering HSA-eligible plans should ensure that there are no financial barriers for preventive services.",

While many biologics will be going off patent, there will likely be multiple prospective manufacturers of biosimilars, and a growing emphasis on regulatory guidelines to ensure their efficacy and safety, in the very near future. A strong factor and assumption surrounding biosimilar development and use is the potential for healthcare cost savings; the introduction of biosimilars is expected to reduce drug costs, although to a lesser degree than seen with small-molecule generic drugs.

People living with schizophrenia often experience a reduced quality of life (QOL) and are more likely to be homeless, unemployed, or living in poverty compared with the general population. Life expectancy for patients with schizophrenia is 15 to 20 years below the average and is complicated by numerous comorbidities, such as weight gain, increased cardiovascular risk, and changes in mood and cognition. Treatment nonadherence can increase the risk of relapse, rehospitalization, and self-harm, leading to a reduced QOL and increased economic burden. Managed care professionals are positioned to improve adherence and outcomes through various drug utilization strategies. Clinicians may also empower patients with schizophrenia through shared decision making and the creation of a therapeutic alliance. Careful monitoring of medication-related adverse effects and offering potential medication alternatives and routes of administration when indicated may also improve adherence to treatment regimens, resulting in improved outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.",

Guidelines recommend a combined treatment approach with both pharmacologic agents and psychological interventions for first-episode psychosis, acute exacerbations, and relapse prevention. Presently, multiple agents are available for the treatment of schizophrenia; however, the majority do not address negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction, with many patients having debilitating residual symptoms, difficulties with adherence, and drug-related adverse effects. To address these concerns, new research evaluating investigational therapies has been undertaken to examine novel treatment strategies.

    "abstract": "Standard ocular drug delivery methods generally are safe and effective for treating diseases of the eye. However, many routes of administration carry the risk of adverse effects due to drug exposure to anterior ocular tissues. Additionally, these delivery methods may not result in high and consistent levels of a therapeutic agent delivered to target tissues for diseases affecting the posterior segment of the eye. Injection into the suprachoroidal space (SCS) represents an alternative method of ocular drug delivery to the posterior segment. SCS injection facilitates targeted distribution to affected chorioretinal tissues for potential efficacy benefits, compartmentalization away from unaffected anterior segment tissues for potential safety benefits, and a high degree of bioavailability. Furthermore, the SCS may serve as a drug depot for long-acting drug delivery of small-molecule suspensions. Until recently, drug delivery to the SCS could be achieved only in the operating room setting with anesthetic immobilization of the eye and surgical dissection through the sclera. A novel microneedle device, the SCS Microinjector® (Clearside Biomedical, Inc) was developed to permit physicians to administer therapies safely and reliably into the SCS in the office setting. Successful use of SCS injection has been demonstrated with triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension (Xipere®, Bausch + Lomb), a novel formulation optimized for use with the SCS Microinjector®. FDA approval of this combination drug and device for the treatment of macular edema associated with uveitis (UME) was based on outcomes from the phase 3 PEACHTREE study (NCT02595398); other important studies included its long-term observational extension (MAGNOLIA; NCT02952001) and an open-label safety study (AZALEA; NCT03097315). The SCS Microinjector® together with triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension for use in the SCS presents an opportunity for safe and effective drug delivery for the treatment of UME and, potentially, for broader use with alternate medications to treat other ocular diseases that impact chorioretinal tissues (eg, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, choroidal melanoma).",

Study Design: Qualitative study with patients and providers from primary care practices in 3 National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network sites in New York, New York; North Carolina; and Florida. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted, audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using an inductive process. Data related to privacy and information security were analyzed. Results: Sixty-five patients and 21 providers participated. Patients and providers faced technology-related security concerns as well as difficulties ensuring privacy in the transformed shared space of telemedicine. Patients expressed increased comfort doing telemedicine from home but often did not like their providers to offer virtual visits from outside an office setting. Providers initially struggled to find secure and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant platforms and devices to host the software. Whereas some patients preferred familiar platforms such as FaceTime, others recognized potential security concerns. Audio-only encounters sometimes raised patient concerns that they would not be able to confirm the identity of the provider. Conclusions: Telemedicine led to novel concerns about privacy because patients and providers were often at home or in public spaces, and they shared concerns about software and hardware security. In addition to technological safeguards, our study emphasizes the critical role of physical infrastructure in ensuring privacy and security. As telemedicine continues to evolve, it is important to address and mitigate concerns around privacy and security to ensure high-quality and safe delivery of care to patients in remote settings.",

The goals of this study were to evaluate whether inpatient palliative care consultation use and discharge to hospice differed by race/ethnicity and whether hospital-level variations explained these differences.Retrospective, cross-sectional study.This study evaluated 5613 patients who were discharged to hospice or died during their hospital stay between 2012 and 2014 in 4 urban hospitals with an inpatient palliative care service. The main outcomes were receipt of an inpatient palliative care consultation and discharge to hospice.The sample was 43% white, 44% African American, and 13% Hispanic. After adjusting for patient characteristics and hospital site, race/ethnicity was not significantly associated with receipt of inpatient palliative care consultation. Hispanic race/ethnicity was associated with a higher likelihood of discharge to hospice (odds ratio, 1.22; P = .036), and inpatient palliative care consultation was associated with 4 times higher likelihood of discharge to hospice (P <.001). Hospital site was also associated with both receipt of inpatient palliative care consultation and discharge to hospice.Our results illustrate significant variation across hospitals in palliative care consultation use and discharge to hospice. No significant racial/ethnic disparities in the use of either palliative care or hospice at the end of life were found within hospitals.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant improvements in mortality over the past 20 years, cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States. One reason for the improvement in mortality is screening for several common cancers in people at average risk for breast, cervical, colorectal, and prostate cancers, and screening for lung cancer in those with a 20-plus pack-year history. Such screening may result in earlier diagnosis when the cancer is most likely to respond to treatment. However, there are no population-based screening recommendations for the majority of cancers in average-risk patients, most of which are not diagnosed until the later stages. One question is whether earlier diagnosis could not only reduce mortality rates but also reduce medical costs. Screening comes with several potential risks, including false positives and overdiagnosis, both of which can affect patients' mental health, increase morbidity and mortality, and lead to excess spending. Additionally, certain cancers can evade traditional screening tests and lead to false-negative results, which delays cancer detection, treatment, and may affect treatment efficacy. The advent of liquid biopsy tests that could screen for dozens of cancers holds promise for identifying more cancers early. However, the cost, the potential for overdiagnosis and false positives, and a lack of evidence demonstrating clinical utility or an improvement in health outcomes call into question their potential use for widespread screening. Government and managed care organizations will need to consider the risks and benefits of these assays in determining coverage.",

The studies compared oral semaglutide (doses of 3 mg, 7 mg, or14 mg) with placebo, and selected commonly used glucose-lowering agents (empagliflozin 25 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg, or liraglutide 1.8mg). Across the studies, oral semaglutide provided greater glycated hemoglobin (A1C) reductions than placebo, empagliflozin, or sitagliptinat 26 weeks, and similar A1C reductions as liraglutide. The proportion of patients achieving the A1C level recommended by the American Diabetes Association of less than 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) was greater with oral semaglutide (7 mg, 42%-69%; 14 mg, 55%-77%) than placebo (7%-31%)and active comparators (25%-62%), with durable target achievement. Oral semaglutide was associated with similar reductions in body weight as empagliflozin and greater reductions than placebo, sitagliptin, or liraglutide. Oral semaglutide was also efficacious in patients with T2D and moderate renal impairment. These findings indicate that oral semaglutide presents a valuable option for treating patients with T2D in a managed care setting, with the potential to expand the number of patients benefiting from GLP‑1RAs.",

    "abstract": "More than 90% of patients who report a penicillin allergy have the allergy disproved when tested. Unnecessary use of alternative (non-beta-lactam) antibiotics can result in more treatment failures and adverse reactions. We described the prevalence and impact of a reported penicillin allergy in high-cost, high-need (HCHN) patients.Retrospective cohort.We identified HCHN patients in a care management program of an urban academic medical center (January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016). We used multivariable logistic regression models to determine the association between a reported penicillin allergy and antibiotic use. We used multivariable Poisson regression models to determine the association between a reported penicillin allergy, with or without multiple drug intolerance syndrome (MDIS; ≥3 reported drug allergies), and healthcare resource utilization (HRU).Of 1870 HCHN patients, 383 (20%) reported penicillin allergy, 835 (45%) had MDIS, and 290 (16%) had both. HCHN patients reporting penicillin allergy had an increased odds of beta-lactam alternative antibiotic use (adjusted odds ratio, 3.84; 95% CI, 2.17-6.80). HRU was significantly higher for patients reporting a penicillin allergy alone (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.25) and with concurrent MDIS (aRR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.08-1.34).HCHN patients had a high burden of reported drug allergy. A reported penicillin allergy conferred a 4-fold increased odds of beta-lactam alternative antibiotic use. Reporting penicillin allergy, with and without MDIS, was associated with significantly more HRU. HCHN care management programs should consider systematic drug allergy evaluations to optimize antibiotic use in these fragile patients.",

Interview transcripts were coded using a deductive dominant approach guided by a logic model aimed at determining the resources and activities relevant to the development of the partnership.Challenges of cross-sector data sharing fit into 3 themes: data sharing regulations, data exchange capabilities, and cross-sector data integration. Overcoming these challenges required creative workarounds-for example, linking patients across organizations was done via establishment of a unique, partnership-specific patient identifier, which was incorporated into the health system's electronic health record for continuity.Our findings suggest that current regulatory frameworks are misspecified to the growing interest in cross-sector partnerships between health care and community-based organizations. Future efforts to support these relationships should consider clarifying rules around data sharing and increasing Medicaid support for nonmedical, health-related social needs.",

    "abstract": "Larotrectinib and entrectinib are tumor-agnostic tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitors that are indicated for the treatment of advanced or metastatic solid tumor cancers with neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusions. Regulatory approval of both agents was based on data from single-arm phase 1/2 studies, including tumor-agnostic basket trials. In the absence of randomized controlled trials, there remains a paucity of data to demonstrate the comparative effectiveness of larotrectinib and entrectinib vs established standard-of-care treatments in cancers with NTRK gene fusions. Furthermore, no studies have directly compared the 2 agents. This article reviews what is known about the comparative effectiveness of larotrectinib and entrectinib vs standard therapies in TRK fusion cancer and examines the comparative effectiveness of the 2 TRK inhibitors. Historical and intrapatient comparisons suggest that TRK inhibitors improve disease response compared with preexisting treatments across most tumor histologies; indirect and limited comparisons of phase 1/2 data and preliminary simulation modeling suggest a potential advantage for larotrectinib over entrectinib in terms of clinical response and survival. Although limited, these data provide some insight into the position of these treatments in established treatment paradigms for TRK fusion cancer, a setting where real-world evidence will be slow to accrue due to the rare nature of these tumors but may be the only way in the future to answer the outstanding questions regarding these 2 agents. Meanwhile, we need to try to obtain the maximum benefit that can be achieved for our patients using the currently available knowledge.",

Results: Across the period of 2017-2022, approximately two-thirds of insured adult patients on average reported being offered a patient portal, and approximately half reported accessing a portal. Patients with lower-than-average patient-centered communication and those who are men, are Hispanic, have less than a college degree, and have no internet are less likely than their counterparts to report being offered or accessing a portal. Conclusions: Although patient-centered communication is an important factor in facilitating patient portal offers and access, it does not appear to be a driver of demographic divides in portal use.",

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, was recently renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH); it represents the progressive form of MASLD. MASH is defined by hepatic steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning degeneration (hepatocellular injury) in a characteristic histologic pattern. Multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms underlie the development of MASLD, and multiple factors (eg, metabolic, hormonal, genetic, nutritional, and epigenetic components) are related to liver injury. MASH has a prevalence in the United States of 1% to 6%, and it is expected to rise in the next decade. Individuals living with MASH frequently suffer from comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Several guidelines have been published to support the timely diagnosis of MASH that incorporate noninvasive tests that obviate the need for liver biopsy. Multiple MASH treatment options are in various stages of development. The THR-β agonist resmetirom, approved by FDA in March 2024, offers a liver-directed treatment for those patients living with moderate to severe fibrosis without cirrhosis. Considering the progressive nature of the disease and the availability of a treatment that can be initiated early to halt MASH progression, patients who have risk factors for MASH should urgently be encouraged to visit their health care providers for MASH screening.",

Study Design: Descriptive analysis of research and development time lines of small molecule drugs in the top 50 of 2020 Medicare Part D spending using publicly available dates when pivotal clinical trials were first posted to ClinicalTrials.gov and FDA approval dates for initial and subsequent indications. Methods: We summarize the drugs, indications, and time lines using descriptive statistics. Results: Thirty of the 50 drugs with highest gross spending by Medicare Part D in 2020 were small molecule drugs with subsequent indications. Subsequent indications based on preapproval research (n = 34) were often approved within 2 years of initial approval (n = 15) and, on average, 2.9 years after a drug’s first approval. Additional indications based on postapproval clinical trials or real-world evidence (n = 42) received FDA approval, on average, 7.5 years after a drug was first approved, with the majority (55.8%) receiving FDA approval more than 7 years after the initial approval. Conclusions: Our analysis of clinical development for new indications reveals aspects of innovation in small molecule drugs that are at risk under the IRA. Specifically, the time lines described in this research demonstrate how the IRA may reduce economic incentives to develop multiple indications, including single-indication launches and investments in postapproval research for additional indications.",

    "abstract": "The US HIV/AIDS Strategy and Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiatives aim to reduce HIV transmission by 90% by 2030 through targeted care and prevention initiatives such as the Undetectable = Untransmittable strategy. Effective HIV management involves implementation of widely available testing to ensure early diagnosis, immediate or early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), patient adherence to medication, and retention in care to achieve viral suppression and improve clinical outcomes. A disproportionate burden of HIV incidence is experienced by certain populations that include Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx people, transgender individuals, those who inject drugs, older adults, and people living in the southeastern US. People with HIV (PWH) in vulnerable and underserved populations are more likely to be affected by the negative impacts of structural and social determinants of health-such as experiencing HIV-related stigma, poverty, and homelessness-resulting in barriers to accessing HIV care and achieving favorable treatment outcomes. Suboptimal HIV care negatively impacts outcomes for both individuals and society. Overall and comorbidity-free life expectancies are lower for individuals who start ART late than for the overall PWH population, and a lack of viral suppression increases community transmission rates. These poor outcomes increase costs for both patients and health care systems. Maintaining access to high-quality care by optimizing ART regimens, decreasing delays in ART initiation, and engaging patients in care by building trust and empowering patient choice will improve individual and population-level outcomes and support the EHE initiative. This manuscript examines strategies to improve HIV care access and outcomes for underserved populations, focusing on social determinants of health, stigma, geographic disparities, and treatment adherence, while highlighting the role of national initiatives and managed care programs in advancing health equity.",

Nevertheless, a polysocial risk score faces uncertainties and challenges due to the HRSNs' differing etiologies and interventions, cooccurrence, and variation in information availability. A national expert panel provided guidance on the development and potential application of a polysocial risk score in a 3-round Delphi process. Expert panel members from across the US included physicians (n = 8), social service professionals and staff (n = 9), and patients (n = 6). Round 1 obtained an initial sense of the importance of HRSNs for general health and well-being and total health care cost. Panelists also suggested additional HRSNs. Responses served as discussion points for round 2, during which 5 focus groups explored how HRSNs should be ranked, additional HRSNs to include, timing of measurements, management of nonresponse and missing data, and concerns about bias and equity. We analyzed the transcripts using a consensus coding approach. Panelists then completed a follow-up survey (round 3). Panelists identified 17 HRSNs relevant to health and well-being for inclusion in a polysocial risk score. Methodology concerns included the sources and quality of data, nonrandom missing information, data timeliness, and the need for different risk scores by population. Panelists also raised concerns about potential bias and misapplication of a polysocial risk score. A polysocial risk score is a potentially useful addition to the growing methodologies to better understand and address HRSNs. Nevertheless, development is potentially complicated and fraught with challenges.",

Retrospective interrupted time series analysis between October 2015 and January 2023. The readmission reduction initiative standardized inpatient care for patients through a novel, electronic health record-integrated, digitally automated point-of-care decision-support tool. A predictive artificial intelligence algorithm was utilized to identify patients at the highest risk of readmission in both the inpatient and outpatient settings, allowing a population health team to perform proactive outpatient management in medical and social domains to avoid readmission. Readmission rates declined from 27.9% in the preimplementation period to 23.9% in the postimplementation period ( P < .004) by the end of 2023. A significant gap in readmission rates between Black/African American patients and the general population was eliminated over the course of the evaluation period. Survival analysis demonstrated a reduction in all-cause mortality in the postimplementation period (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68-0.99; P = .037). Improvement in readmission rates allowed the health system to retain $7.2 million of at-risk pay-for-performance funding. This technology-based readmission reduction initiative demonstrated efficacy in reducing readmission rates, closing equity gaps, improving survival, and leading to a positive financial impact in a safety-net health system. This approach could be an effective model of technology-based, value-based care for other resource-limited health systems to meet pay-for-performance metrics and retain at-risk funding while improving clinical and equity outcomes.",

Narrative review of the current state of diabetes care in America and use of diabetes technologies such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and automated insulin delivery (AID) systems. An internet search of relevant studies and government reports was conducted. Numerous studies have shown that use of CGM and AID improves glycemia, diabetes-related events, and health care resource utilization and lowers overall health care costs. Despite these demonstrated benefits, the majority of individuals with diabetes are not achieving their glycemic goals. Although many of these individuals have limited access to these technologies due to restrictive coverage eligibility criteria, significant disparities exist in technology use within racial/ethnic minority populations and communities of lower socioeconomic status. Transitioning to a value-based approach to diabetes care supports the Quintuple Aim framework. Shifting our current health care delivery paradigm from the traditional volume-based, fee-for-service model to a value-based model that takes a proactive approach could improve patient outcomes and overall quality of life while helping to reduce the long-term costs of diabetes care.",

We compared pre- and postemployment patient panels of primary care physicians who did and did not become hospital employees, analyzing changes in the prevalence of chronic conditions. We measured arthritis, depression, diabetes, hypertension, and ischemic heart disease. We also evaluated whether patients who were dropped from physician panels found alternative sources of primary care. Hospital-employed physicians treated patients of similar or better health; for instance, 54% of integrated physicians' patients had 2 or more chronic conditions compared with 56% among independent physicians (P < .001). After becoming hospital employees, physicians treated approximately 10% fewer Medicare patients (-9.5%; 95% CI, -11.3% to -7.7%). Within physician panels, the prevalence of patients with 2 or more chronic conditions did not significantly change after employment relative to independent physicians (-1.1%; 95% CI, -2.3% to 0.2%). Approximately 37% of patients were dropped from physician panels after employment; these patients were less likely to find alternative primary care compared with those dropped from independent physician panels (P < .001).

Quantifying these relationships may improve understanding of factors contributing to changes in the health care workforce in ACOs and improve clinician recruitment and retention across ACOs to help them succeed in the program. Cross-sectional study of 409 ACOs from the National Survey of Accountable Care Organizations Wave 4 (2017-2018; response rate, 48%). We evaluated ACO provider workforce composition. In multivariable linear regression models, we examined the relationship among ACO provider workforce composition, contract type, structure, and financial risk level. For Medicare Shared Savings Program participants, we also assessed the role of the market environment. We found that provider workforce composition varied across organizations by ACO contract payer. The percentage of primary care providers-physicians and nonphysician providers-was higher in smaller organizations with ACO contracts from a single public payer (77.7% for those with Medicaid-only contracts; 59.5% with Medicare-only contracts) relative to larger organizations with contracts from a single commercial payer (52.4% primary care providers) or multiple payers (54.8%-55.7%). A higher percentage of primary care providers in the ACO was associated with physician leadership, upside financial risk, and financial compensation of physicians being tied to performance measures. With payers' recent interest in more capitated payment models, larger ACOs should consider extending more population-based payments, provider engagement, and compensation strategies to engage aligned providers toward high quality and low costs, mitigate overall provider turnover, and make participation in ACOs sustainable.",

    "abstract": "To quantify the magnitude of altruism value as applied to a hypothetical new treatment for a rare, severe pediatric disease: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Prospective survey of individuals not planning to have children in the future. A survey was administered to US adults (aged ≥ 21 years) not intending to have a child in the future to elicit willingness to pay (WTP) for government insurance coverage for a new hypothetical DMD treatment that improves mortality and morbidity relative to the current standard of care. A multiple random staircase design was used to identify an indifference point between status quo government insurance coverage and coverage with additional cost in taxes that would cover the treatment if unrelated individuals had a child with DMD. Altruism value was calculated as respondents' mean WTP. Among 215 respondents, 54.9% (n = 118) were aged 25 to 44 years and 80.0% (n = 172) were women. Mean WTP for insurance coverage of the hypothetical DMD treatment for others was $80.01 (95% CI, $41.64-$118.37) annually, or $6.67 monthly, after adjustment to account for disease probability overestimation. The adjusted altruism value was higher than the ex ante per-person value using traditional cost-effectiveness approaches ($45.30/year). Without adjusting, individuals were willing to pay $799.11 annually ($66.59 monthly). Despite no possibility of accruing health benefits directly for themselves or their children, individuals had a high WTP for government insurance coverage of a novel treatment for this rare, severe pediatric disease.",

This study highlights lessons learned from a unique stakeholder-health technology navigators-about factors affecting digital health use among older and linguistically diverse patients in one of the largest US safety-net health systems. We conducted in-depth interviews with Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC DHS) navigators from June to December 2023. Discussions focused on their job role, identity, experiences supporting older patients (≥ 50 years) to register and use the patient portal, and linguistically diverse patients (primary language other than English or LEP) in this safety net. We used the Theoretical Domains Framework to create an interview guide. We interviewed 9 female and 2 male navigators across 9 LAC DHS clinics who were bilingual (English and Spanish). Interviews were transcribed and analyzed for major themes. Three primary themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: characteristics of a successful navigator, patients' prior experiences with digital health, and barriers in the clinic. Navigators highlighted older patients' interest in learning to use digital tools and the need for support in digital health engagement. In describing their work with patients, navigators drew on their lived experiences with family and community to connect with these older patients in the Los Angeles safety-net health system. The lessons learned from these navigators can inform digital health engagement in other safety-net health settings so that they are more inclusive for older patients.",

Cross-sectional observational study. We collected a survey from participants in a pilot intervention conducted in 14 Pennsylvania laundromats between September and December 2023. The measures included health insurance coverage, unmet health care needs, and unmet HRSNs. Descriptive analyses and linear probability regression models with laundromat fixed effects were used to estimate the overall prevalence of unmet needs and explore subgroup differences. Among the 1995 sample members, approximately half (52.9%) had Medicaid coverage, 21.7% had private coverage, 14.5% were uninsured, 5.4% had Medicare, and 5.5% were dually enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid. The prevalence of having any unmet HRSN was higher than having any unmet health care need (54.3% vs 12.3%). Across unmet need measures, Medicaid sample members had 1.5 to 5 times higher levels relative to the privately insured. Differences by insurance coverage remained in fixed-effects analyses that limited comparisons to laundromat users at the same location. Laundromat-based outreach is likely most promising for Medicaid-serving stakeholders because Medicaid enrollees are disproportionately represented among laundromat users and have disproportionately high levels of unmet needs.",

    "abstract": "Cancer affects millions of Americans, and the number of cases is steadily rising. The increase in diagnosis of cancer cases comes with an associated increase in personal and economic burden. Earlier detection can improve treatment outcomes and may reduce the burden of cancer. Screening for cervical cancer is a good example of the potential of effective screening methods to dramatically reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with cancer. However, many current screening methods have high false-positive rates, increasing the concern for overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Blood-based tests capable of detecting multiple types of cancer represent an emerging approach to early cancer detection. Although there are several single-cancer detection tests in development, multicancer screening tests have greater potential to allow for widespread screening in the general population. Three multicancer screening tests are being validated in ongoing clinical trials, including the CancerSEEK assay, the Galleri test, and the PanSeer assay, all of which show high specificity in preliminary findings. Further validation is required before multicancer detection tests are incorporated into general population cancer screening.",

However, health care disparities continue to exist. This study aimed to (1) determine the prevalence and predictors of individuals being offered access to OMRs, (2) identify predictors of individuals accessing their OMR, and (3) describe barriers to accessing one's OMR. Study design Secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from Health Information National Trends Survey 5, cycles 1 and 2 (n = 6670). Methods Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to examine the association between sociodemographic and health care-related factors on being offered access to OMRs, accessing OMRs, and cited reasons for not accessing OMRs. Results In 2017-2018, 54% of US adults reported having been offered access to OMRs, and among those offered, 57% reported accessing their records. The groups who were less likely to be offered OMRs included men, middle-aged adults, members of racial/ethnic minority groups, individuals with lower education and household incomes, those who do not use the internet, and those living in rural areas. Respondents who were less likely to access their OMRs despite being offered included individuals with lower education and household incomes and rural residents. Among the 43% who did not access their records, the primary reason for not accessing was their preference to speak to their provider directly. Conclusions Sociodemographic and health care-related factors are associated with variation in use of OMRs. To realize the intended value of OMR use for patients, it is important to address barriers to OMR access and integrate OMRs into patient-provider communication and clinical care.",

Identifying factors that increase patient satisfaction may improve patient care and can protect health care providers from financial penalties. Our study sought to investigate how patient portals are associated with patient satisfaction in both inpatient and outpatient settings.Retrospective, pooled cross-sectional study.Data from the Clinician and Group Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CG-CAHPS) and Hospital CAHPS (HCAHPS) patient satisfaction surveys were linked to inpatient and outpatient portal account status at a large academic medical center. Using fractional logistic regression, we investigated the relationship between patient satisfaction survey scores and patient portal activation.Patients with an activated outpatient portal account reported higher patient satisfaction across a subset of the CG-CAHPS dimensions, and patients with an activated inpatient portal account reported higher patient satisfaction across a subset of the HCAHPS dimensions, compared with patients without the respective portal accounts.Our study suggests the potential for patient portals to enhance patient satisfaction, especially in areas such as care coordination and care transitions. In both inpatient and outpatient settings, portal use may improve the patient-centeredness of care. Our findings indicate important considerations for both health care organizations and their patients to promote patient portal use as a means of improving patient satisfaction, especially in the context of potential impacts on reimbursement and reputation.",

In California, there is great variability in access to e-consult programs for low-income patients who rely on Medicaid managed care plans (MCPs) for covered benefits. This study aimed to understand MCP facilitators of and barriers to e-consult investment in California. Interviews conducted with California Medicaid MCPs' leaders to learn about the facilitators of and barriers to investment in e-consult programs. Interviews were analyzed using content analysis with multistage coding. The Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, and Sustainment framework was used to organize facilitator and barrier themes into 4 contexts: outer context (landscape of health care delivery in California), inner context (components within the medical neighborhood), innovation factors (characteristics of e-consult programs), and bridging factors (MCP actions). Twelve themes emerged from 16 interviews. Outer context themes were regulatory policies and financial policies (barriers), limited specialty care (facilitator), and patient perceptions (both). Inner context themes were workforce characteristics (both), clinical leadership (facilitator), and clinical workflows (both). Innovation factor themes were adjunct e-consult vendor services (both) and software integration (facilitator). Bridging factor themes included collaboration with other plans (facilitator), financial risk delegation (barrier), and quality improvement considerations (facilitator). Medicaid regulatory and reimbursement policies posed the most significant barriers to e-consult investment by Medicaid MCPs in California. Recognition of e-consult as a mode of specialty care delivery and reimbursement for clinicians could help future e-consult programs succeed in enhancing access to specialty expertise for low-income patients.",

Autonomic modulation of gastrointestinal (GI) function occurs via the actions of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators such as serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT), norepinephrine, and dopamine. Of those modulators, serotonin has received the most attention with respect to disorders of GI function. Serotonin exerts its effects via neurocrine, paracrine, and endocrine pathways. Recent studies have demonstrated that serotonin, acting primarily through 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors, is intricately involved in initiating the peristaltic reflex and facilitating intraluminal secretions. Serotonin receptors mediate reflex control of GI motility and secretion and may influence the perception of bowel function and pain under some circumstances. GI motor activity and sensory dysfunction in patients with IBS may be a result of alterations in serotonin levels or associated 5-HT receptors. Serotonin agonists and antagonists such as tegaserod, a 5-HT4 agonist, may offer new treatments that normalize GI motor and sensory functions in patients with disorders of GI function.",

The objective of this study was to better understand the differences between health plan reporting and the geographic variation seen in quality measures related to antibiotic use. We focused on 3 measures from the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) related to antibiotic prescribing and testing to guide antibiotic prescribing. We analyzed data for 3 relevant measures for the years 2008 to 2012, including only commercial health plans. We analyzed the following 3 HEDIS measures: 1) \"Appropriate Testing for Children With Pharyngitis,\" 2) \"Appropriate Treatment for Children With Upper Respiratory Infections,\" and 3) \"Avoidance of Antibiotic Treatment in Adults With Acute Bronchitis.\" Out of these 3 measures, health plans consistently performed poorly on the adult bronchitis measure. Performance was better on the 2 measures focused on the pediatric population. We also saw geographic variation between measures when looking at Census divisions across all years. There is wide variation between individual health plan performance on the measures related to antibiotic use. Geographic differences were also observed on these measures, with health plans in the South Central Census division performing worse than other parts of the country. Stakeholders, such as public health, advocacy groups, foundations, and professional societies, interested in improving the quality of care that patients receive related to antibiotic use in the outpatient setting should consider how existing measures and working with health plans could be used to improve prescribing.",

    "abstract": "The burden of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss in the elderly population, is poised to increase dramatically as the baby boomer generation ages. Fortunately, the prognosis of neovascular AMD has improved dramatically since anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents reached the market 15 years ago. In large-scale clinical trials, anti-VEGF utilization maintained visual acuity in more than 90% of patients. However, providing anti-VEGF treatment requires the specialized expertise of retina specialists and is labor intensive and costly. Further, results in clinical practice do not always measure up to those obtained in rigorous phase 3 trials. Undertreatment and the burden on patients and caregivers from frequent anti-VEGF injections contribute to suboptimal visual acuity results in the real world. As a consequence, retinal specialists are focused on finding effective strategies to extend the dosing interval. These include individualized optical coherence tomography-guided dosing regimens, longer acting new agents with similar or new mechanisms of action, and sustained release delivery devices. With the recent approval of brolucizumab, the neovascular AMD armamentarium has expanded to 4 anti-VEGF agents, and more are in development. Understanding the treatment landscape is a key issue in managed care due to the substantial cost of anti-VEGF medications. The goal of this article is to provide managed care clinicians with an up-to-date assessment of currently available agents, followed by a preview of some investigational agents that could alter the future treatment landscape. These agents include abicipar pegol, faricimab, the ranibizumab port delivery system, an intravitreal bevacizumab formulation, and anti-VEGF biosimilars.",

We sought to evaluate insurance claims data as a source for monitoring progression along the CHB care cascade.Longitudinal evaluation from diagnosis to treatment among commercially insured enrollees with CHB.We used standardized procedure and diagnosis codes to identify enrollees (≥ 18 years) with CHB in large insurance claims databases to describe the CHB care cascade from 2008 to 2016. Linkage to care was defined as procedure codes for liver fibrosis assessment (alanine aminotransferase in conjunction with either hepatitis B virus DNA or hepatitis B e-antigen) more than 12 months after CHB diagnosis. Treatment was defined as a claim for any CHB prescription. We analyzed factors associated with linkage to care and treatment using unadjusted logistic regression and evaluated rates of diagnosis, linkage to care, and treatment over time.Of 16,644 individuals with CHB, 6004 (36%) were linked to care and 2926 (18%) were treated. Persons coinfected with HIV (odds ratio [OR], 0.46; 95% CI, 0.36-0.59) or hepatitis C (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.34-0.73) were less likely to be linked to care, and persons coinfected with HIV (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.19-0.44) were less likely to be treated. From 2009 to 2015, there was a significant decrease in CHB diagnoses but no change in the proportion linked to care and treatment.We identified gaps in linkage to care and treatment in commercially insured adults with CHB.",

    "abstract": "Health care organizations are increasingly employing social workers to address patients' social needs. However, social work (SW) activities in health care settings are largely captured as text data within electronic health records (EHRs), making measurement and analysis difficult. This study aims to extract and classify, from EHR notes, interventions intended to address patients' social needs using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) algorithms.Secondary data analysis of a longitudinal cohort.We extracted 815 SW encounter notes from the EHR system of a federally qualified health center. We reviewed the literature to derive a 10-category classification scheme for SW interventions. We applied NLP and ML algorithms to categorize the documented SW interventions in EHR notes according to the 10-category classification scheme.Most of the SW notes (n = 598; 73.4%) contained at least 1 SW intervention. The most frequent interventions offered by social workers included care coordination (21.5%), education (21.0%), financial planning (18.5%), referral to community services and organizations (17.1%), and supportive counseling (15.3%). High-performing classification algorithms included the kernelized support vector machine (SVM) (accuracy, 0.97), logistic regression (accuracy, 0.96), linear SVM (accuracy, 0.95), and multinomial naive Bayes classifier (accuracy, 0.92).NLP and ML can be utilized for automated identification and classification of SW interventions documented in EHRs. Health care administrators can leverage this automated approach to gain better insight into the most needed social interventions in the patient population served by their organizations. Such information can be applied in managerial decisions related to SW staffing, resource allocation, and patients' social needs.",

We also combined our primary data with physician practice organization information to assess variation in the policy response according to physician-hospital ownership status. Supplementary analyses examined policy-induced changes in inpatient TKA case mix.We observed an immediate shift of roughly 15% of Medicare TKA cases to the outpatient setting. Importantly, there was a simultaneous near doubling of the number of TKAs performed as a hospital outpatient procedure among privately insured patients younger than 60 years. Hospitals allocated a similar proportion of TKA cases to the outpatient setting across the 2 payer groups, and we found evidence of selection against the potentially riskiest Medicare TKA patients for outpatient delivery. Vertically integrated orthopedic physicians retained their Medicare and privately insured TKA cases within the inpatient (higher-cost) setting.Market and financial pressures are encouraging more outpatient care delivery; however, the speed of transition is dictated, in part, by regulatory constraints. Our results suggest that Medicare policy may influence surgical treatment approaches for Medicare and privately insured patients. Spillover implications need to be considered when weighing future Medicare regulatory decisions.",

This study aimed to assess whether state Medicaid expansions were associated with a reduction in racial disparities in timely treatment among patients diagnosed with advanced cancer.This difference-in-differences study analyzed deidentified electronic health record-derived data. Patients aged 18 to 64 years with advanced or metastatic cancers diagnosed between January 1, 2011, and January 31, 2019, and receiving systemic therapy were included.The primary end point was receipt of timely treatment, defined as first-line systemic therapy starting within 30 days after diagnosis of advanced or metastatic disease. Racial disparity was defined as adjusted percentage-point (PP) difference for Black vs White patients, adjusted for age, sex, practice setting, cancer type, stage, insurance marketplace, and area unemployment rate, with time and state fixed effects.The study included 30,310 patients (12.3% Black race). Without Medicaid expansion, Black patients were less likely to receive timely treatment than White patients (43.7% vs 48.4%; adjusted difference, -4.8 PP; P < .001). With Medicaid expansion, this disparity was diminished and lost significance (49.7% vs 50.5%; adjusted difference, -0.8 PP; P = .605). The adjusted difference-in-differences estimate was a 3.9 PP reduction in racial disparity (95% CI, 0.1-7.7 PP; P = .045).Medicaid expansion was associated with reduced Black-White racial disparities in receipt of timely systemic treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic cancers.",

Early identification of patients who are likely to benefit from palliative care would increase opportunities to provide these services to those most in need. This study predicted all-cause mortality of patients as a surrogate for patients who could benefit from palliative care.Claims and electronic health record (EHR) data for 59,639 patients from a large integrated health care system were utilized.A deep learning algorithm-a long short-term memory (LSTM) model-was compared with other machine learning models: deep neural networks, random forest, and logistic regression. We conducted prediction analyses using combined claims data and EHR data, only claims data, and only EHR data, respectively. In each case, the data were randomly split into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) data sets. The models with different hyperparameters were trained using the training data, and the model with the best performance on the validation data was selected as the final model. The testing data were used to provide an unbiased performance evaluation of the final model.In all modeling scenarios, LSTM models outperformed the other 3 models, and using combined claims and EHR data yielded the best performance.LSTM models can effectively predict mortality by using a combination of EHR data and administrative claims data. The model could be used as a promising clinical tool to aid clinicians in early identification of appropriate patients for palliative care consultations.",

We constructed an annual, hospital-level data set on hospital 340B participation from the Office of Pharmacy Information Systems and on uncompensated care provision from the Hospital Cost Reporting Information System.Focusing on 2 periods of program expansion, we separately analyzed trends in uncompensated care costs for 340B-eligible general acute care hospitals and critical access hospitals, stratified by year of 340B program entry, including a stratum of eligible hospitals that never participated. We used a differences-in-differences approach to quantify whether there were differential changes in provision of uncompensated care after hospitals enter the 340B program relative to hospitals that did not participate or had not yet entered.We do not find evidence that hospitals increased provision of uncompensated care after entry into the 340B program differentially more than hospitals that never entered or had not yet entered the program.Relying on hospitals to invest surplus into care for the underserved without marginal incentives to do so or strong oversight may not be an effective strategy to expand safety-net care.",

Only 4 CEDs have had data collection requirements with continued National Coverage Determination (NCD); 3 relate to cardiovascular therapies, and all have some public availability of findings resulting from CED-related data collection mechanisms. There were 2 instances of NCD revocation and deferral to local coverage decisions.Changes in the CED program through improving program predictability and transparency with regard to outstanding questions, roles of relevant stakeholders, and requirements for reporting and reevaluation would strengthen the program's effectiveness. Ultimately, these improvements would provide incentives for stakeholder participation in data collection to achieve the goal of increasing access to beneficial therapies and improving clinical outcomes.",

Methods: Women aged 66 to 90 years who received a diagnosis of stage II or higher epithelial ovarian cancer during 2011-2015 were included (N = 3237). The National Comprehensive Cancer Network clinical practice guidelines were used to identify GCC. Logistic regression was conducted to identify predictors of GCC, a Cox proportional hazards model was used to examine mortality, and generalized linear models were used to examine mean monthly Medicare expenditures and health care utilization. Results: Approximately 57% of women received GCC and 11.6% of women did not receive any cancer-specific treatment. Women who were relatively older (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.272; 95% CI, 0.210-0.351), had Census tract income of $50,000 or less (AOR, 0.709; 95% CI, 0.551-0.913), had a psychiatric condition (AOR, 0.655; 95% CI, 0.464-0.923), and had adenocarcinoma histology (AOR, 0.564; 95% CI, 0.441-0.721) were significantly less likely to receive GCC.

Women who received surgery only or chemotherapy only had a significant higher hazard of all-cause mortality and ovarian cancer–specific mortality compared with those who received GCC (surgery only: adjusted HR [AHR], 2.307; chemotherapy only: AHR, 1.802). Receiving chemotherapy only was associated with 45% (,P, < .0001) higher mean monthly expenditures compared with those who received GCC. Conclusions: Non-GCC was associated with worsened survival, higher health care utilization, and increased expenditures. It is important to highlight that women who received GCC were associated with better survival likely due to favorable prognostic clinical factors.",

Methods: Data were from the CMS MA benefit and enrollment files for 2009-2019, supplemented with area-level data on demographic and provider market characteristics. For each service category, we calculated the annual share of MA enrollees in plans requiring at least some prior authorization and plotted trends over time. We mapped the county-level share of MA enrollees exposed to prior authorization in 2009 vs 2019. We quantified the association between local share of MA enrollees exposed to prior authorization and characteristics of that county in the same year. Finally, we plotted the share of MA enrollees exposed to prior authorization requirements over time for the 6 largest MA carriers. Results: From 2009 to 2019, the share of MA enrollees in plans requiring prior authorization for any service remained stable. By service category, the share of MA enrollees exposed to prior authorization ranged from 30.7% (physician specialist services) to 72.2% (durable medical equipment) in 2019, with most service categories requiring prior authorization more often over time. Several area-level demographic and provider market characteristics were associated with prior authorization requirements, but these associations weakened over time. The use of prior authorization varied widely across plans. Conclusions: In 2019, roughly 3 in 4 MA enrollees were in a plan requiring prior authorization. Service-level, area-level, and carrier-level patterns suggest a wide range of approaches to prior authorization requirements.",

We used nationwide, population-based data to examine the influence of care coordination on 30-day readmission, mortality, and costs for heart failure (HF). Study Design: We analyzed 20,713 patients with HF 18 years or older discharged from hospitals in 2016 using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. The coordination of care among a patient's outpatient physicians was measured with care density. Methods: Multilevel regression models were used after adjustment for patient and hospital characteristics to explore the impact of care density on 30-day readmission, mortality, and costs. Results: Patients with high care coordination had lower odds of 30-day readmission (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.98) and mortality (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70-0.99) and lower costs (cost ratio [CR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79-0.90) compared with those with low care coordination. Patients with medium care coordination had lower costs (CR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.98) than those with low care coordination. Conclusions: High care coordination is associated with decreased 30-day readmission, mortality, and costs for HF. Enhancing coordination of care has the potential to increase the value of care. It is important to monitor coordination of care and develop strategies to maintain high levels of care coordination for HF.",

    "abstract": "The treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains challenging. There has been substantial progress in understanding the molecular pathology of the disease that has led to meaningful advancements in treatment options with varying mechanisms of action, although treatment remains costly. Cytotoxic therapies, which are typically combined with targeted therapies, remain the mainstay of first- and second-line treatment for mCRC. While also relevant in earlier lines of therapy, molecular testing has become increasingly important to guide therapy across lines of therapy, for which treatment options are limited. A paucity of data exists in establishing clinical criteria for optimizing the sequencing of therapies in the third line and beyond. A customized approach should consider the efficacy of the therapy balanced with the patient's goals. Sequencing criteria should include a consideration for exposing patients to as many different modes of therapy as possible while preserving quality of life, avoiding serious toxicities, and accounting for the potential impact of cumulative toxicities from prior therapies.",

    "abstract": "Natalizumab is an alpha(4)-integrin antagonist, the first in its class for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although multiple mechanisms have been proposed for the efficacy of natalizumab in MS, the most likely explanation is that it interferes with the migration of immune cells into the central nervous system. It does this by binding to the alpha(4) subunit of alpha(4)beta(1)-integrin and preventing leukocyte adhesion to endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. The efficacy of natalizumab in relapsing-remitting MS has been demonstrated in several double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Natalizumab has been shown to slow the progression of disability in relapsing-remitting MS significantly better than placebo, and to reduce the number of new and enlarging T2 hyperintense and gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging lesions. In a post hoc analysis, the proportion of patients with relapsing-remitting MS free of disease activity was significantly greater with natalizumab compared with placebo. Due to the rare risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy as a complication, natalizumab is primarily recommended in patients who fail, or cannot tolerate, treatment with interferon (IFN) beta or glatiramer acetate (GA). Stratification of those patients most likely to benefit from natalizumab treatment--such as those with highly active disease, severe disease, or extensive functional loss, or those who have failed or cannot tolerate IFN beta or GA therapy--would help define natalizumab's appropriate place in therapy.",

The cohort was split into training and validation samples (1:1). Cox regression models assessed demographics, fracture history, medically significant falls, osteoporosis-related factors, frailty markers, and selected medications and comorbidities for independent predictors (P <.001) of incident nontraumatic clinical fractures in 12 and 24 months. A 6-variable model of 12-month risk used a published method for the risk-scoring point system.Of 1,287,354 individuals (mean age, 74.3 years; 56% female; 84% white), 3.8% had at least 1 fragility fracture at 12-month follow-up; 6.6% experienced fracture at 24 months (women vs men: 12 months, 4.8% vs 2.5%; 24 months, 8.3% vs 4.4%; both P <.01). At 12 months, recent fracture conferred approximately 3-fold-higher fracture risk (vs no recent fracture). Older age, white race, female sex, osteoporosis-related screening/diagnosis/medication, antidepressant/antipsychotic/sedative hypnotic/muscle relaxant medications, history of falls, fracture history, and respiratory conditions also increased risk (all P <.0001). The simplified model (recent fracture, age, sex, race, falls, antidepressant/antipsychotic/sedative hypnotic/muscle relaxant medications) performed well (C statistic = 0.71).Recent fracture, older age, female sex, white race, falls, and antidepressant/antipsychotic/sedative hypnotic/muscle relaxant medications predict imminent fracture risk in an older-adult Medicare Advantage population.

Schizophrenia leaves patients with the inability to function appropriately in their daily lives, including at work, in relationships, and even with self-care. The exact cause of this disorder has yet to be elucidated; however, multiple factors, including genetic susceptibility and environmental influences, have been implicated in its development. Patients with schizophrenia frequently demonstrate medication nonadherence and have multiple concurrent comorbidities that lead to increased morbidity and mortality. Schizophrenia is estimated to affect more than 21 million individuals globally, and while many therapies have become available for management, the disorder still presents unique challenges to providers, caregivers, and the healthcare system. Unmet medical needs remain for this complex disease state, and research is ongoing to address these needs and improve the overall health and outcomes of patients living with schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Objectives The Medicare Diabetes Prevention Program (MDPP) launched in April 2018, offering an unprecedented opportunity to reach the estimated 48.3% of older adults with prediabetes. Success of the innovative policy is likely to depend on adequate supplier availability. We examined supplier data from CMS to assess beneficiaries' potential access to MDPP services. Study design We conducted a descriptive analysis of MDPP suppliers using data extracted from the CMS registry of suppliers as of July 2019 and data about beneficiary populations. Methods Identifying the location, type, and number of MDPP suppliers and their respective sites, including within states, US territories, and the District of Columbia (hereafter, states), we mapped geographic coverage of MDPP access. Results There are 126 unique supplier organizations that offer the MDPP across 601 sites, equating to only 1 site per 100,000 Medicare beneficiaries. Seventy-five percent of states have no MDPP sites, fewer than 1 site per 100,000 beneficiaries, and/or availability limited to a single municipality. Although only 10.3% of MDPP suppliers are community-based organizations, they represent more than half (55.7%) of sites where beneficiaries can access the program. Conclusions Findings show inadequate MDPP access, with relatively few suppliers and locations where beneficiaries can receive services. Insufficient reimbursement relative to costs for suppliers may largely account for limited availability. Strategies to facilitate access are urgently needed, which may include partnering with large organizations for greater per capita reach and rural organizations for broader geographic coverage, along with setting fiscally sustainable rates based on refined program implementation and cost analysis.",

This shift means that policies need to be developed with the characteristic strengths and weaknesses of physician-led ACOs in mind. Using data from the Leavitt Partners ACO database, we analyzed the types of providers becoming ACOs over time to look at their numbers and market potential. Because the market potential for further growth of physician group-led ACOs is much stronger than for hospital- or health system-led ACOs, policy makers need to create programs and policies that facilitate physician-led ACOs' success by helping them develop the capacity to take on risk, finance investments in high-value healthcare, and partner with other organizations to provide the full spectrum of care.",

PBT use patterns over time were assessed. Multivariate logistic regression models assessed the effects of demographics and health insurance type on receipt of PBT.Of the 2,499,510 people with a cancer diagnosis during the study period, 578,632 (23%) received some type of RT, and of these, 8609 received PBT (1.5%). PBT was most often used to treat cancers of the prostate (41.3%), breast (14.0%), eye (11.7%), lung (6.1%), and brain (6.0%). PBT use was highest in 2003-2004 and then declined over time. PBT use was significantly associated with being white or male, younger age, higher socioeconomic status, Medicare or dual Medicare-Medicaid insurance, uninsured/self-pay status, and proximity to treatment.Significant differences exist in PBT use by demographics and health insurance type. The identified racial and socioeconomic disparities merit further investigation. More granular studies on both use patterns and effectiveness of PBT for specific cancers are needed to draw stronger conclusions about its cost-benefit ratio.",

Medical and pharmacy claims from multiple health plans, both nationally and internationally, were examined to evaluate overall real-world trends in commercially insured patients diagnosed with migraine. A total of 53,608 patients with diagnosis codes for migraine met the study criteria and were matched 1:1 with controls (81.8% female; mean age, 42 years; mean Charlson Comorbidity Index score, 0.34). During the 3-year measurement period, mean medical costs per patient in the migraine cohort were about 1.7 times that of the control group ($22,429 vs $13,166). Unique encounters and cost per patient by medical service type for the migraine cohort compared with the control group were as follows: emergency department, 4.13 ($4000) versus 2.94 ($2639); hospital inpatient, 3.15 ($17,748) versus 2.67 ($16,010); hospital outpatient, 5.14 ($365) versus 4.85 ($396); physician office, 36.78 ($6803) versus 21.39 ($4069); laboratory, 10.12 ($1433) versus 7.71 ($1057); radiology, 7.64 ($2609) versus 5.94 ($1733). Mean pharmacy costs per patient were approximately 1.8 times higher in the migraine cohort compared with the control cohort ($8441 vs $4588, respectively; P <.0001). These results suggest that patients with migraine have more comorbidities compared with those without migraine. These patients also utilize healthcare resources at a significantly higher rate compared with similar patients without a migraine diagnosis. An unmet need exists for new treatment modalities in this patient population. More effective interventions and proper management may lead to improved patient outcomes and healthcare costs for patients with migraine.",

However, as with most biologic drugs, trastuzumab comes with a relatively high price tag compared with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy and contributes to healthcare budgets. Three engineered products related to trastuzumab-2 antibody-drug conjugates, ado-trastuzumab emtansine and fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki, as well as the subcutaneous trastuzumab/hyaluronidase-have since been approved and have expanded the treatment options for this patient population. The approval of 5 trastuzumab biosimilars as of the end of 2019 holds the promise of considerable cost savings, but challenges to integrating their use into patient care must be addressed. Barriers to their use, including physician uncertainty to switch patients from the reference drug to the therapeutic biosimilar and patients' lack of understanding about biosimilars, are common in the United States. It is also important that all stakeholders, including managed care professionals, pharmacists, and practice administrators, understand how to incorporate trastuzumab biosimilars into formulary discussions, clinical care plans and processes, and educational initiatives for healthcare providers and patients.",

The most common reported ADEs across these therapeutic classes included bradycardia, dizziness, hypotension, hyperkalemia, cough, and renal impairment. The incidence of BB-induced bradycardia was 1% to 52% based on 9 studies, and 6 studies described dizziness as a result of BBs and ARNis (15%-43%). Fourteen studies reported induced hypotension (1.4%-63%); 13 studies, hyperkalemia (0.6%-30.2%); 3 studies, cough (37%-50%); and 4 studies, renal impairment (0.6%-7.6%).Findings show that drug-related adverse effects are commonly reported in clinical trials and highlight the sizable burden of ADEs with medical therapy across patients with HFrEF.

We conducted descriptive analyses of network adequacy standards, variation in standards by type of provider, timely access standards, nonquantitative network access standards, and monitoring or enforcement plans.A majority (89.7%) of states applied time and distance standards for network adequacy, stratified by population size or geography. Time and distance standards ranged from 15 to 90 minutes for a primary care provider (mean, 44.7 minutes in rural areas and 28.9 minutes in urban areas) to 30 to 135 minutes for a cardiologist (mean, 72.1 minutes in rural areas and 40.4 minutes in urban areas). Most states also used timely access or appointment availability standards. Relatively few states applied other quantitative standards, such as provider to enrollee ratios, or provided detailed enforcement plans in cases of poor compliance.Most states use travel time and distance to account for local contexts and geographies, but there is considerable variation across Medicaid programs. Several states do not publicize their network adequacy regulations, or they rely on qualitative standards despite federal requirements. For network adequacy to be meaningful, states must balance the tension between flexibility and accountability and ensure that regulations are monitored and enforced accordingly.",

    "abstract": "Dry eye disease (DED) is one of the most common ocular surface disorders. All DED involves an imbalance between tear production and evaporation. Most cases of DED are driven by excessive evaporation, which is often associated with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). In evaporative DED, a deficient tear film lipid layer is believed to lead to increased tear evaporation, inflammation, and ocular surface damage. Most prescription treatments for DED address signs and symptoms by targeting tear production and/or inflammation, but they do not address excessive evaporation. Perfluorohexyloctane (PFHO) ophthalmic solution (MIEBO™; Bausch + Lomb) is a water-free, single-ingredient, preservative-free prescription eye drop that directly targets tear evaporation and is approved by the FDA to treat the signs and symptoms of DED. Results from preclinical studies indicate that PFHO has a high oxygen carrying capacity, may reduce friction on blinking, and spreads quickly over the tear film surface to form a monolayer that inhibits evaporation. These effects can lead to stabilization of the tear film to promote ocular surface healing. Further, PFHO was detected in tears for at least 6 hours in a rabbit pharmacokinetic study, and results indicate that it may improve lipid layer thickness and quality. In 2 pivotal phase 3 trials in patients with DED and clinical signs of MGD (GOBI [NCT04139798] and MOJAVE [NCT04567329]), treatment with PFHO consistently met primary efficacy end points related to DED signs and symptoms (total corneal fluorescein staining and eye dryness, respectively) and was well tolerated. Compared with use of hypotonic saline solution, instillation of PFHO led to significant improvements in signs and symptoms in as early as 2 weeks. In a long-term, open-label safety extension study, efficacy of PFHO was sustained over 12 months, and the safety profile was consistent with those of previous studies. Clinical trial results indicate that treatment with PFHO effectively and consistently reduces the signs and symptoms of DED.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: For patients with asthma who remain symptomatic on a medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting β2 agonist, addition of a long-acting muscarinic antagonist as a supplementary controller is a recommended option. However, real-world data on the characteristics and treatment patterns of these patients are limited. This study described the demographics and clinical characteristics of new users of single- or multiple-inhaler triple therapy and treatment patterns preceding triple-therapy initiation. Study Design: This retrospective cohort study used medical and pharmacy claims data from the IQVIA PharMetrics Plus database. Methods: The study population comprised adults with asthma with or without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) initiating triple therapy with single-inhaler fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilanterol (FF/UMEC/VI; 100/62.5/25 μg) or multiple-inhaler triple therapy (MITT) between September 18, 2017, and September 30, 2019. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns in the 12 months preceding triple-therapy initiation were described (baseline period). Results: A total of 12,395 patients were included. Among FF/UMEC/VI initiators with asthma (n = 1301), the mean age was 49.0 years and 59.3% were women. During the baseline period, 81.5% of patients used controller therapy, 94.7% used rescue medications, and 42.0% reported at least 1 asthma-related exacerbation; the annual mean exacerbation rate was 0.96. Similar trends were observed among patients with asthma initiating MITT and patients with comorbid asthma-COPD initiating FF/UMEC/VI or MITT. Conclusion: In real-world practice, triple therapy is often utilized following other asthma controller medication use. High disease burden, as evidenced by substantial use of rescue medications and continued asthma-related exacerbations, suggests that patients may not have achieved adequate asthma control prior to triple-therapy initiation.",

Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Using a novel data source on SHIP counseling site locations, we characterized the availability of in-person SHIP counseling by zip code tabulation area (ZCTA) and used linear regression and ,t, tests to evaluate whether SHIP counseling sites are disproportionately located in higher-income communities. Results: Our sample included 1511 SHIP counseling sites. More than half (63%) of the localities in our sample have a SHIP site within the ZCTA or county. Twenty-four percent do not have a SHIP site within the county but have one in an adjacent county. The remaining 13% do not have a nearby SHIP site. There is a disproportionate number of individuals eligible for Medicare in localities without a SHIP site. Moreover, the population living in areas without in-person SHIP sites is more likely to have low income and fewer years of education than the population living in areas with a SHIP site. Conclusions: These results suggest that there are areas where in-person SHIP service expansion or other additional navigation support may be warranted.",

The chief debilitating consequence of osteoporosis, fracture, will affect about half the women and a third of the men in their lifetime, posing a daunting challenge to managed healthcare systems in terms of delivering optimal care and restraining cost. By encouraging optimal postfracture follow-up care and identifying those members at higher risk for fracture and in need of prompt treatment, managed care organizations can enhance the cost-effective management of osteoporosis, dampening downstream costs. This manuscript reviews the pathophysiology of osteoporosis, examines issues related to the diagnosis of osteoporosis, especially the role of bone mineral density measurement, and focuses on the impact of various treatment options in reducing fracture risk. Early assessment and treatment emerge as medically prudent steps in reducing the risk for osteoporosis-related fracture.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of medication burden on persistent use of newly added lipid-lowering (LL) drugs among patients with hypertension. STUDY DESIGN This retrospective database study used medical and pharmacy claims from a mid-Atlantic managed care organization. The cohort was obtained from continuous member enrollment in pharmacy and medical benefits from January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2005. METHODS Prescription claims were obtained for 18 months following the date of the first filled LL prescription (ie, index date). Patients were stratified into patients who changed LL drug or strength (group 1) and patients who did not change LL drug or strength (group 2). The primary outcome measure was persistence to newly added LL therapy. Persistence was defined by the length of time a member remained on therapy following the index date. The secondary outcome measure was the medication possession ratio (MPR). The MPR was calculated as the ratio of the sum of the days' supply of prescription filled divided by the number of days filled, plus the days' supply for the final prescription fill. Associations between the daily medication burden, defined as the number of unique drug products, and the outcome measures were analyzed. RESULTS In the cohort of 3058 patients, the mean medication burden was 2.9 medications. Medication burden was positively associated with persistence and MPR through 18 months. Patients who had greater medication burden had longer persistence (P 80%) (P < .001 for both). CONCLUSIONS Patients with higher medication burden had greater adherence to newly added LL therapy. Medication burden should not deter clinicians from adding LL therapy. Among patients with added LL therapy, more attention should focus on patients who have changes to their LL regimen compared with patients who continue on the same LL prescription.",

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize variables, and chi2 tests were performed to examine differences by age category.One hundred eighty-seven surveys were completed. The likelihood of having completed an AD increased with age (P <.001). Of those without an AD, 44% reported having talked with someone about their wishes. Many (62%) subjects thought that it was up to them to raise the topic of EOL care. However, 70% of subjects reported that they would be comfortable if their provider initiated discussion. Participants 60 years or older were more likely to report being very comfortable with their provider bringing up the subject compared with those younger than 60 years (60% vs 39%, P = .02). Few differences were found by age.Room for improvement exists for increasing the number of patients who complete an AD or engage in discussion of their wishes. Ways to involve healthcare providers in the process should be explored, as it seems that patients are receptive to physician-initiated discussions of ADs.",

Treatment duration and efficacy depend heavily on HCV genotype. A sustained virologic response (SVR) is achieved only in approximately 40% of patients. Side effects of the current standard of care often make adherence to therapy difficult, further reducing the chance for an SVR. Numerous patient-related and virus-related factors can determine response to treatment. Nonresponders are a large proportion of the current HCV-infected population, and the number of patients with HCV infection is growing, necessitating newer therapies with higher efficacy and potentially fewer side effects.

DMTs, including interferon-beta, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, mitoxantrone, and fingolimod, reduce the rate and severity of relapses, the accumulation of brain and spinal cord lesions as shown on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and disability progression. Many studies link diminished QOL with specific MS symptoms (fatigue, impaired mobility, spasticity, etc). Even in patients already receiving DMTs, symptoms and QOL may improve with additional agents that treat specific symptoms, thereby improving patient function and ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). Patients have reported that mobility impairment is one of the worst aspects of MS. Almost half of patients treated with DMTs reported no improvement in mobility. However, blocking the voltage-dependent potassium channels on the surface of demyelinated nerve fibers may improve signal conduction. Dalfampridine, a potassium channel blocker, received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for all forms of MS specifically to improve walking, which was demonstrated by increased walking speed. By improving walking in some patients with MS, the effects of dalfampridine may complement those of DMTs and address the stated priorities of many patients.",

Methods:We combined legal scholarship surveying HIE-relevant state laws with the AHA Annual IT Supplement for regulatory barriers and hospital characteristics.Data from CMS reports for hospitals attesting to Meaningful Use Stage 2 in 2016 (MU2, renamed \"Promoting Interoperability\" in 2018) captured hospital HIE volume.We used multivariate logistic regression and linear regression to estimate the association between opt-in state consent policies and reported regulatory barriers and HIE volume, respectively.Results: Hospitals in states with opt-in consent policies were 7.8 percentage points more likely than hospitals in opt-out states to report regulatory barriers to HIE (p=0.03).In subgroup analyses, this finding held among hospitals that did not attest to MU2 (7.7pp, p=0.02).Among hospitals attesting, we did not find a relationship between opt-in policies and regulatory barriers (8.0pp, p=0.13), nor evidence of a relationship between opt-in policies and HIE volume (ß=0.56,p=0.76). Conclusions:Our findings suggest that opt-in consent laws may carry greater administrative burdens compared to opt-out policies.However, less technologically advanced hospitals may bear more of this burden.Furthermore, opt-in policies may not impact HIE volume for hospitals that have already achieved a degree of technological sophistication.Policymakers should carefully consider the incidence of administrative burdens when crafting laws pertaining to HIE.",

FA-related services including outpatient allergist visits, emergency department (ED) visits, epinephrine autoinjector prescription fills, and diagnostic testing were identified. Factors associated with services were assessed using logistic regression. Kaplan-Meier survival curves evaluated the time to guideline-informed care, and proportional hazard models determined associated socioeconomic characteristics.There were 64,276 Medicaid-enrolled children younger than 20 years who had at least 1 claim with an FA diagnosis in 2012. Minority children and those living in a high-poverty county were less likely to have visited an allergist for FA or received diagnostic testing but more likely to have an FA-related ED visit compared with White children and those not living in a high-poverty county. Survival analyses found that of children seen for FA-related primary care or an ED visit, rates of allergist follow-up visits were 21% and 17%, respectively, and rates of epinephrine autoinjector prescription fills were 39% and 41%. Significant associations with guideline-informed care were found by race/ethnicity, dense population, and high-poverty counties.Although guideline-informed FA care includes follow-up with an allergist and epinephrine autoinjector prescription, this study finds low probabilities of timely service utilization after medical visits, as well as socioeconomic disparities in care.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate differences in health care costs between patients who received an electronic specialty consultation and patients who received a face-to-face specialty consultation.Retrospective cohort evaluation of patients who received a specialty consultation in the Veterans Health Administration during 2016.Patients who received an e-consult were matched 1:1 to patients who received a face-to-face consultation using propensity scores. Total, outpatient, and inpatient health care costs over 3 and 6 months following the specialty consultation were compared using a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution and log link.e-Consults accounted for 1.8% (urology) to 9.6% (hematology) of specialty consultations, on average. Across 11 specialties, patients receiving an e-consult had significantly lower health care costs compared with patients receiving a face-to-face consultation, ranging from 3.6% (cardiology) to 30.7% (hematology) lower. This was largely driven by differences in outpatient costs. Patients receiving an e-consult had significantly lower outpatient costs for all specialties except cardiology, ranging from 6.9% (endocrinology) to 31.2% (hematology) lower. Three-month inpatient costs among those who received an e-consult were significantly lower only in cardiology (5.2%), nephrology (9.3%), pulmonary (13.0%), and gastroenterology (14.3%).Electronic specialty consultations are a potential mechanism to reduce health care costs and promote the efficient use of health care resources.",

    "abstract": "Managed care payers, pharmacy directors, pharmacy benefit managers, specialty pharmacy directors, and any other pharmacist and/or healthcare professional interested in scientific advances in pulmonary arterial hypertension Activity OverviewPulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, progressive disorder with currently unknown etiology.Initial symptoms are often nonspecific and include shortness of breath and fatigue, with some patients experiencing these symptoms for more than 2 years before receiving a diagnosis.As PAH progresses, these symptoms may become more severe and occur for patients at rest, making early recognition of symptoms and early diagnosis imperative among healthcare providers.Current treatment goals include symptom management and maintaining patient quality of life, so clinicians should be familiar with goal-directed therapy as well as tests and risk assessment tools to monitor prognosis, treatment, and disease progression in PAH.Multiple classes of agents are used in PAH treatment, and some have been investigated as combination therapy; however, healthcare providers should be aware that certain combinations should be avoided due to increased adverse effects.These therapies are associated with significant cost burden for patients and the healthcare system, giving managed care professionals a significant opportunity to reduce costs and facilitate access of these medications.Mismanagement of patients with PAH stemming from delayed diagnosis is a main concern, so ensuring consistent application of guideline recommendations is important to the PAH treatment paradigm. Educational ObjectivesUpon completion of this activity, participants will be able to: • Classify the pathophysiology, etiology, prognosis, and quality of life burden associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).• Explore the current treatment landscape, updated safety and efficacy data, and new and emerging therapies for PAH.• Identify the costs associated with PAH and opportunities to slow progression and improve outcomes in this patient population.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study explored the contributions of social determinants of health (SDOH) to measures of population health-specifically cost, hospitalization rates, rate of emergency department utilization, and health status-in Texas. STUDY DESIGN: The study associated common SDOH metrics from public data sources (county specific) with health plan enrollment data (including demographics, counties, and zip codes) and medical and pharmaceutical annual claims data. METHODS: Following correlation analyses to reduce variables, the contribution of each SDOH individually and by category to the health outcomes was evaluated. Separate matrices for age populations (under age 19, general population [all ages], and ≥ 65 years) were created with assigned weights of influence for categories and the factors within each category. RESULTS: The contributions of the categories varied by population, confirming that different SDOH influence populations to varying degrees. This was reflected in each model. The largest contributor to cost for the general population and for the group 65 years and older was factors grouped as health outcomes (such as perceived health), at 43.5% contribution and 37.7% contribution, respectively. Yet for the population younger than 19 years, the largest contributor to cost was socioeconomic factors (such as unemployment rate), at 40.2%. The other performance measures also varied by population and the mix and weight of determinants. CONCLUSIONS: This study and the developed population-based matrices can provide a valuable framework for reporting the impact of SDOH on health care quality. The variation suggests the need for further research on how age groups react to the social environment.",

The goals of this study were to develop and validate a predictive model of OUD and to predict future OUD diagnosis, resulting in proactive, person-centered outreach. STUDY DESIGN We utilized machine learning methodology to select a multivariate logistic regression and identify predictors. METHODS Using 2016-2018 data, we used a staged approach to test and validate the predictive accuracy of our model. We identified OUD, the dependent variable, using an industry-standard definition. We included a series of patient demographic, chronic condition, social determinants of health (SDOH), opioid-related, and health utilization indicators captured in administrative data. RESULTS Caucasian (odds ratio [OR], 1.65), male (OR, 1.57), and younger (aged 40-64 years compared with 18-39 years: OR, 0.75) members had greater odds of being diagnosed with an OUD. Members with an SDOH vulnerability had 26% higher odds than those without a documented issue. From a prescribing perspective, we found that having an opioid dose of 120 morphine milligram equivalents and contiguous 5-day supply increased odds of OUD by 1.87 times, and an opioid supply of 30 days or longer increased the odds of OUD by 1.56 times. CONCLUSIONS We built the necessary machine learning infrastructure to identify members with greater than 50% probability of developing OUD. The generated list strategically informs and guides person-centered care and interventions. Through application of these results, we strive to proactively reduce OUD-related structural barriers and prevent OUD from occurring.",

Patient profiles indicated older age was associated with more severe disease and number of comorbidities. The definition of kidney disease varied between studies reporting incidence and prevalence, with reported values up to 37.0% and 43.5% for incidence and prevalence, respectively. CKD among patients with T2D contributed to higher mortality rates. Higher disease progression rates were associated with higher albuminuria and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate levels. The available literature suggested annual screening rates for CKD declined over time. CV events were reported to have a substantial effect on morbidity and resource use.This review highlights the burden of CKD among patients with T2D and underscores a need for new treatment alternatives to reduce the burden of disease.",

Given the increasing awareness of this impact and the adoption of alternative payment models that incentivize addressing social needs, expectations are growing that health systems will appropriately screen for patients' social needs. However, there is limited evidence on how patients would like their health systems to engage with them around these needs. Our objective was to understand patient perspectives on completing social needs screening through technology-based modalities. Study Design: We performed a qualitative study with semistructured patient interviews from November 2021 to April 2022. Methods: Patients were eligible for our health system's standardized social needs screening survey if they had not completed it in the past year and were scheduled for a nonacute primary care visit. Patients were selected for interview if they completed the survey via portal or tablet or if they were eligible for but did not complete the survey. Interviews were analyzed using an integrated approach. Domains, subdomains, and themes were identified. Results: We completed interviews with 54 participants. Participants were broadly accepting of screening, and most were comfortable with portal or tablet-based screening. They were motivated to complete the screening and recognized the connection between social needs and health. Having a trusting relationship with their clinician and feeling that their information was private were noted by patients as important factors for process endorsement. Conclusions: This qualitative study provides insight into patient-centered approaches for identifying patients' social needs.",

We sought to elucidate the impact of social determinants of health (SDOH) on the noncompletion of fecal immunochemical tests (FITs) and colonoscopies at the Providence Community Health Centers (PCHC). Study Design: This was a retrospective cohort review of PCHC patients with associated SDOH profiles between December 1, 2018, and December 1, 2019. Methods: We analyzed fulfilled and unfulfilled CRC screening orders (FITs and colonoscopies) and examined associations and odds ratios between order noncompletion and the presence of SDOH variables. The study sample consisted of a total of 517 orders (fulfilled and unfulfilled; FIT, n = 348; colonoscopy, n = 169). Results: FITs were completed more often than colonoscopies (81.3% vs 65.7%, respectively; ,P, < .001). Colonoscopy noncompletion was associated with patient-reported social determinants of \"housing insecurity/homelessness\" (,P, = .0083) and \"living conditions\" (,P, = .048) and staff-reported \"behavioral health problem\" (,P, = .048). The presence of housing insecurity/homelessness increased the likelihood of an unfulfilled colonoscopy order (odds ratio, 7.5; 95% CI, 1.3-75.0). Patients who reported any SDOH need had a statistically significant increase in colonoscopy noncompletion (,P, = .0022), whereas FIT noncompletion was not associated with the presence of SDOH needs (,P, = .81).

The Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) initiative seeks to reduce HIV diagnoses by 75% by 2025 and by 90% by 2030. Certain demographic groups-including transgender women, cisgender Black women, and Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino men who have sex with men-are disproportionately affected by HIV. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has proven effective in reducing HIV transmission. Real-world data indicate that the states with higher PrEP coverage have experienced steeper declines in new HIV diagnoses; however, several barriers hinder equitable PrEP access and uptake. Challenges such as stigma, discrimination, lack of education, and insurance barriers contribute to disparities in PrEP uptake and access to care, particularly in underserved communities. Population health decision-makers, including managed care organizations and federal and state policy makers, can play a vital role in expanding PrEP coverage and uptake by addressing these barriers and ensuring zero out-of-pocket costs for individuals who need PrEP. Enhancing health care provider education and person-centered HIV prevention strategies (eg, same-day PrEP services, telePrEP programs) also can increase PrEP uptake and adherence and patient satisfaction. A continuous focus on improving PrEP access can substantially contribute to achieving the EHE initiative's goal to end the HIV epidemic.",

METHODS Review of 2 pivotal phase 3 trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of pregabalin for the management of FM. RESULTS FM is a chronic condition that is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain and has a greater prevalence in women than in men. In a 14-week, randomized, double-blind trial, pregabalin at all 3 doses (300, 450, and 600 mg daily) resulted in significantly greater improvements in pain and function relative to placebo. Parallel with these improvements, greater proportions of patients in the pregabalin groups reported improvement in global disease status compared with placebo. In a second study designed to evaluate the durability of response, patients were randomized to up to 6 months of treatment with pregabalin or placebo after a 6-week, open-label, dose-optimization treatment phase. Based on predefined criteria for loss of therapeutic response, patients treated with pregabalin were observed to maintain a therapeutic response for a significantly longer duration than patients treated with placebo. Pregabalin was tolerated by most patients in both trials; the incidence of the most commonly reported adverse events (dizziness, somnolence, weight gain, headache, dry mouth) appeared to be dose-related. CONCLUSION Pregabalin has been demonstrated to be efficacious and well-tolerated for the management of FM.",

Mean scores for both BPRS-C and CGAS showed worst functioning at inpatient sites, followed by Acute Residential Treatment, then partial hospital, then outpatient sites.

Feasibility at intake was demonstrated in that 66% of all patients had a completed form at intake. Reassessment at discharge also appeared to be feasible in more restrictive levels of care, but less feasible in outpatient sites, where fewer than 25% of all patients had a follow-up form.This evaluation suggested that the 2 standardized measures appeared to be valid and reliable as part of routine intake and discharge/follow-up in a large child psychiatry system of care.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-Sectional analysis nested within a cohort of male health plan members (n = 55,278). METHODS: We extracted laboratory serum PSA values during the study period from 1998 to 2002. Using selected demographic and healthcare factors, we estimated the proportion of men who underwent PSA testing at least once during the 5-year period. Odds ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated to assess the association between these factors and PSA screening use. RESULTS: African American men had substantially higher PSA screening prevalence than white men (82.6% vs 73.7%). Low PSA screening use was associated with Latino race/ethnicity, lower level of education, residency in the United States for 25 years or less, current smoking, and lack of PSA test discussion with healthcare providers. The strongest positive predictors of PSA testing were African American race/ethnicity (odds ratio, 1.66; 95% confidence interval, 1.50-1.83) and high concern about prostate cancer (odds ratio, 1.53; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-1.69). In contrast, when men did not discuss PSA testing with their physicians, they were 80% less likely to undergo screening. CONCLUSIONS: In this insured population for whom financial barriers are minimized, PSA screening varied by race/ethnicity and by other patient and clinical factors, possibly reflecting inconsistencies in prostate cancer screening guidelines. Despite these differences, healthcare providers have a key role in patients' likelihood of undergoing PSA screening.",

Logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the odds of controlled BP for NP-treated vs physician-treated patients, adjusting for covariates.The NP-treated sample was composed of 684 patients; their mean age was 54.2 years, 62.6% were female, 59.7% were obese, and 19.2% had diabetes mellitus. Before propensity score matching, physician-treated patients were older, less likely to be female, and more likely to have diabetes. The propensity score-matched cohort (n = 623 in each group) had similar baseline characteristics. Among the NP cohort, 70.5% had controlled BP compared with 63.2% among the physician cohort; the mean number of antihypertensive medications was lower among NP-treated patients (1.6 vs 1.8, P = .01). The adjusted odds of controlled BP were slightly lower for physician-treated patients (odds ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.99).Comparable controlled BP rates were observed among patients with hypertension receiving care from an NP vs a comparison group receiving care from a physician; the groups had similar baseline characteristics. Our findings support the increasingly important role of NPs in primary care.",

Differences between the MHC and comparison groups were examined using X2 tests and logistic regression controlling for age and comorbidity.Among warfarin-eligible AF patients (n = 246), 48.5% of those with MHCs versus 28.9% of those without MHCs were not treated with warfarin (P = .004). Among those receiving warfarin and monitored in VHA, highly supratherapeutic INRs were more common in the MHC group; for example, 27.3% versus 1.6% had any INR >5.0 (P <.001). Differences persisted after adjusting for age and comorbidity.MHC patients with AF were less likely than those without MHC to have adequate management of their AF care. Interventions directed at AF patients with MHC may help to optimize their outcomes.",

Benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine GABA-A receptor agonists are the traditional medications used to treat insomnia. More recently, orexin inhibitors have been introduced that may have fewer adverse effects, including the development of dependence. To date, only suvorexant and lemborexant have been approved for the treatment of insomnia. However, several other agents are in later stages of development.

The majority of physicians and nurses report that they have been victims of workplace violence at least once throughout their careers. Such violent attacks negatively affect the delivery, quality, and accessibility of health care. Certain factors such as substance abuse and intense emotions increase an individual's risk of committing an act of workplace violence against a health care worker. Encountering violent individuals has legal implications and can compromise the moral framework of physicians. With action from institution administrations, advocates, leaders, and government, this issue that detrimentally affects health care can be combatted and reduced. By implementing required staff training, increasing security, strengthening the doctor-patient relationship, using medical chaperones, and reforming policy, positive changes can be made to protect health care workers and the health care system.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES To assess adherence to specialty medications for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at an integrated health system specialty pharmacy (HSSP) and identify characteristics associated with adherence. STUDY DESIGN Single-center, retrospective cohort study. METHODS Study patients were adults with RA who filled at least 3 prescriptions for biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017, at an integrated HSSP. Data were collected from pharmacy claims and electronic health records. The primary outcome, adherence, was measured using proportion of days covered (PDC). Proportional odds logistic regression was used to test association between PDC and age, gender, race, insurance type, and out-of-pocket costs. RESULTS We included 675 patients: 77% were female, 90% were White, 29% were naive to treatment at initial dispensing, 60% held commercial insurance, and the median age was 56 years. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) patient out-of-pocket cost per fill was $1.50 ($0-$5). Median (IQR) PDC was 0.95 (0.84-1.00); 80% of patients achieved PDC of 0.80 or higher. Higher adherence was more likely in patients who were male (odds ratio [OR], 1.58; 95% CI, 1.15-2.18; P = .005], naive to specialty medication treatment (OR, 3.04; 95% CI, 2.21-4.18; P < .001), and older in age (per 10 years: OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04-1.32; P = .008), and adherence had a significant nonlinear association with average cost per fill (P = .006); associations with race and insurance type were not significant. CONCLUSIONS At an integrated HSSP, patients with RA paid low out-of-pocket costs for bDMARD therapy and achieved high treatment adherence. Data suggest that integrated HSSPs assist patients in removing financial barriers to treatment.",

    "abstract": "Dry eye disease is a common but underdiagnosed disorder in the United States, and its prevalence is likely to increase as the nation's population ages. Although still regarded as little more than a nuisance by many clinicians and payers alike, dry eye disease is known to have both clinical consequences for ocular health and effects on vision-related quality of life in many people, impairing their ability to function well in vocational and social settings. Pharmaceutical treatments consist mainly of over-the-counter ocular lubricants (\"artificial tears\") and a few prescription drugs that address the inflammatory component of dry eye disease through immunomodulation and/or inhibition of T-cell activity. In September 2020, Oyster Point Pharma, Inc (Oyster Point Pharma), convened a panel-consisting of 7 managed care executives with experience in management of dry eye disease treatments and 2 eye care practitioners with expertise in dry eye disease-to discuss how the growth of knowledge about dry eye disease in the past 2 decades has altered their thinking about and approach to dry eye disease, as well as how they would like to see the field advance. They pointed to an existing unmet need in knowledge and therapeutics that can address the underlying causes of dry eye disease. Oyster Point Pharma supported the authorship of this article; the authors were members of the panel, and all panelists were compensated by Oyster Point Pharma. This article provides an overview of dry eye disease and summarizes the panel discussion.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with multiple chronic conditions (MCCs) represent a growing proportion of the adult population in the United States, particularly among lower-income individuals and people of color. Despite ongoing efforts to characterize this population and develop approaches for effective management, individuals with MCCs continue to contribute substantially to health care expenditures. Based on a review of recent literature, several identified barriers limit the effectiveness of care for patients with MCCs. Health care delivery system structural limitations, evidence-based care concerns, patient-clinician relationship constraints, and barriers to inclusion of patient-centered priorities may singly or in combination negatively affect outcomes for individuals with MCCs. The COVID-19 pandemic has shed further light on inequities contributing to suboptimal MCC patient management. Awareness of the prevalence and demographic attributes of patients with MCCs and the identified barriers to care may help improve patient engagement and treatment outcomes for this high-cost population. This paper provides recommendations for enhancing MCC patient care outcomes in the current and post-COVID-19 health care delivery settings.",

The primary outcome of interest was all-cause return ED visits, and our secondary outcomes were hospital admissions and completed primary care appointments.Patients with ED visits who received navigation were matched to comparable patients with ED visits without an ED navigator interaction. Outcomes were analyzed using fixed effects logistic regression models adjusted for patient demographics, ED visit characteristics, and preceding utilization. Our primary outcome was odds of a return ED visit within 30 days, and our secondary outcomes were odds of a hospitalization within 30 days and odds of having primary care visit within 30 days.In our sample, there were 1117 ED visits by patients meeting our inclusion criteria with an ED navigator interaction, with 3351 matched controls. ED navigation was associated with 52% greater odds of a completed follow-up primary care appointment (odds ratio [OR], 1.52; 95% CI, 1.29-1.77). In patients with no ED visits in the preceding 6 months, ED navigation was associated with 32% decreased odds of repeat ED visits in the subsequent 30 days (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52-0.90). There was no statistically significant impact on return ED visits in those with higher baseline ED utilization.Our program demonstrates that high-intensity, short-term patient navigation in the ED can help reduce ED visits in those with low baseline ED utilization and facilitate stronger connections with primary care.",

Until now, no rigorous systematic review has synthesized studies about the cost-effectiveness of case management.A systematic review was performed.The bibliographic databases PubMed and CINAHL Plus were systematically searched using key blocks and synonyms of the terms case management, effectiveness, and costs. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Consensus Health Economic Criteria list.A total of 29 studies were included. In 3 studies, the intervention was less effective and more costly than the control group and can therefore be considered not cost-effective. Two studies found that the intervention was less effective and less costly. A more effective and less costly intervention, and therefore a strong recommendation for case management, was found in 6 studies. In 17 studies, the intervention was more effective while being more costly. Nearly half of the studies met most of the quality criteria, with 16 or more points out of 19.Existing studies often have adequate quality and, in many cases, show cost-effective or even cost-saving results. Case management appears to be a promising method to support patients facing complex care situations. However, variation among case management approaches is very high, and the topic needs further study to determine the most cost-effective way of providing such care coordination.",

    "abstract": "Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic neural- and immune-mediated disease that is characterized by intense itch, history of skin scratching, and development of papulonodular lesions. These lesions can develop consequent to a cycle of itching and scratching associated with inflammation and changes in skin cells and nerve fibers (eg, pathogenic skin fibrosis, tissue remodeling, and chronic neuronal sensitization). Diagnosis of PN involves individual evaluation of clinical characteristics to identify disease and symptom severity. In the United States, adult patients with PN (estimated, < 90,000) are more likely to be older (age, 50-60 years); in addition, this disease is detected at higher rates in women and Black individuals relative to other demographic subgroups. Still, the small population of patients with PN exhibits considerably high use of health care resources and experiences considerable symptom burden and negatively impacted quality of life. Further, PN is associated with increased rates of a range of comorbid diseases compared with other inflammatory dermatoses (eg, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis). Adequate treatment must address both the neural and immunological component of the disease; there remains a great unmet need for safe and effective therapies that can reduce the burden of disease.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: \"Sludge,\" or the frictions or administrative burdens that make it difficult for people to attain what they want or need, is an unexplored health care delivery factor that may contribute to deficiencies in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. We piloted a method to identify and quantify sludge in a southeastern US health system's delivery of CRC screening services. Study Design: Mixed methods sludge audit. Methods: We collected and analyzed quantitative (insurance claims, electronic health record, and administrative files) and qualitative (stakeholder interviews and process observations) data associated with CRC screening for instances of sludge. Because they contribute to sludge and reduce system capacity for high-value screening, we also evaluated low-value CRC screening processes. Results: Although specific results were likely amplified by effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the sludge audit revealed important areas for improvement. A 60.4% screening rate was observed. Approximately half of screening orders were not completed. The following categories of sludge were identified: communication, time, technology, administrative tasks, paperwork, and low-value care. For example, wait times for screening colonoscopy were substantial, duplicate orders were common, and some results were not accessible in the electronic health record. Of completed screenings, 32% were low-value and 38% were associated with low-value preoperative testing. There was evidence of a differential negative impact of sludge to vulnerable patients. Conclusions: Our sludge audit method identified and quantified multiple instances of sludge in a health system's CRC screening processes. Sludge audits can help organizations to systematically evaluate and reduce sludge for more effective and equitable CRC screening.",

Study design Telephone survey of employed adults participating in the Kansas Medicaid Buy-In program, Working Healthy, about their experiences in accessing medications after their transition to Part D. Methods A total of 328 (55%) individuals from a random sample of 600 agreed to participate in a survey administered by a university-based research unit during February and March 2006, which included 18 questions with yes/no, multiple choice, and open-ended responses. Participants resembled other Kansas dual eligibles demographically and medically, other than having slightly higher rates of mental illness and lower rates of mental retardation and some physical conditions. Participants' 2004 Medicare and Medicaid claims data were analyzed to obtain an overview of their comorbidities and previous prescription use. Results Twenty percent of participants reported difficulty obtaining medications, including drugs in Part D-protected classes; 13% were required to switch medications; and 8% stopped taking at least 1 medication. More than half did not know they could change plans monthly, potentially improving their access to medications. Conclusion The high incidence of access problems despite Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) safeguards points to the need for ongoing monitoring of Part D. If the problems persist, CMS must be willing to modify the program and/or better enforce the rules already in place to avoid adverse outcomes for beneficiaries with disabilities.",

Infection is often asymptomatic, which increases the risk of unwitting transmission. Up to 29 million American women between the ages of 14 and 59 years are currently infected, and 80% of women will contract the infection by 50 years of age. Persistent oncogenic HPV infection is the leading cause of cervical dysplasia and neoplasia, and evidence shows that oncogenic HPV is present in 99.7% of cervical cancer specimens. Cervical cancer and cervical dysplasias are responsible for the vast majority of morbidities and deaths associated with HPV-related illness. The direct annual healthcare costs for screening, treating, and managing abnormalities related to cervical cancer and cervical dysplasias in the United States are estimated to be as high as $4.6 billion. Although the direct costs of cervical cancer are substantial, only 10% of all expenditures derive from invasive disease; more than two thirds of the total cost is attributable to screening and testing. Annual indirect costs resulting from lost productivity and loss of earnings due to premature death are also significant and are estimated to be higher than direct costs.",

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. METHODS We identified all patients with diabetes mellitus receiving care in US Department of Veterans Affairs facilities during 2004. Cases received at least 6 prescriptions for chronic opioids during 2004, while controls were randomly selected from among patients with diabetes who received no opioids. We compared process measures (glycosylated hemoglobin and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels tested and an eye examination performed) and outcome measures (glycosylated hemoglobin level < or =9.0% and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level < or =130 mg/dL) between groups. RESULTS Cases (n = 47,756) had slightly worse diabetes performance measures than controls (n = 220,912) after adjustment for covariates. For example, 86.4% of cases and 89.0% of controls had a glycosylated hemoglobin test during fiscal year 2004 (adjusted odds ratio, 0.69; P <.001). Among cases, receipt of higher-dose opioids was associated with additional decrement in diabetes performance measures, with a dose-response relationship. CONCLUSIONS Chronic opioid therapy among patients within the Veterans Affairs system is associated with slightly worse diabetes performance measures compared with patients who do not receive opioids. However, patients receiving higher dosages of opioids had additional decrements in diabetes performance measures; these patients may be appropriate targets for interventions to improve their care for pain and diabetes.",

Multivariate analyses were adjusted for age, sex, geographic region, comorbidities, specialist consultation, controller medication use, and asthma severity.Half of high and excessive SABA users had few or no controller claims. Compared with SABA nonusers, high and excessive SABA users had significantly higher odds (odds ratio [95% confidence interval]) of asthma-related emergency department/urgent care visits (6.47 [5.25, 7.98] and 7.68 [6.04, 9.76], respectively), hospitalizations (5.37 [6.04, 9.76]; 6.90 [4.90, 9.73]), and oral corticosteroid use (2.89 [2.72, 3.08]; 3.71 [3.41, 4.03]). Excessive SABA users had 3.0 times ($1791) and high SABA users had 2.2 times ($1326) higher asthma-related healthcare costs than low SABA users ($595). Total costs also increased with higher SABA use, but with smaller incremental differences between excessive and high SABA users and low SABA users.Increased SABA use is associated with higher total and asthma-related healthcare costs.

Selected practice demographics were collected for comparison purposes.Of 890 providers representing 217 practices who were eligible for the city subsidy, 37.7% enrolled, with a mean of 96.6 days from first attempt to enrollment and a mean of 10 outreach attempts. The offer for full payment of technical assistance fees and hardware yielded an additional 100 providers representing 43 practices, a 14.1% enrollment rate.

The offer for a partial rebate had the lowest yield (a 6.2% enrollment rate), a mean of 169.3 days from first attempt to enrollment, and a mean number of 19 outreach attempts.Because of diverse needs and levels of awareness in the EHR adoption process, a flexible milestone-based process is needed to engage primary care providers. In particular, community influence and additional funding were necessary for increasing enrollment among providers in medically underserved neighborhoods. These providers also required persistent and numerous follow-up attempts. Because billions of dollars in federal aid are being offered, effective local recruitment strategies are needed to facilitate provider engagement to increase EHR adoption rates.",

Study design Using data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, we provided state-level estimates of the size and structure of the US individual market from 2002 to 2009. We estimated the number of insurers expected to have MLRs below the legislated minimum and their corresponding enrollment. In the case of noncompliant insurers exiting the market, we estimated the number of enrollees that may be vulnerable to major coverage disruption given poor health status. Results In 2009, using a PPACA-adjusted MLR definition, we estimated that 29% of insurer-state observations in the individual market would have MLRs below the 80% minimum, corresponding to 32% of total enrollment. Nine states would have at least one-half of their health insurers below the threshold. If insurers below the MLR threshold exit the market, major coverage disruption could occur for those in poor health; we estimated the range to be between 104,624 and 158,736 member-years. Conclusion The introduction of MLR regulation as part of the PPACA has the potential to significantly affect the functioning of the individual market for health insurance.",

Health plans with restricted of providers have proved surprisingly popular on the Affordable Care Act health insurance exchanges because of a substantial gap in premiums between plans with open networks and closed networks. The objective of this paper is to assess which other attributes of the provider network matter to patients when choosing health insurance. Study design We used a discrete choice experiment to analyze the effect of previously unobserved characteristics regarding provider networks on plan choice, including wait time, breadth, travel time, whether the plan covers care for their personal doctor, and monthly premium. Hypothetical plan options were offered to respondents of an online survey using Qualtrics software. Methods We used mixed multinomial logit models to estimate preference-based utilities for attributes of primary care provider networks and willingness to pay. Results Coverage of a personal doctor was the most important attribute, followed by premium, wait time to see a primary care provider, the breadth of the network, and travel time to the closest doctor covered by the plan. Respondents were willing to pay $95 per month to have a plan that covers care for their personal doctor, and they were willing to wait 6 days for an appointment to have a plan covering care for their personal doctor. Conclusions The results of this study provide new insights to federal and state legislators developing new models or standards on network adequacy and patient decision support tools.",

This study aimed to examine outcomes associated with the MedWise Risk Score (MRS) in a Medicare Part D population, including total medical expenditures, ADEs, falls, mortality, emergency department (ED) visits, hospital admissions, and length of stay (LOS).Retrospective observational study.The association between MRS and patient health outcomes was derived using drug claims data from 213,561 beneficiaries and medication risk stratification using outcomes data in 2018 with 1 year of follow-up. Analyses were conducted with the Max MRS and the Mean MRS calculated over the year. Analyses utilizing the Max MRS performed better, and results using the Max MRS are presented. Statistical analyses were performed using linear regression, logistic regression, negative binomial regression, and zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) models.Of 203,630 patients studied (mean ± SD age, 76.0 ± 8.0 years), 4.9%, 9.8%, 24.5%, and 15.5% experienced at least 1 ADE, fall, ED visit, and hospital admission, respectively, in 2018. The MRS was associated with an 8.5% change in total medical expenditure per 1-unit increase. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) of ADE was 1.058 (95% CI, 1.055-1.06)/unit MRS. ADEs, falls, and death were more likely in elevated MRS categories (eg, OR of 4.45 for ADEs [95% CI, 4.10-4.83], 5.51 for falls [95% CI, 5.17-5.87], and 4.42 for death [95% CI, 3.82-5.12], respectively forSevere MRS group). Our model predicts 7000 ED visits for every 100,000 patients per unit increase of the MRS. The ZIP models estimated ORs of 1.03 and 1.01 for hospital admissions and increase in hospital LOS, respectively, per MRS unit.This study shows that MRS was associated with health outcomes and therefore could be used to identify patients at increased risk of negative outcomes based primarily on their medication regimens.",

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's National Readmissions Database for 2013 and 2014. METHODS All patients 18 years and older with a 30-day readmission in 2014 were included. We assessed if readmission to a hospital different from that of the index admission was associated with in-hospital mortality, length of stay, and costs of readmission, separately by whether the readmission occurred for the same or different major diagnostic category. Patients with 1 of 3 common diagnoses (congestive heart failure [CHF], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], or myocardial infarction) were studied for disease-specific trends. The same analyses were performed on 2013 data as a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS In 2014, among 792,596 patients with a 30-day readmission, 22.2% experienced fragmentation. Compared with patients whose readmission occurred at the index hospital, patients readmitted to a different hospital experienced 20% higher odds of dying in hospital (P = .02 for same diagnosis readmission; P = .03 for different diagnosis readmission), a half-a-day longer length of stay (P < .001 for both same and different diagnosis readmissions), and more than $1000 higher costs (P < .001 for both same and different diagnosis readmissions). For patients with a CHF or COPD index admission, mortality was consistently higher for fragmented readmissions for a different condition. CONCLUSIONS Fragmented readmissions were associated with higher in-hospital mortality and cost.

    "abstract": "The understanding of which factors are associated with inability to access health care services due to the COVID-19 pandemic is limited. We aimed to examine factors associated with being unable to access health care due to the pandemic among Medicare beneficiaries.A cross-sectional study.We analyzed the summer and fall 2020 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Rapid Response Supplement Questionnaire data. Our study included community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older (summer: n = 8751; fall: n = 7421). Logistic regressions were used to examine factors (eg, sociodemographics, comorbidities) associated with being unable to access health care services due to the pandemic.Approximately 20.9% and 7.5% of the beneficiaries reported they were unable to access health care services due to the pandemic in the summer and fall of 2020, respectively. The most frequent types of services that beneficiaries were unable to access were dental care (summer, 45.5%; fall, 35.1%) and regular check-ups (summer, 35.9%; fall, 46.1%). Beneficiaries who reported a higher income (income ≥ $25,000) (summer: odds ratio [OR], 1.55; P < .001; fall: OR, 1.52; P = .002) or speaking English at home (summer: OR, 1.50; P = .016; fall: OR, 1.53; P = .082) were more likely to report being unable to access services than their counterparts (lower income or speaking a language other than English at home). Beneficiaries with at least 4 chronic conditions were unable to access health care significantly more often than those with 1 or no conditions.Given that sociodemographics and comorbidity burden contributed to the disparities that we observed in accessibility of health care services due to the pandemic, these findings can allow decision makers to target resource allocation and outreach efforts to those populations most at risk.",

We estimated separate regressions for safety-net clinics and hospitals.We find that growth of contracts with 340B hospitals was uncorrelated with uninsured rates, poverty rates, or areas of medical underservice. By contrast, we find that growth of contracts with 340B safety-net clinics was positively correlated with poverty rates and metropolitan statistical status. These findings suggest different patterns of access for patients.Our results add systematic evidence of a difference in how the 2 main types of 340B participants-hospitals and safety-net clinics-use the 340B program. Policy proposals to reform 340B should consider reforms for safety-net clinics and hospitals separately.",

We compared the top and bottom quintiles, in terms of the O/E ratio, of clinics. Multivariable regression was used to estimate the effect of the clinic-level measures on the O/E ratio.Clinics in the top quintile had higher rates of care continuity and quality measures, as well as a lower proportion of disadvantaged populations in their catchment areas. In the regression model, 10% increases in a clinic's rate of weekly provider visits, nurse visits, and debridement were associated with 2.5%, 3.0% and 0.7% increases, respectively, in the O/E ratio. The weekly provider visit rate had a greater marginal effect when the proportion of African American residents in the clinic's catchment area was larger.Clinic-level measures of care continuity, clinical quality, and sociodemographic composition of their catchment areas' population explain a meaningful part of differences in clinics' wound healing performance. Better care continuity appears to have a greater beneficial effect in disadvantaged populations.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Although high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) reduce health care spending, higher deductibles may lead to forgone care. Our goal was to determine the effects of HDHPs on the use of and spending on substance use disorder (SUD) services. Study Design: We used difference-in-differences models to compare service use and spending for treating SUD among enrollees who were newly offered an HDHP relative to enrollees offered only traditional plan options throughout the study period. Methods: We used deidentified commercial claims data from OptumLabs (2007-2017) to identify a sample of 28,717,236 person-years (2.2% with a diagnosed SUD). The main independent measure was an indicator for being offered an HDHP. The main dependent measures were the probability of (and spending associated with) using SUD services and specific treatment types. Results: Enrollees were 6.6% (,P, < .001) less likely to use SUD services after being offered an HDHP relative to the comparison group. Reductions were concentrated in inpatient, intermediate, and ambulatory care, as well as medication use. Being offered an HDHP was associated with a decrease of 21% (,P, < .001) on health plan spending and an increase of 14% (,P, < .01) on out-of-pocket spending. Conclusions: Offering an HDHP was associated with a reduction in SUD service use and a shift in spending from the plan to the enrollee. In the context of the US drug epidemic, these study findings highlight a concern that the movement toward HDHPs may be exacerbating undertreatment of SUD",

One model, developed by Medical Home Network, used AI to analyze SDOH data, ADT activity, and claims and demographic characteristics, whereas the other model (Chronic Illness and Disability Payment System [CDPS]) relied only on demographic and claims information. To compare models, we calculated mean, median, and total spending for members with the highest 5% of AI risk scores and compared these with spending metrics for members with the highest 5% of CDPS scores. We also compared the number of members with the highest 5% of costs prospectively identified by each model as highest risk. We segmented the population by length of prior enrollment to control for varying levels of claims experience.The AI model consistently identified a higher proportion of the highest-spending members. Members deemed highest risk by the AI model also had higher spending than members deemed highest risk by the CDPS model.Identification of high-cost members can be improved by using AI to combine traditional sources of data (eg, claims and demographic information) with nontraditional sources (eg, SDOH, admission alerts).",

We estimated the association between changes in the quantities of EHR inbox notifications and PCP burnout. Study Design: In this observational study, we tested the association between the percent change in daily inbox notification volumes and PCP burnout after an initiative to reduce low-value notifications at the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Methods: The VHA initiative resulted in increases and decreases in notification volumes for PCPs. For each facility, the proportion of PCPs reporting burnout was estimated using VHA All Employee Survey responses before and after the initiative in 2016 and 2018, respectively. Survey responses were aggregated for 6459 PCPs (physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants) at 138 VHA facilities. Fixed effects regression models estimated the association of small and large increases and small and large decreases in notifications on burnout. Results: Daily inbox notifications per PCP decreased by a mean (SD) of 5.9% (30.1%) across study facilities, from a mean (SD) of 128 (52) notifications to 114 (44) notifications after the initiative. Fifty-one percent of facilities experienced reductions in notifications, 30% experienced no change, and 20% experienced increased notifications. PCP burnout was not significantly associated with any level of increase or decrease in notifications. Conclusions: Changes in notification volumes alone did not predict PCP burnout. Future research to reduce burnout might still address EHR notification volumes, but as part of a broader set of strategies that consider the other stressors that PCPs experience.",

Study Design: We designed a dashboard for presenting summative and finer-grained data to health plans for characterizing how well plans are serving individuals who belong to racial/ethnic minority groups and individuals with low income. The data presented in the dashboard were based on CMS' Health Equity Summary Score (HESS) for Medicare Advantage plans. Methods: Interviews and listening sessions were conducted with health plan representatives and other stakeholders to assess understanding, perceived usefulness, and interpretability of HESS data. Usability testing was conducted with individuals familiar with quality measurement and reporting to evaluate dashboard design efficiency. Results: Listening session participants understood the purpose of the HESS and expressed a desire for this type of information. Usability testing revealed a need to improve dashboard navigability and to streamline content. Conclusions: The HESS dashboard is a potentially useful tool for presenting data on health equity to health plans. The multistage process of continual testing and improvement used to develop the dashboard could be a model for targeting and deciding upon quality improvement efforts in the domain of health equity.",

We compared regional home dialysis use by White and non-White individuals over time. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study of dialysis facilities offering home dialysis in 2006-2016 and of 1,098,579 patients with prevalent ESKD in 2006-2016. Methods: We compared hospital referral region (HRR) utilization rates of home dialysis between White and non-White patients over time using a generalized estimating equation model with a negative binomial distribution adjusting for regional characteristics. Results: The mean number of facilities offering home dialysis operating in each HRR increased from 15.6 in 2006 to 22.1 in 2016. Observed mean HRR home dialysis rates increased overall, but White patients maintained greater home dialysis use than non-White patients: 19.7% in 2006 and 26.2% in 2016 among White patients vs 13.0% in 2006 and 17.8% in 2016 among non-White patients.

Study Design: Counterfactual simulation. Methods: Using a nationally representative sample from the 2018 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, we simulated the direct medical care savings and indirect cost savings from reduced absenteeism resulting from PIVPT among commercially insured working adults with self-reported MSK conditions. Model parameters of the impact of PIVPT are drawn from peer-reviewed literature. Four potential benefits of PIVPT are explored: (1) more rapid access to PT, (2) improved adherence to PT, (3) less expensive PT care per episode, and (4) reduced/avoided referral costs of PT. Results: The mean medical care savings per person per year from PIVPT range between $1116 and $1523. Savings are mainly attributed to early initiation of PT (35%) and lower cost of PT (33%). The benefits of PIVPT result in a mean reduction of 6.6 hours in pain-related missed work per person per year. The return on investment of PIVPT is 2.0 (medical savings only) or 2.2 (medical savings plus reduced absenteeism). Conclusions: PIVPT service provides added value to MSK care by facilitating earlier access and better adherence to PT and lowering the cost of PT.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) imposes a large and growing burden on the population, with a prevalence that is projected to increase to more than 8 million adults by 2030. The high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with HF is further exacerbated by the frequent presence of comorbidities. The coexistence of HF and comorbid conditions can result in emergency department visits and hospitalizations that not only affect patients and their families but also pose a growing economic burden on health care systems. The largest costs arise from hospitalization for HF, with outpatient care and associated medication costs comprising the second largest component. For patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), defined as left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less, remarkable improvements in outcomes have been observed in recent decades due to the availability of disease-modifying therapies. However, the management of HFrEF remains suboptimal, with many patients either not receiving guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) or experiencing delays in receiving target doses. Since this can result in preventable hospitalizations and deaths, action is needed to ensure rapid initiation of GDMT. Optimal treatment can be hindered by such patient factors as the presence of comorbidities and socioeconomic barriers that include the cost of multiple treatments. Furthermore, poor treatment adherence is common among patients with HF. Measures aimed at tailoring therapies to individual patients and reducing medical costs are important to increase the uptake of and adherence to therapy and therefore improve clinical outcomes.",

Study Design: Retrospective cohort study using Blue Cross Blue Shield of Rhode Island claims incurred from January 1, 2019, to March 31, 2022, among commercial and Medicare Advantage members. Methods: Difference-in-differences analyses were used to compare changes in health care spend between the 12 months before (baseline period) and the 12 months after (post period) COVID-19 diagnosis for COVID-19 cases and contemporaneous matched controls without COVID-19. Results: Overall, there were 7224 commercial and 1630 Medicare Advantage members with a COVID-19 diagnosis on/before March 31, 2021, each with a matched control, yielding a sample of 14,448 commercial and 3260 Medicare Advantage members.

Study Design: Secondary analysis of the 2022 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS), a cross-sectional survey representative of US adults. Methods: We estimated multivariable probit regressions to understand how sexual orientation was associated with reporting telehealth use, modality (video only, telephone only, both), and experiences, including the reason for, subject of most recent, and quality of the telehealth visit. We adjusted estimates based on respondents' self-reported demographics and health status. Analyses were weighted to represent the US adult population and used full information maximum likelihood to account for missing data. Results: Among all HINTS respondents, having a telehealth visit within the past year was more common among sexual minority respondents than heterosexual respondents. Among telehealth users, sexual minority respondents were more likely than heterosexual respondents to say that they used telehealth because it was convenient and minimized their exposure to illnesses and that the subject of the most recent telehealth visit was mental health. They were less likely to say the subject was minor/acute care. Modality use and quality were comparable between sexual minority respondents and heterosexual respondents. Conclusions: The findings show greater demand for telehealth, especially for mental health care, among sexual minority adults. Knowledge of factors driving patterns in health care utilization within minoritized communities and the implications for both telehealth access and quality are necessary to create policies that have a broad positive impact.",

We assessed associations between race and ethnicity and prevalence of IMIDs and overlap syndrome using US claims and electronic health records from 2021. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study of 10.8 million adults. Methods: We identified the 10 most prevalent IMIDs among frequently discussed IMIDs. We estimated associations between the 5 most prevalent IMIDs and overlap syndrome in Hispanic and non-Hispanic Asian and Black adults using non-Hispanic White adults as the referent and stratifying by sex and age (20-39, 40-59, and ≥ 60 years). Results: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), multiple sclerosis (MS), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were the most prevalent IMIDs in all races and ethnicities. We observed positive associations (,P, < .0001) between Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black adults and SLE, Asian women of all ages and Asian men younger than 60 years and SLE, Black women younger than 60 years and MS, and Hispanic and non-White women 60 years or older and RA. Hispanic and non-White adults of all age groups had inverse associations (,P, < .0001) with IBD. Non-Hispanic Black adults of all ages and Hispanic and non-Hispanic Asian women 40 years or older had inverse associations (,P, < .0001) with psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis. Overlap syndrome was rare among all groups, with some variation in which IMIDs co-occurred. Conclusions: We found racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence and co-occurrence of IMIDs in this sample of US adults. Because misdiagnoses are relatively frequent for patients with IMIDs, awareness of racial and ethnic variations in IMIDs could aid early diagnosis and improve disease management.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: This study determined whether naturally occurring but significantly different outpatient follow-up frequencies are associated with clinical outcomes and service waiting times. Study Design: Longitudinal retrospective study. Methods: This study was conducted in an outpatient setting. Participants consisted of 340 patients with major depressive disorder who were randomly assigned to 4 psychiatrists and were followed at a variable frequency defined by the clinician. Patients were assessed at baseline and at every visit with structured interviews and self-reported questionnaires. These groups were also compared according to their baseline characteristics, treatment, and appointment frequencies. Little’s law was used to estimate the impact of modifying the appointment frequencies on the service waiting time. Results: The demographic variables, prescriptions, and depression severity at intake of patients across the 4 groups were similar. The mean times between appointments of the 4 groups were significantly different (87.0, 46.9, 67.9, and 61.5 days, respectively; ,P, < .001), but these differences in outpatient follow-up frequency were not associated with clinical outcomes (eg, mean last Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report score, 10.5, 10.0, 11.9, and 9.7; ,P, = .25). However, different outpatient follow-up frequencies had an estimated impact on waiting times for access to care; using Little’s law, it was observed that the waiting list would be eliminated by reducing by 23.9% the follow-up frequencies of the 3 psychiatrists with the highest frequencies. Conclusions: Although variations in appointment frequencies do not appear to have a major impact on clinical outcomes, they could be managed to achieve significant improvements in the accessibility of the clinic.",

Study Design: Cohort study using national Medicare data. Methods: Among Medicare beneficiaries with 30-day readmissions in 2018, we examined repeat imaging on the same body system during the readmission. This was evaluated between fragmented and nonfragmented (same-hospital) readmissions and across categories of electronic information sharing via health information exchanges (HIEs) in fragmented readmissions: admission and readmission hospitals share the same HIE, admission and readmission hospitals participate in different HIEs, one or both do not participate in HIE, or HIE data missing. This relationship was evaluated using unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression. Results: Overall, 14.3% of beneficiaries experienced repeat imaging during their readmission. Compared with nonfragmented readmissions, fragmented readmissions were associated with 5% higher odds of repeat imaging on the same body system in older adults without AD. This was not mitigated by the presence of electronic information sharing: Fragmented readmissions to hospitals that shared an HIE had 6% higher odds of repeat imaging (adjusted OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.00-1.13). There was no difference seen in the odds of repeat imaging for older adults with AD. Conclusions: Despite substantial investment, HIEs as currently deployed and used are not associated with decreased odds of repeat imaging in readmissions.",

Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: The system uses medications, demographics, diagnoses, laboratory results, health care utilization patterns, and costs to stratify patients' risk of ED visits and hospitalizations. Patients were assigned 1 of 22 risk levels based on their system-generated risk percentile of either ED visits or hospitalizations. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds of ED visits and hospitalizations associated with each successive risk level compared with the 45th to 50th percentiles. After stratification, 100 high-risk (95th-100th percentiles) and 100 medium-risk (45th-55th percentiles) patients were randomly selected for generation of medication recommendations. Two clinical pharmacists reviewed the system-generated medication recommendations for these patients. Results: Logistic regression models predicting 3-month utilization showed that compared with the 45th to 50th percentiles, patients in the top 1% risk percentile had ORs of 7.9 and 17.3 for ED visits and hospitalizations, respectively. The first 5 high-priority medications on each patient's medication list were associated with a mean (SD) of 6.65 (4.09) warnings. Of 1290 warnings reviewed, 1151 (89.2%) were assessed as correct. Conclusions: The FeelBetter system effectively stratifies older patients with multimorbidity at risk of ED use and hospitalizations. Medication recommendations provided by the system are largely accurate and can potentially be beneficial for patient care.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated telehealth expansion trends as policy makers instituted flexibilities and coverage changes. Federal telehealth flexibilities expire, however, at the end of 2024. To decide whether to extend those flexibilities, policy makers need information about consumer telehealth preferences, impacts of telehealth on care usage and quality, and telehealth accessibility for the full diversity of patients. Research from one of the nation's largest integrated, value-based health systems provides insights. Findings suggest that telehealth utilization has dropped since the peak of the pandemic but remains higher than prepandemic levels. Telehealth appears to be replacing in-person visits rather than leading to more total visits. Patients generally prefer in-person care but many like having the option to use video- and phone-based telehealth, and both video- and phone-based care appear to be helping patients access primary care. An integrated, value-based care approach may assist a diverse range of patients in accessing telehealth services. Action is still needed, however, to ensure that the full diversity of patients can easily access telehealth offerings. Based on experiences within our health system, we recommend that policy makers maintain public and private payer coverage for video- and phone-based telehealth services; encourage well-designed value-based payment models to simplify and expand telehealth access; improve broadband accessibility and broadband and device affordability so that all patients can access telehealth services; and hold digital health to equivalent high standards for care quality, safety, patient satisfaction, clinical outcomes, and health equity as in-person care.",

Current national guidelines set the blood pressure goal for those with diabetes at < 130/80 mm Hg, which is lower than the goal for the general population (<140/90 mm Hg). Achieving this goal, however, remains difficult, with blood pressure control rates being lower for patients with diabetes than for those without diabetes. Large clinical trials have demonstrated that in most cases, patients will require 2 or more antihypertensive agents to achieve goal blood pressure. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system plays a key role in regulation of blood pressure. The angiotensin AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs), which block the effects of angiotensin II, not only lower blood pressure but also provide target-organ protection. These agents are generally well-tolerated, with a side effect profile similar to placebo. Clinical comparisons of different drugs within the class have shown that olmesartan, the newest ARB, produced greater reductions in blood pressure than other agents and that a greater percentage of patients treated with olmesartan reached target blood pressure. Combining an ARB with a diuretic may allow more patients to reach goal blood pressure.",

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective analysis of a regional MCO identifying adults diagnosed with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB) or community- acquired pneumonia (CAP). METHODS A claims database examination of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes was conducted to identify adults receiving initial outpatient care for an LRTI during 2005-2006. Medical record review then was conducted to verify clinical diagnosis of AECB or CAP. Clinical and demographic data were collected. Outpatient office and clinic visits, hospitalization, and radiology, pathology, and pharmacy records were used to determine treatment costs. Treatment failure was determined by use of a second antibiotic course, follow-up emergency room presentation, or hospitalization for LRTI within 28 days of the index visit. The primary outcome was per-case treatment cost from the payer perspective. RESULTS Clinical diagnosis was confirmed for 65 unique coded visits (60 patients; 39 with AECB, 22 with CAP; 1 in both cohorts). Initial visit, initial diagnostic testing, and subsequent hospitalization accounted for the majority (63%) of payer costs. Antibiotics were responsible for 15% of payer costs. Higher initial antibiotic expenditure in the AECB cohort yielded a cost-benefit ratio of 3:1. Mean per-case costs for success and failure were $277 & $372 for AECB, and $493 & $3019 for CAP, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Initial visit and hospitalization costs contribute the majority of payer expenditure while antibiotic expenditure incurs a nominal burden. Higher expenditure on initial antibiotic therapy in the AECB population appears to be beneficial.",

Logistic regression models estimated the probability that beneficiaries, by ethnicity, switched to a different lipid-lowering medication, augmented therapy with another lipid-lowering agent, or titrated the dosage of the drug upward over the course of the year.The models revealed that African Americans were less likely to switch lipid-lowering agents (odds ratio [OR], 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.78), augment lipid-lowering agents (OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.43-0.66), or titrate upward (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.67-0.84) than whites.These results suggest that African Americans may be receiving less aggressive treatment than other patients, which in turn may explain why many studies find that African Americans are less likely to reach lipid goals.

The efficacy of higher-potency regimens in clinical practice in patients who have not achieved their LDL goal on generic therapy is not well characterized. The primary objective of this study was to determine the LDL-lowering efficacy of higher-potency strategies (ezetimibe/simvastatin, rosuvastatin, and atorvastatin) in high-risk patients who were switched from simvastatin therapy. Secondary objectives were to evaluate patient adherence to these therapies, determine the efficacy of these interventions on other lipid parameters, and define the incidence of adverse effects. Study Design: Retrospective data analysis derived from the Veterans Affairs Health Care System VISN 21 over a 3-year time period. Methods: Lipid data were assessed prior to and within 2 to 6 months following the conversion from simvastatin. Adherence to therapy was determined by medication refill data. Results: Treatment with ezetimibe/simvastatin resulted in significantly greater reductions in LDL compared with rosuvastatin or atorvastatin (37 vs 25 and 26 mg/dL, respectively; P <0.05). Adherence to therapy was 51% of all patients studied. All treatments significantly lowered total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides when compared with simvastatin. There was no difference between treatment groups in the number of adverse events. Conclusions: At the doses used in this population, ezetimibe/simvastatin resulted in greater LDL reductions than rosuvastatin or atorvastatin.

    "abstract": "Patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including treatment satisfaction, patient well-being, and quality of life, are becoming increasingly important contributors to treatment decisions in clinical practice and the evaluation of health care services. PROs have been included in a number of clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), including those investigating glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). The first oral GLP-1RA, oral semaglutide, was approved in the United States in 2019. Four PROs were included in the PIONEER clinical study program that evaluated oral semaglutide in patients with T2D across the full diabetes disease spectrum. PRO findings in the PIONEER studies were generally similar for oral semaglutide and comparators, with some exceptions. Improvements in a number of the 36-item Short Form Survey domains were observed for oral semaglutide versus placebo, including general health, bodily pain, physical component summary, social functioning, and mental health. For general health and social functioning, differences significantly favored oral semaglutide versus empagliflozin, whereas role-physical and the physical component summary significantly favored empagliflozin compared with oral semaglutide. The Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire findings indicated that oral semaglutide improved feelings of unacceptably high blood sugars versus placebo (in PIONEER 4, 5, and 8) and sitagliptin (in PIONEER 7). Significant improvements in craving control and craving for savory were observed with oral semaglutide versus empagliflozin in the Control of Eating Questionnaire (in PIONEER 2). These data provide valuable information that can facilitate a patient-centered approach and guide decision-making in managed care to optimize each patient's treatment experience.",

Study design A pre-post observational evaluation of a quality improvement initiative in a healthcare system in Washington state. Methods Men with BPH seen in urology clinics and all men diagnosed with localized PRCA were identified for an intervention period, in which urologists were instructed to order a DA for every patient with those conditions, and a historical control period. Outcomes were 6-month rates of surgery for BPH, any active treatment (hormone therapy, radiation, or surgery) for PRCA, and total healthcare costs. Results During the intervention, DAs were delivered to 22% of men with recent BPH drug treatment, 24% of men with untreated BPH, and 56% of men with PRCA. DA implementation was associated with a 32% lower rate of surgery among men with treated BPH (rate ratio [RR], 0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.94) and a nonsignificant 22% lower rate of surgery among men with previously untreated BPH (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.50-1.22). For PRCA, DA implementation was associated with a 27% lower rate of active treatment (RR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57-0.93). We found no significant associations between DA implementation and costs of care for either condition. Conclusions Implementing patient DAs was associated with lower rates of elective surgery for previously treated BPH and active treatment for localized PRCA; however, implementation of these DAs was not associated with lower costs of care.",

Limited research has been conducted within the US health system to better define LOS outliers and the risk factors for becoming an outlier in the setting of inpatient medicine stays. Study design This was a retrospective study on adult inpatient admissions to the general medicine service of a university hospital from September 2015 to August 2016. Cases were defined as patients with observed LOS 3 SD above predicted. Controls were defined as those who stayed within 3 SD of predicted LOS. Methods A total of 108 LOS outliers were identified through the University Health System Consortium, and 72 were matched with inlier controls by principal diagnosis and disease severity. Results Compared with their inlier controls, outliers stayed 32.41 days longer and cost $77,228 more per stay. There were higher odds of being an outlier observed for patients with a history of smoking (odds ratio [OR], 29.5; 95% CI, 2.9-301.3), in-hospital complications (OR, 17.6; 95% CI, 3.5-88.6), hospital-acquired infections (OR, 7.2; 95% CI, 1.7-31.4), and discharge to a facility (OR, 11.5; 95% CI, 2.6-50.0). Conclusions In-hospital complications, hospital-acquired infections, and discharge to a facility are all predictors of not only increasing hospital days for patients but also increasing the risk of becoming LOS outliers, who stay disproportionately longer and use disproportionately more resources than predicted.",

    "abstract": "Objectives:, COVID-19 has caused considerable drops in utilization of breast cancer screening services during the pandemic, especially among certain racial and ethnic groups. Members of the Community Oncology Alliance (COA)—including the COA president, South Carolina oncologist Kashyap Patel, MD—have reported increases in patients, particularly those of color, presenting with stage III and IV cancer at diagnosis. According to data released by the Biden administration, more than 9.5 million recommended cancer screenings had been missed in the United States as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as of February 2022. President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden, EdD, aim to address this in the 2022 revitalized Cancer Moonshot Initiative. The findings made by COA as well as by Avalere also suggest that the pandemic has exacerbated existing health care disparities. Methods:, Using a multipayer database, we analyzed breast cancer screening rates for 2 periods—March 1 to September 30, 2019, and March 1 to September 30, 2020—among Medicare fee-for-service (FFS), managed Medicaid, and commercial insurance beneficiaries to understand the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on adherence to the US Preventive Services Task Force breast cancer screening recommendations, which are currently undergoing review. Screening rates were evaluated across 5 racial/ethnic groups and by payer type. Results:, Mean monthly mammogram screening rates among eligible White Medicare FFS beneficiaries dropped to 0.6% in April 2020, but these screening rates recovered to 6.5% by June 2020. Screening rates for eligible Black Medicare FFS beneficiaries recovered on a pace slightly slower than that of White beneficiaries, but more rapidly than that of other groups. By comparison, American Indian/Alaska Native beneficiaries had a mean monthly screening rate of 0.5% in April 2020, which recovered to 3.1% in June 2020; these were below 2019 screening rates of 4.2% for April and 3.9% for June. Differences in screening rates by payer type were also observed. Patients with commercial insurance had higher screening rates compared with those covered by Medicare FFS and managed Medicaid. Conclusions:, Our principal finding shows that mean breast cancer screening rates decreased in April 2020 across all payers, but recovery to prepandemic screening levels has occurred more slowly among certain racial and ethnic minority groups. Differences in recovery rates by payer type highlight a strong relationship between income level and screening utilization.",

    "abstract": "The estimated global prevalence of chronic cough (CC) is close to 10%; however, this is likely higher, as many epidemiologic surveys do not adequately capture symptoms or diagnoses of CC. There is a large healthcare burden associated with CC as well as decreased quality of life (QOL). CC has previously been considered a symptom of other comorbidities. Now that it is regarded as a disease state on its own, education is needed to ensure a CC diagnosis is not missed and is adequately treated. CC is associated with many complications and triggers. Unfortunately, there are few effective therapies for CC, and many have severe adverse effects that limit use. Many people experience decreased QOL because of the impact of CC on daily activities. Because there is not a standard definition of chronic cough in the literature, a comprehensive approach to taking a cough history is essential. It is important to consider all triggers, including occupational and geographic triggers. Identified gaps in care include appropriate history taking, efficacious treatments, and more clinicians specializing in cough. Pharmacists require education on the background of CC and current and future therapies to improve disease competency, clinical decision making, and interventions to enhance the QOL by treating CC. Improved decision making will allow pharmacists to educate people with CC and provide resources to enhance their cough-related QOL. Am J Manag Care,. 2022;28:S-S152-S158.",

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A is a bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in clotting factor VIII (FVIII), leading to recurrent joint bleeds, musculoskeletal damage, and chronic pain. The World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) recommends prophylactic FVIII replacement therapy to reduce bleeding risk, yet joint deterioration and pain persist. Maintaining high FVIII levels provides clinical benefits but requires awareness of best practices and managed care considerations. This publication examines the clinical and economic impact of hemophilia A, treatment goals, FDA-approved therapies, and managed care factors. People with hemophilia experience lower bone mineral density, increased osteoporosis risk, and significant effects on mental health, mobility, and quality of life. Treatment options-including standard and extended half-life FVIII therapies, non-factor therapies, and gene therapy-vary in sustaining FVIII levels and preventing bleeds. The high cost of care burdens patients and health systems, though prophylaxis reduces emergency visits and hospitalizations. Adherence challenges arise as patients transition to self-infusion, and insurance restrictions often limit access to comprehensive care. The WFH supports individualized, patient-centered management with pharmacokinetic-guided dosing, multidisciplinary care, and shared decision-making. Maximizing FVIII levels, rather than maintaining minimal thresholds, may improve long-term health. A holistic approach-combining early intervention, personalized prophylaxis, and strategies to address treatment barriers-is essential to better outcomes and achieving the WFH goal of zero bleeds.",

    "abstract": "The US health care system contributes to approximately 9% of domestic US greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate change and threatening human health. By substituting for in-person visits, telemedicine may represent a means of emission avoidance. Leveraging multipayer claims data, we developed models based on various assumptions to estimate ranges of emissions from travel averted by telemedicine utilization between April 1, 2023, and June 30, 2023. We estimated the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions averted from the avoidance of travel by patients using telemedicine as a substitute for their usual source of in-person care at post-public health emergency rates through a modeling analysis of nationwide multipayer claims data representing 19% of US insured adults; findings were extrapolated to the entire US insured adult population. We quantified a monthly average of 1,481,530 US telemedicine visits (65,733 rural) during the study period. Between 740,765 and 1,348,192 of these were estimated to have substituted for in-person visits. Using inputs of 2021 electric vehicle (EV) production share and emissions per mile, we estimated that between 4,075,065 and 7,489,486 kg of CO2 are averted due to telemedicine use each month. Estimates accounting for different assumptions including EV and public transportation use produce a range of 4 million (most conservative) to 8.9 million (least conservative) kg of CO2 averted per month. Extrapolating to the entire US adult population, we estimate that monthly emissions averted range from 21.4 to 47.6 million kg of CO2-roughly equivalent to the monthly emissions of 61,255 to 130,076 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles. Our results suggest that telemedicine use at 2023 rates modestly decreases the carbon footprint of US health care delivery.",

This study assessed challenges faced by care coordinators serving patients with SUD, including the types and frequencies of barriers, associated care coordinator and patient factors, and their relationship with burnout and job satisfaction. Web-based survey data from 322 Virginia Medicaid MCO care coordinators. Coordinators rated 15 barriers related to providing services to patients with SUD. Principal components analysis (PCA) identified 3 subscales categorizing these challenges (challenges accessing resources, administrative and regulatory burden, and data integration). Multivariable linear regression explored associations between coordinator and patient factors and subscales for categories of barriers. Pearson correlations were used to examine the relationship between these barriers and job satisfaction. Coordinators reported a high frequency of challenges in many care coordinating activities: Between 49% and 82% reported each barrier as \"somewhat\" of a problem or a \"major\" problem. Using PCA, 3 main categories of barriers were identified. Having a high proportion of patients with SUD was associated with greater difficulties in accessing resources (P < .01) and data integration issues (P < .05), and working for specific MCOs was associated with all 3 categories of barriers (P < .05). Job satisfaction and burnout were correlated with all 3 categories as well and were most strongly associated with administrative and regulatory burden.

Women aged 18 to 42 years with at least 1 infertility diagnosis and at least 2 years of continuous enrollment after the initial infertility diagnosis were classified into 1 of 2 cohorts: high cohort (those with both infertility diagnostic and treatment coverage) or low cohort (those with only diagnostic coverage or no diagnostic nor treatment coverage). Binary outcomes were analyzed using logistic regression and continuous outcomes were analyzed using 2-stage stepwise regressions. Models controlled for differences in employee demographics, job-related variables (exempt status, full-time status, hourly vs salary, annual salary), and number of insured dependents. Of the 10,820 women who met the inclusion criteria, 7589 (70.1%) were in the high cohort and 3231 (29.9%) were in the low cohort, with mean (SE) ages of 34.4 (0.06) vs 33.5 (0.11) years, respectively (P < .0001).

Methods: The study included individuals 18 years or older with 12 months of continuous enrollment from 2018 to 2023, categorizing GLP-1 RA users into 4 groups based on diabetes and obesity/overweight diagnosis codes within a year of their index date. Results: Prescribing of GLP-1 RA medications, particularly semaglutides, increased notably over the years, whereas dulaglutide, liraglutide, and exenatide use declined. When investigating possible premature prescribing by examining users with no diabetes indication, the number of prediabetes or abnormal glucose diagnoses increased slightly before the index GLP-1 RA prescribing index date. However, less than 9% received a diabetes or prediabetes diagnosis 30 days after starting a GLP-1 RA. Conclusions: From 2018 to 2023, GLP-1 RA prescribing increased significantly, with semaglutide approved for weight loss rising to 60% share in the nondiabetic obese/overweight group. Trends showed a notable rise in prescriptions for nondiabetic and obese/overweight patients.",

Retrospective time series from a national insurance database, with members in all US states, including data from 2008 to 2021. Insulin OOP costs and 30-day equivalent fills per year were quantified among insulin users aged 12 to 64 years, stratified by income (low- vs high-poverty zip code) and health plan type (high-deductible health plans with savings options [HDHP/SO] vs not). Participants were commercially insured insulin users aged 12 to 64 years with at least 1 full enrollment year. Characteristics of interest for disparities analysis included income level (low- vs high-poverty zip code) and health plan type (HDHP/SO vs non-HDHP/SO plan). After increases in adjusted mean annual insulin OOP costs from 2008 ($221 per non-HDHP/SO member and $313 per HDHP/SO member) to 2014 ($280 and $496, respectively), HDHP/SO members had persistent relative reductions in insulin use. In 2014, HDHP/SO members had 0.17 fewer annual fills, a disparity that increased until 2019 (0.79) before decreasing slightly by 2021 (-0.55). Lower-income members consistently had fewer insulin fills. Insulin OOP cost reduction policies would be more efficient if they targeted HDHP/SO plan members and low-income patients.",

This study aimed to assess whether racial/ethnic differences in CRC screening persisted in 2021 and how demographic and socioeconomic factors contributed to these differences. Population-based study. All adults aged 50 to 75 years in the 2021 National Health Interview Survey were included. The rate of CRC screening was calculated for non-Hispanic White, Black/African American, Hispanic, and Asian individuals. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine racial/ethnic differences in CRC screening, controlling for age, sex, immigrant status (vs born in the US), college education (vs no college education), and insured status (vs uninsured status). The rate of CRC screening was highest in the non-Hispanic White group (74.4%), followed by the Black/African American (70.9%), Hispanic (61.7%), and Asian (59.5%) groups (P < .01). In multivariate logistic regression, there was no significant racial/ethnic difference in CRC screening after controlling for age (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.06-1.08), female sex (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.997-1.18), immigrant status (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.54-0.70), college education (OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.52-1.80), and insured status (OR, 4.38; 95% CI, 3.67-5.23). Sensitivity analysis on colonoscopy use confirmed these findings, except for less colonoscopy use in Asian individuals (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60-0.89). Racial/ethnic differences in CRC screening in the US were due to differences in demographic and socioeconomic factors, except for persistently low colonoscopy use in Asian individuals.",

Participants (N = 567) selected a sleep study provider from 5 options, with manipulations including financial responsibility, provision of price information, and a prosocial message encouraging high-value options. Price transparency increased the selection of lower-cost options among participants who were solely responsible for paying for their own health care expenses. For participants whose insurance paid for health care expenses, both price transparency and prosocial messaging were necessary to choose lower-cost options. The study highlights the importance of considering both financial and social factors in patient engagement initiatives, suggesting that a combination of price transparency and prosocial messaging can influence health care choices and potentially contribute to cost-saving strategies in the US health care system.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US, with nearly 40% of eligible individuals not current on lifesaving CRC screening. Although stool-based screening tests offer accessible initial options, the CRC screening process is incomplete without a follow-up colonoscopy after a positive result. Unfortunately, low follow-up rates-particularly among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups-undermine the potential health benefits. Recent policies eliminating patient cost sharing for follow-up colonoscopies address one critical barrier but fail to overcome the systemic obstacles that impede screening completion. Patient navigation programs are a proven strategy to bridge these gaps. By addressing logistical, financial, and educational challenges, navigation services significantly improve follow-up colonoscopy rates. However, inadequate reimbursement has hindered their widespread implementation. Current funding models, including CMS' Principal Illness Navigation services, fall short of supporting preventive care such as CRC screening. To fully realize the potential of CRC screening, investments in patient navigation, enhanced clinician reimbursement for follow-up colonoscopies, and systemic reforms are essential. Modeling studies reveal a \"win-win-win\" scenario: Clinicians receive appropriate compensation for their critical role in follow-up care, payers achieve cost savings through efficient screening processes, and investments in navigation services help close disparities in CRC screening. Expanding navigation programs and incentivizing follow-up colonoscopies would increase screening rates, reduce disparities, and achieve population health gains. These investments represent a rare opportunity to align stakeholder interests, prevent CRC deaths, and advance health equity.",

Study Design: Observational and cross-sectional descriptive study. Methods: Using a large administrative health claims database, we studied employer offering of PDLs between January 2005 and December 2017. Results: The percentage of employers offering PDLs increased between 2005 and 2017, and this was most pronounced among larger employers. In 2017, almost 43.0% (95% CI, 35.7%-50.1%) of employers with 5000 or more insured employees offered PDLs, 4 times more than employers with 50 to 199 employees (10%; 95% CI, 9.3%-10.3%). Among employers with at least 85% of their insured workforce in high-deductible health plans with health savings accounts (HDHP-HSAs; n = 24,632; 8.9%) across the study period, 32.0% offered PDLs in the last benefit year, and 13.0% of non–HDHP-HSA employers did. In adjusted analyses, HDHP-HSA employers with older workforces (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.43-1.48) and those with more chronically ill employees (eg, more than 75% of employees with diabetes) (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.17-1.23) were more likely to offer PDLs than employers with workforces living in poorer neighborhoods (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.77-0.81). Conclusions: More employers offered PDLs over time, particularly large employers and employers with most employees in an HDHP-HSA.

Study design Review of drug development databases and other secondary sources. Methods Biopharmaceutical was defined as any biology-based therapeutic that structurally mimics compounds found within the body. Unique biopharmaceuticals, including new molecular entities or new indications in phase 2 or higher development, were identified and characterized through reviews of the literature, 5 drug development databases, a clinical trial database, and telephone inquiries with manufacturers. Results As of May 2006, there were 111 unique biopharmaceuticals in late-stage development for 190 indications. Of 111 unique agents in the pipeline, 87 are new molecular entities, and 24 are already approved for other indications. Overall, 38 disease categories were targeted, and at least 33 physician specialties are likely to be affected. The greatest proportion of agents (43 biopharmaceuticals and 83 indications) target cancer. More than 70% of agents in the pipeline will require administration by a healthcare provider. More than 50% of the indications in the pipeline will require long-term (chronic) treatment (defined as >1 year and excludes cancer). Conclusions The steady growth of the US biopharmaceutical pipeline and consequent anticipated near-term approvals will increasingly affect third-party portfolio decision making. Cost of therapy, identifying the right drug for the right patient, and outcomes-based value should drive that decision process.",

To examine this assumption, we assessed whether enrollees became more activated after enrolling in a CDHP and the degree to which those who were more activated adopted productive health behaviors.This was a longitudinal study of employees of a large manufacturing company where a CDHP was offered along with a preferred provider organization in 2004. Two waves of survey data were collected with a final sample size of 1616 employees.The hypothesis that enrollees in a CDHP become more activated over time was not supported. However, the data suggest that those who were more activated were more likely to engage in the behaviors that CDHPs seek to encourage and to newly adopt these behaviors over time. This appeared to be true regardless of plan type.Even though CDHPs do not appear to foster activation, they may provide a supportive environment for those who are more activated to manage their health. Encouraging enrollment based on enrollee readiness to take advantage of the CDHP environment may be more productive than relying on plan designs alone to activate enrollees once they are enrolled.",

However, its effectiveness has not been assessed in a US real-world setting. METHODS Electronic medical record (EMR) data were used to compare clinical outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) treated with dapagliflozin and metformin with or without other oral antidiabetic drugs (D + M ± OAD), versus metformin with at least 1 other OAD (M + OAD). Adult patients with T2D on these regimens from January 01, 2014, to February 28, 2015, were identified in a US EMR database, with the date of first prescription for dapagliflozin (D + M ± OAD) or other OAD (M + OAD) as the index date. Patients were observed for 12 months before the index date (baseline) and 12 months afterward (ie, follow-up). Patients in the M + OAD group were propensity score matched 1:1 to those in the D + M ± OAD group. Outcomes included change in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) level, weight, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP/DBP) from baseline to follow-up. RESULTS A total of 1093 patients receiving M + OAD were matched to 1093 patients receiving D + M ± OAD. Compared with those given M + OAD, patients given D + M ± OAD had a greater reduction in A1C level (mean, -1.0% vs -0.7%; P <.01), greater weight loss (-1.8 kg vs -0.7 kg, P <.01), and greater change in SBP (-3.6 mm Hg vs -0.1 mm Hg, P <.01) and DBP (-2.0 mm Hg vs -0.6 mm Hg, P <.01) from baseline to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS In current US clinical practice, patients receiving D + M ± OAD had greater reductions in important clinical outcomes of T2D-A1C level, weight loss, and blood pressure-versus patients receiving M + OAD. This study supports the use of dapagliflozin as add-on therapy to metformin with or without other OADs for patients with T2D.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is characterized by eosinophilic airway inflammation and elevated serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels. Due to these pathologic features, the foundation of asthma treatment has historically been anti-inflammatory therapy with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). Numerous factors in addition to IgE and eosinophils, however, likely play important roles in mediating the airway inflammatory response characteristic of asthma. ICSs are effective therapy for some patients with persistent asthma, but clinical trials have shown that even increasing doses of ICSs under carefully controlled situations does not always result in acceptable asthma control. Consequently, other classes of medications, in addition to ICSs, are recommended in those patients with more severe asthma. The class of medication most commonly used in more severe asthma, along with ICSs, is long-acting inhaled beta2-agonists, but leukotriene modifying agents and anti-IgE monoclonal antibodies may also be used. Agents such as tiotropium, a long-acting inhaled anti-muscarinic agent, and those aimed at inhibiting cytokines, such as mepoluzimab, daclizumab, and etanercept, hold promise in the treatment of asthma. Other agents under investigation include phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitors and oligonucleotides. Bronchial thermoplasty, a nonpharmacologic option, may also be beneficial in patients with poorly controlled asthma. As our understanding of the complex pathophysiology of asthma increases, it will enable the development of novel therapeutic approaches for patients who are not responding well to traditional treatments. Although more studies are necessary to ensure the efficacy and safety of both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches, there is future promise for therapeutic advances in severe, persistent asthma.",

    "abstract": "gammaCore is cleared by the FDA for acute and preventive treatment of cluster headache and the acute treatment of migraine in adults. Previously, only 2 treatments were approved for acute treatment of cluster headache while none were approved for preventive treatment. Following the initial FDA clearance, based on the ACT-1 and ACT-2 studies, a gammaCore Patient Registry (GPR) was designed to provide insights on the use of gammaCore and prescription patterns in the real-world setting and to characterize respective benefits and challenges during the acute treatment of episodic cluster headache. GPR was a prospective observational registry in which patients with episodic cluster headache (3rd edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria) who were prescribed gammaCore were invited to voluntarily enroll and provide information on their experiences between July 2017 and June 2018. Participants provided baseline information and were trained to self-administer treatment with gammaCore for cluster pain. Participants were also requested to record information for each cluster attack. Of the 182 patients who provided baseline demographic and cluster headache characteristics, 152 provided health index baseline data using EuroQol Health Index tool, 5-level format (EQ5D-5L) and 17 patients provided attack data on a total of 192 cluster headache attacks. The mean age was 49 years; 65% were male and 82% were white; the mean number of months of known diagnosis of cluster headache was 57; the mean number of attacks per cluster headache 4-week period was 14; and the mean pain score was 3.7 (0-4 scale) with a mean attack duration of 74 minutes. Sixty-seven percent of patients had used preventive treatments and 83% had used abortive treatments for cluster headaches; 25% of participants reported at least 1 comorbidity. The mean EQ5D-5L score (scale 0-1) was 0.83. Of the 192 cluster headache attacks reported, gammaCore was used in 116 (60%) attacks. Within this group, the mean pain score at the start of the attacks was 2.7, the mean number of stimulations used was 3.6, and the pain score after 30 minutes was 1.3. At 30 minutes, the pain of 81 (70%) attacks was reduced to none (27%) or mild (43%) (a pain score of 0 or 1) and in 94 (81%) attacks, patients experienced a reduction of at least 1 point in the pain score. This real-world observational evidence suggests that gammaCore adds clinically meaningful value to patients with episodic cluster headache by providing rapid pain relief and confirms that there is significant interest among prescribers in providing this new treatment and technology. This evidence further supports the need to redefine gammaCore as no longer investigational or experimental during considerations for reimbursement.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease affects nearly 1 million people in the United States, and the prevalence is expected to increase to at least 1.2 million people by 2030. Parkinson disease is a chronic, incurable disease. Most treatments focus on controlling motor symptoms; however, as the disease progresses, periods of reduced therapeutic benefit, or OFF periods, become more frequent and increasingly troublesome. OFF periods contribute to the already substantial economic burden of Parkinson disease. People with Parkinson disease who experience OFF periods and their caregivers have reported more work days with low productivity and more missed work days compared with those who do not experience OFF periods. More caregivers of people with Parkinson disease who experience OFF episodes reported that due to the disease, they had reduced or changed working hours, lost opportunities, or had reduced work productivity, and these caregivers reported an average of more than twice the amount of employment income lost compared with caregivers of people with Parkinson disease who do not experience OFF periods.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES Although the Affordable Care Act has greatly expanded coverage, the physician workforce has not increased commensurately. Data on wait times, especially among dermatologists who accept Medicaid, are lacking. The objective of this study was to evaluate wait times in dermatology clinics by insurance coverage and chief complaint. STUDY DESIGN A secret shopper survey was conducted. METHODS Between June and July 2016, 186 dermatology clinics in Michigan were contacted to determine the earliest available appointment for a patient seeking an evaluation of a changing mole, a chronic rash, and botulinum toxin administration. RESULTS The mean (standard error [SE]) wait time regardless of insurance or chief complaint was 28.8 (1.29) days. Clinics that accept Medicaid had longer wait times (32.9 [2.19] vs 25.4 [1.50] days; P = .024). The mean (SE) wait time for a mole or rash was longer for patients with Medicaid compared with those with private insurance (40.0 [4.08] vs 27.7 [1.54] days; P = .003). The mean (SE) wait time for Medicaid patients compared with patients with private insurance was also longer, even within the same clinic (39.1 [4.11] vs 27.5 [1.57] days; median, 23.5 vs 16.0 days). Patients with Medicaid were able to obtain appointments sooner for botulinum toxin administration (22.5 [2.10] days) compared with evaluation of a mole (40.0 [6.63] days) or rash (40.1 [4.99] days) (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS Wait times for clinic appointments were longer for patients with Medicaid, especially when requesting an evaluation for a medical dermatologic issue compared with a cosmetic consultation. Delay in medical dermatologic care, especially among Medicaid patients, must be addressed.",

Although the greater focus on social determinants is laudable and necessary, there is a tendency for health care organizations to implement SDOH programs at scale without rigorous evidence of effect, rather than targeting interventions to specific patients and assessing their impact. This broad, and sometimes blind, application of SDOH interventions can be costly and wasteful. We argue for rejecting the more is better mindset and specifically targeting patients who truly need and would substantially benefit from SDOH interventions. Matching interventions to the most appropriate patients involves screening for social needs, developing rigorous evidence of effect, and accompanying policy reform.",

We compared trends in biosimilar uptake across 2 dimensions: provider's place of service and provider's prescribing exclusivity. We then used multivariate regression analysis to estimate the association between any biosimilar uptake and practice-level characteristics, controlling for geography and time fixed effects.Relative to hospital-based providers, office-based providers were earlier and quicker adopters of the biosimilar filgrastim. Across all places of service, providers predominantly prescribed either the biosimilar or biologic, exclusively, for all their patients. Any biosimilar uptake was more common among providers in office-based settings, providers with larger practice sizes, and providers with a higher share of health maintenance organization patients, nonwhite patients, and younger patients.This study uncovers important associations between provider practice characteristics and biosimilar uptake. Our findings suggest that provider awareness and incentives can be important levers to strengthen US biosimilar market penetration and competition.",

We examined prescribing patterns in the context of intravenous (IV) iron, for which multiple similarly safe and efficacious formulations exist, with wide variations in price.We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of IV iron utilization and payment in the Medicare population between 2015 and 2017.This analysis used a national, random 20% sample of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with Part B claims for IV iron between January 2015 and December 2017-a period before, during, and after a national shortage of iron dextran. This sample included 66,710 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with at least 1 Part B claim for IV iron.The greatest increase in utilization occurred in the most expensive iron formulation, ferric carboxymaltose; its market share rose from 27.4% of use in 2015 to 47.7% in 2017. The use of a less expensive formulation, iron dextran, decreased from 26.7% to 18.7% over the same period. An alternative payment model in Maryland hospitals was associated with markedly less utilization of ferric carboxymaltose, accounting for 4.7% of IV iron utilization in Maryland hospitals.There was an increase in the dispensing of a higher-priced IV iron formulation associated with a shortage of a less expensive drug that persisted once the shortage ended. These findings in IV iron have broader implications for Part B drug payment policy because the price of the drug determines the physician and health system payment.",

    "abstract": "The antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) vasculitides include several closely related, often severe, multisystem autoimmune diseases characterized by antibodies against serine proteinase 3 (PR3) or myeloperoxidase. Loss of tolerance to these antigens triggers a cascade of events, beginning with the priming of neutrophils by proinflammatory cytokines and complement activation, translocation of ANCA-specific antigens to the plasma membrane, neutrophil hyperactivation, and further activation of the alternative complement pathway, leading to tissue damage and the clinical manifestations of ANCA vasculitis. Due to the heterogeneity in presentation of these diseases, diagnosis is often substantially delayed, leading to poor outcomes. The current treatment pathway for most patients involves induction with cyclophosphamide or rituximab in combination with glucocorticoids, followed by a maintenance phase with rituximab, azathioprine, or methotrexate, during which time glucocorticoids are tapered. Current therapies are often effective in inducing and maintaining remission but are associated with a range of toxicities. Several new therapies are in development for ANCA vasculitis. Avacopan, an orally administered inhibitor of the complement fragment 5a (C5a) receptor, has been assessed in a phase 3 clinical trial and may play a role in reducing the cumulative glucocorticoid dose. Preliminary data suggest that cluster of differentiation (CD) 80 and CD86 blockade with abatacept may also have a role in the management of ANCA vasculitis. There is an unmet need for additional therapeutic options for patients with these diseases.",

As we increasingly adopt the Acute Hospital Care at Home program and similar home-based services, it is crucial to better define the value of these programs and their appropriate reimbursement rates. We provide a framework centered around cost, quality, and equity to help accomplish this task. Quality reporting should use both inpatient-specific and home health care-specific metrics, equity-focused process metrics and risk-adjusted outcome metrics, and validated disease-specific tools. Costs should be measured comprehensively and uniformly through the use of time-driven activity-based costing and consider caregiver opportunity costs. It is also worthwhile to consider personal, societal, technical, and allocative value when determining the value and subsequent reimbursement rates of hospital-at-home programs. With careful patient selection, the hospital-at-home model has the potential to significantly benefit a subset of patients. To create sustainable reimbursement mechanisms for hospital-at-home programs, we first need a better definition of the value provided by this model of care.",

The study used Medicare Provider Analysis and Review files to compare differences in use of top-ranked cancer hospitals for complex cancer surgery (lobectomy, esophagectomy, gastrectomy, colectomy, and the Whipple procedure [pancreaticoduodenectomy]) between MA and FFS enrollees 65 years and older who underwent the surgery in 2015 to 2017. After adjusting for demographic characteristics and county fixed effects, MA enrollees were less likely to use top-ranked cancer hospitals than FFS enrollees by 6.0 percentage points (95% CI, 4.7-7.2) overall; the difference varied from 3.5 percentage points (95% CI, 2.5-4.6) for colectomy to 14.3 percentage points (95% CI, 10.9-17.8) for the Whipple procedure. The difference in cancer surgery rate at a top-ranked cancer hospital between MA and FFS enrollees was larger for MA plans without out-of-network (OON) benefits (-7.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -9.1 to -5.9) than for MA plans with OON benefits (-2.3 percentage points; 95% CI, -2.9 to -1.7). MA enrollees were less likely to use top-ranked cancer hospitals for complex cancer surgery than FFS enrollees. This difference was larger for MA plans with more restrictive OON policies.

We estimated the potential impact of an HAH program for patients readmitted within 60 days postoperatively and described the characteristics of eligible patients to aid in the design of future programs.This was a cross-sectional study of 60-day postoperative readmissions at a tertiary care center in 2018.We identified the number of readmissions that may have been eligible for HAH, collected descriptive information, and estimated the financial margin that could have been generated had eligible readmissions been diverted to HAH.There were 2366 readmissions within 60 days of surgery in 2018. A total of 731 readmissions met inclusion criteria for HAH (30.1%), accounting for 4152 bed days. Of these readmissions, the most common diagnoses were infection, gastrointestinal complications, and cardiac complications. Patients' home addresses were within 16 miles of the hospital in 447 cases (61.1%). Avoidance of these readmissions and use of the beds for new admissions represented a potential backfill margin of $8.8 million, not incorporating the cost of HAH.Many 60-day postoperative readmissions may be amenable to HAH enrollment, representing a significant opportunity to improve patient experience and generate hospital revenue. This is of particular interest in the post-COVID-19 era. To maximize their impact, HAH programs should tailor clinical and operational services to this population.",

Only 1 (5%) displayed the minimum negotiated price for the 2 imaging studies and none for any of the hospital services. The mean (range) cash price for MRI was $3793 ($464-$6215) and for ultrasound was $767 ($136-$1391). The mean (range) cash price for cardiac surgery was $236,125 ($72,250-$349,782); for joint replacement, $46,008 ($22,170-$71,985); and for childbirth, $19,568 ($7314-$29,068).In an early assessment, a significant percentage of US hospitals were not in compliance with new price transparency legislation.

Noting that value realization has eluded IPU pilots globally over the past 15 years, the authors examine 6 critical challenges and propose recommendations to consistently deploy effective IPUs, leading to a win-win proposition for all key stakeholders.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are among the most common causes of adverse drug reactions and are further complicated by genetic variants of drug-metabolizing enzymes. The aim of this study is to quantify and describe potential DDIs, drug-gene interactions (DGIs), and drug-drug-gene interactions (DDGIs) in a community-based population. Study Design: This was an analysis of deidentified retail pharmacy prescription data for 4761 individuals. Methods: Data were first assessed for DDIs, and individuals were stratified to a risk category using the logic of a commercially available digital DDGI tool. To calculate the frequency of potential DGIs and DDGIs, genotypes were imputed and randomly allocated to the cohort 100 times via Monte Carlo simulation according to each variant's frequency in the general population. Results: The probability of a DDI of any impact was 26.0% and increased to 49.6% (95% CI, 48.4%-50.7%) when drug-metabolizing phenotypes were ascribed according to the distribution of variants of 11 genes as found in a Caucasian population. There was a 7.8% probability of major DDIs, which increased to a 10.1% (95% CI, 9.5%-10.8%) probability with the addition of genetic contributions. The probability of DDGIs of any impact was correlated with the number of medications. Antidepressants, antiemetics, blood products and modifiers, analgesics, and antipsychotics had the highest probability of DDGIs. Conclusions: The probability of drug interaction risk increased when phenotypes associated with genetic polymorphisms were attributed to the population. These data suggest that pharmacogenomic assessment may be useful in predicting drug interactions and severity when evaluating patient medication profiles.",

    "abstract": "Anti-obesity medications used with lifestyle intervention produce greater and more sustained weight loss than does lifestyle intervention alone. However, until 2021, FDA-approved medications for the long-term treatment of obesity in the general adult population had not demonstrated the sustained loss of 15% body weight needed to meet or exceed all guideline-recommended targets for weight-related complications. To meet this need, investigators launched the Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity (STEP) program of phase 3 clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of a weekly 2.4-mg subcutaneous injection of semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA). Following the results of STEPs 1 to 4, the FDA approved semaglutide therapy in patients with obesity. This article examines the design, efficacy, and safety of semaglutide therapy as revealed by the results of STEPs 1 to 4. These trials included adults with obesity who reported at least 1 unsuccessful attempt to reduce body weight by means of diet. STEP 2 studied effects on patients who also had type 2 diabetes (T2D); STEPs 1, 3, and 4 excluded patients with this condition. STEP 3 examined the effect of this pharmacotherapy plus intensive behavioral therapy and a 2-step, intensively restricted dietary plan. STEP 4 assessed the effects of continuing semaglutide 2.4 mg vs switching to placebo after an initial treatment period. In the trials comparing the effects of semaglutide 2.4‑mg treatment with those of placebo across 68 weeks and in patients with no T2D (ie, STEPs 1 and 3), patients treated with semaglutide achieved a mean -14.9% to -16.0% weight change. This far exceeds the 4.0% to 10.9% weight loss seen with other approved antiobesity medications. In STEPs 2 and 4, the estimated treatment differences between the semaglutide 2.4-mg and placebo arms were -6.2% and -14.8%, respectively. Safety and tolerability of this treatment in STEPs 1 to 4 was consistent with those of other GLP-1RA-based therapies. Ultimately, the results of the first 4 STEP trials demonstrated that semaglutide 2.4 mg is a safe, well-tolerated, and highly effective treatment to promote weight loss, avoid weight regain, and mitigate the effects of the prevalent, chronic disease of obesity. In November 2022, based upon the results of STEPs 1 to 3 and other trials, the American Gastroenterological Association recommended that semaglutide 2.4 mg \"be prioritized over other approved [anti-obesity medications] for the long-term treatment of obesity for most patients.\"",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a serious, progressive, chronic disease that is associated with a spectrum of complications and poor outcomes (eg, premature death, diminished quality of life) and is a risk factor for several other diseases. Obesity increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain cancers. More recently, obesity was recognized as a risk factor for poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. When experienced concurrently with a serious disease, obesity may increase the risk of negative health outcomes. Furthermore, individuals with obesity are more likely to experience social stigma and discrimination at work and in educational and health care settings; these may impact mental and physical health and contribute to increased adiposity. In the United States, the economic burden of obesity is immense-according to estimates, hundreds of billions of dollars are spent annually on direct medical needs and lost productivity associated with obesity. More severe classes of obesity greatly impact both the health of individuals and health care expenditures. As obesity becomes more prevalent, policy makers, health care professionals, and payers must consider its clinical, social, and economic implications.",

    "abstract": "Patients with macular edema (ME) associated with uveitis (UME) are at risk for vision loss and decreased quality of life, and they often experience high health care costs and rates of workforce absenteeism. Systemically or locally delivered corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for UME. Although traditional corticosteroid treatments may demonstrate high levels of efficacy, systemic delivery carries the risk of potentially serious systemic adverse effects (AEs), and standard local modes of delivery may be associated with low bioavailability in posterior ocular tissues and steroid-associated AEs due to anterior ocular tissue exposure. Drug injection into the suprachoroidal space (SCS) allows for targeted delivery to chorioretinal tissues with high bioavailability in the posterior segment, as well as for inherent drug sequestration away from the anterior segment, which may lower the risk of AEs associated with anterior tissue exposure to steroids. A novel triamcinolone acetonide (TA) injectable suspension formulated for administration to the SCS, SCS-TA (Xipere®; Bausch + Lomb), received FDA approval in 2021 for the treatment of UME. It is administered via the SCS Microinjector® (Clearside Biomedical, Inc), a device specifically designed for SCS delivery of ocular therapeutics. This approval was based on results from the phase 3 PEACHTREE clinical trial (NCT02595398) that demonstrated the clinical efficacy-including significantly increased visual acuity and decreased central subfield thickness-and safety of SCS-TA in patients with UME. Results from this trial, as well as from its long-term observational extension (MAGNOLIA; NCT02952001) and an open-label safety study (AZALEA; NCT03097315), support the possibility that treatment with SCS-TA may address the burden of disease in patients with UME.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Private managed care plans in the Medicare Advantage (MA) program have been gaining market share relative to traditional fee-for-service Medicare (TM), yet there are no obvious structural changes to Medicare that would explain this growth. Our goal is to explain the growth in MA market share during a period when it increased dramatically. Study Design: Data are drawn from a representative sample of the Medicare population from 2007 to 2018. Methods: We decomposed MA growth into changes in the values of explanatory variables that influence MA enrollment (eg, income and payment rate) and changes in preferences for MA vs TM (estimated coefficients) using a nonlinear version of the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition to distinguish the sources of MA growth. We find that the relatively smooth growth in MA market share masks 2 distinct growth periods. Results: From 2007 to 2012, 73% of the increase was due to changes in the values of the explanatory variables, and only 27% was due to changes in coefficients. In contrast, from 2012 to 2018, changes in explanatory variables, particularly MA payment levels, would have led to a decline in MA market share if that effect had not been offset by changes in the coefficients. Conclusions: Overall, we find that MA is becoming more appealing to more educated and nonminority beneficiaries than in the past, although minority and lower-income beneficiaries are still more likely to pick the program. Over time, if preferences continue to shift, the nature of the MA program will change as it moves more toward the middle of the Medicare distribution.",

Many patients with chronic pain experience a subset of specific co-occurring pain conditions that may share a common pain mechanism and that have been designated as chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPCs). Little is known about chronic opioid prescribing patterns among patients with COPCs in primary care settings, especially among socioeconomically vulnerable patients. This study aims to evaluate opioid prescribing among patients with COPCs in US community health centers and to identify individual COPCs and their combinations that are associated with long-term opioid treatment (LOT).Retrospective cohort study.We conducted analyses of more than 1 million patients 18 years and older based on electronic health record data from 449 US community health centers across 17 states between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2018. Logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between COPCs and LOT.Individuals with COPCs were prescribed LOT 4 times more often than individuals without a COPC (16.9% vs 4.0%). The presence of chronic low back pain, migraine headache, fibromyalgia, or irritable bowel syndrome combined with any of the other COPCs increased the odds of LOT prescribing compared with the presence of a single COPC.Although LOT prescribing has declined over time, it remains relatively high among patients with certain COPCs and for those with multiple COPCs. These study findings suggest target populations for future interventions to manage chronic pain among socioeconomically vulnerable patients.",

We examined expenditures and utilization associated with these events in a large health system. Study Design: Retrospective, single-center study at Cleveland Clinic, a large, integrated health system participating in VBC contracts, including a Medicare accountable care organization. Methods: We analyzed beneficiaries who transitioned to dialysis between 2017 and 2020. Crash starts involved initiating inpatient hemodialysis (HD) with a central venous catheter (CVC). Optimal starts were initiated with either home dialysis or outpatient HD without a CVC. Suboptimal starts were initiated with outpatient HD with a CVC or inpatient HD without a CVC. Results: A total of 495 patients initiated chronic dialysis: 260 crash starts, 130 optimal starts, and 105 suboptimal starts. Median predialysis 12-month cost was $67,059 for crash starts, $17,891 for optimal starts, and $7633 for suboptimal starts (,P, < .001). Median postdialysis 12-month cost was $71,992 for crash starts, $55,427 for optimal starts, and $72,032 for suboptimal starts (,P, = .001). Predialysis inpatient admission per 1000 beneficiaries was 1236 per 1000 for crash starts vs 273 per 1000 for optimal starts and 170 per 1000 for suboptimal starts (,P, < .001). Postdialysis inpatient admission for crash starts was 853 per 1000 vs 291 per 1000 for optimal starts and 184 per 1000 for suboptimal starts (,P, < .001). Conclusions: In a major health system, crash starts demonstrated the highest cost and hospital utilization, a pattern that persisted after dialysis initiation. Developing strategies to promote optimal starts will improve VBC contract performance.",

This narrative seemed to hold up in the COVID-19 pandemic era, when mistrust in systems and providers led to widely recognized vaccine hesitancy and reluctance to seek care. In this review, we suggest that the \"mistrust leads to underuse\" narrative is important but incomplete, as mistrust in health care may also cause patients to overuse health care services. We searched the literature for studies, meta-analyses, and interviews that assessed the effect of patient trust on health care utilization. Although overuse literature is sparse, surveys and physician interviews indicate that patients who do not trust their clinicians may seek multiple opinions on the same diagnosis and utilize more costly interventions that are not recommended. Physicians also report being more likely to utilize extraneous tests and medications when patients do not trust them. Hence, problems of trust may lead to both underuse and overuse of health care services. We postulate several factors that may influence whether a mistrustful patient underuses or overuses health care resources, including personal characteristics, environmental characteristics, and levels of analysis, and we encourage more investigation about mistrust and health care overutilization.",

Blood samples were drawn 20 to 56 days post infusion. A Bayesian data assimilation tool used clinical and serologic data to generate individual pharmacokinetic profiles and forecast trough IFX. Results were reported to providers to aid in-therapy management decisions and the decision-making process was assessed through questionnaires. Relationships between forecasted IFX concentration, disease activity, and therapy management decisions were analyzed by logistic regression.PredictrPK IFX was used for 275 patients with IBD by 37 providers. In 58% of cases, providers modified treatment plans based on the results, including dose modifications (41%; of these, one-third decreased dose) and discontinuation (8%) of IFX. Of the 42% where treatment was not modified, 97.5% had IFX levels of 5 µg/mL or greater. Patients with IFX concentrations less than 5 µg/mL were 3 and 7.3 times more likely to have active disease or discontinue IFX, respectively. There was unanimous agreement among providers who completed a postprogram survey that PredictrPK IFX was beneficial in guiding treatment decisions and added more value to their practice than routine therapeutic drug monitoring.PredictrPK IFX enables earlier and more precise dose optimization of IFX in patients with IBD, exerting a substantial impact on treatment decisions that may result in improved health outcomes and overall cost savings.",

Here, the cost-effectiveness of treating HCV with DAAs vs no treatment over a lifetime horizon is evaluated from the perspective of Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC).A hybrid decision-tree Markov model.The model simulated the health and economic outcomes for a real cohort of patients with HCV treated with either ledipasvir-sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir-velpatasvir between November 1, 2014, and October 31, 2019, at KPSC. Patients entered the model at different stages of liver disease and received either active treatment with DAAs or no treatment. Patients who did not achieve sustained virological response experienced disease progression; those who achieved sustained virological response experienced either significantly slower or no disease progression depending on the stage of fibrosis at model start. Demographics, treatment experience, genotype, baseline fibrosis stage, treatment rates, and treatment efficacy were sourced from KPSC real-world data. Costs and utilities were sourced from published literature.A total of 7255 patients with a mean age of 59 years were treated during the study period. Over a lifetime horizon, DAAs resulted in significant reduction in advanced liver disease events and a total cost savings of $1 billion compared with no treatment based on a hybrid decision-tree Markov state-transition model. Cost savings were achieved after only 3 years. DAA intervention dominated no treatment on a per-patient and cohort basis.DAA treatment at KPSC is predicted to significantly reduce HCV-related morbidity and mortality, providing an anticipated return on investment in drug costs after 3 years of treatment.",

This study examined the association between Medicare Advantage penetration levels in rural areas and hospital financial distress and closure.This retrospective cohort study followed rural general acute care hospitals open in 2008 through 2019 or until closure using Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases for 14 states.The primary independent variables were the percentage of Medicare Advantage stays out of total Medicare stays at the hospital and the percentage of Medicare Advantage beneficiaries out of total beneficiaries in the hospital's county. Financial distress was defined using the Altman Z score, where values less than or equal to 1.1 indicate financial distress and values greater than 2.8 indicate stability. The Z score was examined as a continuous outcome in hospital and county fixed-effects models. Risk of closure was examined using Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for hospital and market factors.Rural hospital Medicare Advantage penetration grew from 6.5% in 2008 to 20.6% in 2019. A 1-percentage point increase in hospital penetration was associated with an increase in financial stability of 0.04 units on the Altman Z score (95% CI, 0.00-0.08; P = .03) and a 4% reduction in risk of closure (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92-1.00; P = .04).

    "abstract": "Objectives: Unused medical appointments affect both patient care and clinic operations, and the frequency of cancellations due to clinic reasons is underreported. The prevalence of these unused appointments in primary care in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System (VA) is unknown. This study examined the prevalence of unused primary care appointments and compared the relative frequency of cancellations and no-shows for patient and clinic reasons. Study Design: In this retrospective, observational study, we collected all in-person and virtual VA primary care appointments from October 1, 2018, to April 1, 2024. Methods: We examined the proportion of appointments canceled on the same day as the appointment and classified these into canceled by patient, canceled by clinic, and no-show. Results: Of more than 90 million in-person and nearly 24 million virtual primary care appointments, 11.9 million (10.87%) were canceled on the day of the appointment. For in-person care cancellations, the most common reasons were canceled by the patient (3.92%; n = 3,531,016), no-show (3.87%; n = 3,487,944), and clinic cancellation (3.08%; n = 2,780,259). Conclusions: Although this study shows that same-day cancellations of primary care appointments in the VA are common, comparisons with other providers and health care systems indicate similar or lower levels of unused appointments in the VA.",

Study of approximately 500 insurers covering more than 40 million lives annually in the large group market that submitted an MLR submission form (2014-2022). We assessed trends in the MLR, premiums, medical claims spending, administrative costs, quality improvement spending, and margins among all insurers in the large group market. The mean MLR was 90.0% (2014-2020), which increased to 91.8% in 2021 before declining in 2022. Spending on both administrative costs and quality improvement was small and stable during this period. In contrast, premiums and medical claims spending grew between 2014 and 2020, with claims spending increasing 9.4% between 2020 and 2021 compared with just 3.9% for premiums. This mirrored the observed trend in insurer margins, which increased from 2014 to 2020 before experiencing a temporary decline in 2021. Medical spending is the primary driver of premiums in the large group market. Efforts to address growing health insurance premiums in the US will require consideration of how medical spending contributes to this growth.",

Study Design: Cohort study conducted from January 2020 to June 2022. Methods: Data from an independent specialty pharmacy were used to identify patients 18 years and older with at least 1 olaparib (Lynparza) prescription who were at high risk for olaparib nonadherence as assessed using a pharmacy intake survey. We compared olaparib therapy duration between patients with and without a nurse-led personalized care plan. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate adjusted HRs (aHRs) for therapy discontinuation. Results: Of 560 patients at high risk for olaparib nonadherence, 163 received a care plan and 397 did not. Commonly reported symptoms included fatigue, nausea, gastrointestinal tract problems, depression, anxiety, and pain. The care plan group had significantly longer olaparib therapy (median [IQR], 6.7 [2.5-14.3] months vs 4.9 [1.9-10.4] months; ,P, < .001) and a lower risk of discontinuing treatment (aHR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64-0.94) than the controls. Within the care plan group, patients experiencing resolution of at least 1 symptom (median therapy duration [IQR], 10.3 [4.8-19.0] months vs 3.9 [1.9-11.4] months; ,P, < .001) or at least 1 dose modification (median therapy duration [IQR], 11.9 [6.7-17.8] months vs 4.7 [1.9-11.8] months; ,P, < .001) had approximately 2.5 times longer olaparib therapy duration than patients who did not. Conclusions: A nurse-led personalized care approach effectively increased medication persistence among patients receiving olaparib for treatment of cancer, and the effect was more apparent among care plan patients who experienced symptom resolution or dose modification.",

Study Design: The mean 1-year cost of treating 66 Medicare Advantage patients with diabetes and CKD who were receiving PIR was compared with that of treating 1301 Medicare Advantage patients with diabetes and CKD not receiving PIR. Differences in disease severity were compared using mean risk adjustment factor scores. Methods: Cost comparisons were made for CKD stages 2, 3a, 3b, 4, and 5. The total cost of treating the PIR patients was then compared with the total costs of treating the same number of non-PIR patients to determine cost differences potentially incurred. Results: The mean annual cost of treating PIR patients with stage 2 CKD was $11,251 vs $18,058 for the non-PIR group. For patients with stage 3a CKD, the mean PIR cost was $10,974 vs $18,563 for the non-PIR group. For patients with stage 3b CKD, the mean costs were $19,520 and $18,398, respectively. The mean costs for stages 4/5 CKD were $14,042 vs $22,124, respectively. The costs for an equal number of non-PIR patients at each stage were $345,830 higher than the actual costs of the PIR patients. There were no significant differences in the mean risk adjustment factor scores between the 2 groups. Conclusions: PIR is a possible method of reducing the cost of treating patients with diabetes and CKD. Given the rapidly increasing numbers of patients with diabetes and CKD who are Medicare Advantage beneficiaries, PIR should be considered for use by managed care organizations.",

Especially for accountable care organizations (ACOs), home-based postacute rehabilitation offers a high-value option if outcomes are not compromised. The objective was to compare outcomes for episodes in a novel high-intensity home-based rehabilitation (HIHR) model vs an SNF. Retrospective cohort study. Medicare patients from a large integrated multihospital health system who had low to moderate medical complexity and mild to moderate mobility deficits at hospital discharge were included. The primary exposure was discharge to HIHR (intervention) or an SNF (control) after hospitalization. The primary outcome was Activity Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) mobility score. Secondary outcomes were Medicare costs within 30 and 90 days post hospitalization, 30-day readmission rate, and index hospital length of stay (LOS). Inverse probability of treatment-weighted regression was used for comparison between cohorts. There were 171 patients discharged to HIHR and 841 to SNFs. The adjusted AM-PAC mobility T-score was 8.2 (95% CI, 6.3-10.1) points higher after HIHR vs SNF. Adjusted Medicare costs were lower for the HIHR cohort (within 90 days, -$17,123; 95% CI, -$20,757 to -$13,490). Hospital LOS and odds for readmission did not differ between cohorts. The HIHR cohort demonstrated better functional outcomes and lower posthospital costs. HIHR may be a high-value option for patients attributed to a Medicare ACO who have moderate medical complexity and moderate functional deficits at the time of hospital discharge.",

Detecting suspected COVID-19 cases in EDs is resource intensive. We examined the associations of screening workload for suspected COVID-19 cases with in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission during short-term ED revisits. Study Design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using electronic health record data from a tertiary teaching hospital. Methods: We analyzed all 72-hour ED-revisiting patients at the Taipei Veterans General Hospital ED in Taiwan between January 27, 2020, and December 31, 2020. Screening workload for suspected COVID-19 cases was measured with the daily number of suspected COVID-19 cases. Multivariate logistic regression models were used after adjustment for patient characteristics to examine the associations of screening workload with in-hospital mortality and ICU admission. Results: A total of 1107 patients were included. The mean number of daily suspected COVID-19 cases was 9.4. The rates of subsequent in-hospital mortality and ICU admission were 2.1% and 3.2%, respectively. The volume of daily suspected COVID-19 cases was significantly associated with increased subsequent in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR, 1.073 with each additional daily suspected COVID-19 case; ,P, = .005). Conclusions: This is the first study to our knowledge to identify that screening for suspected COVID-19 cases in EDs can adversely affect patient outcomes during short ED revisits. Identifying this association could enable ED providers and policy makers to optimize emergency service delivery during an epidemic and help patients.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Patient experience surveys are essential to measuring patient-centered care, a key component of health care quality. Low response rates in underserved groups may limit their representation in overall measure performance and hamper efforts to assess health equity. Telephone follow-up improves response rates in many health care settings, yet little recent work has examined this for surveys of Medicare enrollees, including those with Medicare Advantage. Our objective was to describe response rates to the 2022 Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (MCAHPS) surveys and the completion mode (mail or telephone), overall and by person-level characteristics. Study Design: Cross-sectional survey. Methods: Participants were 1,092,434 individuals with Medicare who were selected to receive the 2022 MCAHPS survey in the 50 states and the District of Columbia and who were representative of the Medicare population. Study measures were survey response and completion mode. Results: The overall response rate was 33.7% (31.3% by mail and 2.3% by telephone), with 6.9% of responses by telephone. Despite the low overall telephone response rate, the phone was used at markedly higher rates by respondents in some groups with lower overall response rates who are thus underrepresented among respondents, including those who were younger than 65 years (eligible for Medicare due to disability: 16.5% of responses by telephone), Black (16.1%), or Hispanic (14.1%) or had limited income and assets (14.6%). Conclusions: Including a telephone component in the administration of the MCAHPS survey continues to have value because several groups still show a relative preference for survey completion by telephone. Steps should be taken to improve response rates by telephone.",

States are required to establish quantitative network adequacy standards (NAS) to regulate MMC plans' MH care access. We examined the association between quantitative NAS and MH care access among Medicaid-enrolled adults and among those with MH conditions. Cross-sectional study with a difference-in-differences design. Using the 2016-2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, we included Medicaid enrollees aged 18 to 64 years in 15 states. Subgroup analyses included enrollees with MH conditions who experienced in the past year (1) serious psychological distress, (2) a major depressive episode, and/or (3) suicidal thoughts. Outcomes assessed whether in the past year the enrollee had any (1) MH services, (2) inpatient MH stays, (3) outpatient MH visits, (4) MH prescription, and (5) unmet MH care needs. Among 9300 adults aged 18 to 64 years, 27.2% had MH conditions. Among all adults, NAS were marginally associated with increased use of any MH services (adjusted OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-2.1; P = .055) but were not associated with other outcomes. Among enrollees with MH conditions, no statistically significant association between NAS and MH care access was observed. Current quantitative NAS requirements may have few impacts on improving MH care access for adults and those with MH conditions without the implementation of additional interventions. States should consider adjusting enforcement strategies and adopting other interventions alongside NAS.",

Single-center, retrospective chart review. Clinical pharmacists contacted patients with primary care providers within the health system affiliated with the drug plan to facilitate the switch. Drug plan members with external primary care providers were sent letters communicating the formulary change without contact from the clinical pharmacist. Outcomes included the proportion of patients successfully switched to alogliptin, reasons for not switching, changes in hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), and cost savings. Initially, more than 50% of patients contacted by pharmacists agreed to switch to alogliptin; however, only 44% were successfully switched to alogliptin per prescription claims data. One patient from the group that received letters without clinical pharmacy intervention switched to alogliptin. Overall, there was no significant difference in the mean HbA 1C level for the patients switched to alogliptin. At the end of the year-long study period, only 12 of the 67 patients successfully switched to alogliptin were still taking alogliptin. Reverting to a branded product and switching to a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist were the most common reasons that alogliptin was discontinued. Cost savings to the health plan were $220,717, or $0.17 per member per month over 1 year. The use of pharmacists was beneficial in switching patients to alogliptin and yielded cost savings without compromising patient outcomes.",

Cohort study using a difference-in-differences design comparing hospitals in 75 metropolitan statistical areas randomized into CJR by CMS with non-CJR hospitals in 119 areas as controls. The primary outcome was the case mix-adjusted, hospital-level HHC uptake rate, which is the rate of patients referred to HHC at hospital discharge receiving an HHC visit within 14 days. Secondary outcomes included HHC uptake rate by race/ethnicity and the quality of HHC agencies used among referrals, which was measured by agency-level improvement in ambulation, unplanned hospitalizations, emergency department visits, time to the first home health visit, and distinct number of agencies. After the launch of CJR, HHC uptake decreased nationally but there was a 3.73-percentage point (4.5%) lower decrease in CJR hospitals; this was driven by White patients (3.54-percentage point differential; P = .026). A marginally statistically significant (P = .054) 5.05-percentage point differential increase for Black patients was observed due to a slight increase in the treatment group and a large decrease in the control group. There was no statistically significant change for Hispanic or Asian American/Pacific Islander populations. No statistically significant increases were observed in the quality of HHC used. CJR mitigated a trend of decreased HHC uptake, but more work is needed to improve uptake for larger portions of the patient population. Our results suggest that addressing care coordination incentives via CJR may mitigate some racial disparities.",

Other independent variables included sociodemographic (age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status), geographic (distance to the clinic, residence in a medically underserved area [MUA]), and clinical (visit history, visit type, visit dates, days between visits) factors. We used mixed-effects logistic regression to examine the relationship between prior appointment duration and missed appointments. The study sample included 28,090 unique patients who had 56,180 appointments. The regression model demonstrated that longer prior appointment duration was associated with a lower likelihood of a missed appointment (OR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.88-0.92). Being Hispanic or non-Hispanic Black (Hispanic: OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.15; Black: OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.38-1.61), lacking insurance (OR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.38-1.57), and living 40 or more miles from the clinic (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.08-1.36) were associated with higher odds of missing appointments.

A retrospective analysis of paid medical insurance claims organized into 30-day episodes of care initialized by ED visits for Michigan adult residents with private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid. Thirty-day claims-based episodes of care initialized by ED visits at Michigan hospitals were constructed for 15 medical conditions. Mean episode payments were price standardized and risk adjusted.

Total payments across a 30-day episode of care and utilization of postacute care services varied substantially by condition and across the state, with mean risk-adjusted, price-standardized 30-day total payments for a given episode ranging from $3262 for abdominal pain to $17,941 for congestive heart failure. Episodes of care created from multipayer claims data can be used to provide insight into opportunities for collaboration and improvement of patients' care continuum following an ED visit.",

    "abstract": "Cancer and dementia are prevalent chronic conditions among older adults. Despite the complexities involved in caring for individuals with both conditions, the patterns of hospitalization in this specific group are not well understood. This study aimed to examine the associations between the presence of dementia and hospitalization-related outcomes. A multiyear cross-sectional analysis using 2016-2019 National Inpatient Sample data. We examined hospitalization pattern disparities between patients with cancer 65 years and older with and without dementia at high risk of mortality. The influence of dementia on multiple hospitalization-related outcomes (eg, emergency admission, hospital charges) was investigated using a series of multivariable regression models. The study involved 774,812 hospital discharges of patients with cancer 65 years and older, including 8.7% with comorbid dementia. The prevalence of dementia varied across different cancer types, ranging from 5.5% for pancreatic cancer and esophageal cancer to 18.9% for nonmelanoma skin cancer. Multiple adjusted logistic regression models indicated that patients with cancer and dementia were more likely to be admitted through the emergency department (adjusted OR [AOR], 1.48; 95% CI, 1.44-1.52), to have nonelective admissions (AOR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.61-1.74), and to be discharged to skilled nursing or related facilities (AOR, 2.16; 95% CI, 2.12-2.19), and they had approximately 6.9% lower hospital charges but a 6.8% longer length of stay compared with those without dementia (all P < .001). Dementia was prevalent among older patients with cancer, particularly those with nonmelanoma, prostate, and bladder cancers. Comorbid dementia was associated with unplanned or unnecessary hospitalization, highlighting the need to enhance health care management and tailored strategies for this population.",

    "abstract": "US military veterans have multiple options for health insurance coverage, including the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Medicare programs, which can lead to strategic selection of coverage and potentially inefficient budgetary allocations. Because coverage choices are likely to be a function of coverage availability and benefit value, understanding the relationship between benefit value and reliance on coverage is critical. Analysis of cross-sectional, nationally representative survey data. This analysis relied on a novel measure of benefit value for the VHA and Medicare Advantage (MA) programs and nationally representative survey data of veterans and their health care use for 2016 through 2019. Linear regressions controlling for beneficiary and market characteristics with state and year fixed effects were used to first estimate the effect of VHA benefit value relative to MA benefit value on MA enrollment, and then on veteran reliance on VHA-paid care conditional on MA enrollment. We found that a $1 increase in relative VHA benefit value leads to at most a 0.2% (SE = 0.04) reduction in the probability of MA enrollment and a 0.3-percentage point (SE = 0.1) increase in reliance on VHA-paid care. Results were consistent across subgroups of enrollees, with slightly larger effects for enrollees with less generous benefits. For most veterans, benefit value has a small, often nonsignificant, effect on reliance. These results imply that changes in VHA benefit value are unlikely to have major effects on veteran reliance on the VHA.",

Retrospective analyses to assess the impact of disasters on Medicare Advantage contracts' quality-of-care performance scores in 2017 and 2018 for 11 Part C clinical quality and patient experience measures used in the Medicare Advantage Star Ratings. We calculated each Medicare Advantage contract's disaster exposure using the percentage of the contract's beneficiaries residing in a Federal Emergency Management Agency-designated disaster area during the measurement period. Using linear mixed models, we estimated the association between contract-level disaster exposures and performance scores during the performance period measured, with random effects for contract and fixed effects for year, contract characteristics, and the disaster exposure, using repeated cross-sectional data on contracts from 2016 to 2018. We found no evidence that geographically limited disasters meaningfully affected contract quality performance scores. The disasters studied were associated with statistically significant but small changes in performance scores for 1 of 11 measures in both years. The lack of evidence that being in a disaster-affected area had a meaningful negative impact on quality measure performance suggests that performance measurement programs are robust to the impact of short-term localized disasters and continue to function as intended.",

This retrospective cross-sectional study analyzed 1.9 million telemedicine video visits from a large academic health care system in New York City between 2020 and 2023. The data, collected from the health care system's electronic health records, included telemedicine encounters across more than 500 ambulatory locations. We used descriptive statistics to outline telemedicine usage trends and compared telemedicine utilization rates and evaluation and management characteristics across clinical specialties. Telemedicine utilization peaked during the COVID-19 pandemic, then declined and stabilized. Despite an overall decline, 2 non-primary care specialties (behavioral health and psychiatry) experienced continued growth in telemedicine visits. Primary care and urgent care visits were mainly characterized by low-complexity visits, whereas non-primary care specialties witnessed a rise in moderate- and high-complexity visits, with the number of moderate-level visits surpassing those of low complexity. The findings highlight a dynamic shift in telemedicine utilization, with non-primary care settings witnessing an increase in the complexity of cases. To address future demands from increasingly complex medical cases managed through telemedicine in non-primary care, appropriate resource allocation is essential.",

    "abstract": "To investigate demographic disparities in failed episodes of telemedicine utilization. The primary hypothesis was that certain demographic groups, including older adults and specific racial or ethnic groups, would experience disparate amounts of failed video visits. A retrospective review was conducted using electronic health record-integrated scheduled telehealth video visit telemetry data gathered for all video visits at a California academic health center from September 1, 2020, to November 30, 2020. For each visit, we collected demographics including age, sex, ethnicity, primary language, and race. Outcomes were categorized as successful or failed based on review of telemetry data. Successful visits were defined as simultaneous connections and completion of video visit, whereas failed visits were defined as provider-reported failure or lack of simultaneous connections for the telemedicine visit. Binomial generalized logistic regression using a generalized estimating equation approach was used to assess the impact of demographic factors on video visit success. Of 47,065 scheduled telemedicine video visits, telemetry data were available for 30,996; the 16,069 visits excluded from the study were due to no-shows, cancellations, or a nonintegrated solution being utilized. Of 30,996 visits included in the study, 27,273 were successfully completed. Analysis of the 3723 failed visits revealed that older adults and African American/Black patients were more likely to experience failed video visits, with ORs of 2.02 and 1.56, respectively. This study highlights the significant demographic disparities in failed video visit occurrence caused by technical failure as demonstrated by telemetry data. These findings highlight the need for targeted interventions and opportunity for improved outcomes.",

Using administrative claims data, we analyzed the demographic and clinical attributes associated with an eligible member's enrollment. Finally, we empirically assessed whether expanding the choice of modalities through which enrollees accessed diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) increased overall utilization and addressed geographic disparities. Although digital health program applications responded to the timing of the communications campaigns, overall program enrollment in absolute terms was low compared with the size of the eligible population. Among those eligible, female and employee subscribers were more likely to enroll. Overall, DSMES use increased slightly during the initial year, but we did not observe significantly higher rates of use among members in rural areas following the digital health program launch.

However, there is no literature examining how requiring preappointment engagement affects outcomes. The current study aimed to investigate the impact of mandatory preappointment surveys on patient show rates and wait-list times and provide guidance for implementing data-driven policy change. This study examined show rates and wait-list times during the 1 year before and 1 year following a policy change requiring new patients to complete preappointment surveys before they are scheduled. The χ2 test of homogeneity was used to determine changes between pre- and post-policy change show rates, and an independent t test was used to examine changes in wait-list time. This study examined the medical records of 275 youth with intake appointments at an interdisciplinary chronic pain management clinic at a large hospital. A retrospective chart review was conducted to determine changes in patient show rates and wait-list times. Findings demonstrated that patient show rates increased from 78.8% to 86.1% after the policy change, and average wait-list time decreased by 55.2% from the year before the policy change. This study's findings provide evidence that requiring patients to complete a preappointment survey before being scheduled significantly improved show rates and decreased wait-list times in a pediatric pain clinic. Providers should balance benefits with potential limitations, such as restricting access to care, when implementing such a policy change. This study also offers practical guidance for implementing data-driven policy change in health care settings.",

Case study including individuals aged 18 to 79 years referred by an ambulatory health care provider to a single regional health system's MTG program from April 2020 through September 2023. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and cardiometabolic measures (blood pressure [BP], weight, body mass index [BMI], and hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c]) were abstracted from electronic health records. Descriptive and bivariate analyses evaluated differences in demographics and comorbid conditions among those who ever vs never used the Food for Life Market. Weighted linear mixed-effect models evaluated the expected change in outcomes from baseline to recent measure, accounting for demographics, time between measures, and attributed market location. A total of 2259 adults received referrals to the MTG program (median, 1 referral; range, 1-7; 3184 total referrals). Of those referred, 1397 (61.8%) ever attended; MTG users were significantly older than nonusers (median age, 52.9 vs 38.3 years; P < .001). MTG program attendance was associated with favorable changes in market attendees vs nonusers in diastolic BP (-0.54 vs -0.51 mm Hg; P = .04) and BMI (0.20 vs 0.23; P = .02) after 3 years from baseline, after accounting for confounders. No significant differences were observed in systolic BP, HbA1c, or weight. An unincentivized MTG intervention demonstrated modest impacts on key cardiometabolic measures. Future efforts to colocate MTG sites with clinical settings may enhance program uptake and impact on cardiometabolic measures.",

    "abstract": "Health care networks are increasingly turning to programs that provide office-based care coordination to high-cost, high-need patients to control preventable health care costs. Although care coordination programs have been shown to result in shorter-term cost benefits, little is known about patients who remain in such programs beyond 2 years. This study sought to assess the amount of care coordination engagement over time in patients enrolled for more than 2 years in an office-based care coordination program. Cohort study with 9 years of follow-up data. The study population was adult patients enrolled for 2 or more years as of November 2023 in an office-based care coordination program at a major academic medical center in Boston, Massachusetts. The association between patient length of enrollment in an outpatient care coordination program and amount of care coordination engagement was assessed using linear regression, with differences between cohorts compared by t test and analysis of variance. Engagement patterns in 5 sequential study cohorts based on date of enrollment were compared. Among all 2258 patients enrolled, care coordination engagement increased linearly over time, with a mean increase of 0.2 care coordination encounters per patient per year. Similar increasing engagement patterns over time were observed across all study cohorts. Length of time enrolled in an office-based care coordination program predicted care coordination engagement, with care coordination services increasing the longer patients remained in the program.",

We evaluated the association between FFS or MA and each outcome, adjusting for age, race, marital status, county type, neighborhood poverty level, stage, hormone receptor status, and dual Medicare-Medicaid enrollment. Standard treatment was mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery plus radiotherapy; chemotherapy for regional disease; and hormone therapy if hormone receptor positive.

Using US health care claims data from the Optum Clinformatics database, this retrospective analysis identified adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using semaglutide. The CGM cohort had at least 1 CGM-related claim between January 1, 2019, and September 30, 2022. Random index dates were used in the control (non-CGM) cohort. At least 1 laboratory HbA1c value was required during baseline and follow-up periods. Outcomes included change in HbA1c and the proportion of people who reached American Diabetes Association (ADA) or Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) HbA1c targets of less than 7.0% or less than 8.0%, respectively. A total of 21,247 people with T2D were identified, with 18,488 in the control group and 2759 using CGM. Overall, a significantly greater reduction in HbA1c was observed in the CGM cohort compared with the control group (difference-in-differences, -0.55%; 95% CI, -0.64% to -0.47%; P < .0001). Among CGM users, the proportion meeting the ADA target of HbA1c less than 7.0% nearly doubled, and the proportion achieving the HEDIS target of HbA1c less than 8.0% increased by more than 50%. The results suggest that CGM provides an additive benefit to semaglutide, leading to greater decreases in HbA1c. Expanded use of these complementary therapies in the primary care setting could enable more people with T2D to achieve their glycemic goals.",

Medicaid coverage is a predictor of prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS) after TBI, a proxy for decreased PAC access. Among Medicaid patients with TBI, it is unknown whether coverage under a managed care organization (MCO) or fee-for-service (FFS) model predicts differences in LOS. Discharge data for patients with TBI from 318 California hospitals between 2017 and 2019 were obtained. We used multivariable regression models, treating mortality/hospice disposition as competing risks, to evaluate associations between insurance type and LOS, adjusting for sociodemographic factors and illness severity. Sensitivity analysis was conducted in patients with severe TBI identified by receipt of intracranial pressure monitoring or trauma craniotomy/craniectomy. Adjusted HRs (aHRs) were reported. The California Department of Health Care Access and Information Patient Discharge Dataset was queried for patients with TBI using International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Exclusion criteria were younger than 18 years or older than 65 years, payer other than private insurance (PI) or Medicaid, death or hospice discharge within 5 days of hospitalization, presence of a do-not-resuscitate order, and nonemergency admission. A total of 39,834 patients were analyzed (FFS, 24.2%; MCO, 33.2%; PI, 42.6%). Competing risk regressions showed that Medicaid models were associated with longer LOS compared with PI (FFS: aHR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.80-0.83; MCO: aHR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.87-0.96). Compared with MCOs, FFS was associated with longer LOS in the overall cohort (aHR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.85-0.91) and in the severe TBI subgroup (aHR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.99).

    "abstract": "Advances in diabetes technology have led to improved glycemic control. However, no study has evaluated the economic impact of advanced hybrid closed-loop (AHCL) technology in the US compared with older and less expensive treatments. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of the MiniMed 780G system (MM780G) with AHCL technology vs multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI) with intermittently scanned continuous glucose monitoring (isCGM) among patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the US. A 6-month randomized controlled trial compared MM780G against MDI with isCGM among patients with T1D. Outcomes included changes in hemoglobin A 1c and quality of life. We used the IQVIA Core Diabetes Model to simulate direct costs and quality of life separately over a 4-year horizon and a lifetime horizon. Treatment effects were sourced from the randomized controlled trial, and utilities and disutilities for diabetes-related complications came from the literature. We generated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves for the base case and 5 one-way sensitivity analyses. At a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000, MM780G is cost-effective in the base case, with an ICER of $68,402 per quality-adjusted life-year over a 4-year horizon and $38,842 per quality-adjusted life-year over a lifetime horizon. Sensitivity analyses varying the rates of short-term complications, pricing, and assumptions about treatment-related utilities show cost-effectiveness at a threshold of $100,000 in all but 1 case. MM780G is likely to be cost-effective vs MDI with isCGM in patients with T1D in the US at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000.",

    "abstract": "To compare quality and health resource utilization among beneficiaries under 2-sided risk Medicare Advantage (MA) payment arrangements (at-risk MA) vs traditional Medicare (TM). Retrospective cross-sectional regression analyses of claims and enrollment data from 2016 to 2019 examining 20 performance measures. All patients were cared for by the same 17 physician groups and 15,488 physicians across 35 health insurers. Logistic regressions adjusted for demographics, geography, and comorbidities for 20 quality and utilization measures across 4 domains of care. Estimates were reported using marginal risk and marginal risk difference per 1000 across the study period. The sample comprised 6,564,538 person-years (30.3% at-risk MA and 69.7% TM). Sixteen of the 20 measures favored at-risk MA, including lower acute inpatient admissions, lower 30-day readmissions, avoidance of emergency department utilization across 4 measures, avoidance of disease-specific inpatient admissions in 7 of 9 measures, lower high-risk medication use and office visits, and higher medication adherence to renin-angiotensin system drugs. The other 4 measures were statistically equivalent. Given the CMS goal of moving all beneficiaries to fully accountable care arrangements by 2030, it is critical to understand the differences in quality and health resource utilization between at-risk MA and fee-for-service TM to inform policies on payment and service delivery. Although the associations are not causal, in this cross-sectional study, at-risk MA relative to TM was associated with 11.3% to 54.0% higher quality and efficiency in 16 of 20 measures after adjusting for differences in demographics, comorbidities, and other health characteristics.",

First, characterizations of the number, type, and cost of medications provided to charitable care patients via the Streamlined Medication Access for High-Risk Patients (SMART) formulary were compared with existing benchmarks. Second, emergency department (ED) and hospital utilization data were reviewed for charitable care patients after implementation of the SMART formulary and compared with utilization prior to implementation. From January 1, 2023, through August 31, 2024, the SMART formulary provided 6791 medications to 418 unique patients, totaling more than 4.5 times more prescriptions to nearly 3 times more unique patients than the benchmark charitable care spending (March 1, 2019, to June 30, 2021). Drug costs per patient and costs per prescription were reduced by 62% and 72%, respectively. Reductions in ED visits (10%) and hospitalizations (34%) occurred, reducing the total health care spend by $6163 per month. The SMART formulary team facilitated the completion of 74 patient assistance program applications and connected patients to manufacturer insulin savings programs, estimating an additional indirect cost savings of $310,168. The SMART formulary reduced the total cost of care for a cohort of charitable care patients enrolled in a primary care clinic at a large urban academic medical center in Baltimore, Maryland.",

A retrospective cohort study of patients in Maryland undergoing elective major joint replacement between 2011 and 2018 was performed using a 20% fee-for-service Medicare sample in a difference-in-difference framework with patients undergoing hip fracture repair serving as controls. Among Maryland residents, there were 7147 Medicare fee-for-service patients undergoing elective major joint replacement and 1008 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries undergoing hip fracture repair. We used patient-level generalized linear models with a negative binomial family function and a log link function to estimate the association of the All-Payer Model with the rate of elective major joint replacement surgery. Under the All-Payer Model, the rate of elective major joint replacement surgery increased more than that of hip fracture repair (adjusted relative risk, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.15-1.51). Compared with hospitals without affiliates in adjacent states (Maryland-only hospitals), those with affiliates (Maryland hospitals with affiliates) saw rates of elective major joint replacement grow more slowly (adjusted relative risk, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.95) after the All-Payer Model. Furthermore, major joint replacement rates for Maryland residents at affiliated hospitals in adjacent states increased from 4.26 per 10,000 in the preintervention period to 5.23 per 10,000 in the postintervention period. Under the All-Payer Model, population-based rates of elective major joint replacement surgery increased more rapidly than did rates of hip fracture repair. Although rates of major joint replacement at Maryland hospitals with affiliates grew more slowly than for Maryland-only hospitals, rates among Maryland residents increased at the affiliates in adjacent states.",

We aimed to validate the performance of the PREVENT cardiovascular risk equation across diverse racial and ethnic groups and assess its association with long-term all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Observational cohort study using nationally representative data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) linked with mortality data. Using 10-year data from the NHANES (2009-2018), we analyzed a cohort of more than 177 million adults in the US to evaluate the association between baseline cardiovascular risk, as determined by the PREVENT overall cardiovascular disease risk equation, and long-term all-cause and cardiovascular mortality across racial and ethnic groups. The cohort was stratified by race and ethnicity. We employed Cox proportional hazards models to assess the relationship between cardiovascular risk and mortality. Our analysis revealed significant variations in baseline cardiovascular risk across racial and ethnic groups. Across all groups, there was a consistent incremental increase in both cardiovascular and all-cause mortality rates with higher estimated cardiovascular risk. During up to a decade of follow-up, we found that individuals at high risk had a 6-fold higher risk of all-cause mortality and a 9-fold higher risk of cardiovascular mortality compared with individuals at low cardiovascular risk. The association between cardiovascular risk and mortality remained consistent across all racial and ethnic groups, albeit with very different risk estimates. For every 5% increase in estimated 10-year cardiovascular risk, there was a 54% increase in all-cause mortality and a 57% increase in cardiovascular mortality. These study findings validate PREVENT scores across diverse racial and ethnic populations, highlighting the tool's effectiveness in predicting cardiovascular risk and mortality regardless of race or ethnicity.",

    "abstract": "Individuals younger than 65 years can qualify for Medicare if they have long-term disabilities or certain qualifying conditions. These beneficiaries-particularly the non-dual-eligible population-may experience cost and access barriers to medical care. We examined the association between Medicare coverage type and reported barriers to care. Multivariable linear probability models assessed the association between self-reported Medicare coverage and patient-reported outcomes by dual-eligibility status. Using 2012-2020 data from the Health and Retirement Study, we compared self-reported sociodemographic and health-related characteristics of non-dual-eligible and dual-eligible beneficiaries aged 50 to 64 years by Medicare coverage type at their baseline interview. We then examined the following self-reported outcomes: experiencing cost-related medication nonadherence, delaying care due to cost, not having a usual source of care, and having trouble finding a doctor. Among non-dual-eligible beneficiaries, enrollment in traditional Medicare (TM) plus supplemental coverage vs TM with no supplemental coverage was associated with lower reported rates of experiencing cost-related medication nonadherence (-7.5 percentage point [PP] change; 95% CI, -12.1 to -3.0), delaying care due to cost (-9.8 PP; 95% CI, -13.3 to -6.3), and having no usual source of care (-5.5 PP; 95% CI, -8.9 to -2.1). Compared with TM with no supplement, Medicare Advantage enrollment was associated with lower rates of delaying care due to cost (-4.2 PP; 95% CI, -7.6 to -0.7) and having no usual source of care (-5.2 PP; 95% CI, -8.2 to -2.3). Among dual-eligible beneficiaries, outcomes largely did not differ by coverage type. Switching from traditional Medicare to Medicare Advantage was associated with trouble finding a doctor for dual-eligible beneficiaries. Enrollment in less generous Medicare coverage was associated with greater cost and access barriers to care for beneficiaries younger than 65 years.",

Plan sponsors can leverage membership in national and regional health care business coalitions, such as The ERISA Industry Committee and the Employers' Forum of Indiana, for policy advocacy and education at federal and state levels. Coalition successes include Texas House Bill 711, which combats anticompetitive contracting practices, and Indiana's House Enrolled Act 1259, which enhances pricing transparency.

Birth certificates (n = 191,943; 2014-2022) were linked with insurance claims (2013-2021) from the Arkansas All-Payer Claims Database to assess alternative approaches for algorithmic fairness in predictive models for low birth weight (< 2500 g).

The original model had lower accuracy (percent predicted correctly) in predicting low birth weight among Black, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, Asian, and unknown racial/ethnic populations relative to White individuals. For Black individuals, accuracy increased with all 6 fairness-improving approaches relative to the original model; however, sensitivity (true-positives correctly predicted as low birth weight) significantly declined, as much as 31% (from 0.824 to 0.565), in 5 of 6 approaches. When developing and implementing decision-making algorithms, it is critical that model performance metrics align with management goals for the predictive tool. In our study, fairness-improving models improved accuracy and area under the curve scores for Black individuals but decreased sensitivity and negative predictive value, suggesting that the original model, although unfair, was not improved. Implementation of unfair models for allocating preventive services could perpetuate racial/ethnic inequities by failing to identify individuals most at risk for a low-birth-weight delivery.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenge of improving outcomes for the 5% of individuals with complex chronic diseases who utilize 50% of health care resources. Previous interventions targeting this population have shown limited impact, often due to transactional and time-limited approaches. This study proposes a longitudinal, relationship-based case management framework as an alternative solution. A nonrandomized, prospective cohort study was conducted among Medicaid enrollees with complex medical and social needs. The intervention involved case managers building strong interpersonal relationships over a minimum of 1 year, addressing barriers to care and facilitating solutions. Primary outcomes were total health care expenditures and patient-rated quality of life. The intervention group exhibited a significant reduction in total health care costs over 1 year ($8568 per patient), with greater savings observed for patients with higher preintervention costs. Additionally, an estimated annual savings net of program costs of $248,121 was observed. Patient-rated quality of life showed substantial improvement, evident at both 6 months and 1 year post enrollment. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of a longitudinal, relationship-based case management approach in improving outcomes for individuals with complex medical, social, and behavioral needs. Unlike transactional interventions, this approach emphasizes partnership and customization, yielding substantial cost reductions and enhanced quality of life. Although limitations exist, including nonrandomization and staff diversity, this study provides a foundation for future research and scalability of similar interventions.",

However, there are limited data on which factors are associated with the highest risk of UAMCCs. This study sought to determine which factors were associated with increased risk of UAMCCs. Retrospective study conducted among all adult patients with 2 or more chronic conditions defined by CMS presenting to 2 hospitals within a major Midwest health care system from November 1, 2022, to October 31, 2023. Demographics, chronic conditions, primary care physician (PCP) visit utilization, and annual wellness visit (AWV) utilization were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression to identify associations with UAMCCs. Among 18,448 patients (55.8% women) included in the study, 3842 (20.8%) had at least 1 UAMCC. Patients with UAMCCs were more likely to have Medicare or Medicaid insurance; be widowed; speak Spanish; have a higher Charlson Comorbidity Index score; and have Alzheimer disease, atrial fibrillation, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and/or stroke. When examining PCP visit measures, AWVs and having 1 or more PCP visits were associated with fewer UAMCCs. Higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores, several health conditions, and Spanish language were associated with increased UAMCCs. AWVs and having 1 or more PCP visits were associated with fewer UAMCCs.",

Quasi-experimental evaluation of hospitals before and after joining a CMS ACO using a difference-in-differences design during the period from 2010 to 2013. Propensity score-matched groups of hospitals were used to estimate the combined effects of ACO maturity and CMS ACO participation on inpatient costs, quality, and patient safety outcomes. Total treatment costs, mortality rates for 4 common conditions, and 4 perioperative adverse events were investigated. Analyses were based on state-level data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. We matched 121 CMS ACO-participating hospitals and 853 nonparticipating hospitals. Hospitals with an ACO maturity score of 0 had significantly worse acute myocardial infarction mortality and perioperative pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis rates than nonparticipants. These differences were no longer significant with increasing ACO maturity. Higher ACO maturity was associated with significant improvements in accidental punctures and lacerations among hospital CMS ACO participants. No other significant trends were observed. Findings suggest a potential positive effect of hospital CMS ACO participation with increasing maturity. However, use of early ACO data, a short follow-up period, and other limitations hindered the ability to identify significant trends. Nonetheless, ACO maturity scores and new outcome measures may offer a promising approach for tracking the long-term impact of hospital ACO participation in future research and policy evaluations.",

However, the sustainability of televisit use for specialty care delivery following the pandemic is unclear. In this descriptive, retro-spective study of national Veterans Health Administration (VHA) data, we assessed total outpatient visit volume by month in 9 specialties (cardiology, dermatology, eye care, gastroenterology [GI]/hepatology, neurosurgery, orthopedics, podiatry, substance use disorder [SUD], and urology) at all VHA facilities in the US between January 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and September 2023 (representing late phases of health system recovery post COVID-19). We also categorized outpatient visits by modality (in person, telephone, video) and assessed time trends in the proportion of total outpatient visits in each specialty delivered by televisit. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the study findings. Although total visit volumes in most VHA specialties had returned to pre-COVID-19 baselines by the end of the study period, they did not fully rebound in others, suggesting persistent care gaps. Televisit use increased from a mean of 7% in quarter 1 (Q1) 2019 to 54% in Q2 2020, then decreased modestly to 27% of all specialty visits by Q3 2023. The specialties with the highest sustained televisit use in Q3 2023 were SUD and GI, despite restored in-person visit availability. The use of telephone visits exceeded the use of video visits throughout the study period. Our findings suggest that televisits will likely remain an important visit modality for patients in the postpandemic era.",

Less is known, however, about how care is potentially altered by participation in similar private payer-based models. Here, we take advantage of a natural experiment in which 2 large practices from among a network of oncology practices participated in a shared savings program (SSP) with a private insurer. Quasi-experimental (difference-in-differences) statistical analysis of oncology claims data. We used monthly provider-level claims data from September 2014 through August 2017 for patients with breast, colon, and lung cancer from The US Oncology Network. Key outcome measures were monthly mean office visits, total costs, and buy-and-bill drug costs among patients with breast, colon, and lung cancer. We then compared the utilization and cost patterns, preintervention and post participation, among patients on this insurance at participating practices vs those of patients at nonparticipating practices. Monthly per-patient total costs in colon cancer and lung cancer were lower through the first year of participation in the program by $1391 (95% CI, -$2218 to -$563; P < .01) and $1050 (95% CI, -$1878 to -$222; P = .02), respectively. These savings increased for colon cancer but disappeared for lung cancer in the second year. The program appeared to have no significant impact on any costs for participants with breast cancer in either of the years we examined. Our results suggest that private payer-based SSP models can be associated with reduced costs for colon cancer care. There is weaker evidence of effects in lung cancer and no evidence in breast cancer. Such heterogeneous effects can inform future model development.",

For the dichotomous analysis, AMCC was associated with a significant increase in the percentage of patients with a PAM of level 3 or 4 at 180 days (15.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.6-24.7). AMCC significantly increased patient activation, particularly at the final measurement.

Voluntary alignment allows Medicare beneficiaries to self-attribute to a particular medical provider or organization by signing a form or making a selection in the MyMedicare.gov portal. We performed mixed-methods analyses of cross-sectional survey, enrollment, and claims data and coding transcripts of interviews with NGACO leadership. We statistically compared characteristics of NGACOs and beneficiaries that engaged in voluntary alignment compared to claims alignment. Additionally, we grouped qualitative interview responses into 2 overarching themes that emerged around NGACO leaders' perceptions, use, and experiences with voluntary alignment. Few NGACOs engaged in widespread use of voluntary alignment. NGACOs that adopted voluntary alignment were similar to those that did not in most respects, although beneficiaries aligned through voluntary alignment were sicker and more expensive than those aligned through claims only. Many NGACO leaders reported they were content with claims-based alignment and did not think implementing initiatives to increase voluntary alignment would be worthwhile. The analysis suggests possible lessons for using voluntary alignment in future ACO models. NGACO leaders perceived that the use of voluntary alignment was limited by a high implementation effort, a need for patient education, and tight administrative time frames. Perceived benefits of voluntary alignment included attribution flexibility and creating opportunities for beneficiary engagement. Some leaders suggested allowing year-round voluntary alignment sign-up to better integrate voluntary alignment into their regular office workflows.",

    "abstract": "Medication nonadherence is prevalent among patients taking acute and/or chronic medications. It has been associated with poorer health outcomes, increased mortality, and higher costs for payers and the health care system. Numerous factors contribute to medication nonadherence, with forgetfulness being the primary reason. Payers have a vested interest in improving patient adherence to medications to mitigate overall health care costs by enhancing disease management, and they typically offer programs and initiatives aimed at improving medication adherence. One intervention that has had success in improving medication adherence and patient outcomes across a variety of disease states is putting patients' medications in blister packs. Although there is decades' worth of evidence demonstrating the success of blister packaging, utilization outside of the long-term care setting in the US is limited, likely due to the fragmentation of the health care system. Even though putting medications in blister packs has the potential to improve outcomes, pharmacies are the institutions that would have to implement this initiative while not seeing the financial savings from the reduced health care costs. Although it may improve their patients' outcomes, they would not be capturing the cost savings required to implement a potential new workflow and/or offset additive costs. Therefore, payers should consider incentivizing pharmacies to put medications in blister packs. Because payers would realize cost savings from the reduction in health care costs, they could reinvest some of that money toward blister packaging at their pharmacies and/or provide preferred contracting and network status for independent pharmacies that blister-package medications to help improve their population's health.",

    "abstract": "To (1) develop a metric that quantitatively measures the risk that utilization management (UM) policies pose to patients and (2) measure the relationship between this metric and payers' real-world UM use. We conducted a targeted literature review and an expert elicitation exercise to create the Data-Based Utilization Management Risk Designation (BURDEN) score. Real-world data analysis measured the relationship between BURDEN and actual payer policies. The BURDEN score was based on 9 UM factors impacting patient outcomes. Factors were weighted based on an expert elicitation procedure with 6 stakeholders. UM policy restrictions were drawn from Tufts Medical Center's Specialty Drug Evidence and Coverage database, and net price data came from SSR Health. Ordinary least square regressions were performed to examine the relationship between the BURDEN score and coverage policies. Among 98 treatments identified across 30 unique diseases, UM policies on treatments for myasthenia gravis, multiple myeloma, and lupus nephritis posed the highest risk to patients, according to the BURDEN score. When treatments had a high BURDEN score, payers were 22.0% less likely to impose any UM restriction (P = .041) and 36.2% less likely to impose step edits (P = .039). This study developed a quantitative measure (BURDEN) to estimate the relative risk to patients of payer UM policies. Payers appeared modestly sensitive to treatments that posed a high risk to patients should UM be implemented. However, coverage decisions did not appear to be fully patient-centered, as some higher BURDEN products experienced increased UM usage.",

    "abstract": "We sought to determine whether patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or CVD risk factors and fragmented care (ie, care spread across multiple providers) perceive any gaps in communication among their providers and whether any gaps are perceived as clinically significant (ie, leading to adverse events). We conducted a cross-sectional telephone survey of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries 65 years and older with CVD or at least 1 CVD risk factor and highly fragmented ambulatory care (reversed Bice-Boxerman Index score ≥ 0.85) who had been attributed to an accountable care organization in New York, New York. Using a previously tested survey instrument, we asked about perceptions of communication among the respondents' providers, any adverse events (drug-drug interactions, duplicate tests, emergency department visits, or hospitalizations), and whether those events were preventable with better communication. We used descriptive statistics. Of 201 eligible individuals, 96 completed surveys (47.8% response rate). Of those, 94 (97.9%) reported having at least 2 ambulatory visits and at least 2 ambulatory providers in the past year and were included in our analytic sample. The mean (SD) age was 76 (6.8) years; approximately two-thirds (69%) were women. Approximately half of respondents (48%) reported a problem with, or \"gap\" in, communication among their providers. One in 14 respondents (7%) reported experiencing an adverse event that they thought could have been prevented with better communication. Gaps in communication for patients with CVD or CVD risk factors are common and hazardous. Interventions are needed to leverage patients' observations to address gaps in communication before they cause harm.",

A 2022 survey of primary care clinical staff in the US who provided HPV vaccination to children aged 9 to 12 years (N = 2527; response rate, 57%). The primary outcome was a mutually exclusive categorical variable for the type of P4P quality metrics used in the past year: HPV vaccination, other pediatric vaccinations, other quality metrics, or none. The secondary outcome was an indicator variable for whether the respondent was, or would be, eligible for P4P incentives. We adjusted logistic models for clinical staff and clinic characteristics. Only 8% (n = 193) of respondents reported use of P4P incentives for HPV vaccination in their clinic. Clinics that were part of a health care system were more likely to have used P4P incentives for HPV vaccination (relative risk ratio [RRR] for respondents in systems of ≥ 5 clinics vs respondents not in systems, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.38-3.08), and clinics that saw more children were more likely to have used P4P incentives for HPV vaccination (RRR for respondents in clinics seeing ≥ 50 children vs clinics seeing 0-9 children per week, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.44-4.82). Physicians were more than twice as likely as other clinical staff to be eligible for P4P incentives (eg: OR for physician assistant, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.28-0.59).

Qualitative study. Participants were leaders and high-level employees from large health insurance organizations in the US. Our aim was to survey 20 participants, 10 from organizations that covered IMWM and 10 that excluded coverage for IMWM. Participants completed a 30-minute interview. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using directed content analysis. Twenty individuals completed an interview; 9 interviewees were from organizations that covered IMWM at the time of the study, and 11 were from organizations that excluded coverage for IMWM. We identified 5 key themes: (1) high cost as the primary barrier to coverage of IMWM, (2) perception of obesity as a lifestyle choice, (3) current or planned use of varied utilization management strategies to limit initial and ongoing prescribing of IMWM, (4) coverage for lifestyle-change programs to support weight management, and (5) perceived responsibility of pharmaceutical companies to lower list prices for IMWM to enable broad coverage and advance health equity. High cost of IMWM is the primary limiting factor in coverage policies. There is variability in plan design, with utilization management strategies that aim to reduce near-term spending. Health plan leaders call on pharmaceutical companies to reduce list prices to increase equitable access to IMWM.",

We characterized patients with CD or UC as being at high or low risk of disease progression and estimated rates of CD-related and UC-related HCRU. This retrospective study used claims data from a US health care payer database from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2019. Included patients were fully insured, were 18 years or older, had a diagnosis of CD or UC, and were naive to biologic treatment.

For CD, 1459 (39.1%) patients were high risk and 2272 (60.9%) patients were low risk. High-risk patients had higher mean hospitalizations (0.35 vs 0.28; P = .03) and surgeries (0.04 vs 0.01; P < .0001) per patient than low-risk patients. During follow-up, 13.8% of patients with CD at high risk received advanced therapy vs 4.8% of low-risk patients. For UC, 2215 (40.4%) patients were high risk and 3270 (59.6%) patients were low risk. High-risk patients had higher mean hospitalizations (0.33 vs 0.10; P < .0001) and surgeries (0.01 vs 0.00; P < .0001) per patient than low-risk patients. During follow-up, 7.7% of patients with UC at high risk received advanced therapy vs 1.8% of low-risk patients.

Data suggest that corticosteroid premedication prior to infliximab (IFX) administration is ineffective at preventing infusion reactions. Therefore, we examined corticosteroid premedication practices in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which represent an opportunity for reducing corticosteroid overuse. National cohort study of patients with IBD receiving IFX using 2015-2021 Truven (now Merative) MarketScan data. We examined corticosteroid premedication as an outcome of interest using descriptive statistics and identified associated patient-level factors using bivariate analyses. We also explored differences in corticosteroid premedication for first IFX infusions (ie, no opportunity for a prior reaction) and subsequent IFX infusions. We identified 19,637 patients with IBD who received IFX and met the inclusion criteria. Corticosteroid premedication use declined from 27.4% in 2015 to 20.4% in 2020. During this time, 38.7% of the 4639 patients who received IFX premedication were premedicated for more than 90% of their infusions. Overall, those who received corticosteroid premedication were younger (median age, 30 vs 33 years), more often female (51.6% vs 47.7%), and more likely to have 1 or more comorbidities (21.7% vs 18.8%) than patients who were not premedicated, but the groups had similar rates of diabetes (4.1% vs 4.2%), cataracts (1.4% vs 1.3%), and osteoporosis (1.4% for both). Among patients receiving corticosteroid premedication, 62.5% received it with their first IFX infusion, suggesting routine practice rather than a strategy for those who had a prior infusion reaction. Corticosteroid premedication for IFX remains unnecessarily common. Corticosteroid premedicating is a common low-value practice that could be targeted to reduce corticosteroid overuse in IBD.",

RCTs were selected as the data sources because of the standardized reporting on outcomes and prospective data. Studies included in the analysis reported on US patients recently diagnosed with HF who underwent watchful waiting after discharge.

The pooled estimates of all-cause and HF-specific hospital readmissions, length of hospital stay, emergency department visits, and mortality at 3, 6, and 12 months were calculated using R software's meta and metafor packages. There were 31 studies that met the inclusion criteria and reported data for 6916 patients with HF receiving SOC. The proportions of patients with a readmission and an emergency department visit at 3 months were 32.55% (95% CI, 24.03%-41.63%) and 13.83% (95% CI, 8.21%-20.49%), respectively.

    "abstract": "States are experimenting with accountable care organization (ACO) contracts to slow Medicaid spending growth. There is limited information on how ACOs have impacted expenditures in Medicaid, which includes a relatively heterogenous population with less spending compared with Medicare. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of high-risk care management on spending and utilization within Massachusetts' largest Medicaid ACO. This observational study analyzed Medicaid claims data from Massachusetts' largest Medicaid ACO utilizing staggered program entry from 2016 to 2021 (n = 158,441 total beneficiaries). It included adults aged 18 to 64 years with multiple chronic conditions and used a claims-based algorithm for participant selection. We examined spending and clinical event rates of those participating and not yet participating in a high-risk care management program. Between 2016 and 2021, 2479 beneficiaries were identified as high risk and entered the program. The study utilized a difference-in-differences approach with linear regression models to assess the impact of care management. The analysis accounted for time-stable and time-changing covariates, including comorbidity levels and age. Participation in the program for 7 or more months was associated with a $243 reduction in monthly spending compared with similar beneficiaries who had not yet started the program (95% CI, -$479 to -$6). There also were comparable reductions in emergency department visit and hospitalization rates. These early ACO data findings suggest that upstream care management of high-risk individuals may represent a viable approach for slowing Medicaid spending growth.",

Longitudinal study of US hospital and ACO data for 3534 short-term acute care hospitals ever participating in Medicare ACOs or not across hospital referral regions (HRRs) from Milliman Torch Insight (2011-2020). Using HRR as the local market, we calculated 3 hospital MS measures using annual net patient revenue, discharges, and beds, and we calculated market concentration using a modified Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. We compared hospital characteristics by Medicare ACO participation. In longitudinal, multivariable ordinary least squares regressions, we examined the association among hospital MS, ACO participation, and market concentration. Thirty percent of hospitals (n = 1048) reported ever participating in ACOs. Across MS measures, ACO participants had larger MS, with a mean MS of 11.5 (vs 8.5 for nonparticipants) for net patient revenue, 11.4 (vs 8.4) for discharges, and 10.9 (vs 8.6) for beds. The difference in MS between ACO participants and nonparticipants was larger in more concentrated markets relative to less concentrated markets. ACO participation was associated with increases in mean MS of 1.7 percentage points (PP) for net patient revenue, 2.0 PP for discharges, and 1.6 PP for beds. ACO participation was associated with additional MS gains in more (vs less) concentrated markets. More importantly, baseline (2011) MS emerged as the most important predictor of MS growth. Hospitals participating in ACOs still surpass nonparticipants on MS. Our finding that baseline MS is most predictive of future MS growth suggests that competition should be managed prior to ACO entry and participation should be closely monitored in concentrated markets. With competition fostering quality and improving patient welfare, MS gains associated with hospital ACO participation may suggest the need for future assessments to ensure that quality and patient welfare do not decrease over time.",

Retrospective claims-based analysis. Using data from Symphony Health Integrated Dataverse from March 2015 through October 2020, we identified adults with MDD who were being treated with antidepressants and had an initial cariprazine claim that was either rejected for a formulary-related reason (eg, noncoverage, prior authorization requirement, step therapy requirement) or approved; rejected patients were required to receive a subsequent atypical antipsychotic (which helps balance the health status across cohorts but may induce bias and affect generalizability). Rejected and approved cohorts were matched (1:2) using propensity scores. Outcomes included all-cause and mental health (MH)-related HCRU (hospitalizations, emergency department [ED] visits, outpatient visits) and treatment patterns. HCRU was compared between cohorts using rate ratios (RRs), with 95% CIs and P values. Treatment patterns were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The rejected cohort comprised 566 patients, with 1132 matched patients in the approved cohort. All-cause and MH-related hospitalization rates were 61% and 89% higher, respectively, for the rejected vs approved cohort (all-cause: RR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.15-2.32; P = .012; MH related: RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.18-2.89; P = .016). ED and outpatient visit rates were similar. Patients in the rejected cohort often never received cariprazine (68.4%), and those who did received it after a 6-month delay on average. Patients with MDD who had an initial adjunctive cariprazine claim rejected for a formulary-related reason and subsequently received an atypical antipsychotic experienced significantly higher hospitalization rates than those with approved initial cariprazine claims, suggesting that formulary restrictions on adjunctive cariprazine may be associated with negative downstream effects.",

    "abstract": "To assess trends in assigned International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision ( ICD-10 ) codes for patients hospitalized with heart failure (HF) from 2018 to 2022 in 2 large US health systems. Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of ICD-10 codes assigned to patients hospitalized with HF in the Providence Health and University of Colorado Health (UCHealth) systems. The study included patients discharged from the Providence Health and UCHealth systems between 2018 and 2022 with a primary diagnosis of HF. ICD-10 codes analyzed included systolic HF (I50.2), diastolic HF (I50.3), combined systolic and diastolic HF (I50.4), hypertensive heart disease with HF (I11.0), and hypertensive heart disease with HF and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (I13.0, I13.2). Hospitalization data were analyzed separately for each health system due to privacy policies. Between 2018 and 2022, 61,238 HF hospitalizations occurred in the Providence Health system, and 13,576 occurred in UCHealth. Hypertensive heart disease with HF and CKD was the most common diagnosis, accounting for 42% to 56% of HF hospitalizations, followed by hypertensive heart disease with HF (34%-42%). Together, these diagnoses represented 85% to 90% of HF hospitalizations. Systolic, diastolic, and combined HF codes accounted for only 9% to 18% of hospitalizations. Significant variability in hypertension prevalence (ie, 100% in Providence Health and 38%-39% in UCHealth) was observed between the 2 health systems in patients with codes I13.0 and I13.2. The study highlighted a significant shift in HF diagnosis codes, with hypertensive heart disease with HF with and without CKD now predominant. The findings highlight the need for standardized coding practices across health systems for quality improvement initiatives and health services research.",

    "abstract": "Biologics have substantially improved health outcomes for patients with immunologic conditions. However, not all patients have equitable access to these important medications. Accordingly, we conducted a systematic review to understand US health care disparities in biologics access and associated clinical and economic outcomes, including health care resource use, across immunology (ie, rheumatology, gastroenterology, and dermatology). Systematic literature review. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases for studies published between 2017 and 2023 focused on access to biologic treatments for US adult patients (≥ 18 years) diagnosed with immunologic conditions. Across the 21 studies included in this systematic review, disparities in biologics access were inconsistently studied, and only 8 studies (38%) evaluated clinical or economic outcomes of low biologics access. The factors most frequently associated with disparities in access to biologics included insurance type; Black, Hispanic, or Asian race or ethnicity; high out-of-pocket costs; and insurance prior authorization requirements. These disparities were associated with worse clinical and economic outcomes, including higher hospital admission and readmission, higher number of emergency department visits, and treatment delays. However, some studies found no association between some of these disparities and access to biologics, highlighting the complexity of the issue. We identified key factors that influence disparities in biologics access within immunology across the US, which were associated with worse clinical and economic outcomes. We highlight potential solutions to minimize disparities in biologics access and the need for more in-depth research to address these disparities.",

    "abstract": "Ambulatory cardiac monitors (ACMs) enable heart rhythm monitoring for various durations, including Holter monitors (0-48 hours), long-term continuous monitors (LTCMs; 3-14 days), and external ambulatory event monitors (AEMs; up to 30 days). These devices detect intermittent or asymptomatic arrhythmias that might go unnoticed with a standard electrocardiogram. Previous research has explored variations in ACM use among Medicare beneficiaries. This study assessed the incidence of clinical and economic outcomes among commercially insured patients who had never had an arrhythmia diagnosis and received their first ACM. Retrospective cohort study using a large commercial claims database focused on patients without prior arrhythmia diagnoses who received their first ACM between 2016 and 2023. Outcomes included new arrhythmia diagnoses, repeat ACM testing, cardiovascular (CV) events, and health care resource use and costs. Results were stratified by major ACM manufacturers using National Provider Identifiers. To minimize confounding, inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to balance covariates, and adjusted regression models were used to evaluate outcomes during follow-up. Of 428,707 patients meeting inclusion criteria, 36% used LTCMs, 36% used Holter monitors, and 27% used external AEMs. Adjusted analyses showed that a certain LTCM brand was associated with higher odds of a new arrhythmia diagnosis, fewer retests (except vs AEMs), lower odds of CV events, and less follow-up health care resource use and costs than other ACM types and manufacturers. Clinical and economic outcomes can vary by ACM type among commercially insured patients. A specific LTCM manufacturer demonstrated superior performance, with greater diagnoses of arrhythmia, fewer repeat tests, and fewer CV events compared with other ACM types and manufacturers.",

This study examines whether hospital ACO participation is associated with changes in emergency department (ED) admission practices, hospital length of stay (LOS), and spending for unplanned admissions. Study Design: A difference-in-differences analysis of Medicare fee-for-service ED visits and hospitalizations (2008-2019). Methods: Medicare claims were linked to ACO tracking data from Torch Insight to identify hospitals that joined an ACO between 2012 and 2017 (6 cohorts, followed for a maximum of 5 years), the start date of their initial contract, and ACO characteristics. Key outcomes included ED admission and observation stay rates, hospital LOS for emergent admissions, and total costs for an index ED event. Results: Among the 995 hospitals (27.6% of the short-term hospitals in our study) that joined a Medicare ACO during the study period, program participation up to 5 years was not associated with changes in the rate of hospitalization from the ED, hospital LOS, or total costs of the index event. Findings remained consistent across ACO program, contract risk levels, year of program entry, and overall ACO performance (eg, whether the ACO generated shared savings). Conclusions: Hospitals did not significantly alter care delivery for unplanned hospitalizations after joining an ACO. These findings suggest that hospital-led ACOs may have limited impact on reducing costs for emergent admissions, raising concerns about their ability to drive meaningful care transformation.",

Beneficiaries were divided into 4 cohorts based on their enrollment in TM or MA and the year of enrollment in 2019, the year before the COVID-19 pandemic, or 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic. For each cohort, 12 clinical quality measures were constructed, including 4 screening measures requiring in-person visits and 8 medication management and adherence measures. Results: A total of 3,190,208 Medicare beneficiaries were included (58.4% female; mean age, 73.0 years). In both 2019 and 2021, the MA program performed significantly better than TM across the 12 clinical quality measures. Compared with the year before the pandemic, both programs experienced a decrease in screening measures that required in-person visits during the pandemic, with a slightly higher decrease for the MA plans. In contrast, measures of medication management and adherence improved for both programs, but especially for MA plans. Conclusions: MA plans continued to outperform TM on clinical quality measures during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Using data from the National Committee for Quality Assurance publicly reported national averages for HEDIS quality metrics from commercial/private insurance and Medicaid managed care, observed differences for these measures were aggregated to establish the index. The Health Insurance Disparities Index (HeIDI) demonstrated a gradual worsening of disparities nationally between individuals with commercial/private insurance and individuals with Medicaid insurance from 2017 to 2022, with a substantial deterioration during and after the COVID-19 pandemic years.

Traditional medications are often limited in effectiveness and tolerability, creating a need for accessible nonpharmacologic options. This coverage with evidence development (CED) study assessed the necessity of the remote electrical neuromodulation (REN) wearable device for migraine treatment as a standard payer-covered treatment. Real-world postmarketing CED study in 2 clinics for 14 months. Members (aged 12-75 years) of a major US health insurer (Highmark Inc) diagnosed with migraine were prescribed REN as part of their clinical care. Effectiveness was evaluated by change in Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) score from baseline to 3 months of treatment and by prospective pain and disability reports 2 hours post treatment. Utilization was measured through prescription fulfillment and safety via adverse event reports. A total of 381 patients (mean [SD] age, 40.5 [13.2] years; 91.1% female) participated. Change in MIDAS score was calculated from all participants who answered the questionnaire twice (n = 116), showing a significant and clinically meaningful mean (SD) improvement of -12.1 (51.8) points (P = .014), from 58.3 (59.0) to 46.2 (44.1). Of the participants, 77.8% reported pain relief and 33.3% reported pain freedom; 70.6% and 50.0% reported relief and freedom from functional disability, respectively. Patients used a mean (SD) of 4.0 (3.1) devices annually (extrapolated). Three minor adverse events were reported. These positive outcomes led to the inclusion of REN as a standard treatment for migraine under Highmark policy. REN leads to significant clinical and functional benefits in patients with migraine. Additional health insurers are encouraged to consider REN as a standard covered treatment.",

RPM depends on home readings by patients electronically transmitted to clinicians and includes automated alerts for excessive abnormal readings. Data demonstrating the efficacy of RPM are limited; moreover, no study has specifically addressed patients with stage 2 hypertension. The current study aimed to address this gap. Quasi-experimental retrospective cohort study. A cohort of community-dwelling Medicare patients in a large outpatient primary care practice was enrolled in an RPM program if they were diagnosed with hypertension. Patients were followed for 1 year. Each patient was also assigned a nurse to function as a care coach, who communicated with the patients monthly and provided at least 20 minutes of care management. Of the 3403 Medicare beneficiaries who consented to participate, 1594 actively engaged in the program for 1 year. Of these, 652 had stage 2 hypertension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP [DBP] ≥ 90 mm Hg). The initial mean SBP/DBP ratio for those with stage 2 hypertension was 152/85 mm Hg, which decreased to 132/74 mm Hg by month 12. At baseline, 100% of these 652 patients met the criteria for stage 2 hypertension, but by month 12, this percentage decreased to 25%. In the 163 patients who remained in stage 2 hypertension, a notable decrease in BP was also achieved, with the mean BP dropping from 155/87 mm Hg to 146/77 mm Hg (P < .05). Deployment of an RPM program in Medicare patients with concomitant care coaching was associated with statistically significant reductions in both elevated BP readings and the presence of stage 2 hypertension.",

Cross-sectional, secondary analysis. Data for 14,579 adult beneficiaries in the 2021 Merative MarketScan Commercial and Medicare databases in Arizona, Nevada, and New Mexico were analyzed. Outpatient claims associated with NP care were used to examine the use of low-value lumbar x-ray, antibiotics for acute upper respiratory infection (aURI), and routine electrocardiogram (ECG) as described by the Choosing Wisely initiative. International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision and Current Procedural Terminology codes were used to apply inclusion and exclusion criteria. Relationships between LVC use and the state where a beneficiary received care, rural-urban practice location, and beneficiary sex and age were examined. Prevalence rates of NP use of low-value lumbar x-ray (13%), aURI antibiotic (42%), and ECG (6%) were lower or relatively similar to those found in other studies. Older beneficiary age was significantly associated with more low-value ECGs used (P < .001), but when adults 45 years and older were examined, age no longer remained significantly related. No significant relationships between NP LVC use and practice location or beneficiary sex were found. NP LVC use in primary care was lower or relatively similar compared with the general clinician population. MarketScan may underrepresent rural care, and the relationship between NP LVC use and rural-urban location should be reexamined using an alternative classification system. To deimplement NP LVC use, other factors, such as NP characteristics, must be explored.",

Utilizing value-based care (VBC) that offers additional support to providers is one strategy by which the Medicaid system can improve these outcomes. In this analysis, we examined a Medicaid managed care plan's incentive-only VBC program, which is supported by a provider enablement team to assist care providers in meeting program goals. Cross-sectional analysis of deliveries occurring between July 2020 and June 2022 from Elevance Health-affiliated Medicaid managed care plans operating in 16 states. This study primarily relied on medical claims data to compare maternal, infant, and cost outcomes in Medicaid members with a care provider participating in a supported VBC program vs those with a care provider not participating in supported VBC. A propensity-balanced multivariable regression model was used to estimate the impact of participation vs nonparticipation in supported VBC on delivery, cost, and quality outcomes. Members with a care provider supported in the VBC program had significantly lower neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) lengths of stay, preterm births, and low birth weights; significantly better timeliness and adequacy of prenatal care rates; and significantly lower birth costs, NICU costs, and maternal and infant costs in the first year after birth. These results provide insight into how payers and care providers can partner to improve maternal and infant outcomes among Medicaid members and subsequently experience cost savings.",

Study Design:, A cross-sectional telephone survey of patients and qualitative interviews with PCPs. Methods:, Patients' reasons for adherence or nonadherence to statins and completion of laboratory tests and their perceptions of the safety-net program were ascertained. PCPs were asked to describe their familiarity with the safety-net program and perceived patient barriers to filling a new statin prescription and completing laboratory tests. Results:, Among 59 participating patients, 86% did and 14% did not fill their statin. Patients reported statin adherence because their doctor prescribed it (100%), to lower cholesterol (94%), and to prevent a heart attack/stroke (51%). Reasons for nonadherence included wanting to try lifestyle modification (63%), general medication concerns (50%), and fear of adverse events (38%). Among patients filling their prescription, 94% completed a follow-up lipid panel. Among 14 PCPs interviewed, 8 were aware of the safety-net program. PCPs cited in-basket volume and lack of an automated reminder system as common barriers to following up with patients with high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. PCPs perceived (1) patients' fear of statins and (2) forgetfulness as the main reasons for not filling their prescriptions and not completing lipid panels, respectively. PCPs suggested that more frequent patient and provider reminders could improve prescription fills and laboratory test completions. Conclusions:, Interventions focused on improving patients' knowledge of statins and educating PCPs about outreach programs may facilitate patient-provider communication and improve statin adherence.",

    "abstract": "The Affordable Care Act (ACA), enacted in 2010, aimed to improve health insurance coverage and access to care, notably through a provision extending dependent coverage up to age 26 years. This study investigates the ACA's impact on substance use disorder (SUD)-associated emergency department (ED) visits among young adults aged 23 to 29 years. A quasi-experimental study analyzed opioid- and alcohol-associated ED visits and inpatient admissions among young adults (aged 23-25 [treatment] vs 27-29 [comparison] years) using 2007-2019 Nationwide Emergency Department Sample data. A difference-in-differences approach assessed the ACA's impact, adjusting for covariates including sex, comorbidities, payer source, income, residence, and hospital region. Generalized linear models estimated adjusted ORs with 95% CIs, ensuring robust analysis of the ACA's effects on substance-related health care utilization. Opioid-associated ED visits had no change between the treatment and comparison groups, whereas alcohol- associated ED visits declined more for the treatment group after the ACA (OR, 0.841; 95% CI, 0.828-0.855). No changes in inpatient admissions among opioid- or alcohol-associated visits, respectively, were seen between the 2 groups. Our findings indicate that the ACA's implementation led to mixed effects on substance-associated health care utilization among young adults, with reduced alcohol-associated visits in the treatment group but unchanged discrepancies in opioid-associated ED visits and inpatient admissions between the 2 groups. Further research is warranted to explore state-level variations and population-level substance use trends along with continuous monitoring to inform interventions addressing substance-associated public health challenges.",

State and federal regulations mandate insurance carriers to submit regulatory filings to help maintain network adequacy compliance, but the accuracy of these data remains unassessed. We employed a secret shopper survey to verify regulatory filings and assess the congruence between the filings and provider directory listings as well as appointment availability and wait time for 8306 mental health counselors submitted by all carriers participating in Pennsylvania's Affordable Care Act (ACA) Marketplace for plan year 2024. Descriptive analyses, with tests of proportion and t tests to assess differences between carriers and between adult and pediatric provider specialties. A total of 19.9% of filed regulatory listings (n = 1649) were not present in consumer-facing provider directories, and only 35.3% of filed listings (n = 2928) fully matched provider directory entries. Of the 2152 provider listings we were able to verify fully via secret shopper calls, 65.2% (n = 1404) exhibited at least 1 inaccuracy. Inaccurate phone number was the most common issue (56.6%; n = 1219). Appointments were available for only 321 of the 2152 providers (14.9%), with a mean of 33.2 days lapsed between call and scheduled appointment time. Although we identified substantial differences in appointment wait times by carrier, we found no difference between adult and pediatric providers. ACA network adequacy assessments that rely on carrier regulatory filings and/or consumer-facing directories substantially overestimated provider availability and access to mental health services.",

This study aimed to evaluate factors associated with disparities in rheumatology, dermatology, and gastroenterology specialist access for patients with immunological conditions and the consequences of such disparities. Systematic literature review. Studies published between 2017 and 2023 examining US adults (≥ 18 years) with key immunological conditions receiving care by rheumatologists, dermatologists, and gastroenterologists were systematically reviewed. Thematic analyses of qualitatively synthesized data were used to evaluate disparities in specialist access (defined under \"5 A's\": affordability, availability, accessibility, accommodation, and acceptability) and the associated clinical/economic outcomes. Specialist access disparities and related outcomes were inconsistently evaluated across the 46 included studies, with limited evidence in gastroenterology. Common factors associated with specialist access disparities in rheumatology and dermatology included rural residence, insurance type (primarily Medicaid), Black or Hispanic race and ethnicity, and low regional specialist density. Frequent outcomes of this low access included higher disease severity, higher hospital admission and readmission rates, and higher numbers of emergency department visits. Importantly, studies described ways to improve specialist access across the 5 A's (eg, minimize structural barriers, use a multidisciplinary approach, promote telemedicine, increase health literacy, improve community partnerships). Specialist access disparities were identified in rheumatology and dermatology. Conclusions in gastroenterology could not be inferred due to limited evidence. Evidence-based solutions are provided to address identified gaps in US health care.",

Propensity-matched, retrospective study. Two cohorts with International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes for diagnosis or symptom(s) of oropharyngeal infection or RTI (first diagnosis = index) on an outpatient claim were identified in the IQVIA PharMetrics Plus database (July 2020-October 2023). HCRU and costs were examined over 6 months post index across 5 subcohorts: patients receiving syndromic RT-PCR and 4 matched subcohorts (other PCR, point-of-care [POC] only, culture, or no test). The mean (SD) costs for postindex total outpatient services ($2598 [$7564] vs $2970 [$8417]; P < .0001), physician office visit ($624 [$1150] vs $689 [$1082]; P = .0002), emergency department (ED) ($290 [$1145] vs $397 [$1630]; P = .0192), and other medical services ($1684 [$6799] vs $1883 [$7568]; P < .0001) were significantly lower for the oropharyngeal RT-PCR subcohort than the matched culture subcohort. The mean (SD) postindex costs for any outpatient medical services ($2796 [$11,453] vs $3221 [$7873]; P < .0001), physician office visits ($525 [$974] vs $703 [$2635]; P = .0057), ED visits ($253 [$1036] vs $355 [$1300]; P = .0011), and other medical services ($2018 [$10,986] vs $2163 [$6458]; P < .0001) were significantly lower for the RTI RT-PCR subcohort than the matched culture subcohort. Patients in both RT-PCR subcohorts had lower utilization of other medical services and any outpatient services compared with all matched comparator subcohorts. This propensity-matched study provides evidence on the economic impact of syndromic RT-PCR tests for respiratory infections, highlighting their advantages over traditional diagnostic methods.",

    "abstract": "Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, is FDA approved under the brand names Ozempic for treatment of type 2 diabetes and Wegovy for the treatment of overweight or obesity. The soaring popularity of these drugs, driven by social media and their overall efficacy, has resulted in nationwide shortages. The high costs associated with the FDA-approved products for both insurers and patients have also led to additional restrictions in access. In response to the unmet growing demand for semaglutide, suppliers have started to sell compounded versions of these products, both legally and illegally. This narrative review examines the implications of these compounded products on our health care system, highlighting concerns regarding their safety, efficacy, and regulatory status. Compounding, when done following federal and state regulations, can fill an important need in our health care marketplace. However, the compounded semaglutide products currently available to patients may lack the quality controls historically seen with compounded formulations, resulting in risks for dosing errors and adverse health outcomes. In addition, the compounded semaglutide market worldwide has seen batches of fraudulent products. Pharmacists and other health care providers have a unique opportunity to help guide patients in navigating this compounded semaglutide market, including directing them to lawful sources of compounded semaglutide, providing counseling on dosage and administration, and minimizing safety concerns.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the relationship between the frequency of routine primary care visits and total health care expenditures among commercially insured adults. Retrospective cross-sectional statistical analysis of a nationally representative data set of health care utilization and expenditures over a 2-year period. We used multivariate regression analysis to evaluate the association between the annualized number of visits with a primary care physician for routine care and total health care expenditures for commercially insured adults younger than 65 years, adjusting for underlying clinical complexity measured through risk scoring. Data were drawn from information collected by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality between 2021 and 2022. For a sample cohort of 3879 participants, more frequent primary care visits were associated with incremental reductions in expenditures only for participants with high underlying clinical complexity. A relative risk level of approximately 2 times the average commercially insured adult was identified as an inflection point, above which cost reductions vs counterfactual prediction were observed, up to a limited number of visits. Our results show a relationship between primary care visit frequency and health care expenditures with similar directionality and risk dependency as has been observed in other studies for Medicare-insured adults. This finding suggests that certain commercial populations may benefit from risk-stratified, high-touch primary care models like those being employed for some Medicare populations. The health care cost reduction benefits of these models appear premised more on clinical need than coverage type. Demonstrating this relationship is useful for health care providers, insurers, and policy makers who are developing advanced primary care models.",

OBJECTIVE To assess the contribution of continuity of care (COC) with a single clinician to short-term outcomes in a setting in which electronic medical records are used. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. METHODS Between January 1, 2003, and October 1, 2004, we identified 3718 patients assessed for lipid and blood pressure control and a subgroup of 1448 patients with diabetes mellitus assessed for glycemic control in the primary care clinics of a large Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare facility. Continuity of care was defined as having been seen by the same clinician (physician or nurse practitioner) in the year before testing. Analytic techniques accounting for clustering of patients by providers yielded robust estimators for the association between continuity with a single clinician and control of these cardiovascular disease risk factors. RESULTS Patients with complete COC were more likely to be men with few medical problems and visits during the study period. Controlling for these differences, we detected no association between COC and patient attainment of recommended goals for cardiovascular disease risk factor control (P < .05 for all). CONCLUSION Continuity of care with a single clinician contributes little to cardiovascular risk factor management in a setting in which electronic medical records provide enhanced informational continuity, although its value may be greater in the management and outcomes of established diseases that require coordination of care and ongoing collaboration between clinician and patient.",

Outcome measures were assessed based on national guidelines for asthma management: at least 1 asthma controller medication prescription, at least 1 outpatient visit, 1 or more asthma emergency department visits, and an annual influenza vaccination.Adherence to national guidelines varied significantly (P </= .05) between plans. The proportion of children with at least 1 asthma controller prescription ranged from 66% to 88%; the proportion of children with influenza vaccination ranged from 3% to 46%. Plan ranking varied depending on the guideline measure used. The plan with the lowest aggregate proportion of children who had asthma controller prescriptions (66%) had regional proportions that ranged widely, from 44% to 72%. Some plans were observed to rank highly in performance in 1 region and substantially lower in other regions; similar within-plan regional variation was found for each outcome measure.Assessments of adherence to Medicaid pediatric asthma management guidelines at the plan level may be insufficient to identify opportunities for improvement. Administrative claims-based profiles of plan performance that are sensitive to regional variations in plan characteristics may be particularly useful in isolating and prioritizing quality-improvement opportunities.",

Study design Semistructured qualitative interviews and survey. Methods We drew a stratified random sample of 40 multispecialty California POs (25% of the POs that were eligible for incentives). In-person interviews were conducted with physician leaders and a survey was administered on actions being taken to reduce costs and redesign care and to discuss the challenges to improving value. We performed a thematic analysis of interview transcripts to identify common actions taken and challenges to reducing costs. Results VBP helps to promote care delivery transformation among POs, although efforts varied across organizations. Investments are occurring primarily in strategies to control hospital costs and redesign primary care, particularly for chronically ill patients; specialty care redesign is largely absent. Physician payment incentives for value remain small relative to total compensation, with continued emphasis on productivity. Challenges cited include the lack of a single enterprisewide electronic health records platform for information exchange, limited ability to influence specialists who were not exclusive to the organization, lack of payer cost and utilization data to manage costs, inability to recoup care redesign investments given the small size of VBP incentives, and lack of physician cost awareness. Conclusions Transformation could be advanced by strengthening financial incentives for value; engaging specialists in care redesign and delivering value; enhancing partnerships among POs, hospitals, and payers to align quality and cost actions; strengthening information exchange across providers; and applying other strategies to influence physician behavior.",

However, little is known about the organizational factors that underlie intersite variation in readmission rates. Evidence from other chronic diseases points to care coordination as one such factor.To understand whether intersite differences in care coordination may be one of the organizational factors contributing to the variation in readmission rates, we examined provider perspectives on COPD care at Veterans Affairs (VA) sites.In this mixed-methods positive deviance study, we selected 3 VA sites in the lowest quartile and 3 in the highest quartile for 2016 risk-adjusted COPD readmission rates. During June to October 2017, we conducted semistructured interviews with primary and specialty care providers involved in COPD care at VA sites with low (n = 14) and high (n = 11) readmission rates.Although providers at all sites referenced ongoing readmission reduction initiatives, only providers at low-readmission sites described practice environments characterized by high relational coordination (ie, high-quality work relationships and high-quality communication). They also reported fewer significant structural barriers to collaboration in areas like patient volume.The most notable differences between high- and low-readmission sites were related to the quality of relational coordination and the presence of structural barriers to coordination, rather than specific readmission reduction initiatives. Implementing organizational reforms aimed at enhancing relational coordination and removing structural barriers would enhance care for COPD and may improve quality of care for other chronic conditions.",

We termed this new algorithm the NYU/JHU-EDA. We then compared visit distributions across these 2 algorithms and 2 other previous revised versions of the NYU-EDA using our 2 data sources.Applying the newly developed NYU/JHU-EDA, we classified 99% of visits. Based on our analyses, it is evident that an even greater number of US ED visits than categorized by the NYU-EDA are nonemergent. For the first time, we provide a more complete picture of the level of severity among patients treated for injuries within US hospital EDs, with about 86% of such visits being nonsevere. Also, both the original and updated classification tools suggest that, of the 38% of ED visits that are clinically emergent, the majority either do not require ED resources or could have been avoided with better primary care.The updated NYU/JHU-EDA taxonomy appears to offer cogent retrospective inferences about population-level ED utilization.",

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study. METHODS Patients with colorectal cancer were identified from the Florida Inpatient Discharge Database. Distance traveled from primary residence to surgical facility was estimated using zip code. After adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, multivariate regression models compared bypassed hospitals, the length of stay, and complication rates for patients traveling different distances to receive care. RESULTS Patients residing in rural areas and in South (odds ratio [OR], 2.37; 95% CI, 1.55-3.63) and Central Florida (OR, 5.86; 95% CI, 3.86-8.89) were more likely to travel more than 50 miles for treatment. Teaching status of the hospital (OR, 9.99; 95% CI, 6.98-14.31), a hospital's availability of a colorectal surgeon (OR, 1.83; 95% CI, 1.45-2.31), and metastasized cancer (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.17-1.82) influenced the patient's decision to travel farther for treatment. Length of stay was significantly higher for patients traveling farther (P   50 miles vs < 25 miles [P = .4516]). CONCLUSIONS A greater number of patients travel more than 50 miles to the surgical facility at a later stage of disease. These patients do not significantly differ from those traveling less than 50 miles in their rates of complications; however, they stay longer at the surgical facility.",

Factors associated with PCP referral to nephrology were assessed in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs) less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2.Electronic health record review at an integrated health care network.Factors associated with referral status were identified using Fisher's exact tests, t tests, and multivariable logistic regression.Of 133,913 patients regularly seeing PCPs between October 2017 and September 2019, 1119 had a final eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 and were not on renal replacement therapy. Care was provided by 185 PCPs (61 practices). Analyses were restricted to the 97.1% (n = 1087) of patients who were African American or European American. Of these, 54.6% had not been referred to nephrology. Nonreferred patients had higher numbers of PCP visits (P = .004). In contrast, referred patients were younger, were more often African American, and had PCPs at the academic medical center (all P < .0001). Referred patients had more complex medical histories with higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores, more hospitalizations, and greater numbers of inpatient days (all P < .0001). Analyses restricted to patients with serum creatinine concentration of at least 2 mg/dL yielded similar results. Age, number of hospitalizations, ancestry, academic physician, diabetic end-organ damage, peripheral vascular disease, and tumor status were independent predictors of nephrology referral.Impediments to appropriately timed nephrology referrals persist in patients with high likelihoods of progression to end-stage kidney disease. Improved access to nephrology care should be rapidly addressed to meet targets in the 2019 Executive Order on Advancing American Kidney Health.",

Educational ObjectivesUpon completion of this activity, participants will be able to: • Classify the pathophysiology, etiology, prognosis, and quality of life burden associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).• Explore the current treatment landscape, updated safety and efficacy data, and new and emerging therapies for PAH.• Identify the costs associated with PAH and opportunities to slow progression and improve outcomes in this patient population.

The evaluation focused on care coordination, quality, health service utilization, and costs in patients with heart failure, coronary heart disease, heart rhythm disorders, and/or valvular heart disease (disease cohorts). Multivariable regression models were used to adjust for differences in patient characteristics between the groups.Across all disease cohorts, participation in the collaborative care program was associated with better care coordination and improved quality in a broad range of indicators (pharmacotherapy and vaccination). Results showed lower emergency service utilization and hospitalizations, lower consultation frequencies with GPs and specialists, and a shift from inpatient to outpatient procedures. Program participation resulted in higher costs for outpatient cardiologist treatment, but disease-specific costs were lower overall.The results underline evidence that health care service programs that strengthen collaboration between GPs and cardiologists can substantially improve the care of patients with chronic cardiac conditions while simultaneously reducing costs.",

    "abstract": "Patient-centered care, defined as providing care that is respectful of, and responsive to, individual patient preferences, needs and values, and ensuring that patient values guide all clinical decisions, is advocated by clinicians and professional organizations and is part of a composite criterion for augmented reimbursement for various health care settings, including patient-centered medical homes. Despite general agreement that patient-centered care is a good idea and worthy of incentivization, patient-centered care is difficult to assess accurately, scalably, and feasibly. In this commentary, we suggest that assessment of patient-centered care may be improved by identifying circumstances that indicate its probable absence-in particular, by flagging probable discordance between a patient's preferences and their treatment care plan. One potential marker of this discordance is persistent lack of control of a comorbid condition that is easily controllable by existing therapies and where existing therapies are sufficiently diverse to be compatible with a wide range of patient preferences (eg, stage 1 hypertension, type 2 diabetes with glycated hemoglobin < 8.5%). We outline how this approach may be tested, validated, and harmonized with existing quality improvement activities.",

This study assessed change in community clinic patients' CVD risk management during the COVID-19 pandemic and CVD risk factor control among patients who had primarily in-person or primarily VC visits. Study Design: Retrospective interrupted time- series analysis. Methods: Data came from an electronic health record shared by 52 community clinics for index (March 1, 2019, to February 29, 2020) and follow-up (July 1, 2020, to February 28, 2022) periods. Analyses compared follow-up period changes in slope and level of population monthly means of 10-year reversible CVD risk score, blood pressure (BP), and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) among patients whose completed follow-up period visits were primarily in person vs primarily VC. Propensity score weighting minimized confounding. Results: There were 10,028 in-person and 6593 VC patients in CVD risk analyses, 9874 in-person and 5390 VC patients in BP analyses, and 8221 in-person and 4937 VC patients in HbA1c analyses. The VC group was more commonly younger, female, White, and urban. Mean reversible CVD risk, mean systolic BP, and percentage of BP measurements that were 140/90 mm Hg or higher increased significantly from index to follow-up periods in both groups. Rate of change between these periods was the same for all outcomes in both groups, regardless of care modality. Conclusions: Among community clinic patients with CVD risk, receiving a majority of care in person vs a majority of care via VC was not significantly associated with longitudinal trends in reversible CVD risk score or key CVD risk factors.",

Comfort with prediction of bill payment and missed appointments was especially low (21.6% and 36.6%, respectively). Comfort was higher with clinical predictive models, such as predicting stroke in an emergency (55.8%). Experiences of discrimination were significant negative predictors of comfort with administrative predictive models. Health system transparency around privacy policies was a significant positive predictor of comfort with both clinical and administrative predictive models. Conclusions: Patients are more comfortable with clinical applications of predictive models than administrative ones. Privacy protections and transparency about how health care systems protect patient data may facilitate patient comfort with these technologies. However, larger inequities and negative experiences in health care remain important for how patients perceive administrative applications of prediction.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Health inequities are frequently driven by social determinants of health (SDOH) and structural determinants of health. Our pilot sought to test the feasibility of screening for health literacy (HL) and perceived health care discrimination (PHD) through a live telephonic-facilitated survey experience with managed care patients. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Newly enrolled Medicare Advantage patients were screened for self-reported PHD, HL, and multiple SDOH using validated screening tools. Response rates for both HL and PHD screens were analyzed. A χ2 test for association between response to PHD screen and patient race was conducted. A weighted logistic regression model was used to understand how HL is associated with SDOH and demographic factors (age, gender, race/ethnicity, and income). Results: HL and PHD screening questions have different levels of feasibility. Administering the HL screen did not present a challenge, and patients felt comfortable responding to it. On the other hand, the PHD question had a lower response rate among patients, and some concierge advocates felt uncomfortable asking patients the question. Based on the self-reported HL data collected, low/limited HL is associated with patients who were Black, were low income, reported loneliness or isolation, or reported food insecurity. It is important to note that the study’s findings are limited by the small sample size and that study results do not imply causality. Conclusions: It is feasible to collect self-reported HL data through a live telephonic format at the time of patient enrollment into a health plan. Health plans can leverage such screenings to better understand patient barriers for health equity–oriented interventions.",

The degree of file overlap is low, with only 16.3% of hospital–billing code observations appearing in both data sources. However, for the observations that overlap, pricing concordance is high: Corresponding prices have a correlation coefficient of 0.975, 77.4% match to the penny, and 84.4% are within 10%. Exact price matching rates are greater than 90% for 3 of the 4 service lines included in this study.

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by a progressive decline in lung function, worsening quality of life, and high mortality. However, the rate and pattern of progression of IPF are variable. Real-world studies, which include a broader population of patients than clinical trials and collect data over longer periods, have provided important information on the clinical course of IPF and further insights into the efficacy and safety of antifibrotic therapies. They also highlight the worsening of patients' quality of life as lung function is lost, the high frequency of hospitalizations, and the impact of acute exacerbations on mortality in patients with IPF. Data from patient registries and analyses of claims data suggest that antifibrotic therapy is more likely to be used in patients who have worse lung function and that its use is associated with an improvement in life expectancy. The safety profile of antifibrotic therapies in real-world populations is consistent with that observed in clinical trials. Further real-world studies are needed to improve understanding of the course and impact of IPF in specific groups of patients and how the care provided to these patients might be improved.",

Several sets of criteria have been proposed for the identification of PPF, most of which are based on a combination of a decline in forced vital capacity, worsening of respiratory symptoms, and increase in the extent of fibrosis on radiology. Although some risk factors for faster progression of fibrosing ILD have been identified, it remains challenging to predict which individuals will develop PPF. Close monitoring, including regular pulmonary function tests, is required to detect the earliest signs of worsening disease. PPF is associated with high rates of hospitalization and death. Management of PPF requires a multidisciplinary and multimodal approach, including pharmacological therapy and supportive care. Discussions about palliative care should begin at an early stage, individualized to the needs of the patient.",

Study design We conducted an Internet-based contingent valuation survey of 1802 obese persons eligible for bariatric surgery but who had not undergone the procedure. Methods We used multivariate regression analysis to separately estimate the likelihood of having gastric bypass and gastric banding surgery at different out-of-pocket costs. We combined the results with estimates of the privately insured bariatric surgery-eligible population from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2002, to estimate aggregate demand. Results Out-of-pocket cost was negatively and highly significantly related to the self-reported likelihood of having surgery. Persons with higher incomes and younger persons also reported a significantly higher likelihood of surgery. No effect was found for body mass index or for most comorbidities. We estimate that about 150 000 bariatric operations per year would be demanded by those with private health insurance at an out-of-pocket cost of USD 25 000. At USD 5000, we estimate a demand of 250 000 bariatric operations per year. Conclusions Price is significantly and negatively related to the demand for bariatric surgery. At an out-of-pocket cost of USD 5000, about 2.2% of the bariatric surgery-eligible population would strongly consider surgery.",

Its economic burden is enormous, and the estimated direct and indirect costs of the disease in 2006 exceeded $400 billion. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is recognized as a major cause of coronary heart disease and other clinical forms of atherosclerotic disease, and an elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level remains the primary target of lipid-lowering therapy. Recent retrospective evidence points to deficiencies in the management of patients with atherosclerosis in the clinical practice setting. Enhancing awareness of the need to monitor and treat dyslipidemia in atherosclerosis, and of the benefits of such treatment reported in recent studies, may help to narrow this treatment gap. This review will examine the development of atherosclerosis and the role atherosclerosis plays in the underlying pathophysiology of CV disease. Imaging methods for assessing progression of atherosclerosis and new recommendations for risk-reduction therapy in patients with established atherosclerotic vascular disease are discussed.

METHODS We collected individual clinician accounts of experiences with and perceptions about Part D plans when medications were switched for nonmedical reasons, including diseases that clinicians believed were most medically risky for switching with nursing home residents and the common health outcomes of switching. Publisher HCPro's long-term care readership database was used to reach survey participants. Individuals were classified by clinician type and then e-mailed an invitation to take these electronically disseminated surveys in September 2007. RESULTS A total of 569 total case histories representing 555 nursing homes were collected. About three-quarters of the case histories collected showed decreased efficacy after a nonmedical switch for Part D beneficiaries. Switching for those with hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, HIV, and bipolar disorder, among other diseases, was considered most medically risky in this population. CONCLUSION Nurses, physicians, and pharmacists who shared their perceptions regarding the effect of nonmedical switching in long-term care settings reported situations in which switching increased administrative time, increased side effects, and appeared to have increased downstream costs to plans.",

Results An essential element of efficiency is that healthcare outputs are as large as possible given their inputs. An efficiency measure specifies outputs and inputs appropriate to the goals of the assessment. Participants in the healthcare system have differing perspectives about the goals of efficiency assessments, relevant outputs and inputs, and validity of measures. Conclusion The broad meaning and the value of healthcare efficiency seem uncontroversial, yet any particular application may be confronted with conflicting perspectives and with practical challenges.",

Among visits made by women of childbearing age that included Pap tests, 76.0% occurred in obstetrics and gynecology offices or clinics. Using a simple projection model, we estimated an overall annual decrease of 1.2 million Pap tests for young women aged 15 to 26 years and a corresponding cost reduction of $77.6 million after routine HPV vaccination and HPV DNA testing. Among female subjects 15 years and older, the estimated potential decrease in Pap tests was 6.3 million, with an estimated $403.8 million in cost reduction.The NAMCS and NHAMCS provide baseline data to estimate the effects of HPV vaccination and HPV DNA testing on cervical cancer screening policy. These future technologies may result in changes to cervical cancer screening policies and, when fully accepted and implemented, may reduce economic costs associated with cervical cancer in the United States.",

New work processes, governance structures, and relationships are needed for the coevolution of healthcare markets and business models. But coevolution is slow, hindered by the scarcity of incentives for legacy delivery systems and constrained by the prevailing patient-healthcare paradigm. The greater opportunity lies in wellness for individuals, families, communities, and society at large: a consumer-community paradigm. Capturing new value from this opportunity can start with investment in health information exchange and the creation of Smart Health Communities. By shifting the focus of exchange from public servant to value-added service provider, these communities can serve as a platform for a wider array of wellness services from consumer care, traditional healthcare, and research.",

STUDY DESIGN Prospective observational cohort study of a convenience sample of employees from 3 large US employers. Participants had at least 1 child (< or = 17 years) living in their household for at least 4 days per week. METHODS Each month from November 2007 to April 2008, employees completed Web-based surveys regarding acute respiratory illness in their household. In the final survey, employees were presented with descriptions of influenza and questions regarding their willingness to pay to prevent influenza. Factors associated with willingness to pay were examined using multivariate ordinary least squares regression analysis of the log of willingness to pay. RESULTS Among 2006 employees, 31.3% were female, the mean age was 41.7 years, 85.3% were of white race/ethnicity, and the mean household size was 4.0. Employees' median (mean) willingness to pay to prevent influenza was $25 ($72) for themselves, $25 ($82) for their adult household members, and $50 ($142) (P <.01) for children. However, influenza vaccination rates were approximately equal for children (27.5%), employees (31.5%), and other adult household members (24.5%). This finding may be explained by barriers such as cost, dislike of vaccinations, and disagreement with national influenza vaccination recommendations, which were significantly associated with lower willingness to pay for prevention of influenza (P <.05). CONCLUSION Employees expressed a stronger preference to prevent influenza in their children than in themselves or other household members; however, modifiable barriers depress vaccination rates.",

This study examined gender differences and clinical, social, and lifestyle correlates in healthcare use.The multiwave web-based survey collected self-reported measures from a national sample of newly separated military veterans.Multivariable analysis weighted to represent the sampling frame and account for attrition at follow-up examined the association between gender and self-reported healthcare utilization overall and in the VHA.In fall 2016, veterans within approximately 90 days post military separation provided baseline data and completed a follow-up survey a year later, representing a cohort of 49,865. Sleep problems, anxiety, and depression were associated with healthcare use for both men and women following transition. Women were twice as likely as men to use healthcare in general but equally likely to use VHA care. For women veterans, unstable housing at separation was associated with less healthcare use a year later, especially for the subgroup with mental/behavioral health issues.US veterans separating from military service need expert care, both in the VHA and elsewhere, for anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbance. Women veterans may be underserved by the VHA and may benefit from housing assistance programs to enable ongoing healthcare use.",

    "abstract": "Oncology biologics are one of the fastest-growing segments of pharmaceutical development, bringing more options to patients, including those with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. The advent of multiple oncology biosimilars is affecting this patient population, as 5 trastuzumab biosimilars had been FDA approved as of the end of 2019; only 2, however, have been commercially marketed. Trastuzumab serves as the foundation for treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugates have been developed to enhance efficacy, improve safety, and/or create more convenient administration. Three biologic drug entities have been approved using trastuzumab, including 2 antibody-drug conjugates and a subcutaneous trastuzumab formulation that includes hyaluronidase. More products are being developed, so biosimilars and other HER2-targeted therapies may further disrupt the biologic market. Many challenging questions surround the adoption of oncology biosimilars, including regulatory pathways, efficacy, safety, cost-benefit, and comparability. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act established an abbreviated regulatory approval pathway for biosimilars to create a catalyst for innovation and competition in the biologics market and to lower the costs of biologics. Challenges to adoption of therapeutic oncology biosimilars continue in the United States and include a lack of directed education to providers and patients, residual concerns regarding efficacy and safety, and practices including \"pay-for-delay.\" The uptake of oncology biosimilars is also affected by multiple issues stemming mainly from cost of care, including drug cost, patient access, formulary inclusion, and treatment management algorithms. Managed care organizations and payers need to be familiar with the biosimilar approval process, the concerns of stakeholders (eg, providers and patients), and factors influencing HER2-directed therapies, including the use of biosimilars and antibody-drug conjugates in today's market.",

    "abstract": "Activity OverviewChronic cough is the most common symptom for which individuals seek medical advice.This health issue has a substantial impact on a person's quality of life and can produce complications such as vomiting, fractures, muscle pain, syncope, and depression.Pharmacists and managed care professionals should recognize the complicated etiology of chronic cough and its difficult management.As there are currently no available therapies specifically indicated for this, the emerging treatment options that are targeted for patients with chronic cough have the promising potential to fulfill unmet needs in this population.They will resolve or minimize the significant burden on healthcare resources, families, work, and school, and improve patients' overall health. Statement of Educational NeedChronic cough is a highly debilitating condition that can result from multiple etiologies or is sometimes due to unknown causes.Further, there are no FDA-approved agents at this time that specifically address chronic cough.Combined with a lack of robust efficacy for agents used to treat acute cough, there is a significant unmet need for efficacious agents that provide relief for patients with chronic cough.To address these concerns, new agents with novel mechanisms of action are in development and, if found safe and effective, could become available in the United States.Therefore, healthcare professionals require continuing professional education and application of this knowledge to improve chronic cough management, clinical decision making, and the quality of life among patients affected. Educational ObjectivesAt the completion of this activity, participants will be able to:• Examine the etiologies of chronic cough, the burden, and the pathophysiology.• Explain the treatment options for chronic cough including the emerging therapies.• Identify opportunities to improve the management of chronic cough from a payer and patient perspective, as well as to integrate new treatments into the existing treatment algorithm.

    "abstract": "In the United States, approximately 12 million individuals seek medical care for pharyngitis each year, accounting for about 2% of ambulatory care visits. Although the gold standard for diagnosing group A streptococcus (GAS) is culture, it is time intensive. Rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) with or without culture confirmation are commonly used instead. Although RADT provide results quickly, they generally have lower test sensitivity. Recently, point-of-care nucleic acid amplification tests (POC NAAT) have emerged. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness and budget impact to the US payer of adopting POC NAAT.This study was a cost-effectiveness analysis, with costs and outcomes calculated via a decision tree.A decision-tree model quantified costs and outcomes associated with a GAS diagnostic strategy using POC NAAT compared with RADT + culture confirmation. Model inputs were derived from the published literature. Model outputs included costs and clinical effects: quality-adjusted life-days lost, GAS and antibiotic complications, number of patients appropriately treated, and antibiotic utilization. Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed.Base-case analysis projected that a POC NAAT strategy would cost $44 per patient compared with $78 for RADT + culture. Compared with RADT + culture, POC NAAT would increase the number of appropriately treated patients and avert unnecessary use of antibiotics. The budget impact of POC NAAT was -0.4% relative to current budget over 5 years. Findings were robust in sensitivity analyses.Our results suggest that POC NAAT would be less costly and more effective than RADT + culture; POC NAAT adoption may yield cost savings to US third-party payers. Access to POC NAAT is important to optimize GAS diagnosis and treatment decisions in the United States.",

STUDY DESIGN: Secondary data analysis using dual-eligible enrollment data and health care workforce data. METHODS: We determined the density of dual-eligible beneficiaries per 1000 population in 2017 for each of 3142 US counties. County-level supply of primary care physicians (PCPs), primary care nurse practitioners, and physician assistants was determined. RESULTS: One-third of the 791 counties with the highest density of dual-eligible beneficiaries had PCP shortages. Counties with the highest density of dual-eligible beneficiaries and the fewest primary care clinicians of any type were concentrated in Southeastern states. These areas also had some of the highest coronavirus disease 2019 outbreaks within their states. CONCLUSIONS: States in the Southeastern region of the United States with some of the most restrictive scope-of-practice laws have an inadequate supply of primary care providers to serve a high concentration of dual-eligible beneficiaries. The fragmented care of the dually eligible population leads to extremely high costs, prompting policy makers to consider integrated delivery models that emphasize primary care.

The \"MSR\" cohort included those who received their first-ever MSR in 2018 and received another MSR in 2019. The \"failed to engage\" (FTE) cohort included beneficiaries who were targeted in both 2018 and 2019 but did not engage in an MSR at any point through the end of 2019. For both cohorts, we calculated the change from 2018 to 2019 for each outcome and then determined whether unadjusted year-over-year changes differed significantly between cohorts. Additionally, these difference-in-differences (DiD) analyses were adjusted for baseline MRS and multimorbidity.A total of 11,436 beneficiaries were targeted for MSRs in both 2018 and 2019. Beneficiaries were, on average, aged 76.6 ± 10.0 years. The MSR cohort (N = 4384) outperformed the FTE cohort (N = 7052) in total medical costs (DiD = $958/y [7.5% savings]; P = .042), hospitalizations (DiD = 3.9 admissions/100 beneficiaries/y [10% reduction]; P = .032), ED visits (DiD = 6.2 visits/100 beneficiaries/y [10% reduction]; P = .014), and mortality (2.1% fewer died in 2019; P < .001). Each outcome remained significant after adjusting for baseline MRS and multimorbidity.MSRs were effective at improving annual health care costs, hospitalizations, ED visits, and mortality in Medicare beneficiaries targeted according to MRS.",

This study aimed to describe treatment patterns and treatment initiation after initial CKD diagnosis among patients with T2D.Retrospective analysis using data from the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart administrative claims database (January 2014-September 2018).Adult patients with T2D entered the cohort if they met the criteria for CKD, defined as 2 laboratory test results 90 to 365 days apart (January 2014-September 2017) indicating CKD. Included were patients with no prior use of ACEis or ARBs or evidence of kidney disease in the 365 days prior to cohort entry (baseline). Patients were followed for a maximum of 365 days and were censored on death, disenrollment, or end of data. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and medication use were assessed at baseline, and treatments were assessed over a 1-year followup period. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with ACEi or ARB initiation.Among 15,400 eligible patients without prior ACEi or ARB treatment, only 17% initiated such therapy within a year after meeting CKD criteria. Patients who were White, resided in the northeastern United States, had more comorbidities, had less advanced albuminuria, or used sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors were less likely to initiate treatment.A large proportion of patients with T2D meeting criteria for CKD do not initiate the recommended therapy within 1 year of CKD diagnosis, highlighting a need for new therapies that can slow the progression of CKD.",

    "abstract": "Health care payers are increasingly experimenting with interventions to address social risk factors. With enactment of the 2018 Bipartisan Budget Act, Medicare Advantage (MA) plans have new opportunities to offer supplemental benefits that are not \"primarily health-related.\" This article presents findings from interviews conducted with executives from MA plans regarding plan decision-making processes related to new social risk factor benefits.Semistructured qualitative interviews with MA plan leadership.A total of 63 plan representatives from 29 unique MA plans were interviewed about the rationale for social risk-related interventions and how data are used to inform benefits expansion decisions. This paper combines qualitative interview data from 2 separate studies with similar target groups and interview guides. Interview transcripts were qualitatively analyzed to examine underlying themes.Three main themes emerged: (1) Plans use multiple data sources to determine how to target benefits; (2) evidence gaps hinder decision-making to expand or offer new supplemental benefits; and (3) in the absence of sufficient evidence, some plans have their own research and quality improvement processes to maximize effectiveness.Findings provide insights about opportunities and challenges that MA plans face in making decisions related to supplemental benefits designed to address members' social risk factors. Barriers include collecting, generating, and analyzing data critical to informing investments. Results highlight the need to ensure interoperability of new and existing data sources, foster shared learning opportunities, and narrow evidence gaps about specific social care interventions to inform the design and implementation of effective supplemental benefits.",

We link the administrative data, which include details on salary and other benefit choices, to each employee in each year with medical claims. Our variables of interest include medical spending and utilization outcomes grouped into different care settings.Using multivariate regressions, we estimate the association between salary buckets and health care utilization and spending, controlling for demographic characteristics, comorbidities of employees, human resource health plan benefits, and geography.Employees earning less than $75,000 show lower rates of utilization and spending on preventive measures, such as outpatient visits and prescription drugs, while having higher rates of utilization of preventable and avoidable emergency department visits and inpatient stays, resulting in lower overall health care spending among lower-salary employees.Low-salary employees enrolled in HDHPs have higher rates of acute care utilization and spending but lower rates of primary care spending compared with high-salary employees. Results suggest that HDHPs discourage routine physician-patient care among low-salary employees.",

We used inductive and deductive approaches informed by a health care innovation adoption model to identify themes in the qualitative data.Twenty rural hospital CFOs and other hospital administrators from 10 states participated in interviews. Seventeen (85%) represented critical access hospitals and 3 (15%) represented short-term acute care hospitals. Although CFOs believed telehealth has some financial advantages (eg, can help to avoid patient transfers), they did not believe that telehealth improved their hospitals' financial situations. CFOs, rather, seem motivated to implement telehealth services to improve quality of care and address patients' needs. CFOs reported that limited reimbursement, low volumes, preference for in-person care, and insufficient broadband were key challenges to telehealth's financial viability.Understanding how CFOs think about the return on investment of telehealth can inform efforts to promote telehealth utilization in rural communities and to develop policy solutions to make telehealth more sustainable. CFOs may benefit from guidance on promising practices and cost-effective implementation strategies. Policy makers could take steps to improve telehealth's financial attractiveness (eg, through payment parity, subsidies to improve technology infrastructure).",

    "abstract": "Despite available technology and supportive evidence in the literature, the integration of telemedicine interventions in the US health care system has remained sluggish for decades. The COVID-19 pandemic catalyzed widespread utilization of virtual visits and remote monitoring in urgent, primary, and specialist care settings out of sheer necessity. Specifically, in the rheumatology subspecialty, a lack of available providers and a patient community hindered by mobility and access issues have underscored the value of telemedicine. For these reasons, a solutions-focused, multistakeholder virtual roundtable meeting convened by the Frances Hamburger Institute for Community Rheumatology (FHI) identified telemedicine as a critical area for intervention to improve the quality and cost-effectiveness of patient-centered care. Building upon stakeholder experience and published findings, the Patient-Centered Rheumatology Collaborative identified the continued deregulation of policy barriers and the facilitation of sustainable coverage and reimbursement as critical steps toward establishing a robust infrastructure for telemedicine post pandemic. FHI roundtable attendees acknowledged several remaining telemedicine access barriers concerning traditionally underserved patient populations that will need to be addressed to realize the full potential of telemedicine. These recommendations are in concordance with those of other recent consensus groups, and they legitimize the formation of collaborative frameworks among payers, providers, and other key stakeholders to advance care in rheumatology.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To (1) track the integration of telehealth- and COVID-19–related apps with electronic health records (EHRs) over time, (2) identify the primary functionality of apps designed to support the COVID-19 response, and (3) examine whether apps available prior to the pandemic added new telehealth- or COVID-19–related functionalities during the pandemic. Study Design: Data were collected from public EHR app galleries on a monthly basis from December 31, 2019, through June 1, 2021. Methods: Apps were identified as relating to COVID-19 or telehealth using text analysis of the app marketing materials. Descriptive analyses were conducted to characterize telehealth- and COVID-19–related apps discovered through the app galleries, identify their primary functionality, and examine whether any apps added new telehealth- or COVID-19–related functionalities during the pandemic. Results: The number of COVID-19–related apps increased from 0 in March 2020 to 19 a month later and continued to grow to 62 as of June 2021. The number of telehealth-related apps more than doubled from prepandemic levels (n = 41) to a total of 87 apps by June 2021. These apps were 2 times more likely to contain specialized capabilities used to support COVID-19 response efforts, such as secure messaging, vaccine administration, and laboratory testing, compared with all apps listed in the EHR app galleries. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the potential of integrating third-party apps into EHRs to expand the range of tools that health care providers can use to diagnose, treat, and communicate with patients.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Many individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are undiagnosed or unaware of the disease and at risk of not receiving services to manage their condition and of \"crashing\" into dialysis. Past studies report higher health care costs among patients with delayed nephrology care and suboptimal dialysis initiation, but they are limited because they focused on patients undergoing dialysis and did not evaluate costs associated with unrecognized disease for patients \"upstream,\" or patients with late-stage CKD. We compared costs for patients with unrecognized progression to late-stage (stages G4 and G5) CKD and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) with costs for individuals with prior CKD recognition. Study Design: Retrospective study of commercial, Medicare Advantage, and Medicare fee-for-service enrollees 40 years and older. Methods: Using deidentified claims data, we identified 2 groups of patients with late-stage CKD or ESKD, one group with prior evidence of CKD diagnosis and the other without, and compared total and CKD-related costs in the first year following late-stage diagnosis between the 2 groups. We used generalized linear models to determine the association between prior recognition and costs and used recycled predictions to calculate predicted costs. Results: Total and CKD-related costs were 26% and 19% higher, respectively, for patients without prior diagnosis compared with those with prior recognition. Total costs were higher both for unrecognized patients with ESKD and unrecognized patients with late-stage disease. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that costs associated with undiagnosed CKD extend to patients not yet requiring dialysis and highlight potential savings from earlier disease detection and management.",

Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: We used the Humana Research Database to identify 7026 patients with a diagnosis of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in 2017 who were enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug plan with at least 12 months preindex enrollment, with first ESRD evidence as the index date. Patients with kidney transplant, hospice election, or dialysis preindex were excluded. Transition-to-dialysis planning was defined as optimal (vascular access placed), suboptimal (nephrologist care, but no vascular access), or unplanned (first dialysis in IP stay or ED visit). Results: The cohort was 41% female and 66% White, with a mean age of 70 years. Optimally planned, suboptimally planned, and unplanned transition to dialysis occurred for 15%, 34%, and 44% of the cohort, respectively. Among patients with preindex chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3a and 3b, 64% and 55%, respectively, had an unplanned dialysis transition. For patients with preindex CKD stages 4 and 5, 68% and 84%, respectively, had a planned transition. In adjusted models, patients with a suboptimally or optimally planned transition were 57% to 72% less likely to die, 20% to 37% less likely to experience an IP stay, and 80% to 100% more likely to experience an ED visit than patients with an unplanned dialysis transition. Conclusions: A planned transition to dialysis was associated with reduced odds of IP stays and lower mortality.",

Each patient in the experimental group received 7 home visits along with 24/7 telephone counseling services throughout the first 6 weeks after discharge, and patients were provided physical care, training, and counseling services during these home visits with the collaboration of their physician.Home care resulted in better self-efficacy and fewer symptoms in the experimental group (P < .05), and it also reduced readmissions to the hospital in the experimental group (23.3%) compared with the control group (46.7%).This study's findings suggest that home care, with a focus on continuity of care, decreases symptoms and readmissions to the hospital and improves the self-efficacy of patients after cardiac surgery.",

We examined health system– and physician practice–level capabilities associated with adoption of (1) patient engagement strategies and (2) chronic care management processes for adult patients with diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease. Study Design: We analyzed data collected from the National Survey of Healthcare Organizations and Systems, a nationally representative survey of physician practices (n = 796) and health systems (n = 247) (2017-2018). Methods: Multivariable multilevel linear regression models estimated system- and practice-level characteristics associated with practice adoption of patient engagement strategies and chronic care management processes. Results: Health systems with processes to assess clinical evidence (β = 6.54 points on a 0-100 scale; ,P, = .004) and with more advanced health information technology (HIT) functionality (β = 2.77 points per SD increase on a 0-100 scale; ,P, = .03) adopted more practice-level chronic care management processes, but not patient engagement strategies, compared with systems lacking these capabilities. Physician practices with cultures oriented to innovation, more advanced HIT functionality, and with a process to assess clinical evidence adopted more patient engagement strategies and chronic care management processes. Conclusions: Health systems may be better able to support the adoption of practice-level chronic care management processes, which have a strong evidence base for implementation, compared with patient engagement strategies, which have less evidence to guide effective implementation. Health systems have an opportunity to advance patient-centered care by expanding practice-level HIT functionality and developing processes to appraise clinical evidence for practices.",

Vaccine hesitancy is a primary contributor and may be influenced by health literacy (HL). This study assessed the association between HL and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in a population residing in 14 Southern states.Cross-sectional study using a web-based survey conducted between February and June 2021.The outcome was vaccine hesitancy, and the main independent variable was HL, assessed as an index score. Descriptive statistical tests were performed, and multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted, controlling for sociodemographic and other variables.Of the total analytic sample (n = 221), the overall rate of vaccine hesitancy was 23.5%. Vaccine hesitancy was more prevalent in those with low/moderate HL (33.3%) vs those with high HL (22.7%). The association between HL and vaccine hesitancy, however, was not significant. Personal perception of COVID-19 threat was significantly associated with lower odds of vaccine hesitancy compared with those without perception of threat (adjusted odds ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.73; P = .0189). The association between race/ethnicity and vaccine hesitancy was not statistically significant (P = .1571).HL was not a significant indicator of vaccine hesitancy in the study population, suggesting that general low rates of vaccination in the Southern region may not be due to knowledge about COVID-19. This indicates a critical need for place-based or contextual research on why vaccine hesitancy in the region transcends most sociodemographic differences.",

Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Using Health Resources and Services Administration 340B Office of Pharmacy Affairs Information System and zip code tabulation area (ZCTA)–level US Census Bureau databases, we created a unique data set that contains covered entities’ characteristics, CP use, and ZCTA-level median household income in 2019 for more than 90,000 pairs of covered entities and CPs. We computed income differences between each pair and for a subset of pairs in which the pharmacy is within 100 miles of the covered entity for both hospitals and federal grantees. Results: On average, median income in the pharmacy’s ZCTA is about 35% higher than in the covered entity’s ZCTA, with little difference between hospitals (36%) and grantees (33%). Roughly 72% of arrangements cover less than 100 miles; in that subset, income is about 27% higher for pharmacy ZCTAs, with little difference between hospitals (28%) and grantees (25%). In more than 50% of arrangements, the median income in the pharmacy’s ZCTA is more than 20% higher than in the covered entity’s ZCTA. Conclusions: CPs serve at least 2 purposes: They can increase low-income patients’ access to medicines directly when a CP is closer to where a covered entity’s patients live, and they can increase profits for covered entities (some of which are potentially passed on to patients) and CPs. We find that in 2019, both hospitals and grantees used CPs to generate income but generally they do not appear to contract with pharmacies located in neighborhoods where low-income patients are likeliest to live. Prior research findings have suggested that hospitals and grantees behave differently from each other with respect to CP use, but results of our analysis suggest the opposite.",

Inadequate reach and utilization of the MDPP threaten its long-term success; thus, the purpose of this project was to determine facilitators and barriers to MDPP implementation and use in western Pennsylvania. Study Design: We conducted a qualitative stakeholder analysis project with suppliers of the MDPP and health care providers. Methods: Using an implementation science framework, we conducted individual interviews with 5 program suppliers and 3 health care providers (N = 8) to determine their perspectives on positive aspects of the program and reasons for MDPP unavailability and lack of use. Data were analyzed using Thorne and colleagues’ approach of interpretive description. Results: Three main themes emerged: (1) facilitators and attributes of the MDPP, (2) barriers to MDPP implementation, and (3) suggestions for improvement. Facilitators of the program included technical support and webinars from Medicare to assist with the application process. Barriers such as financial reimbursement constraints and a lack of a systematic referral process were noted. Stakeholders suggested refinements to participant eligibility and performance-based payments, a seamless method of flagging and referring patients through the electronic health record, and ongoing virtual program delivery options. Conclusions: Findings from this project can be used to improve implementation of the MDPP in western Pennsylvania, support Medicare policy refinement, and inform implementation research to promote broader adoption of the MDPP across the United States.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatally progressive degenerative disease, with many patients succumbing to the condition within 3 to 5 years after diagnosis. It is a rare, orphan disease with an estimated US prevalence of 25,000 patients. Patients with ALS and their caregivers are faced with a substantial financial burden as a result of the condition, as ALS has an estimated national financial burden of $1.03 billion. A significant driver of the patient financial burden includes the continued need for caregiver support as the weakening of muscles progresses to dysphagia and dyspnea, making it difficult to complete activities of daily living as the disease progresses. Caregivers also experience financial burdens, as well as feelings of anxiety, depression, and decreased quality of life. In addition to needed caregiver support, patients with ALS and their families also incur substantial nonmedical costs including travel expenses, home modifications such as ramps, and indirect costs such as productivity loss. Due to the wide range of clinical symptoms that patients may exhibit when first presenting with ALS symptoms, diagnosis is often delayed, which negatively affects patient outcomes and impacts missed opportunity for clinical trial recruitment aimed at developing new disease-modifying therapies. Additionally, delay in diagnosis and referral to ALS treatment centers results in increased overall health care costs. Telemedicine may be a tool used to promote timely care from an ALS treatment center in addition to clinical trial participation for those patients who cannot overcome mobility barriers for care. Currently, 4 therapies are approved for the treatment of ALS. Riluzole has demonstrated modest improvement in survival. Other recently approved therapies include oral edaravone, a combination therapy of sodium phenylbutyrate and taurursodiol (PB/TURSO), and tofersen, which is administered intrathecally and approved under an accelerated approval. Long-term studies have shown PB/TURSO to have a dual benefit on survivaland function. The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) 2022 Evidence Report for ALS does not value the high price points of edaravone and PB/TURSO as cost-effective based on the current evidence, despite valuing the need for new treatment options for this patient population.",

Methods: We analyzed data from Optum's 2019 biannual clinician survey, including a validated burnout measure and measures of provider experience and intent to stay. A 6-item measure of team effectiveness (TEAM) focused on efficiency, communication, continuous improvement, and leadership. Construct validity was assessed with content, reliability, and correlation with burnout. Generalized estimating equations with robust SEs determined relationships among TEAM score, provider experience, and intent to stay, controlling for demographics, clustering, and practice factors. Results: Of 1500 physicians and advanced practice clinicians (1387 with complete data; response rate 56%), there were 58% in primary care; 57% were women, and 38% identified as Asian, Black/Hispanic, or another race/ethnicity other than White non-Hispanic. Burnout was present in 30%.

    "abstract": "Defining a path toward improved heart failure (HF) care is essential, as there is a clear need to improve HF treatment quality, outcomes, and value. This article reviews potential strategies to help improve the quality of HF clinical care and decrease costs. To start, HF phenotyping may be useful in guiding patient treatment, as some phenotypes are associated with higher hospitalization costs and longer length of stay. Identifying and addressing social determinants of health that may be barriers to optimal health may improve management of HF and help to prevent disease progression. In addition, patient-reported outcomes can be useful for evaluating the effectiveness of treatment regimens and assessing which treatments lead to a genuine improvement in quality of life (QOL). Recent innovations in payment reform have seen the implementation of value-based payment (VBP) models over the traditional fee-for-service (FFS) models. FFS models can lead to low-quality care focused on treating illness instead of supporting wellness initiatives. By contrast, VBP models aim to decrease excessive health care costs, thereby increasing incentives to hospitals that deliver high-quality patient care. Further, novel care delivery approaches, such as hospital-at-home and other digital tools, can provide patients with lower-cost care and are associated with improved QOL, including reductions in hospital readmission.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) substantially impacts the health and financial security of an increasing proportion of the US population. It worsens debility and quality of life and may lead to hospitalization and death. HF is a clinical syndrome with diverse symptomatic presentations. Physicians generally divide patients with HF into 2 groups: those with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than or equal to 50% and those with an LVEF less than 49%. This review focuses on the group of patients whose LVEF is greater than or equal to 50%. This classification of HF is referred to as HF with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Few beneficial therapies have been identified for this condition, possibly because of its heterogenous etiologies (eg, myocardial, vascular, metabolic, and other physiologic derangements). Clinicians should focus on diagnosing, treating, and preventing the etiologies that are known to cause HFpEF. Results from a small proportion of randomized controlled trials have shown therapeutic benefit for small molecules, although limited, if any, demonstrated mortality benefit has been noted. More research and investment are needed to decrease the burden of HFpEF and to discover lifesaving treatments for this growing population.",

    "abstract": "Though biologic medications have improved the treatment landscape by providing the solution to many unmet medical needs, biologics cost much more than small-molecule chemical medications. Biosimilars are cost-effective alternatives that are highly similar to originator/reference biologics in terms of efficacy and safety, yet the uptake of biosimilars in the United States has been gradual in part due to provider- and patient-related barriers. To improve biosimilar uptake and adoption, the FDA has established an interchangeable designation for biosimilars. This review discusses the FDA biosimilar and interchangeable biosimilar approval pathway requirements, FDA regulations, and state-specific requirements regarding the dispensing and administration of biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars. For FDA approval, a biosimilar must demonstrate that it is highly similar to the reference product and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the reference biologic and the proposed biosimilar. Interchangeable biosimilars are recommended to undergo additional studies to demonstrate that there is no change in efficacy or safety after 3 switches between the proposed interchangeable biosimilar and the reference product. Most states permit the substitution of a reference product for an interchangeable biosimilar without the approval of the prescribing physician. The time frame required for communication to the prescriber about such substitutions varies by state. This review highlights the importance of understanding the regulation of interchangeable biosimilar products in each state.",

    "abstract": "Adults with a new diagnosis of cancer frequently visit emergency departments (EDs) for disease- and treatment-related issues, although not exclusively. Many cancer care providers have 24/7 clinician phone triage available, but initial recorded phone messages tend to advise patients to go to the nearest ED if they are \"experiencing a medical emergency.\" It is unclear how well patients triage themselves to the optimal site of care.Cross-sectional study of tumor registry records (university patients diagnosed 2008-2018 and safety-net patients diagnosed 2012-2018) identifiably linked to electronic health records and a regional health information exchange.We geoprocessed addresses to calculate driving time distance from the patient's home to the ED. We used mixed-effects regression to predict the diagnosis code-based severity for ED visits within 6 months of diagnosis, clustering visits within patients and hospitals.A total of 39,498 adults made 38,944 ED visits to 67 different hospitals. Patients self-referred for 85.5% of visits and bypassed a median (IQR) of 13 (4-33) closer EDs. Visits closer to home were not significantly more clinically severe; visits were significantly less severe if the patient self-referred (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.97) or they were on weekends (AOR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.99). Reanalyzing within each individual health system also showed similar findings.Adults with cancer infrequently use available clinician advice before visiting the ED and may use factors other than clinical severity to determine their need for emergency care. Future work should explore the challenges that patients face navigating unplanned acute care, including reasons for underusing existing resources.",

We aim to quantify the prevalence and growth of commercial insurers participating in MA within the same state. Study Design: Repeated cross-sectional analysis of Clarivate's Interstudy enrollment data comprising the universe of insurers in the United States from 2015 to 2021. Methods: We calculated the share of employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) enrollees covered by an insurer offering MA in their state in 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2021. We documented this share across states, years, and the state's 2015 tercile. Results: Between 2015 and 2021, the share of ESI enrollees covered by an insurer offering MA in the same state increased from 83.5% to 95.3%. This growth was concentrated in states with initially low rates in 2015 (lowest 2015 state tercile, ≤ 70.5%), in which the share grew from 47.6% to 87.9%. In 2015, 23.5% of states had a share greater than 90.0% compared with 74.5% in 2021. Conclusions: By 2021, almost all ESI enrollees were covered by insurers who participated in MA in the same state. Future research should investigate how insurer participation in MA affects network formation and prices in commercial markets.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Urolithiasis represents a leading cause of emergency department (ED) presentation nationally, affecting approximately 10% of Americans. However, most patients require neither hospital admission nor surgical intervention. This study investigates patient and facility factors associated with potentially avoidable ED visits and their economic consequences. Study Design: Retrospective analysis. Methods: Patients presenting to the ED for index urolithiasis events were selected using Florida and New York all-payer data from the 2016 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project state databases. Avoidable visits were defined as subsequent ED encounters following initial ED presentation that did not result in intervention, admission, or referral to an acute care facility. Utilizing multivariable logistic and linear regression, researchers discerned patient and facility factors predictive of avoidable ED presentations and associated costs. Results: Of the 167,102 ED encounters for urolithiasis, 7.9% were potentially avoidable, totaling $94,702,972 in potential yearly cost savings. Mean encounter-level costs were higher for unavoidable vs avoidable visits ($5885 vs $2098). In contrast, mean episode-based costs were similar for avoidable and unavoidable episodes ($7200 vs $7284). Receiving care in small metropolitan (vs large metropolitan) communities was associated with potentially avoidable visits, whereas increased comorbidities and Hispanic ethnicity were protective against avoidable visits. Conclusions:, The incidence of ED use for subsequent urolithiasis care reveals opportunity for enhanced outpatient availability to reduce hospital-based costs. Several nonclinical factors are associated with potentially avoidable ED visits for urolithiasis, which, if appropriately targeted, may represent an opportunity to reduce health care spending without compromising the quality of care delivery.",

Study Design: Retrospective analysis of the MarketScan Databases. Methods: Adults with T2D using SMBG or initiating CGM between January 2018 and March 2019 were eligible for inclusion. Inclusion criteria were (1) 2 consecutive claims for T2D or 1 claim for T2D and a claim for glucose-lowering therapy, (2) at least 1 pharmacy claim for SMBG strips or CGM sensors, and (3) continuous enrollment for 1 year before and after the index date. Individuals with evidence of CGM in the preindex period, pregnancy, use of rapid-acting insulin or glucagon, type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes, or secondary diabetes at any time during the study period were excluded. SMBG and CGM patients were matched using propensity score, and all-cause HCRU and costs during a 1-year period were compared. Results: A total of 3498 patients were included in each matched cohort. The per-patient per-year (PPPY) all-cause cost was $20,542 in CGM users vs $19,349 in SMBG users (,P, < .001). The PPPY cost of glucose-lowering medication was $6312 in CGM users vs $5606 in SMBG users (,P, < .001). No significant differences in the number of emergency department visits or hospitalizations were observed, but CGM users had more all-cause outpatient visits and office visits with an endocrinologist. Conclusions: In adults with nonintensively managed T2D, SMBG appears to be less costly than CGM and is associated with lower pharmacy costs.",

Capitated managed care rather than noncapitated managed care created the strongest incentives to reduce care; however, even these effects became rather weak during 2004-2005 compared with those in 2000-2001.Managed care and traditional indemnity plans were substantially more similar in their effects on physician incentives to provide care by 2004-2005 than they were just 3 years earlier.

Utilities were based on the European Quality of Life 5-Dimensional data collected in ECHELON-2. Medical resource use and costs were from literature and standard sources.The model predicted that A+CHP extended PFS and OS by 2.92 and 3.38 years, respectively, over CHOP. After incorporating QOL and discounting, A+CHP was associated with 1.79 quality-adjusted life-years gained at a total incremental cost of $159,388, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $89,217. Sensitivity analyses provided ICERs ranging approximately from $57,000 to $138,000. The estimated probability that A+CHP is cost-effective compared with CHOP was 82% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000.Based on the ECHELON-2 trial data, this analysis found A+CHP to be cost-effective for patients with previously untreated CD30-expressing PTCL.",

    "abstract": "Neovascular (or wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects more than 10% of people older than 65 years in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia. It is estimated that about 11 million Americans have some form of AMD, with that number expected to double by 2050. Approximately 20% of patients will advance from a nonneovascular form of the disease to neovascular AMD, which is associated with central visual acuity loss that can result in severe visual impairment and blindness. Improvements in vision preservation and quality of life require regular clinical visits for intravitreal therapy, which, while effective, come at high cost and potential financial strain, often complicated by the fact that most patients with the disease will be covered by Medicare and subject to the regulations and restrictions within their insurance plans. The requirement for frequent treatment also threatens adherence to therapy, and many patients do not follow up clinically as advised. The confluence of high-cost drug therapy and growing demand for treatment of a sight-threatening disease creates a mandate that managed care professionals and payers focus on current and emerging management options in neovascular AMD and on how to administer therapies in both a clinically responsible and cost-effective manner to diminish risk of vision loss and improve overall patient outcomes.",

The patients were provided with non-face-to-face services as needed throughout the 30-day period.The effectiveness of the TCM model was measured using a retrospective propensity score matching design, which allowed for an accurate comparison between those who received TCM and similar ICC Medicare beneficiaries who did not. The analysis utilized Medicare parts A and B claims from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017.Patients who received TCM had lower 30-day readmission rates than those who did not (P < .05).The services provided to ICC Medicare patients through the TCM model may have enhanced the ability to identify problems at an earlier stage, resulting in the prevention of complications and unnecessary utilization of costly health care services.",

Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a frequent complication and is the leading cause of death in patients with SSc. Although economic data are limited, available data suggest that SSc-ILD is associated with significant cost implications. Treatment of SSc-ILD has historically been with immunosuppressive agents. In 2019, however, the treatment landscape expanded with the FDA approval of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor nintedanib. A lack of codified treatment guidelines for patients with SSc-ILD creates significant challenges in improving outcomes at the patient level and, more generally, in reducing disease burden to the health care system. As the treatment landscape continues to evolve, it is likely that to reduce lung volume loss in patients, a combination of immunosuppressive and antifibrotic approaches will need to be used. Additionally, a greater emphasis on risk-stratification strategies may allow for more efficient follow-up, monitoring, and assessment of treatment response.",

Our analytic sample included 8782 adult patients with diabetes with a total of 356,631 encounters.Fixed-effects linear probability models with clustered robust standard errors estimated the association between patients' need for DSME and likelihood of being referred to the service. Models controlled for patients' health status, prior utilization, encounter setting, comorbidity risk scores, the state's expansion of Medicaid, and the count of accredited DSME program sites in the community.Most patient encounters indicated at least 1 type of need for DSME, but less than 7% of those encounters with a documented need resulted in a provider referral. In regression analysis, clinical indicators of need increased the likelihood that patients would be referred to DSME. Patients exhibiting multiple types of need were most likely to be referred to DSME.Although findings indicate that patient need for DSME does improve the likelihood of being referred, provider referral rates were significantly lower than anticipated. Future research should explore barriers to clinical guideline adherence and whether clinical decision support in EHR systems can facilitate provider referrals.",

It is unknown whether there were changes in testosterone marketing practices by pharmaceutical companies following the FDA label warning. Both primary care physicians (PCPs) and non-PCPs prescribe testosterone and are targeted by pharmaceutical marketing representatives to encourage testosterone prescribing. Likewise, pharmaceutical marketing occurs in both urban and rural areas. Our study is the first to examine testosterone marketing practices around the period of the testosterone label warning by physician specialty and rural vs urban primary care service area. In this study, we found that testosterone marketing efforts such as marketing spending per encounter, quarterly marketing spending per physician, and quarterly number of encounters per physician increased among non-PCPs and urban physicians for 4 quarters following an FDA boxed warning in 2015 on testosterone prescriptions. After the black box warning, off-label testosterone advertisements stopped. This reduction in advertising could have made it more attractive for pharmaceutical companies to increase their marketing spending targeting non-PCPs and physicians in urban areas. Understanding responses of pharmaceutical companies to FDA guidelines is important and can help inform future guideline initiatives.",

Federal regulations around Medigap enrollment and pricing are limited to the first 6 months after turning 65 years old. Eight states institute regulations that apply to later enrollment; half use community rating (charging everyone the same premium) and half use both community rating and guaranteed issue (requiring insurers to accept any beneficiary irrespective of health conditions). We examined the impact of state-level Medigap regulations on insurance coverage and health care spending for Medicare beneficiaries.We used a retrospective cohort study design. Using the 2010-2016 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey, we identified beneficiaries with TM only, TM + Medigap, or Medicare Advantage (MA) by state-level Medigap regulations.Outcomes were insurance coverage and health care spending. We used an instrumental variable approach to address endogenous insurance choice. We conducted 2-stage least squares regression while controlling for individual-level characteristics and area-level demographic characteristics. Then we used the recycled prediction methods to predict enrollment and spending outcomes for the 3 state-level Medigap regulation scenarios.Although enrollment in TM only was consistent across regulation scenarios, the scenario with community rating and guaranteed issue had lower Medigap enrollment and higher MA enrollment than the no-regulation scenario. Despite negligible health differences, TM + Medigap beneficiaries had higher Medicare spending than TM-only beneficiaries, suggesting moral hazard.Our findings suggest a link between additional regulations and lower Medigap and higher MA enrollment. Policy makers should consider the potential effects on insurance coverage, premiums, financial protection, and moral hazard when designing Medigap regulations.",

Prior research has not examined the relative rates of resumption of high-value and low-value care. We examined the use of 6 common low-value services that received a D grade from the US Preventive Services Task Force compared with clinically comparable high-value services in a large commercially insured population nationwide from before the pandemic to April 1, 2021. We found that, overall, low-value services and high-value services were disrupted similarly. In aggregate, low-value care declined to 56.2% and high-value care to 53.2% in the initial month of the pandemic (April 2020) relative to baseline (number of visits in 2019 normalized by relevant enrolled population), then rebounded to 83.1% of baseline for low-value services and 95.0% of baseline for high-value services by January 2021. Substantial heterogeneity appeared across clinical contexts, such as prostate cancer screening for men 70 years and older rebounding to 111.8% of baseline and asymptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease screening remaining at 38.5% of baseline in January 2021. This suggests that although, on average, resuming lower-value services may have been perceived to be a lesser priority by providers and patients, the pandemic may have had heterogeneous effects on consumer and provider decision-making along the dimension of clinical value. This enhances our understanding of how disruptions affect the relationship between clinical value and usage of different services and suggests the need for more targeted interventions to reduce low-value care.",

Although many COVID-19 survivors require extensive care after discharge, the degree to which this care contributes to financial stress is unclear. Using national data, we assessed out-of-pocket spending during the 180 days after discharge among patients hospitalized for COVID-19.Retrospective cohort analysis of Optum's deidentified Clinformatics Data Mart, a national database of medical and pharmacy claims.Among privately insured and Medicare Advantage patients hospitalized for COVID-19 between March and June 2020, we calculated median out-of-pocket spending during the 180 days after discharge. For comparison, we repeated this calculation among patients hospitalized for pneumonia.Of 7932 patients with COVID-19 included in analyses, 2061 (26.0%) had private insurance. Among privately insured and Medicare Advantage patients, median (25th-75th percentile) out-of-pocket spending after discharge was $287 ($59-$842) and $271 ($63-$783), respectively. Out-of-pocket spending exceeded $2000 for 10.9% and 9.3% of these patients, respectively. Among privately insured and Medicare Advantage patients hospitalized for pneumonia, median (25th-75th percentile) out-of-pocket spending after discharge was $276 ($62-$836) and $570 ($181-$1466). Out-of-pocket spending exceeded $2000 for 12.1% and 17.2% of these patients, respectively.For most patients hospitalized for COVID-19, postdischarge care may not be a major source of financial stress. Although this is reassuring, our findings also suggest that a sizable minority of COVID-19 survivors have substantial out-of-pocket spending after discharge. These survivors could be particularly vulnerable to financial toxicity if they also receive bills for the hospitalization owing to the expiration of insurer cost-sharing waivers. Insurers should consider this possibility when deciding whether to reinstate cost-sharing waivers for COVID-19 hospitalizations.",

    "abstract": "About 37 million people in the United States have diabetes. Diabetes-related complications are costly and associated with substantial morbidity. By improving glucose control, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can reduce costs due to diabetes-related hospitalizations, hypoglycemia, and diabetic ketoacidosis. However, people of color and low socioeconomic status, populations with disproportionately high prevalence of diabetes, face significant inequity in accessing CGM technology. Potential reasons for CGM inequity include implicit bias and differences in coverage between commercial and government insurance. Recent changes to Medicare CGM eligibility criteria have eliminated blood glucose monitoring requirements. However, cost and CGM coverage requirements remain as barriers to the recommended use of this technology as defined in current clinical practice guidelines. Coverage expansion from durable medical equipment to the pharmacy benefit may improve access. Other strategies to optimize CGM utility overall include integrating CGM data directly into electronic health records for population health management and diabetes control performance measures based on CGM data in value-based contracts (VBCs).

    "abstract": "Objectives:, To examine whether fragmentation of care is associated with worse in-hospital and 90-day outcomes following durable ventricular assist device (VAD) implant. Study Design:, Cohort study. Methods:, This study was conducted using Medicare claims linked to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (Intermacs) among patients undergoing VAD implant between July 2009 and April 2017. Medicare data were used to measure fragmentation of the multidisciplinary care delivery network for the treating hospital, based on providers' history of shared patients within the previous year. STS Intermacs data were used for risk adjustment and outcomes ascertainment. Hospitals were sorted into terciles based on the degree of network fragmentation, measured as the mean number of links separating providers in the network. Multivariable regression was used to associate network fragmentation with 90-day death or infection risk. Results:, The cohort included 5159 patients who underwent VAD implant, with 11.2% dying and 27.6% experiencing an infection within 90 days after implant. After adjustment, a 1-unit increase in network fragmentation was associated with an increase of 0.179 in the probability of in-hospital infection and an increase of 0.183 in the probability of 90-day infection (both ,P, < .05). Similar results were observed in models of the numbers of in-hospital and 90-day infections. Network fragmentation was predictive of the probability of 90-day mortality, although this relationship was not significant after adjustment. Conclusions:, Care delivery network fragmentation is associated with higher in-hospital and 90-day infection rates following durable VAD implant. These networks may serve as novel targets for enhancing outcomes for patients undergoing VAD implant.",

The disease may progress to end-stage renal disease, which is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The National Kidney Foundation recently established clinical practice guidelines to aid in the identification and stratification of CKD. Central to these guidelines is the use of glomerular filtration rate estimation equations. Integrated healthcare systems can use the guidelines to identify patients with CKD early in its course. Early identification allows for timely nephrology referral, institution of measures to slow the progression of CKD, and treatment of CKD-specific complications. Administration of these efforts early in the course of CKD improves subsequent morbidity and mortality of affected patients. By identifying CKD early in its course, patients can be referred to a coordinated case management team that can help administer care. The team can follow up a patient from the early diagnosis of CKD to end-stage renal disease and renal replacement therapy. Finally, continuous quality improvement can be instituted to assist in improving patient care.",

    "abstract": "underresourced. Many randomized controlled trials have shown that system changes improve the care of depressed patients in the primary care setting. These changes include initial assessment of depression diagnostic criteria and severity using standard instruments, tracking and monitoring treatment effectiveness, stepped care for treatment intensification as needed, and relapse prevention. 7-15 Another key role in these trials is a care manager (ideally in the primary care setting) who provides patients with education, support, and care coordination, and facilitates psychiatric consultation and mental health therapy for patients who are not improving. Screening for case-finding could be added to the above list once the rest of the system is in place, as was recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). 16 Compared with other chronic conditions such as diabetes and coronary artery disease, depression care is improving more slowly. Although the present Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) benchmarks may not be ideal for measuring depression care, they provide a national standard for comparison. Mean HEDIS rates for medication adherence for 3 and 6 months and optimal practitioner contacts in 2005 (61%, 45%, and 21%) have changed little since 2001 (57%, 40%, and 20%, respectively) for patients with commercial insurance. 17,18 Mean HEDIS rates for these measures are even lower and have improved less for Medicare and Medicaid patients. While the HEDIS measures for depression care show higher rates of 3- and 6-month medication adherence in Minnesota compared with the nation as a whole, the numbers are not showing improvement in Minnesota. For example, 6-month medication adherence in Minnesota (for all types of insurance) was 49% in 2002, 51% in 2003, and 49% in 2004. 19",

    "abstract": "To understand the value for payers and purchasers of primary care quality measures in an insured population, we conducted a 2-part analysis. In the first part, we reviewed the economic and clinical literature supporting 62 quality metrics spanning primary care that had been proposed for use in a physician recertification program and in a pay-for-performance program. We then ranked these metrics by both economic and clinical evidence of effectiveness. For many of the metrics, there was little clinical or economic support for inclusion in a pay-for-performance program. For the 20 with both clinical and economic evidence of effectiveness, we constructed actuarial models to understand the potential financial effect that attainment of these metrics would have in an insured population, from the perspective of a payer. Of those, 16 were found to be cost-saving in the short term with respect to direct medical costs incurred by payers. This analysis suggests that many recommended primary care quality measures may have little clinical evidence of effectiveness beyond expert opinion, and may provide scant clinical or economic benefit to payers if achieved. A minority, however, may deliver substantial savings in the short term. Given the current emphasis on pay-for-performance and pay-for-reporting programs, and recent studies showing a lack of relationship between measures and clinical/economic value, this analysis informs payers, purchasers, providers, and policymakers about the importance of choosing the right metrics and the methods for collecting them.",

This study evaluates patterns of healthcare utilization, costs, and blood glucose control for patients with diabetes who initiate CSII. Study design Pre-post with propensity-matched comparison design involving commercially insured US adults (aged 18-64 years) with insulin-requiring diabetes who transitioned from MDII to CSII between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2012 (CSII initiators; n = 2539), or who continued using MDI (n = 2539). Methods Medical claims and laboratory results files obtained from a large US-wide health payer were used to construct direct medical expenditures, hospital use, healthcare encounters for hypoglycemia, and mean concentration of glycated hemoglobin (A1C). We fit difference-in-differences regression models to compare healthcare expenditures for 3 years following the switch to CSII. Stratified analyses were performed for prespecified patient subgroups. Results Over 3 years, mean per-person total healthcare expenditures were $1714 (95% confidence interval [CI], $1184-$2244) higher per quarter for CSII initiators compared with matched MDII patients (total mean 3-year difference of $20,565). Compared with matched controls, mean A1C concentrations became lower for CSII initiators by 0.46% in year 2 (P = .0003) and by 0.32% in year 3 (P = .047). CSII initiators also had a higher rate of hypoglycemia encounters in year 1 (P = .002). Conclusions For adults with insulin-requiring diabetes, transitioning from MDII to CSII was associated with modest improvements in A1C but more hypoglycemia encounters and increased healthcare expenditures, without significant improvement in other potentially offsetting areas of healthcare consumption.",

Data on enrollee demographics and screening services from enrollment and claims files were merged with state-year data on co-payment policies and county-level controls from the Area Health Resources File. Participants were nonelderly, nondisabled, nonpregnant women in the recommended age range for each screening service (50-64 years for mammograms; 21-64 years for Pap tests) enrolled in fee-for-service Medicaid. The main independent variable is whether an enrollee faced cost sharing for preventive services. We examined 3 categories of cost sharing: co-payments for all visits, including for preventive services; co-payments for outpatient visits but waived for preventive services; and no co-payments. The main outcome measure was receipt of mammogram or Pap test within a 12-month period.Medicaid enrollees with co-payments for preventive services were less likely to receive both screening mammograms and Pap tests than enrollees in states not requiring cost sharing for preventive services.Co-payments for preventive services discourage breast and cervical cancer screening among Medicaid enrollees. The effect is larger for breast cancer screening, which is costlier and requires an additional visit. Considering this evidence, cost sharing for preventive services may lead to adverse health consequences and greater long-term costs.",

We compared the differential trends of adoption by various characteristics of health systems.We find that the adoption of an EHR certified by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) increased from 73% to 91%. However, in 2016, only 38% of clinics reported having all 16 health IT functionalities included in this study. Small health systems lag behind large systems in ambulatory health IT adoption. Patient-facing functionalities were less likely to be adopted than those oriented toward physicians. Health information exchange capabilities are still low among ambulatory clinics, pointing to the importance of the ONC's recent Promoting Interoperability initiative.The relatively low uptake of health IT functionalities important to care improvement suggests substantial opportunities for further improving adoption of ambulatory health IT even among the current EHR users.",

Data represent 285 PCPs (779 PCP-years) in a large, multispecialty group practice during 2011, 2012, and 2013.PCPs were ranked each year by their number of additional conditions addressed during acute care visits. The top one-third (max-packers) addressed 25.4% more \"other problems\" than expected, while focused PCPs (bottom one-third) addressed 20.3% fewer than expected. Outcomes were resource use, clinical quality metrics, patient-reported experience, physician time using the EHR, and physician productivity. All measures were risk-adjusted to account for patient mix. T tests were used to compare measures.Relative to a focused pattern of care, max-packing was associated with 3.4% lower overall resource use, consistently better scores for the available clinical quality metrics, and comparable patient experience (except for worse wait time ratings). Patients of focused PCPs used 7.3% more specialist services, in terms of costs, than patients of max-packers ($1218 vs $1136; P <.001). Max-packers spent 40 minutes more per clinical day using the EHR. PCPs with less appointment availability and who used a mix of appointment slots were more likely to be max-packers.Max-packing behavior yields desirable outcomes at lower overall cost but involves more conventionally uncompensated PCP time. Alternatives to compensation just for face-to-face visits and using more flexible scheduling may be needed to support max-packing.",

    "abstract": "Objectives Effective communication among health care providers is critically important for patient safety. Handoff of patient care from the operating room (OR) to the intensive care unit (ICU) is particularly prone to errors. The process is more complicated in an academic environment in which junior clinicians are being trained. Standardization of, and training in, transitions of care can be a crucial means to improve patient safety. Study design Pre- and postintervention surveys of health care providers. Methods Based on a workflow analysis and qualitative needs assessments, we developed a 3-step protocol to standardize the handoff of care from the OR to the ICU for adult patients after cardiac surgery and to provide an effective learning environment. The process starts during surgery, continues when the patient leaves the OR, and concludes with the actual face-to-face transfer of care between providers, at the bedside, in the ICU. We conducted pre- and postimplementation surveys among physician trainees and nursing staff regarding their perception of the handoff process. Results We surveyed 42 clinicians before and 33 after implementation of the handoff process. Prior to implementation, most clinicians expressed a need to improve the current process; this perceived need was significantly greater in health care professionals with 4 or fewer years of experience. Post implementation, clinicians saw a significant improvement in information provided, efficiency, relevance to patient care, and psychological safety, a concept in which participants feel accepted and respected in a group setting without fear of negative consequences or judgement. Conclusions Our workflow-oriented, standardized process for handoff of care from the OR to the ICU can improve perceived communication and psychological safety, especially for junior clinicians.",

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective analysis of 78,826 patients from a single tertiary care center between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018. METHODS The patient population was divided between patients discharged before and after noon. Outcomes were analyzed with univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS DBN was independently associated with higher likelihood of LOS above the median (odds ratio [OR], 1.26; 95% CI, 1.18-1.35; P < .001) among medical patients. This association was not seen among surgical patients, in whom DBN was associated with a shorter LOS (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.71-0.86; P < .001). Factors associated with higher LOS in both medical and surgical groups included higher case mix index, Medicaid payer, weekday discharges, and discharge to skilled nursing or rehabilitation facilities. For the variable of readmission, DBN in surgical patients was associated with a lower readmission rate (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.95; P = .008). CONCLUSIONS The finding that DBN was associated with higher LOS among medical patients suggests that some patients may have been able to be safely discharged the evening prior. In patients with surgical diagnoses, DBN was associated with a lower LOS and a lower risk of readmission. Patients with later discharges were more likely to be sent to a rehabilitation center or skilled nursing facility and were more frequently discharged during a weekday. Identification of these factors may help health systems transition patients safely and efficiently out of the hospital.",

Value creation is closely related to participants' behavior. The DART (Dialogue, Access, Risk assessment, Transparency) model is widely used in commercial research because it defines and classifies value co-creation behavior clearly and systematically. However, there is little research using the DART model in the field of health care. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the psychometric properties of a scale measuring patient value co-creation behavior based on the DART model.The Delphi technique was used to determine the scale content with a panel of 17 experts. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 356 outpatients and inpatients of a hospital in Guangzhou, China.Internal consistency reliability and composite reliability (CR) were used to estimate the scale's reliability. Validity was assessed using convergent and discriminant validity.Three rounds of expert consultation were completed before a final consensus was reached regarding scale content. The patient value co-creation behavior scale was composed of 23 items and 4 dimensions. The overall Cronbach's α was 0.934, and the CRs of the 4 DART dimensions were 0.843, 0.872, 0.911, and 0.884, respectively, showing satisfactory reliability. The average variance extracted ranged from 0.473 to 0.659, and the χ2 difference between constrained and free models was significant, indicating convergent and discriminant validity.The scale exhibited acceptable reliability and validity and could serve as an evaluation tool for patient value co-creation behavior.",

Next, we estimate the premium impact of proposed federal policies to address surprise billing, which, by removing provider leverage stemming from the ability to surprise-bill, could reduce in- and out-of-network payments for these services, in turn affecting premiums. Specifically, we model the premium impact of reducing payment for these services (1) by 15% and (2) to 150% of traditional Medicare payment rates.More than 10% of health plan spending is attributable to ancillary and emergency services that commonly surprise-bill. Reducing payment for these services by 15% would reduce premiums by 1.6% ($67 per member per year), and reducing average payment to 150% of traditional Medicare rates-the high end of payments to other specialists-would reduce premiums by 5.1% ($212 per member per year). These savings would reduce aggregate premiums for the nation's commercially insured population by approximately $12 billion and $38 billion, respectively.Addressing surprise billing could substantially affect commercial insurance premiums.",

This study sought to measure any additional impact on compliance when alerting messages also were sent to patients. STUDY DESIGN For alerts that were generated by computerized clinical rules applied to claims, compliance was determined by subsequent claims evidence (eg, that recommended tests were performed). Compliance was measured in the baseline year and the study year for 4 study group employers (combined membership >100,000) that chose to add patient messaging in the study year, and 28 similar control group employers (combined membership >700,000) that maintained physician messaging but did not add patient messaging. METHODS The impact of patient messaging was assessed by comparing changes in compliance from baseline to study year in the 2 groups. Multiple logistic regression was used to control for differences between the groups. Because a given member or physician could receive multiple alerts, generalized estimating equations with clustering by patient and physician were used. RESULTS Controlling for differences in age, sex, and the severity and types of clinical alerts between the study and control groups, the addition of patient messaging increased compliance by 12.5% (P <.001). This increase was primarily because of improved responses to alerts regarding the need for screening, diagnostic, and monitoring tests. CONCLUSION Supplementing clinical alerts to physicians with messages directly to their patients produced a statistically significant increase in compliance with the evidence-based guidelines underlying the alerts.",

Therapeutic inertia could be responsible for the vast majority of cardiovascular events in patients with hypertension. The present study was conducted to explore views and opinions of clinicians involved in providing health care services to patients with hypertension in Palestine and achieve formal consensus on promoters of the phenomenon of therapeutic inertia from their point of view.In this exploratory study, a mixed-methods approach combining literature search, qualitative interviews, and 2 Delphi technique rounds was used.Interviews with key contact clinicians (n = 18) were conducted. To achieve formal consensus on promoters of therapeutic inertia in hypertension, 2 Delphi rounds were conducted using a panel of general practitioners, family medicine specialists, and internal medicine specialists (n = 50).The majority of the panel members (90%) agreed that therapeutic inertia was prevalent in treating patients with hypertension in Palestine. Of the 41 potential promoters, consensus was achieved on 37 (90.2%). Of these 37 promoters, 21 (56.8%) were clinician-related, 10 (27.0%) were patient-related, and 6 (16.2%) were health care system-related factors. The study explored views and opinions of clinicians involved in providing health care services to patients with hypertension in Palestine relevant to therapeutic inertia in hypertension.Findings of this study could inform policy and decision makers to devise strategies to eliminate or reduce therapeutic inertia in managing hypertension in Palestinian clinical practice. Future studies are needed to determine whether such strategies can improve outcomes of patients with hypertension.",

We identified subgroups of HC patients based on latent concepts of complexity and utilization.We used cross-sectional national data from the 2014 Health Center Patient Survey and latent class analyses to identify distinct and homogenous groups of complex high-utilizing patients aged 18 to 64 years.We included indicators of chronic conditions (CCs), MH, SUD risk, and health behavior to measure complexity. We used number of outpatient and emergency department visits in the past year to measure utilization.HC patients were separated in 9 distinct groups based on 3 complexity latent classes (MH, multiple CCs, and low risk) and 3 utilization classes (low, high, and superutilizers). Conditions associated with each subgroup differed. The highest prevalence of bipolar disorder (45%) and high SUD risk (6%) was observed among MH superutilizers, whereas the highest prevalence of cardiovascular disease (48%) and obesity (96%) was seen among CC superutilizers. Most MH superutilizer patients concurrently had MH conditions and obesity and were smokers, but most CC superutilizer patients concurrently had hypertension, obesity, and cardiovascular disease.Our examination of complexity and utilization indicated distinct HC patient populations. Managing the care of each group may require different targeted intervention approaches such as multidisciplinary care teams that include MH providers or specialists.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the prevalence of previously unrecognized osteoporosis in men admitted for long-term rehabilitation nursing home care.Cross-sectional study.A total of 1179 consecutive admissions to a VA rehabilitation center were reviewed. Men who were already diagnosed with osteoporosis, had confounding medical illness, were unable to complete the study, or who declined to participate were excluded. A total of 153 patients were enrolled and 106 were evaluated. Measurements included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry of the hip and lumbar spine, biochemical and hormonal studies, and functional evaluation.A total of 33 patients (31.1%) had osteoporosis (T-score at any site lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck <-2.5). Patients with osteoporosis were significantly older than those without: 68.4 +/- 13.2 years versus 62.7 +/- 12.1 years (P <.05), respectively. Body mass index (BMI) and weight were lower in men with osteoporosis: 23.4 +/- 3.9 kg/m2 versus 28.7 +/- 7.08 kg/m2 and 72.6 +/- 14.4 kg versus 90.3 +/- 23.8 kg, respectively (both, P <.001). There were no differences in use of medications thought to affect bone metabolism or functional status, or in hormonal and metabolic measurements. Hip and spine bone density were correlated (r = 0.3, P <.05). Multivariate analysis showed that hip bone density was independently associated with BMI.Hip osteoporosis is common in this unscreened population, suggesting that screening should be more widely performed in veterans admitted to rehabilitation units. These data suggest that nutritional status could impact osteoporosis risk.",

    "abstract": "Health insurers in India currently face many challenges, including poor consumer awareness, strict regulations, and inefficient business practices. They operate under a combination of stifling administrative costs and high medical expense ratios which have ensured that insurers operate under steep losses. External factors (eg, onerous regulations, lack of standards, high claims payouts) and internal factors (eg, high administrative costs, dependence on indemnity models that cover inpatient treatment costs only) have forced the health insurance industry into a regressive spiral. To overcome these challenges, health insurers need to innovate in their product offerings and tighten their existing processes and cost structures. But as a long-term strategy, it is imperative that health insurers deploy managed care concepts, which will go a long way toward addressing the systemic issues in the current operational models of health plans.",

METHODS:Between March 1, 2010, and March 31, 2013, we assisted a private medical practice, comprising 5 primary care clinic sites, to organize and deliver team-based care for patients with CHD.We used billing records and the registered nurse care manager's diary to calculate the cost of team-based care, differences in the average number of visits per patient, and revenue per patient before and after the implementation of team-based care. RESULTS:The net cost of team-based primary care was $291 per patient over the 1-year period of observation. CONCLUSIONS:The findings from this study are consistent with other economic analyses of team-based care and suggest that payment for care must be restructured if patients are expected to enjoy the benefits of team-based primary care.",

NTRK gene fusions have been identified as oncogenic drivers in a wide range of tumors in both adult and pediatric patients. There has recently been a paradigm shift in cancer treatment toward biomarker-based targeted therapies, as an increasing number of actionable targets are being identified across different tumors and/or tumor histologies. These targeted agents offer greater comparative effectiveness and safety vs historical nontargeted standard therapies. The development of drugs that specifically target oncogenic drivers of cancer has led to the emergence of screening technologies to identify the patients most likely to benefit from targeted therapy. This review describes the role of NTRK gene fusions in cancer and outlines the epidemiology of NTRK gene fusions, the therapeutic benefits of targeting TRK fusions with small molecule inhibitors, and recommendations for NTRK gene fusion testing in adult and pediatric patients with cancer, in order to guide treatment decisions.",

Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor intravitreal injection therapy has dominated as the standard of care treatment for over 15 years, but poor adherence and high treatment burden have led to suboptimal visual outcomes in the real world compared with the clinical trial results. New treatments are emerging that expand the therapeutic targets and use innovative delivery mechanisms with longer durability to ease the treatment burden.

    "abstract": "Work relative value units (wRVUs) quantify physician workload. In theory, higher wRVU assignments for procedures recognize an increase in complexity and time required to complete the procedure. The fairness of wRVU assignment is debated across specialties, with some surgeons arguing that reimbursement may be unfairly low for longer, more complex cases. For this reason, we sought to assess the correlation of wRVUs with operative time in commonly performed surgeries.We analyzed the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database, selecting the 15 most performed surgical procedures across specialties in a 90-day global period, using Current Procedural Terminology codes.Calculation and comparison of mean operative time and mean wRVUs were performed for each of the 15 procedures. Cases with missing values for wRVUs or operative time and cases with an operative time of less than 15 minutes were excluded. The Spearman correlation coefficient was calculated to evaluate the strength of correlation between operative duration and wRVUs.A total of 1,994,394 patients met criteria for analysis. The lowest mean wRVU was 7.78 (95% CI, 7.77-7.78) for inguinal hernia repair; the highest was 43.50 (95% CI, 43.37-43.60) for pancreatectomy. The shortest mean operative time was 51.0 (95% CI, 50.8-51.1) minutes for appendectomy; the longest was for pancreatectomy at 324.6 (95% CI, 323.2-326.0) minutes. The Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.81.In our analysis, we found a strong correlation between operative duration and wRVU assignment. Thus, the reimbursement of physicians depending on wRVUs is fair for the most commonly performed surgical procedures across specialties.",

The regression relies on a fully interacted set of indicator variables of each racial group by 3 time periods: 2005-2009, 2010-2013, and 2014-2018.Outcomes included indicators of mammography, colonoscopy, and lipid panel use. Several chronic conditions were examined, including diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and mental health status. The final outcome variables examined health insurance (uninsured or not) and out-of-pocket spending as a share of family income. Regression models were used controlling for patient characteristics (age, income, education) and for a set of fully interacted indicator variables of race and time period. We tested for relative changes in White adults vs minority adults for each outcome variable. We used the Wald test (test command in Stata) to test for relative changes over time.We found reductions in baseline (pre-ACA) disparities over time in several of the measures between minority adults and White adults. This included greater growth in the use of mammograms and colonoscopies among minority populations. The results also saw relative reductions in hypertension, coronary heart disease, and fair or poor mental health. Finally, the share uninsured among Hispanic adults decreased at a faster rate than among White adults pre-ACA compared with the ACA period examined.The ACA is associated with a reduction in baseline differences in the use of some clinical preventive services, chronic disease prevalence, health insurance coverage, and out-of-pocket spending. Continued efforts to promote prevention and further expansions of coverage would appear to pay dividends.",

The eGFR and uACR tests were assessed nationally and by state. The proportions of tested patients and patients receiving adequate monitoring per clinical practice guidelines were analyzed during the 1-year period after T2D and CKD diagnosis, along with all-cause health care costs.Among 101,057 adults with CKD and T2D, 94.1% had at least 1 eGFR test and 38.7% had at least 1 uACR test over 1 year. Only 20.3% of patients had adequate uACR monitoring; this was much lower than observed for adequate eGFR monitoring (86.6%). The eGFR testing rates were high across states (range, 79.5% [Colorado] to 97.3% [Alabama]); conversely, uACR testing rates were uniformly lower and showed wider variation (range, 14.0% [Maine] to 58.9% [Hawaii]). Mean annual all-cause health care costs were $28,636 and increased with CKD GFR stage. Lower uACR testing rates were associated with higher health care costs at the state level (Pearson r = -0.55; P < .01).In the United States, uACR testing is underutilized, with large geographical variations in testing rates noted between states. Lower uACR testing rates were associated with higher health care costs. The lack of sufficient uACR testing raises concerns about CKD management in patients with T2D.",

Statistical tests were then performed to assess whether modeled event rates aligned with trial observations. A cross-validation was also performed using the online version of the SHARP CKD-Cardiovascular Disease (SHARP CKD-CVD) model, with population characteristics from the finerenone trials analyzed. Where no finerenone data were available, the default SHARP CKD-CVD values were used. Comparison of the results considered the ranges from both models.The outcomes of the FINE-CKD model reflect the event rates observed in the trials. Based on the results of the statistical tests, the hypothesis of no difference between observed and modeled events cannot be rejected for any of the outcomes. The results of the FINE-CKD model are within the ranges from the SHARP CKD-CVD model. Disease progressions align across the models; however, incident kidney failure events in the SHARP CKD-CVD model were higher. This can be explained by simulation of more severely affected patients in the SHARP CKD-CVD model.This study demonstrates that the FINE-CKD model adequately reflects the clinical data and provides reliable extrapolation relative to the existing predictive tools while also being conservative in its approach.",

Early and intensive diagnosis and management of diabetes can reduce the economic burden and improve the societal burden of long-term diabetes-related complications. Healthcare providers practicing in the primary care setting are on the front line of screening, diagnosis, and managing a large majority of persons with diabetes.Until recently, blood glucose monitoring, along with timely A1C measurements, has been the recommended means by which patients can best achieve their prescribed metabolic targets. However, supplies and testing can be costly and burdensome, affecting patient compliance and medication adherence. The recent introduction of integrated diabetes technology including continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has had a tremendous impact on treating patients to their prescribed glycemic targets safely and efficiently while minimizing their risk of developing treatment-emergent hypoglycemia. Patients who utilize CGM are able to reduce their risk of hospitalizations, minimize work absenteeism, lower their A1C, lower their risk of hypoglycemia, as well as long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications.The American Diabetes Association updated its evidence-based Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes in 2022 around the use of CGM, as has the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology. Because these devices can have a positive effect on the management of persons with diabetes, managed care and healthcare providers should allow technological integration for their patients.",

Increased share of COVID-19 patients was associated with higher odds of in-hospital death among all patients and non-COVID-19 patients. The effects were more pronounced among patients 45 years and older and those with septicemia or pneumonia, and they were also stronger during the months in which COVID-19 cases surged. Although no sizable changes were found in the odds of discharge to other hospitals or SNFs, transfers to home care grew during the pandemic.The negative impact of the pandemic on mortality among non-COVID-19 patients confirms existing concerns about patient care. No evidence suggests large-scale changes in practices regarding discharge/transfer to other facilities.

Obesity is influenced by genetic, environmental, physiologic, behavioral, and sleep factors and is associated with approximately 200 health conditions. Assessed using body mass index, body composition, and evaluation of weight-related complications, obesity is treated with lifestyle interventions, anti-obesity medications, and metabolic and bariatric surgery. The age-adjusted prevalence of overweight and obesity in US adults has increased substantially in the 21st century, from an estimated 56% in 1988-1994 to approximately 73.1% in 2017-2018. Nevertheless, there are substantial barriers to successful obesity treatment in the United States, including inadequate treatment coverage; a lack of acceptance by providers, patients, and employers that obesity is a disease; the perception that treatment is ineffective; and the belief that obesity is a behavioral concern related to a lack of willpower. Obesity is a serious, chronic, relapsing, and treatable disease associated with many related conditions; it requires long-term medical management and multimodal care strategies.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated telemedicine use nationally, but differences across health systems are understudied. We examine telemedicine use for adults with diabetes and/or hypertension across 10 health systems and analyze practice and patient characteristics associated with greater use. Study Design: Encounter-level data from the AMGA Optum Data Warehouse for March 13, 2020, to December 31, 2020, were analyzed, which included 3,016,761 clinical encounters from 764,521 adults with diabetes and/or hypertension attributed to 1 of 1207 practice sites with at least 50 system-attributed patients. Methods: Linear spline regression estimated whether practice size and ownership were associated with telemedicine during the adoption (weeks 0-4), de-adoption (weeks 5-12), and maintenance (weeks 13-42) periods, controlling for patient socioeconomic and clinical characteristics. Results: Telemedicine use peaked at 11% to 42% of weekly encounters after 4 weeks. In adjusted analyses, small practices had lower telemedicine use for adults with diabetes during the maintenance period compared with larger practices. Practice ownership was not associated with telemedicine use. Practices with higher proportions of Black patients continued to expand telemedicine use during the de-adoption and maintenance periods. Conclusions: Practice ownership was not associated with telemedicine use during first months of the pandemic. Small practices de-adopted telemedicine to a greater degree than medium and large practices. Technical support for small practices, irrespective of their ownership, could enable telemedicine use for adults with diabetes and/or hypertension.",

The US Department of Health and Human Services has established a Viral Hepatitis National Strategic Plan with the goal of eliminating HBV infection in the United States by the year 2030. This goal will be achieved by reducing the incidence of new HBV infections by 90% and mortality by 65%, with a main focus on prevention of HBV infection through vaccination. Currently, 4 HBV vaccines (excluding bivalent vaccines) are available in the United States for use in adults, including Heplisav-B, which was approved by the FDA in November 2017 for use in adults 18 years and older. All 4 HBV vaccines are equally recommended as options for the prevention of HBV infection by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. This article provides an overview of emerging considerations based on CDC recommendations and new clinical data around HBV vaccines, as well as the potential of Heplisav-B in fulfilling unmet needs that currently exist in the HBV prevention landscape.",

Study Design: Nested case-control design. Methods: This study employed a nested case-control design using a 5% random sample of the national Medicare administrative claims data for 2012-2016. Eligible individuals experiencing a composite outcome of opioid-related adverse events were defined as cases and matched to controls using incidence density sampling. Continuity of opioid prescribing (operationalized using the Continuity of Care Index) and prescriber specialty were assessed among all eligible individuals. Conditional logistic regression was conducted to assess the relationships of interest after accounting for known confounders. Results: Individuals with low (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% CI, 1.08-1.94) and medium (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.04-1.79) continuity of opioid prescribing were found to have greater odds of experiencing a composite outcome of opioid-related adverse events compared with individuals with high prescribing continuity. Fewer than 1 in 10 (9.2%) older adults starting a new LTOT episode received at least 1 prescription from a pain specialist. Receiving a prescription from a pain specialist was not significantly associated with the outcome in adjusted analyses. Conclusions: We found that higher continuity of opioid prescribing, but not provider specialty, was significantly associated with fewer opioid-related adverse outcomes among older adults with CNCP.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Commercial accountable care organization (ACO) contracts attempt to mitigate spending growth, but past evaluations have been limited to continuously enrolled ACO members in health maintenance organization (HMO) plans, excluding many members. The objective of this study was to examine the magnitude of turnover and leakage within a commercial ACO. Study Design: A historical cohort study using detailed information from multiple commercial ACO contracts within a large health care system between 2015 and 2019. Methods: Individuals insured through 1 of the 3 largest commercial ACO contracts during the study period, 2015-2019, were included. We examined patterns of entry and exit and the characteristics that predicted remaining in the ACO compared with leaving the ACO. We also examined predictors of the amount of care delivered in the ACO compared with outside the ACO. Results: Among the 453,573 commercially insured individuals in the ACO, approximately half left the ACO within the initial 24 months after entry. Approximately one-third of spending was for care occurring outside the ACO. Patients who remained in the ACO differed from those who left earlier, including being older, having a non-HMO plan, having lower predicted spending at entry, and having more medical spending for care performed within the ACO during the initial quarter of membership. Conclusions: Both turnover and leakage hamper the ability of ACOs to manage spending. Modifications that address potentially intrinsic vs avoidable sources of population turnover and increase patient incentives for care within vs outside of ACOs could help address medical spending growth within commercial ACO programs.",

Participants were categorized based on adherence to the 10 processes in the ADA guidelines into adherent (≥ 9 processes) and nonadherent (≤ 6 processes) categories. Propensity score matching was employed using a logistic regression model. After matching, total annual health care expenditure change from baseline year was compared using a t test. Further, imbalanced variables were controlled for in a multivariable linear regression model.A total of 1619 patients representing 15,781,346 (SE = 438,832) individuals met the inclusion criteria, among whom 12.17% received nonadherent care. After propensity matching, those who received nonadherent care had $4031 higher total annual health care expenditures compared with their baseline year, whereas patients who received adherent care had $128 lower total annual health care expenditures compared with their baseline year. Further, multivariable linear regression adjusted for the imbalanced variables indicated that nonadherent care was associated with a mean (SE) $3470 ($1588) increase in the change from baseline health care expenditure.Nonadherence to the ADA guidelines results in a significant increase in health care expenditures among patients with diabetes. The economic impact of nonadherent care for T2D is a significant and extensive issue that needs to be addressed. These findings emphasize the importance of providing care based on ADA guidelines.",

Study Design: Cross-sectional observational study using electronic health record data from an academic health system in 2019. Methods: We calculated the relative risk of sufficient lung cancer risk factor documentation by patient-, provider-, and system-level variables using Poisson regression models, clustering by clinic. We compared unadjusted, risk-adjusted, and reliability-adjusted proportions of patients with sufficient smoking documentation across 31 clinics using logistic regression models and 2-level hierarchical logit models to estimate reliability-adjusted proportions across clinics. Results: Among 20,632 individuals, 60% had sufficient risk factor documentation to determine screening eligibility. Patient-level factors inversely associated with risk factor documentation included Black race (relative risk [RR], 0.70; 95% CI, 0.60-0.81), non-English preferred language (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.49-0.74), Medicaid insurance (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.57-0.71), and nonactivated patient portal (RR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.80-0.90).

Conclusions: We found a low rate of sufficient lung cancer risk factor documentation and associations of risk factor documentation based on patient-level factors such as race, insurance status, language, and patient portal activation. Risk factor documentation rates varied across clinics, and only approximately half the variation was explained by factors in our analysis.",

Hospitalizations in patients with CKD are associated with higher medical costs and increased morbidity and mortality. Identification of patients with CKD who are at greatest risk of hospitalization may hold promise to improve clinical outcomes and enable judicious allocation of health care resources. Study Design: Retrospective, observational cohort study. Methods: Medicare Part A and Part B claims from calendar years 2017 and 2018 from 50,000 unique patients with a diagnosis of stage 3 to 5 CKD were used for this study. Data were split into training (n = 40,000) and test (n = 10,000) sets. A variety of model types were built to predict all-cause hospitalization within 90 days. Results: The final model was a gradient-boosting machine with 399 input terms. The model demonstrated good ability to discriminate (area under the curve [AUC] for the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.73), which was stable when tested in the test set (AUC = 0.73). The positive predictive value in the test set was 0.306, 0.240, and 0.216 at the 10%, 20%, and 30% thresholds, respectively. The sensitivity in the test set was 0.288, 0.453, and 0.609 at the 10%, 20%, and 30% thresholds, respectively. Conclusions: We developed an algorithm that uses medical claims to identify Medicare patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 who are at highest risk of being hospitalized in the near term. This algorithm could be used as a decision support tool for clinical programs focusing on management of patient populations with CKD.",

    "abstract": "Dry eye disease (DED) is a common condition in which tear film abnormalities result in a damaging cycle of tear hyperosmolarity, desiccating stress, inflammation, and ocular surface injury. In a healthy tear film, meibum produced by the meibomian glands forms a lipid layer that stabilizes the tear film and protects against aqueous tear evaporation. Excessive tear evaporation due to a deficient lipid layer is believed to be the most common cause of DED, and most evaporative DED is associated with meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD); this highlights the pathophysiologic importance of the dysfunctional tear lipid layer. Current treatments for DED may be used to supplement hyperosmolar aqueous tears, lubricate the ocular surface, increase meibum flow, decrease inflammation, promote tear production, or otherwise decrease clinical signs of ocular surface damage and/or improve symptoms. Until now, no prescription eye drop has directly addressed the excessive evaporation that occurs in most patients with DED. Perfluorohexyloctane (PFHO) ophthalmic solution (MIEBO™; Bausch + Lomb) is a preservative-free eye drop that has demonstrated the ability to form a long-lasting barrier that inhibits evaporation in preclinical studies. FDA approval of PFHO was based on results from 2 pivotal clinical trials (GOBI [NCT04139798] and MOJAVE [NCT04567329]) in patients with DED and clinical signs of MGD which demonstrated consistent improvements in both signs and symptoms of disease, with a safety profile similar to that of saline eye drops. PFHO is the first and only FDA-approved eye drop that directly targets tear evaporation in patients with DED, thereby promoting ocular surface healing and providing symptomatic relief.",

We sought to identify clinicians' perspectives on the quality of e-consult requests that they send and receive. Study Design: A qualitative research study at the US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) New England Healthcare System. Methods: We interviewed a total of 73 clinicians, including 38 specialists across 3 specialties (cardiology, neurology, pulmonology) and 35 primary care clinicians (PCCs), between March and June 2019. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: VA specialists and PCCs generally agreed that e-consult requests should be focused and precise, not require lengthy chart review, and include adequate preliminary workup results. At the same time, specialists expressed frustration with what they perceived as suboptimal e-consult requests. Interviewees attributed this gap to 3 factors: limitations of the electronic health record user interface, divergence between PCCs and specialists in the areas of expertise, and organizational pressures on the 2 groups. Conclusions: VA clinicians' perspectives on suboptimal requests contain lessons that are broadly applicable to other health systems that seek to maximize the potential of e-consults to facilitate clinician collaboration and care coordination.",

Study Design: Retrospective cohort study of patients qualified for hospital-level care who were admitted to either ACAH or a traditional hospital. Methods: From April 29, 2020, to November 14, 2021, patients requiring hospital-level care received Kaiser Permanente at Home or traditional hospital care. In a subgroup of patients, we compared outcomes for Kaiser Permanente at Home vs traditional hospital care using regression models. Results: A total of 1005 patients were admitted to Kaiser Permanente at Home. Average daily census (ADC) was intentionally increased over time in stages, from 7.2 to 8.8, then to 12.7. The maximum daily census was 22, with a peak ADC of 16, representing 9% of the total hospital inpatient medicine service census. During this time, there were numeric decreases in Kaiser Permanente at Home escalation rates (17.5% to 10.8%), median length of stay (7.43 days to 5.46 days), and readmission rates (9.79% to 9.24%). A subgroup of Kaiser Permanente at Home patients contributed to the comparative analyses, which showed that patients admitted to Kaiser Permanente at Home were 64% less likely to experience delirium than patients admitted for traditional hospital care (OR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15-0.88; ,P, = .026). Comparisons of quality metrics across stages of implementation (readmissions, escalations, length of stay) were inconclusive. Conclusion: In an integrated delivery system, ACAH care can be scaled and can create hospital capacity. However, our data were inconclusive regarding quality throughout scaling due to the small effective sample size, necessitating replication in a larger prospective study with adequate power/precision.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To compare 12-month total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty (THA) rates for digital musculoskeletal (MSK) program members vs patients who received traditional care for knee or hip osteoarthritis (OA). Study Design: Retrospective, longitudinal study with propensity score–matched comparison group that used commercial medical claims data representing more than 100 million commercially insured lives. Methods: Study participants with hip OA (M16.x) or knee OA (M17.x) ,International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification, (,ICD-10-CM,) codes were identified in the medical claims database. Digital MSK program members were identified using record linkage tokens. The comparison group had hip- or knee-related physical therapy identified via ,ICD-10-CM, and ,Current Procedural Terminology ,codes. Respectively in each knee and hip OA group, digital members were matched to control group patients with similar demographics, comorbidities, and baseline MSK-related medical care use. TKA and THA at 12 months post participation were compared. Results: In the knee OA group, 739 of 56,634 control group patients were matched to 739 digital members. At 12 months, 3.79% of digital members and 14.21% of control group patients had TKA (difference, 10.42%; ,P, < .001). In the hip OA group, 141 of 20,819 control group patients were matched to 141 digital members. At 12 months, 16.31% of digital members and 32.62% of control group patients had THA (difference, 16.31%; ,P, = .001). Conclusions: These findings suggest that patients who participated in a digital MSK program to manage OA have lower rates of total joint arthroplasty in the 12 months after enrollment.",

Despite the established benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, there are concerns regarding the risk of major bleeding. The risks, benefits, and complexity identified in these interventional trials are communicated in this article to enable well-informed therapeutic decisions. Thienopyridine nonresponsiveness and variability of response are emerging as significant concerns in ACS patients that may lead to poor long-term cardiovascular outcomes. Current research on thienopyridine responsiveness and evidence-based mechanisms for overcoming thienopyridine nonresponsiveness are discussed. In addition, adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy is critical but difficult to achieve, and a considerable proportion of patients (1 of 7) discontinue therapy before 30 days of drug-eluting stent implantation. It has been established that premature discontinuation of thienopyridine therapy is associated with a marked increase in the risk of stent thrombosis (and consequently myocardial infarction and/or death) and is the leading independent predictor of stent thrombosis in multivariate analyses. The factors related to premature cessation of thienopyridine therapy are listed with recommendations for minimizing the complications arising as a result of premature discontinuation.",

STUDY DESIGN An interrupted time series analysis using pharmacy claims and a retrospective cohort study. METHODS The study assessed changes in preferred drug use and subsequent cost reductions. A retrospective cohort study determined if the IA process produced fewer gaps in therapy than the PA process. Provider acceptance of the IA process was assessed using a brief survey of 240 randomly selected primary care practices. RESULTS Market share for preferred proton pump inhibitors quadrupled from a range of 17.6% to 19.3% at baseline to 76% in the first month after implementation of the new IA policy. Most practices (81.1%) reported reduced administrative burden with the IA process. The median gaps between medication fills for patients using IA were approximately one-half those of patients using PA (P <.001) and were one-fourth in a subset of highly adherent, regularly filling patients (P <.001). CONCLUSIONS Instant approval may be more patient friendly and prescriber friendly than PA as assessed by a proxy measure for access (gap in therapy) and physician-reported acceptance. Despite its ease of use, IA does not seem to reduce switching to preferred drugs.",

In August 2005, it was mandated that all new ezetimibe prescriptions be 5 mg, prescribed as a 10-mg tablet split in half. Methods The impact of the 2 ezetimibe dosing strategies on percent lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and achievement of National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) goals was assessed in all patients prescribed ezetimibe 5 or 10 mg. Results A total of 272 patients were prescribed ezetimibe; 86 received 5 mg and 186 received 10 mg. Of those 272 patients, 197 had evaluable baseline and posttreatment LDL-C (55 taking the 5-mg dose and 142 taking the 10-mg dose). The effects of ezetimibe 5 and 10 mg on all lipid parameters were similar. Ezetimibe 10 mg reduced LDL-C by 26.1%, whereas 5 mg reduced LDL-C by 25.8%. The percentages of patients achieving goal LDL-C were similar: 61.8% (5 mg) and 60.5% (10 mg). Conclusion These data strongly suggest that ezetimibe 5 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg are clinically equivalent with respect to LDL-C reduction and achievement of ATP III LDL-C goals. Widespread adoption of this low-dose strategy could result in a potential cost savings of more than a billion dollars annually, with a potential reduction in hepatotoxicity.",

Data were collected on ocular attributes, and descriptive, cross-tabulation, and regression statistics were applied to depict prevalence and potential influence of RFs. For the ocular hypertension subset, the OHTS risk scoring system calculated average cumulative 5-year risk of glaucoma conversion.With 1189 eligible medical records available, univariate analyses demonstrated significant associations between older age and mean deviation (MD), vertical cup-to-disc ratio (CDR), intraocular pressure, and central corneal thickness (CCT). The presence of diabetes mellitus had a protective effect. Regression analyses identified age, mean CCT, and CDR as significant predictors of MD, whereas CCT was the strongest predictor of vertical CDR. Mean composite OHTS score was 9.7, signifying a 15% cumulative 5-year risk for developing glaucoma.Known RFs were present in approximately one third of patients. Although analyses confirmed the predictive value of these RFs, existing models may not account for several important RFs or may rely on ocular metrics that might not be routinely or practically assessed in clinical practice.

Study design This was a multiyear cross-sectional study using the data warehouse of Clalit Health Services (Clalit), the largest payer/provider healthcare system in Israel, with complete clinical records for more than 4 million members. All admissions from 2009 to 2014 were included in the study. Discharge diagnoses were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Methods We provide adjusted rates (per 100,000 Clalit population adjusted by age and sex to the 2005 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development population) for all admissions, by discharge diagnoses, for each year. We identify the highest adjusted rates (relative and absolute) by both catchment area and hospital affiliation (Clalit or non-Clalit). Results ACSC-related admissions made up 16.2% of all admissions for the 5 years studied, and the overall rate increased by 26.8% from 2009 to 2014. The conditions with the highest admission rates in all years and all catchment areas were pneumonia and congestive heart failure. There was extreme variation among catchment areas for hypertension-related admissions. Within the Clalit hospitals, ACSCs accounted for 20.5% of admissions; within non-Clalit hospitals, ACSCs accounted for 13.6% of admissions. Conclusions In evaluating the rates of ACSC-related admissions, this study demonstrates the contribution of a single, longitudinal benchmark. This study also suggests that hypertension, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia may be areas for future intervention in Clalit.",

However, whether having a consistent HIV health care provider is associated with desirable clinical outcomes remained unclear. This study examined the association of having a consistent HIV health care provider and HIV-related clinical outcomes. STUDY DESIGN This was a multiyear cross-sectional observational study using secondary data. METHODS A total of 1584 people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and receiving HIV health care who participated in the Illinois Medical Monitoring Project from 2009 to 2014 were included. Two logistic regressions were conducted to examine the associations of having a consistent HIV health care provider and 2 clinical HIV outcomes, viral suppression and high CD4 cell count. The inverse probability weighting method was applied to address the potential issue of missing data about whether a patient had a consistent HIV health care provider. RESULTS Patients who had a consistent HIV health care provider, compared with those who did not, had higher odds of achieving HIV viral suppression (ie, viral load < 200 cells/mm3) and of having high counts of CD4 cells (ie, CD4 ≥ 200 cells/mm3) (odds ratios, 4.10 and 4.18, respectively; both P < .05). CONCLUSIONS Having a consistent HIV health care provider was associated with a higher likelihood of achieving desirable HIV clinical outcomes among PLWHA. To optimize these outcomes, policy and educational interventions are needed for PLWHA to have consistent HIV health care providers and to establish long-term, consistent physician-patient relationships.",

    "abstract": "HIV prevention strategies prioritize medication adherence among people living with HIV (PLWH). Of the 1.1 million PLWH in the United States, more than two-fifths are not virally suppressed and thus experience increased morbidity and mortality as well as transmission risk. Integrated care models are meant to address these gaps and often cite the importance of mental health care services (MHCS). However, research into the impact of integrating MHCS has been limited to those in homogenous treatment.This study used an analytic observational cross-sectional design to achieve the above objectives.This study utilized a cross-sectional survey aimed to identify needs among PLWH in the Midwestern region of the United States and to stratify by both MHCS need and receipt. The survey, administered throughout 2018 in 12 HIV service organizations, was completed by PLWH receiving different supportive services. Comparative logistic regression models were calculated to identify the likelihood of nonadherence based on both MHCS receipt and need.Of the 537 survey respondents, 20% reported receiving integrated MHCS, 8% reported needing but being unable to receive MHCS, and 72% reported not needing or receiving MHCS. Overall, 50% of the sample reported missing at least some HIV medication within the past 30 days. Individuals who needed but did not receive MHCS were more likely to report treatment nonadherence. No significant difference in adherence was identified between those who received MHCS and those who did not need MHCS.Results suggest that continued assessment of needs and integration of MHCS into HIV care improves the likelihood of medication adherence. Further, our study highlights how systematically asking PLWH about their needs and connecting them to services may critically affect HIV management.",

Individuals aged 55 to 75 years using specialty drugs make the transition from employer-sponsored insurance (ESI) to Medicare Part D coverage. We compared out-of-pocket (OOP) spending across ESI, Medicare fee-for-service (FFS), and Medicare Advantage (MA) prescription drug plans to examine the impact of benefit design on OOP spending.Analyses consisted of Truven MarketScan and Medicare Part D prescription drug claims from 2013 to 2017 for individuals enrolled in ESI, FFS, and MA drug plans taking at least 1 drug among the top 4 specialty drug classes: rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), cancer, and hepatitis C.Multivariate regression analyses with fixed effects were used to assess whether there are differences in OOP spending by insurance type and the impact of benefit design differences. A secondary outcome was drug choice within a therapeutic class.There were small differences in drug choice between Medicare and ESI but significant differences in OOP spending. Monthly OOP spending for ESI relative to FFS was $108 less for RA drugs, $288 less for MS drugs, $504 less for cancer drugs, and $1437 less for hepatitis C drugs. Spending was slightly greater for beneficiaries in MA plans compared with FFS. Higher Medicare spending was driven by gaps in coverage in the Part D benefit phases because beneficiaries pay a percentage of list price.OOP spending was substantially higher for Medicare enrollees compared with ESI enrollees as a result of the Part D benefit structure.",

Guidelines addressing telemetry use have been developed by the American Heart Association (AHA) and are effective when applied to specific clinical practices and high-value care. The purpose of our intervention was to facilitate more effective utilization of telemetry in our hospital. We aimed to reduce patient days on telemetry through use of AHA guideline criteria for telemetry. STUDY DESIGN We used Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles with chart review for pre- and postintervention measurement collection. METHODS We included patients hospitalized at The Brooklyn Hospital Center on inpatient general medical wards from January 1, 2017, through July 31, 2018. The intervention consisted of a standard process of reviewing patients on telemetry based on AHA guidelines, educating teams on the guidelines, and changes to telemetry order sets. The primary outcome measured was the total number of days that patients remained on telemetry. Secondary measures included the daily number of telemetry downgrades and total number of patients on telemetry. Diagnosis-related group and case mix index were also noted. RESULTS Patient average days on telemetry changed from 7.20 days preintervention to 3.51 days post intervention (P < .0001). The number of patients on telemetry with a diagnosis meeting AHA guidelines for telemetry increased. CONCLUSIONS The stated intervention resulted in more effective use of telemetry, evidenced by fewer patient days on telemetry and increased numbers of patients on telemetry meeting AHA guidelines for telemetry.",

Results The percentage of privacy officers who chose to report a breach to the Office for Civil Rights varied by scenario: scenario 1 (general with little information), 39%; scenario 2 (4-factor risk assessment, paper records), 73.2%; scenario 3 (4-factor risk assessment, ransomware case), 91.9%. Several factors affected the response to each scenario. In scenario 1, privacy officers with a Certified in Healthcare Privacy and Security (CHPS) credential were less likely to report; those who previously reported a prior breach were more likely to report. In scenario 2, privacy officers with a bachelor's degree or graduate education were less likely to report; those who held the CHPS or coding credential were less likely to report. Conclusions Study findings show there are gray areas where privacy officers make their own decisions, and there is a difference in the types of decisions they are making on a day-to-day basis. Future guidance and policies need to address these gaps and can use the insight provided by the results of this study.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes affects an estimated 34 million US adults, with type 2 diabetes (T2D) accounting for 90% to 95% of cases. The downstream consequences of uncontrolled T2D are substantial, including an increased risk of microvascular complications (eg, renal impairment, retinopathy, and peripheral neuropathy), cardiovascular disease, impaired quality of life, and death. Overall, diabetes places a significant strain on the US health care system, with 7.8 million hospitalizations annually among patients with diabetes, and $237 billion in direct medical costs. Injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have been available for T2D for over a decade, and are recommended, in particular, for patients with a compelling need to minimize hypoglycemia risk, curtail weight gain, or promote weight loss, and for patients with established cardiovascular disease. Despite being associated with high glucose-lowering efficacy, weight loss, and a low risk of hypoglycemia, injectable GLP-1RAs are relatively underutilized, and are associated with suboptimal adherence and persistence. These challenges may relate in part to the injectable route of administration, given that injection-related concerns have been linked with a failure to intensify T2D therapy in a timely manner (ie, therapeutic inertia), and are cited by patients as a barrier to initiating and persisting with injectable treatments. The approval of the first tablet formulation of a GLP-1RA for T2D, oral semaglutide, has the potential to address these challenges. In this context, we review the burden of T2D in the United States, the role of GLP-1RAs, the challenges of therapeutic inertia and poor adherence, and the rationale for an oral GLP-1RA, focusing on considerations for managed care.",

The 6 index medication classes were sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), basal insulin, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, and thiazolidinediones (TZDs). Multivariable regression models compared between-class changes in adjusted quarterly costs after second-line ADM initiation.The study cohort included 34,963 adults. Most were prescribed a sulfonylurea (46.0%) or DPP-4 inhibitor (30.4%). Adjusted quarterly index medication costs were significantly higher for all patients receiving nonsulfonylurea medications, ranging from $108 (95% CI, $99-$118) for TZDs to $742 (95% CI, $720-$765) for GLP-1 RAs. Changes in quarterly total health care costs were significantly higher for all nonsulfonylurea classes. Conversely, changes in quarterly nonpharmacy medical costs were significantly lower for patients receiving DPP-4 inhibitors (-$67; 95% CI, -$92 to -$43), GLP-1 RAs (-$43; 95% CI, -$85 to -$1), and SGLT-2 inhibitors (-$46; 95% CI, -$87 to -$6); changes in all other quarterly costs besides the index medication were significantly lower for patients receiving DPP-4 inhibitors (-$60; 95% CI, -$94 to -$26) and SGLT-2 inhibitors (-$113; 95% CI, -$169 to -$57).The higher cost of nonsulfonylurea medications was the main driver of relative increases in total costs. Relative decreases in nonpharmacy medical costs among patients receiving newer ADM classes reflect these medications' potential value.",

So far, most efforts to address cascades have focused on identifying, measuring, and educating clinicians on low-value services, with only modest success. We explore potential solutions for both closing the floodgates and slowing a cascade once the floodgates have been opened, including information to assist patients and clinicians in making better decisions, relationships that enable shared decision-making, and policy changes. Ultimately, reducing cascades while maintaining our commitment to high-quality care requires equipping patients and clinicians with the information, tools, and support needed to embrace uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "The high cost of therapies for treatment of cancer places a substantial burden on the United States healthcare system. In recent years, there has been increased attention to the cost-savings benefits associated with clinical uptake of biosimilars and their market availability, with several biosimilars with oncology-related indications currently available. Though the biosimilar development process has contributed to price reductions and increased patient access to care, misconceptions about biosimilar safety and efficacy as well as inconsistent prescribing patterns have emerged as main barriers to their use in clinical practice. However, this hesitation from a clinical standpoint is not necessarily matched by payers or formulary decision makers in the oncology space. Earlier detection of cancer and longer duration of therapy has spurred discussion about initiation of biosimilars for newly diagnosed patients requiring treatment, but incorporation of biosimilars into formularies and institution protocols remain a challenge. There is clear urgency within the healthcare system to initiate the inclusion of biosimilars into treatment pathways for cancer, and pharmacists who care for patients with cancer have an important role in providing consistent messaging to both healthcare professionals and patients about biosimilars.",

Data from interview transcripts were coded using qualitative coding software and analyzed for thematic responses.Our findings suggest that clinics respond to the incentives in the tiered cost-sharing benefit design. Two motivations cited by clinics are (1) concern over developing a reputation as a high-cost clinic and (2) concern about the possible loss of patients due to higher cost sharing. Some clinics have agreed to price reductions or risk-sharing arrangements to move to, or remain in, a tier with lower cost sharing. Clinic informants reported that price reductions alone are not scalable. They sought greater transparency in tier assignment and increased data sharing to help them reduce costly or unnecessary utilization.Managers of primary care clinics respond to a tiered benefit design that holds them accountable for total cost of care. They respond by offering price discounts and expressing interest in reducing costly referrals and unnecessary use of services.",

Study Design: A retrospective analysis was conducted comparing baseline medication adherence, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) cell counts, and viral load in antiretroviral-experienced human immunodefi ciency virus–infected patients to the same values after at least 6 months of specialized pharmacy care. Methods: A total of 64 patients participated in an ongoing pharmacist-managed medication program. All participants received education, assessment, clinical support, therapy review, refi ll reminders, and custom packaging. Results: After 6 months of pharmacy care, mean medication adherence increased 28% and mean CD4 cell count increased 38%. The percentage of patients whose viral loads were considered undetectable increased from 28% to 66%. In addition, the number of patients achieving greater than 95% adherence increased 69%. Conclusions: A comprehensive pharmacy care program demonstrated substantial and sustained improvement in medication adherence, CD4 cell counts, and viral load among HIV patients receiving HAART. Furthermore, based on published data, the increase in CD4 cell counts resulted in a mean overall healthcare cost savings of $2929.00 per member per year.

For a sample of 6990 patients who received mental health care from the VHA in 2013, we used survey and administrative data to investigate the association of a suite of access and encounter satisfaction measures with a large collection of measures of program characteristics. We estimated risk-adjusted correlations between 6 satisfaction measures (across 2 domains: access and encounter satisfaction) and 28 mental health care program characteristics (across 4 domains: program reach, psychosocial service access, program intensity, and treatment continuity). We found that satisfaction with access to care was higher than experiences with care encounters, but that broad measures of mental health care program reach and intensity were positively associated with both kinds of satisfaction. No measures of psychosocial service access were positively associated with access and encounter satisfaction. Most measures of treatment continuity were consistently and positively associated with both kinds of satisfaction. As the VHA strives to increase access to, and provision of, mental health care, policy makers and program managers should be aware that satisfaction with care, as it is currently measured, may not rise as more patients initiate treatment, unless continuity of care is maintained or enhanced.",

Although lice do not transmit disease, many schools send children home if they detect live head lice. It is the position of the National Association of School Nurses that children who have been treated for lice infestations should not be excluded from school because of the presence of residual nits. The primary goals of the school nurse in controlling infestations are to identify children with head lice and to break the cycle of reinfestation. Routine screening of children for head lice is often part of infestation management policies in school districts. A thorough screening of a child's head can take several minutes. If a school's policy is to screen all students, the total time for examination adds significantly to the school nurse's caseload. The use of the school nurse's time for universal screening must be measured against other responsibilities, including health problem management, medication management, health assessments, and vision and hearing screening. Once a child is identified as having lice, the school nurse can play a key role in working with the child's family to eradicate the infestation. Education about treatment options and environmental cleaning are topics the nurse can address with the family. The school nurse also can function as a case manager who coordinates various aspects of treatment for an affected child. Because infestations can be very upsetting to students and to their families, the nurse can provide support and reassurance to the family as the child is treated. Participation of school nurses in developing appropriate and consistent policies and procedures within the school district is vital to the overall management of infestations. Their efforts to control and reduce infestations are necessary for the overall health of the school population.",

However, with the rise of both purchaser and consumer demand for broader and more detailed information on performance beyond licensure and professional self-regulation, especially at the provider level, the role of accreditation is less clear. We hypothesize that for accreditation to be a critical part of a market-driven, consumer-focused healthcare system, accrediting bodies must enlarge their scope of assessment with an emphasis on clinical performance of providers, revise and expand their level of reporting and transparency of assessment, and broaden the base of their governance. A new approach to accreditation could enhance accountability by (1) building on an existing framework and data-collection structure that are proven elements of quality assurance in multiple healthcare sectors; (2) expanding existing involvement of both public and private entities in the process; (3) building on existing linkages to professional and regulatory bodies; (4) providing greater flexibility, compared with regulation, in responding to change; and (5) having a defined source of funding. By these means, accrediting bodies will both improve accountability and successfully drive quality improvement.",

STUDY DESIGN The study database consisted of 4 years of claims from a mixed-model health maintenance organization. Using the grouper of Episode Treatment Groups by Symmetry Health Data Systems, Inc, 2 episode databases were created, with and without pharmacy claims included. For each database, the responsibility for defined episodes was attributed to physicians within specialty (1) on the basis of combined professional and prescribing costs and (2) on the basis of professional costs alone. METHODS Using the different databases and attribution rules, physicians were ranked within specialty on the economic profiling metric, and the various rankings were compared for consistency. Analyses were performed for cardiologists, family practitioners, general surgeons, and neurologists. RESULTS The absence of prescriber identifying information appears to have only a small effect on physicians' economic profiles. The absence of pharmacy claims, on the other hand, may affect economic profile performance, but the effects differ by specialty and depend on pharmacy costs as a percentage of episode total costs for the specialty and the correlation of episode costs with and without pharmacy costs included. CONCLUSIONS Physicians' economic profile rankings are not greatly affected by the presence or absence of prescriber identifying information in pharmacy claims.

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to examine the financial impact of a prior authorization (PA) intervention for pregabalin in a commercially insured US population via an economic model. METHODS An Excel-based model was developed to simulate 2 hypothetical scenarios for health plans: one with a on pregabalin, and another without a PA. In the scenario, a variable percentage of pregabalin prescriptions were assumed to be approved and dispensed, the remainder being denied or a substitute product dispensed (branded or generic alternatives). In the no PA scenario, all pregabalin prescriptions were assumed to be filled. The market shares of these products, including pregabalin, were based on secondary prescription data. The model calculated the total drug acquisition cost and cost of administration in each scenario for a cohort of 1000 patients over a 1-year period. Patients switching to pregabalin following denial were accounted for in the model. Sensitivity analyses were carried out varying the approval rates and prescription share of pregabalin and limiting the range of substituted products. RESULTS The pregabalin prescribing rate was set to 10.3% in both the and no PA scenarios, with a denial rate of 50% in the scenario, consistent with the IMS prescription volume. The calculated drug acquisition cost for the scenario was $885,564 compared with $888,822 for the no PA scenario, a difference of 0.4%, after factoring in the cost of administration. The calculated administration cost was $4121. Eliminating the administration cost results in a cost for the scenario of $881,443, 0.8% below the no PA scenario. Lowering the pregabalin approval rate from 50% to 10% decreased the costs of the scenario to $879,660, 1.0% lower than the no PA scenario. Raising the pregabalin market share to 20% in the no PA scenario increased the costs of that scenario to $902,714, 1.9% higher than the scenario. Limiting the substituted products for denied pregabalin prescriptions in the scenario to the 2 most common products, valproate sodium and gabapentin (both generics), lowered the cost of the scenario to $875.412, 1.5% below the no PA scenario cost. With half of the denied pregabalin patients switching to pregabalin during the course of the year, the cost of the scenario increased to $892,550, 0.4% higher than the no PA scenario. CONCLUSION Potential savings due to protocols on pregabalin are low, in the 1% to 2% range across a variety of scenarios, because of the relatively low pregabalin market share (about 10%) in typical health plans and the absence of a significant difference in cost for the most commonly substituted products. Patients who switch to pregabalin after an initial denial will further reduce savings to health plans.",

Retrospective descriptive analysis. We analyzed 2010 to 2014 IBM MarketScan Databases and calculated annual heroin overdose rates. For a subset of patients, we describe their comorbidities, where they accessed health services, and select prescription histories prior to their first heroin overdose. Heroin overdose rates were much lower, but increased faster, among the commercially insured compared with Medicaid enrollees from 2010 to 2014 (270.0% vs 94.3%). By 2012, rates among the commercially insured aged 15 to 24 years reached the overall rates in the Medicaid population. All patients had healthcare encounters in the 6 months prior to their first heroin overdose; two-thirds of commercially insured patients had outpatient visits, whereas two-thirds of Medicaid patients had emergency department visits. One month prior to overdose, 24.5% of Medicaid and 8.6% of commercially insured patients had opioid prescriptions. Fewer Medicaid patients had buprenorphine prescriptions (17.8% vs 27.3%) despite similar rates of known substance-related disorders. A higher proportion of Medicaid patients had non-substance-related comorbidities. Heroin overdose rates were persistently higher among the Medicaid population than the commercially insured, with the exception of those aged 15 to 24 years. Our findings on healthcare utilization, comorbidities, and where individuals access services could inform interventions at the point of care prior to a first heroin overdose. Outpatient settings are of particular importance for the growing cohort of young, commercially insured patients with opioid use disorders.",

Because little is known about members' experiences using this new tool, we sought to evaluate benefits and challenges of using PDLs to manage asthma costs.Qualitative interview study.In 2018, we conducted telephone interviews with US adults (n = 22) who (1) were in HDHPs with PDLs and (2) had asthma and/or a child with asthma. We analyzed data using thematic content analysis.Some members reported that PDLs provided financial benefit and facilitated adherence to preventive medications. Others experienced barriers to using PDLs. Notably, some PDLs did not include members' asthma medications or provided only modest cost coverage due to restrictions in underlying formulary structures. Members who were aware of having a PDL sometimes worked with their providers to switch to listed medications. However, many members were not aware of having a PDL. Finally, because PDLs did not cover nonmedication costs, some members still struggled to afford asthma care.PDLs are a promising tool for helping families in HDHPs manage their medication costs and, in turn, their asthma. However, given current limitations in coverage, members must be aware of the benefit to seek out listed medications, and they may still struggle with the remaining cost sharing. Attention to implementation, including member outreach and education, is likely needed to realize the full potential of PDLs.",

We defined discontinuation of DAA therapy as filling prescriptions for fewer weeks than the expected duration of the DAA identified. We estimated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of DAA discontinuation by patient characteristics using multivariable logistic regression. We estimated the model separately for patients with a Part D low-income subsidy (LIS) and those without an LIS.Of 82,056 patients who initiated a DAA therapy during the study period, 5171 (6.3%) did not complete the therapy. Discontinuation rates varied across DAAs, ranging from 4.7% (elbasvir/grazoprevir) to 11.8% (ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir). Women with an LIS were more likely to discontinue DAA therapy than men with an LIS (aOR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.08-1.25; P <.01). Non-LIS black and Hispanic patients had higher odds of discontinuation than non-LIS white patients (black: aOR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.28-1.73; P <.01; Hispanic: aOR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.01-2.44; P <.05). High comorbidity index score increased the odds of DAA discontinuation among patients with an LIS.Real-world discontinuation of DAA therapy was low, but it was 3 times more likely than in clinical trials and varied by patient characteristics. Efforts to increase DAA adherence would help lower patients' risk of developing resistance to future treatments and reduce potential waste of resources.",

    "abstract": "Migraine is a debilitating condition that affects approximately 16% of adults and is the fifth leading cause of emergency department visits in the United States. There are several treatment options for migraines; opioids are frequently prescribed. Results from a recent study showed that more than half of the patients with chronic migraine and a third of the patients with episodic migraine received an opioid prescription in the past year. The American Headache Society recognizes the magnitude of this issue and is working to educate providers on the danger of prescribing opioids in the migraine population The objective of this article is to assess the utilization trends of prescription opioid products and evaluate the impact of opioid utilization on healthcare costs in this patient population. This retrospective claims database analysis used real-world medical claims from multiple health plans. The study period was from January 1, 2009, to September 30, 2017. Patients were included if they were 18 years or older and continuously enrolled in the study period for at least 3 years. Patients were included in the migraine cohort if they had any diagnosis of migraine headache during the study period, while patients without a headache related diagnosis were included in the control cohort. Control patients were propensity matched 1:1 to migraine patients. Discrete (count) data are represented by frequencies and percentages. Continuous results are presented as means, medians, and standard deviations. In the study, 107,216 patients met the inclusion criteria, with 53,608 assigned to each cohort. In the migraine and control cohorts, respectively, 28% and 11% were prescribed opioids. In both cohorts, a majority of the patients were female (81.8%). In both cohorts, opioid use was associated with higher total costs compared with patients who were not prescribed opioids: $82,007 for 200 morphine milligram equivalents (MME)/day or more versus $19,792 for no opioid in patients with migraine; and $54,200 for 200 MME/day or more versus $12,060 for no opioid use in control patients; P <.0001. Patients with more than 2 comorbidities who were prescribed opioids had higher costs than patients with more than 2 comorbidities who were not prescribed opioids and patients with less than 2 comorbidities who were prescribed opioids ($65,980, $32,152, and $35,964, respectively, for patients with migraine, and $52,883, $24,641, and $35,748, respectively, for control patients; P <.0001). Patients with migraine have more than twice the healthcare costs as patients without migraines. The additional increase in healthcare costs in patients with migraine who use opioids for treatment and/or have 2 or more comorbidities is significant. Control of the pain associated with migraine, specifically among those with multiple comorbid conditions, may contribute to substantial reductions in healthcare costs.",

We sought to develop a unifying framework that could be used by administrators, practitioners, and investigators to help define and document operational performance measures that are comparable and reproducible.Retrospective analysis.Health care operations and clinical investigators used an iterative process consisting of (1) literature review, (2) expert assessment and collaborative design, and (3) end-user feedback. We sampled the literature from the medical, health systems research, and health care operations (business and engineering) disciplines to assemble a representative sample of studies in which outpatient health care performance metrics were used to describe the primary or secondary outcome of the research.We identified 2 primary deficiencies in outpatient performance metric definitions: incompletion and inconsistency. From our review of performance metrics, we propose the FASStR framework for the Focus, Activity, Statistic, Scale type, and Reference dimensions of a performance metric. The FASStR framework is a method by which performance metrics can be developed and examined from a multidimensional perspective to evaluate their comprehensiveness and clarity. The framework was tested and revised in an iterative process with both practitioners and investigators.The FASStR framework can guide the design, development, and implementation of operational metrics in outpatient health care settings. Further, this framework can assist investigators in the evaluation of the metrics that they are using. Overall, the FASStR framework can result in clearer, more consistent use and evaluation of outpatient performance metrics.",

The analysis included 896 patients enrolled in CBCM over the course of 2 years (January 2016 to December 2017) and a propensity score-matched cohort of high-cost patients (n = 2152) who received primary care at sites that did not participate in CBCM during the same time period.

Secondary outcomes included utilization by care setting: outpatient, inpatient, emergency department, pharmacy, postacute care, and all other remaining sites. We used zero-inflated gamma and Poisson regression models to estimate average differences in postperiod costs and utilization between CBCM enrollees versus non-CBCM enrollees.We did not observe meaningful differences in total costs or visit frequency among CBCM enrollees relative to non-CBCM enrollees.Although our study found no association between the CBCM program and subsequent cost or utilization outcomes, understanding why these outcomes were not achieved will inform how future Medicaid programs are designed to achieve better patient outcomes and lower costs.",

To understand how ACOs' choice of attribution method affects incentives for care among seriously ill Medicare beneficiaries, this study compares beneficiary characteristics and Medicare per capita expenditures between prospective and retrospective ACO populations.This retrospective, cross-sectional analysis describes survival, patient characteristics, and Medicare spending for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries identified with serious illness (n = 1,600,629) using 100% Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary and MSSP beneficiary files (2014-2016).We used generalized linear models with ACO and year fixed effects to estimate the average within-ACO difference between potential retrospective and prospective ACO populations.Dying in the first 90 days of the performance year was associated with reduced odds of retrospective ACO attribution (odds ratio [OR], 0.24; 95% CI, 0.24-0.25) relative to beneficiaries surviving 270 days or longer. Similarly, hospice use was associated with reduced odds of retrospective assignment (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.79-0.80). Among ACOs that did not achieve shared savings, average per capita Medicare expenditures (after truncation) were $2459 (95% CI, $2192-$2725) higher for prospective vs retrospective ACO populations. The difference was $834 (95% CI, $402-$1266) greater per capita among ACOs that achieved shared savings.The difference in survival and spending for ACO populations captured by prospective vs retrospective attribution methods means that ACOs may need to employ different care management strategies to improve performance depending on their attribution method.",

Office managers and lead nurses were surveyed about their office systems for providing adult immunizations, beliefs about PPV and influenza vaccines, and their own vaccination status. Hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) analyses were used to account for the clustered nature of the data.Sampled patients were most frequently female (61%) and white (83%), and averaged 76 years of age. Weighted vaccination rates were 61.1% for PPV and 52.5% for influenza; rates varied by practice. Using HLM, with patient age and race entered as level 1 variables and office factors entered as level 2 variables, time allotted for an annual well visit was associated with a higher likelihood of influenza vaccination (odds ratio [OR] = 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.02, 1.07; P = .003). Nurse influenza vaccination status was associated with a higher likelihood of PPV vaccination (OR = 3.81; 95% CI = 1.49, 9.78; P = .009).In addition to race and age, visit length and the nurses' vaccination status were associated with adult vaccination rates.

    "abstract": "Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a serious, potentially fatal disease of recurrent swelling of various subcutaneous and submucosal tissues throughout the body. Swelling is mediated by uncontrolled regulation of bradykinin, making it pathologically distinct from other forms of angioedema. Diagnosis can be challenging, but distinctions in clinical presentation and laboratory studies can confirm clinical suspicion. Though the disease is rare, the socioeconomic burden of living with and treating HAE is significant for patients and healthcare systems. As a result, there has been a dramatic expansion of treatment options specifically designed for HAE in recent years. Novel treatments are effective in treating swelling attacks, preventing recurrence, and improving patient quality of life. However, significant differences in the risks, benefits, and cost of treatments must be weighed in the determination of clinical protocols to determine optimal utilization of healthcare resources.",

Dependent variables in the model included age, sex, and the 32 ADGs. The prediction model was externally validated on 30,793 primary care patients. Discrimination and calibrations were assessed by computing C statistics and by visual inspection of the calibration plot, respectively.Our model was able to discriminate very well between complex and noncomplex patients (C statistic = 0.9; 95% CI, 0.88-0.92), whereas the calibration plot suggests that the model provides overestimates of complex patients.With this study, the ACG System has proven to be a useful tool in the identification of patients with complex care needs in primary care, opening up possibilities for tailored interventions of care management for this complex group of patients. Utilizing ADGs, the prediction model that we developed had a very good discriminatory ability to identify those complex patients. However, the calibrating ability of the model still needs improvement.",

Analyses were adjusted for risk scores and fixed effects for the month of dialysis initiation and county of residence.The difference in risk-adjusted 1-year mortality between MA stayers (Medicare beneficiaries who were continuously enrolled in MA prior to dialysis initiation) and TM stayers (those who were continuously enrolled in TM prior to initiating dialysis) was -0.1 percentage points (95% CI, -1.0 to 0.8); however, the difference increased to -1.0 percentage points (95% CI, -3.2 to 1.2) when comparing TM-to-MA switchers (those who switched from TM to MA before initiation) with TM stayers, a comparison more prone to favorable selection bias given our finding that TM-to-MA switchers were healthier than MA stayers.Among Medicare beneficiaries with kidney failure who initiated dialysis, risk-adjusted 1-year mortality rate is not different between MA and TM stayers. If there is remaining favorable selection in MA due to unobserved health status, our finding provides a lower-bound estimate of the MA impact on mortality among beneficiaries with kidney failure.",

However, the evidence on the effectiveness of such models is far from clear. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Community Health Team (CHT) program, a community-based care management program in Rhode Island, had impacts on health care utilization and cost.We used data from 2014 to 2018 to evaluate the effects of the CHT program on health care utilization and cost. Our analytical sample consisted of a total of 12,830 patients, with 2282 in the intervention group and 10,548 in the matched comparison group.We used a combination of propensity score-matched difference-in-differences framework and generalized linear models.The program led to an overall decrease in hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.89; P = .028) and inpatient costs (IRR, 0.79; P = .024). This translates into a reduction of 7 hospitalizations per 1000 people per month and a reduction of inpatient cost of $289 per person per month. Impacts varied considerably across subgroups. For patients with 1 to 2 encounters with the program, there was a significant decrease in emergency department visits, hospitalizations, inpatient cost, outpatient cost, professional cost, and total cost. Although no significant impacts were observed for patients with 3 to 5 encounters with the program, patients with more than 6 encounters with the program saw an increase in pharmacy cost and total cost.There is a need for a tailored approach to addressing patients' needs in primary care.",

Incidence of EPS (diagnosis or medication use) was assessed in the year following AAP initiation. Annual all-cause and schizophrenia-related health care resource utilization (HCRU) and costs were assessed in cohorts who did or did not develop EPS in the year following first EPS claim (EPS cohort) or randomly assigned index date (non-EPS cohort). Multivariate regression was used to compare all-cause and schizophrenia-related total health care costs and inpatient admissions between cohorts.A total of 3558 patients with schizophrenia newly initiating AAPs were identified; 22.1% developed EPS in the year following AAP initiation (incidence: 26.9 cases per 100 person-years). Multivariate analyses revealed that patients with EPS had 34% higher odds of all-cause (odds ratio [OR], 1.3361; 95% CI, 1.0770-1.6575; P < .01) and 84% increased odds of schizophrenia-related (OR, 1.8436; 95% CI, 1.0434-2.4219; P < .0001) inpatient admission compared with the non-EPS cohort. The EPS cohort also evidenced significantly higher adjusted all-cause ($26,632 vs $21,273; P < .001) and schizophrenia-related ($9018 vs $4475; P < .0001) costs compared with the non-EPS cohort.The 20% of patients who developed EPS in the year following AAP initiation evidenced significantly increased HCRU and costs over the postindex period.

We identified patients with HER2-positive early-stage breast cancer (EBC) (n = 159) who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with RTZ or MYL-1401O ± pertuzumab (n = 92) or adjuvant chemotherapy with RTZ or MYL-1401O plus taxane (n = 67) between January 2018 and June 2021, as well as patients with MBC (n = 53) who had received palliative first-line treatment with RTZ or MYL-1401O and docetaxel ± pertuzumab or second-line treatment with RTZ or MYL-1401O and taxane between January 2018 and June 2021.The rate of achieving pathologic complete response in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy was similar between those receiving MYL-1401O and RTZ (62.7% [37/59] and 55.9% [19/34], respectively; P = .509). Progression-free survival (PFS) at 12, 24, and 36 months was similar in the 2 cohorts of the EBC-adjuvant group: 96.3%, 84.7%, and 71.5%, respectively, in patients receiving MYL-1401O, and 100%, 88.5%, and 64.8% in patients receiving RTZ (P = .577).

Study Design: Retrospective analysis using 2012-2017 Medicare enrollment data. Methods: We studied enrollees who joined MA between 2012 and 2016 and identified all enrollees who changed insurers (switched insurance or disenrolled to TM) at least once between the start of enrollment and the end of the study period. We categorized each change as switching insurers or disenrollment to TM, and by whether the previous insurer had exited the market. Results: Among 6,520,169 new MA enrollees, 15.6% had changed insurance within 1 year after enrollment in MA and 49.2% had changed insurance by 5 years. More enrollees switched insurers rather than disenrolled, and most enrollees who changed insurers did not do so as a result of insurer exits. Conclusions: New MA enrollees change insurers at a substantial rate when followed across multiple years. These changes may disincentivize insurers from investing in preventive care and chronic disease management and, as shown in several non-MA populations, may lead to discontinuities in care, increased expenditures, and inferior health outcomes.",

Our objective was to determine whether a patient activation program (Office-Guidelines Applied to Practice [Office-GAP]) plus a mobile health (mHealth) intervention compared with mHealth alone improved medication use and decreased 10-year atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) risk score in patients with T2D. Study Design: Quasi-experimental design; Office-GAP plus mHealth vs mHealth only. Methods: The Office-GAP intervention included (1) a patient activation group visit, (2) provider training, and (3) a decision support checklist used in real time during the encounter. The mHealth intervention included daily text messages for 15 weeks. Patients with T2D (hemoglobin A1c ≥ 8%) attending internal medicine residency clinics were randomly assigned to either the combined Office-GAP + mHealth group (Green) or mHealth-only group (White). After group visits, patients followed up with providers at 2 and 4 months. A generalized estimating equation regression model was used to compare change in medication use and ASCVD risk scores between the 2 arms at 0, 2, and 4 months. Results: Fifty-one patients with diabetes (26 in Green team and 25 in White team) completed the study. The 10-year ASCVD risk score decreased in both groups (Green: –3.23; ,P, = .06; White: –3.98; ,P, = .01).

There was no significant difference in impact of the combined intervention (Office-GAP + mHealth) compared with mHealth alone. Conclusions: Both Office-GAP + mHealth and mHealth alone increased the use of evidence-based medications and decreased 10-year ASCVD risk scores for patients with T2D in 4 months.",

Successful programs have been developed for chronic conditions (eg, heart failure, diabetes, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) that use principles of self-management, monitoring, and care coordination. However, because of the effects of dementia on the mind including behavioral complications, the progressive loss of capacity for affected individuals to participate in care or decision-making, the devastating effects on care partners, and the scope of disease management beyond medical issues, the management of dementia is different and demands different approaches. The success of dementia management will depend upon how well the care provided is able to maximize the function, independence, and dignity of the individual living with dementia while minimizing care partner strain and burnout.",

This study examined the shift from face-to-face to telehealth care around the start of the pandemic (April-July 2020) compared with the same months in 2019 and 2021 and the corresponding 30-day readmission rates. We compared the rates of face-to-face and telehealth TCM as well as face-to-face and telehealth non-TCM services and observed a dramatic shift to telehealth in 2020 with a slight drop-off in 2021. For TCM services specifically, face-to-face visits made up nearly 90% of visits in 2019, whereas telehealth made up the vast majority in 2020 and 2021 at 97.5% and 84.9%, respectively. Over the same time periods, 30-day readmission rates remained steady at 10% along with no changes in 30-day mortality. Among those who completed TCM visits, 30-day readmission rates remained between 8% and 9% and 30-day mortality remained below 1%. These data indicate that this dramatic systemwide shift from face-to-face to telehealth TCM was not accompanied by concurrent changes in either 30-day readmission or mortality rates. Although the findings may be subject to ecologic bias, the data at hand did not allow for reliable estimation of differences in effects of patient-level service delivery type on readmission risk or mortality due to the extremely low volume of face-to-face visits during the pandemic periods. Future research would be needed to conduct such comparisons.",

Results: Medicare eligibility at age 65 years led to significant increases in having any coverage or Medicare coverage: 8.8 percentage points (95% CI, 8.4-9.2) and 78.1 percentage points (95% CI, 74.9-81.4), respectively. However, there were no or small changes in the diagnosis of chronic conditions at age 65 years. Specifically, there were no significant changes in the diagnoses of 17 chronic conditions, and the changes were minor in magnitude. Significant changes were observed only in the diagnosis of stroke and cancer, at –0.6 percentage points (95% CI, –1.0 to –0.2) and –1.7 percentage points (95% CI, –2.8 to –0.6), respectively. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that Medicare coverage did not necessarily lead to increased diagnosis of chronic conditions. Further research is necessary to explore the underlying mechanisms behind this observation.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Transitions of care are pivotal, vulnerable times as patients are discharged from the hospital. Telephonic care coordination is standard care, but labor intensive. We implemented a patient postdischarge digital engagement (PDDE) program to scale coordination. We hypothesized that PDDE could reduce readmissions for low-risk patients and supplement care coordination for medium- and high-risk patients. Study Design: Pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster randomization trial with 5 implementation waves based upon primary care clinic region. Methods: All inpatient hospital discharges between March 2020 and November 2020 were stratified by readmission risk. Low-risk patients were offered access to PDDE, and moderate-risk and high-risk patients were offered access to PDDE and care coordination. Readmission was defined as an unplanned inpatient admission within 30 days from discharge. An intention-to-treat primary analysis was conducted using mixed-effects logistic regression clustering for wave; a treatment-on-the-treated analysis was also conducted to assess the impact among program users. Results: A total of 5490 patient discharges were examined (2735 control; 2755 intervention); 1949 patients were high risk, 2032 were medium risk, and 1509 were low risk. PDDE intervention did not significantly affect readmission among low-risk (95% CI, –0.23 to 0.90; ,P, = .23), medium-risk (95% CI, –0.14 to 0.60; ,P, = .21), and high-risk (95% CI, –0.32 to 0.64; ,P, = .48) groups after adjustment for time and patient factors. In a treatment-on-the-treated analysis, among patients who activated the PDDE program, readmission was also similar among the low-, medium-, and high-risk cohorts. Conclusions: Our study expanded resource-limited care coordination by offering low-risk patients a service they were unable to receive previously while having no impact on readmission. PDDE efficiently provided additional touch points between patients and providers.",

Study Design: Retrospective analysis of 10 price transparency data files from HCA Healthcare. Methods: Cross-sectional qualitative analysis of 524 hospital-insurer contracts across 10 hospitals. Results: We ascertain 4 empirical regularities in these files. First, hospitals contract with many payers, ranging from 35 to 82 across the hospitals in the sample. Second, contract structure varies significantly within and across hospitals: Of the 524 contracts in our sample, the median contract contained 9 contract elements, whereas the mean contract contained 1285 contract elements. Third, most of the contracts in our sample contained multiple contracting methodologies (eg, both fixed fee and percentage of charges). Fourth, these contracts indicated substantial variation for the same service within and across hospitals, validating findings from analyses based on claims data and hospital price transparency files. Conclusions: Hospital-insurer contracts dictate the flow and structure of a significant portion of total health care expenditure in the US. Increased attention by both researchers and policy makers would lead to a greater understanding of this vital—yet understudied—element of the market for hospital services.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture risk calculators (eg, the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool [FRAX]) guide primary prevention care in postmenopausal women. BMD scores use non-Hispanic White (NHW) reference data for T-score classification, whereas FRAX incorporates BMD, clinical risk factors, and population differences when calculating risk. This study compares findings among Asian, Black, and NHW women who underwent osteoporosis screening in a US health care system. Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study. Methods: Asian, Black, and NHW women aged 65 to 75 years who underwent BMD testing (with no recent fracture, osteoporosis therapy, metastatic cancer, multiple myeloma, metabolic bone disorders, or kidney replacement therapy) were compared across the following measures: femoral neck BMD (FN-BMD) T-score (normal ≥ –1, osteoporosis ≤ –2.5), high FRAX 10-year hip fracture risk (FRAX-Hip ≥ 3%), FRAX risk factors, and diabetes status. Results: Among 3640 Asian women, 23.8% had osteoporosis and 8.7% had FRAX-Hip scores of at least 3% (34.5% among those with osteoporosis). Among 11,711 NHW women, 12.3% had osteoporosis and 17.2% had FRAX-Hip scores of at least 3% (84.8% among those with osteoporosis). Among 1711 Black women, 68.1% had normal FN-BMD, 4.1% had BMD-defined osteoporosis, and 1.8% had FRAX-Hip scores of at least 3% (32.4% among those with osteoporosis). Fracture risk factors differed by group. Diabetes was 2-fold more prevalent in Black and Asian (35% and 36%, respectively) vs NHW (16%) women. Conclusions: A large subset of Asian women have discordant BMD and FRAX scores, presenting challenges in osteoporosis management. Furthermore, FN-BMD and especially FRAX scores identified few Black women at high fracture risk warranting treatment. Studies should examine whether fracture risk assessment can be optimized in understudied racial minority populations, particularly when findings are discordant.",

Nurse practitioner (NP) LVC ordering practices among adult patients in outpatient settings are described and compared with those of other health care clinicians. Factors impacting NP ordering practices are also explored. Study Design: Integrative review. Methods: Electronic databases, including MEDLINE's PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Business Source Complete, and Google Scholar were searched for original studies published prior to April 2023. Search terms included relevant keywords pertaining to LVC and NPs. Results were supplemented by a search of the reference lists of included studies. Results: Of the 20 included studies, 7 were of low quality, which limited findings. Results comparing NP LVC ordering practices with those of other health care clinicians were conflicting. When compared with physicians, NPs ordered equal rates of antibiotics in 4 studies and lumbar imaging in 6 studies; they ordered less imaging in 2 studies but more imaging in 1 study. In 1 study, NPs ordered fewer lumbar imaging studies than physician assistants. NPs reported following protocols for prescribing and found that patient education and reassurance were successful in minimizing LVC ordering when managing patient expectations. NP specialization appeared to influence LVC ordering, whereas scope of practice laws had no effect. Conclusions: The full extent to which NPs order LVC services, as well as a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing their decisions, remains unknown. It is unclear whether NPs order fewer or equal LVC services compared with other health care clinicians. More research on NPs and LVC is indicated.",

We assessed persistence among newly treated patients with T2D and documented the impact of persistence on clinical outcomes and costs. Study Design: Retrospective study of Optum Clinformatics Data Mart commercial and Medicare Advantage enrollees from 2007 to 2020. Methods: We identified adult patients who initiated antidiabetic treatments. Patients were required to have at least 1 treatment-free year prior to their first T2D prescription. Persistence was measured as the duration of continuous therapy until a 60-day gap in drug availability appeared in any antidiabetic therapy. Factors associated with duration were documented, focusing on the initial class(es) of T2D drugs. The impact of treatment duration on the risk of hospitalization and on total health care costs was also examined. Results: A total of 673,265 patients were included, with a median follow-up of 7 years. Only 22% of patients maintained continuous treatment, of whom 10% added a second medication. A 1-month increase in duration was associated with reduced risk of hospitalization due to stroke by 0.54% (95% CI, 0.46%-0.60%), acute myocardial infarction by 0.51% (95% CI, 0.44%-0.57%), and all-cause hospitalization by 0.36% (95% CI, 0.34%-0.37%). A 1-month increase in duration was associated with a year-to-year decrease in medical costs of $51 (95% CI, –$54 to –$48) and an increase in year-to-year drug costs of $14 (95% CI, $13-$14). Conclusions: Our findings show low persistence among patients with T2D and emphasize the importance of medication persistence, which is associated with cost savings and lower risk of hospitalizations.",

Although much of the data are publicly available, some of these data items will need to be collected directly from drug companies.

This study aimed to identify DRPs in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and to develop and implement a framework to reduce potential risks associated with drug treatment. Study Design: Prospectively designed quasi-experimental study. Methods: This study consisted of observational (risk assessment and framework development) and interventional (framework implementation) periods and was conducted at a department of cardiovascular surgery in a university hospital. An expert panel evaluated the causes of DRPs. Then a framework was developed in consensus to identify safeguards to be implemented during the interventional period. Results: A total of 200 patients (100 patients per study period) were included. During the observational period, a total of 275 DRPs and 487 causes were identified; 74.5% of DRPs were not solved. For the risk analysis, 487 causes were evaluated and only 32.6% were considered acceptable risk. By implementing the framework in the interventional period, 215 DRPs and 304 causes were identified and 386 interventions were recommended by a clinical pharmacist. A total of 342 (88.6%) interventions were accepted by a health care team, and 128 (59.5%) DRPs were completely solved. For the risk analysis, 304 causes were evaluated and 84.9% were considered acceptable risk (,P, < .001 compared with the observational period). Conclusions: It is possible to reduce risk levels or prevent occurrence of DRPs by implementing a framework for risk management developed by a multidisciplinary care team in areas such as cardiac surgery where time is limited.",

Group-based trajectory models (GBTMs) have been used to better represent adherence over time. This study aims to examine adherence patterns 1 year after initiation among users of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors using GBTMs and evaluate the ability of baseline characteristics to predict adherence trajectory. Study Design: SGLT2 inhibitor new-user cohort study from 2014 to 2018. Methods: We calculated 12-month PDC and categorized patients with PDC of 80% or greater as adherent. We performed multivariable logistic regression on adherence status controlling for baseline covariates. GBTMs were fit to identify adherence patterns 12 months following SGLT2 inhibitor initiation. Five multinomial logistic regression models including different subsets of predictors were used to predict adherence trajectory group assignment. Results: In a cohort of 228,363 SGLT2 inhibitor users, the mean PDC was 57%, with 36% of the cohort being adherent. Overall, women and patients with anxiety or depression were less likely to be adherent. Six patterns of SGLT2 inhibitor adherence were identified with GBTMs: 1 fill (PDC = 0.08), early discontinuation (PDC = 0.22), consistently low adherence (PDC = 0.35), moderate adherence (PDC = 0.48), high adherence (PDC = 0.79), and near-perfect adherence (PDC = 0.95). All prediction models showed poor predictive accuracy (0.35). Conclusions: We found wide variation in adherence patterns among SGLT2 inhibitor users in a national cohort. Predictors from a health care claims database were unable to accurately predict adherence trajectory.",

    "abstract": "The US faces a maternal health crisis as overall maternal mortality rates continue to worsen. HHS, in its Healthy People 2030 report, indicates that women in the US are more likely to die from childbirth than are women in other developed countries. The cost of the maternal health crisis and its associated morbidities is estimated to be $32.3 billion from conception to 5 years postpartum, with $18.7 billion in medical costs and $13.6 billion in nonmedical costs. Under the current health care reimbursement system, health care providers alone have little short-term incentive to bear the cost for solutions or prevention strategies that could change the social and cultural factors affecting maternal outcomes. This article provides an overview of the crisis, along with its economic and societal costs, and the role of prenatal care and premature birth in this escalating problem. The article then proposes maternal navigation for pregnant patients who chronically miss prenatal care appointments as one way to reduce premature births and associated health care costs. Through intentional and focused investment in maternal navigation by payers and providers together, health outcomes can be improved and disparities can be reduced. As a result, payer and provider costs are reduced and the interests of all parties are advanced. A connected system of support that improves health outcomes and reduces health care costs for the most at-risk patients is an essential response to a crisis that affects not only the individual but also society.",

Methods: Propensity score–weighted difference-in-disparities analyses comparing Black-White and Hispanic-White disparities in MA vs TM among near-poor Medicare beneficiaries with incomes between 101% and 250% of the federal poverty level. We assessed differences in cost-related medical care barriers and cost-related dental care barriers as well as receipt of annual eye exams in MA vs TM. Results: For cost-related barriers to medical care, Hispanic-White disparities were narrower by 8.8 (95% CI, –14.0 to –3.6) percentage points in MA relative to TM but differences in Black-White disparities were not statistically significant. MA was not associated with narrower differences in Hispanic-White or Black-White disparities in dental care access. Higher proportions of Black and Hispanic beneficiaries in MA received an annual eye exam vs White beneficiaries in both MA and TM. MA was associated with narrower racial disparities primarily compared with TM without supplemental insurance. Conclusions: Among near-poor Black and Hispanic Medicare beneficiaries, MA was associated with greater use of vision care and narrowing of some disparities in cost-related access barriers vs TM. However, MA did not uniformly narrow racial/ethnic disparities in access and use. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining and enhancing features of Medicare coverage that may promote equitable access to care, including additional benefits and lower cost sharing.",

Study Design: Retrospective cross-sectional analysis of 48.3 million patients receiving Medicaid and their acute care visits across 34 states and the District of Columbia in 2019. Methods: Descriptive analyses of county-level variations in emergency department visits and hospitalizations (acute care) for ACSCs, and multivariate regressions of proximity to and density of health facility infrastructure as correlates to utilization and spending. Regression models were adjusted for county-level poverty rates, chronic disease rates, and state fixed effects. Results: Among the studied patient population receiving Medicaid, nearly 40% of acute care visits were for ACSCs, with variations across and within states. Rates ranged from 17.8 per 1000 member-months in Vermont to 39.0 in Mississippi, and from 5.9 to 77.9 between counties within states. Longer distances to the nearest urgent care center and primary care shortage area designation correlated to higher acute care visits for ACSCs (+ 4.3 per 1000 member-months for every 100 miles; 95% CI, 2.9-5.7; ,P, < .001; +1.5 per 1000 member-months if shortage area; 95% CI, 0.4-2.6; ,P, = .006). Counties with more rural health clinics had fewer acute care visits for ACSCs (–3.4 fewer visits per rural clinic per 1000 population; 95% CI, –4.6 to –2.2; ,P, < .001). Among 6 states with additional spending data, 4.2% of total Medicaid spending was attributable to acute care visits for ACSCs. Conclusions: Our evaluation revealed more than 13-fold variation in acute care utilization for ACSCs between Medicaid counties within the same state. Proximity to urgent care facilities and density of rural health clinics were major explanatory variables for these variations, underscoring the importance of local health infrastructure in reducing acute care utilization for ACSCs.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Despite widespread efforts to reduce emergency department (ED) visits, patients newly diagnosed with cancer often use the ED for commonly anticipated acute care needs. Existing delivery innovations to reduce ED use are underused, and reasons for this are not understood. Patients who recently visited the ED may provide insights into these patterns of care. Study Design: Qualitative study of semistructured patient interviews from April 2019 to April 2022. Methods: We interviewed patients diagnosed with cancer within the prior 6 months from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and its academically affiliated but clinically distinct safety-net health system Parkland Health who had recently visited their respective ED. We completed 29 interviews in English and 11 in Spanish, then analyzed the interviews with the constant comparative method. Results: Nearly all patients were unaware of, but interested in using, 24/7 telephone triage and oncology urgent care clinics. Safety-net patients, especially Spanish-preferring patients, reported less access to outpatient cancer teams. Patients did not weigh symptom severity to decide between sites of care, but insured patients were concerned about the cost of hospital visits. Patients did not look forward to visiting the ED but understood its advantages, and for safety-net patients, the ED was the main way to access physicians. When patients were discharged home, they were relieved not to be hospitalized, and the good clinical experience inadvertently reinforced future ED use. Conclusions: Even robust education programs for patients with cancer may have difficulty conveying the availability of innovative clinical services. Patient perspectives on avoidable ED visits may differ from policy makers' definitions.",

We documented the growing rate of counseling and psychotherapy use in the decade prior to turning age 65 years among subsequent cohorts aging into Medicare. We characterized how this growth varied across demographic groups, income levels, and mental and physical health status. Study Design: We present trends using data from the 2002-2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey Household Component. Methods: We categorized individuals into 5-year Medicare entry cohorts based on the year they turned age 65 years. Our outcome was an indicator for having a visit for counseling or psychotherapy in a given year. Employing a probit regression, we characterized visit rates across 5-year cohorts, presenting both unadjusted and covariate-adjusted results. We ran stratified regressions by subpopulations. Results: Our sample included 54,666 individuals aged 55 to 64 years, weighted to be nationally representative. The cohort aging into Medicare between 2021 and 2025 was 88% (95% CI, 57%-119%) more likely to have a counseling or psychotherapy visit between the ages of 55 and 64 years compared with the cohort that gained eligibility for Medicare between 2006 and 2010 at the same age. Growth in utilization was pervasive across many subpopulations. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that more recent cohorts aging into Medicare seek significantly more counseling and psychotherapy than prior cohorts. This increased utilization is pervasive across subpopulations, suggesting that plans must prepare to accommodate the needs of new Medicare entrants.",

Methods: The primary outcome was a mutually exclusive categorical variable that described the type of quality metrics for which providers received feedback in the past year: HPV vaccine, other pediatric vaccinations, other quality metrics, or none.

    "abstract": "The US is facing a growing epidemic of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with over 2.5 million cases of chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis reported in 2021 and again in 2022. This public health crisis disproportionately affects youth and racial and ethnic minority communities, exacerbating barriers to accessing sexual health services. Untreated STIs can lead to severe health consequences, including infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease, and increased risk of HIV transmission and acquisition. Managed care organizations (MCOs) within Medicaid play a pivotal role in improving sexual health service delivery and addressing the rise in STIs. This commentary explores opportunities for Medicaid MCOs to enhance STI prevention, screening, and treatment. It was informed by reviews of Medicaid managed care contracts, plan provider manuals, and interviews with Medicaid plan officials and other experts. It presents a set of opportunities to enhance STI prevention, including incentivizing syphilis screening during pregnancy through existing perinatal and maternal health efforts, leveraging extended postpartum coverage for sexual health education, integrating STI services with substance use disorder programs, supporting community-based organizations that serve relevant communities, training community-facing workers in STI care and sexual health, coordinating with local health departments, and providing enrollee access to condoms and home STI tests. Implementing these strategies could reduce STI rates and improve health outcomes, particularly among vulnerable populations. Although this commentary draws on research focused on Medicaid MCOs, a coordinated approach that includes commercial plans and coordination with health departments could ultimately enhance the consistency and quality of STI services and sexual health care across the health care system.",

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS The study used publicly available data released by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to generate snapshots of formulary coverage and enrollment levels in each plan year. The analysis included all Part D plans and tracked formulary coverage of 152 of the most common brand name and generic drugs prescribed to seniors. RESULTS Since 2006, the number of products available without restriction has increased and the number of drugs not on formulary has decreased. However, it appears that beneficiaries (subsidized beneficiaries in particular) may not be using their open-enrollment periods to reevaluate the available plan offerings. CONCLUSIONS Beneficiaries need to reevaluate the Part D options available on an annual basis to maintain enrollment with the most appropriate plan available. Although all plans meet the proscribed formulary requirements, some plans offer richer drug coverage with more drugs available on an unrestricted basis. Benchmark plan status allows Part D plans to maintain or gain significant Medicare enrollment from year to year. Careful oversight should be provided to ensure that the level of formulary coverage offered at benchmark and other plans remains consistent.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate factors affecting adherence to inhaled therapy in patients with asthma to further identify the determinants most closely associated with adherence to inhaled therapy for asthma, especially inhaled glucocorticosteroids (ICS).A 2-stage study was conducted. In stage 1, we performed nonassumptive deep-dive qualitative scoping to investigate the determinants of poor adherence in patients with asthma, and in stage 2 we developed a new questionnaire for cross-sectional surveys to obtain more accurate information about critical issues related to asthma management.Patients with asthma who were 18 years and older in the outpatient clinic of The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from November 2016 to January 2018 were investigated.In the 350 patients with asthma recruited, 32% of patients showed good adherence, whereas 68% of patients displayed poor adherence to inhaled therapy due to various reasons. Further analysis indicated that inadequate understanding of asthma treatment and control, poor self-management, financial burden, adverse reactions, and the fear of potential adverse reactions were significant independent risk factors for poor ICS inhalation adherence in patients with asthma.Our research shows that many patients with asthma in western China have poor disease control and poor inhalation therapy adherence. We hope this research can alert clinicians and help them identify patients who may be experiencing uncontrolled asthma due to poor adherence to inhaled therapy, and we suggest that clinicians help those patients obtain appropriate information about asthma control and self-management.",

Additional covariates adjustment was used to minimize residual imbalance.Utilization and cost data were compared between individuals enrolled vs individuals eligible for but not enrolled in the DCR program using a standard mean difference. Individuals were employees or their dependents from self-insured companies throughout the United States. Outcomes included adherence to the care standards, service utilization, and costs.A total of 3318 propensity-matched participants were included. Primary analysis revealed that enrolled members increased adherence to semiannual glycated hemoglobin, annual lipid, and annual urine albumin-creatinine ratio testing. Additionally, enrolled members experienced less utilization of high-acuity services and increased rates of physician visits. In a secondary analysis, the enrolled group was associated with greater pharmaceutical costs but lower medical costs.A behavioral science- and incentive-based diabetes management program was associated with greater rates of adherence to recommended diabetes monitoring care standards, increased routine clinic visits, decreased hospital admissions, and decreased inpatient days. Anticipated increases in pharmaceutical expenditures were offset by overall lower medical expenditures. Results indicate the economic benefits of adherence to evidence-based standards for diabetes care.",

Maryland's \"total coverage\" proposal could receive a credit from Medicare to offset Medicaid investments in treatments that could lead to Medicare savings. This study analyzes the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of total coverage for HCV treatments sponsored by state Medicare and Medicaid.A Markov model simulated patients going through the care continuum of HCV. The model simulated 3 pathways: standard coverage with a 50% probability of screening for HCV and 20% probability of treatment; risk-stratified total coverage with assumed 80% probability of screening and 60% treatment rate; and total coverage with assumed 80% probability of screening and 100% treatment rate.The model calculated US$ and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to produce an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio evaluated at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY. The budget impact for the state of Maryland was calculated in terms of per member per year.Total coverage and risk-stratified coverage saved $158 per patient and $178 per patient, respectively, compared with standard care at an increased effectiveness of 0.05 and 0.02 QALYs over 25 years. Total coverage and risk-stratified total coverage would save $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, after 25 years.Medicare-Medicaid partnerships to pay for all HCV treatments today represent good value and a low budget impact. States with trouble covering HCV treatments should consider using this model to plan coverage decisions.",

One way to reduce the cost of care is by identifying and reducing low-value care (LVC): patient care that offers little to no benefit in specific clinical scenarios, adds cost, and may, through adverse effects or adverse outcomes, actually harm patients. The authors have been involved in identifying and reducing LVC for more than 15 years and have created a practical, 10-step approach to effectively integrate LVC reduction programs into medical systems. The approach has been tested, with results reported in peer-reviewed journals. Key steps include assembling accurate, meaningful data; creating simple yet dramatic practitioner reports; learning to identify and manage the stages of change; and developing an outreach strategy anchored in nonjudgmental communication, explicit core values, and a well-articulated reason to focus on reducing LVC.",

    "abstract": "Activity OverviewIron deficiency anemia (IDA) is closely linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Treatment often consists of iron replacement therapy, and novel intravenous (IV) iron formulations have impacted the management of patients with both IBD and IDA.Managed care professionals must understand the role of IV iron in treating patients with IBD and IDA, as well as safety and efficacy considerations.This activity will review the role of IV iron replacement in IBD and IDA and focus on the economic burden of these disease states and the impact of IV iron on healthcare resource use. Statement of Educational NeedInflammation in the gastrointestinal tract can result in iron deficiency anemia (IDA), which is the most common complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Treatment options for IBD can also contribute to the condition, with between 36% and 90% of patients with IBD developing IDA.These patients experience higher rates of hospitalization, longer lengths of stay, and high healthcare costs.Managed care professionals should be familiar with newer intravenous (IV) iron replacement therapies that are entering the treatment landscape of iron deficiency in IBD with the potential to reduce healthcare resource utilization and lessen disease severity for patients.The market for IV iron is expected to increase considerably through 2026, and payers must be equipped to address challenges affecting utilization of and access to these therapies, such as ensuring access to infusions when products require higher doses.To appropriately individualize the treatment of IDA in patients with IBD, managed care professionals must recognize the indications, risks, and benefits of IV iron replacement therapies to develop and implement evidence-based pathways and management plans. Educational ObjectivesUpon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: • Examine the biologic pathways relevant to iron hemostasis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as well as appropriate monitoring of iron status.• Compare iron replacement therapies, including risks and benefits, for the treatment of patients with IBD and iron deficiency.• Explore the health-related quality of life and economic burden of iron deficiency anemia in relation to the evolving evidence-based treatment protocols for patients with IBD and iron deficiency to improve outcomes and efficiently allocate healthcare resources.",

We adopted group-based trajectory modeling to identify medication adherence trajectories over 12 months. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to evaluate the unadjusted and adjusted associations of IMT medication and adherence trajectory categories. All analyses accounted for treatment option selection bias with inverse probability treatment weighting.Of 1555 individuals, 73% of the sample used ICS/LABA for IMT. Four medication adherence trajectories were observed regardless of regimen: (1) persistent high adherence (12.0%), (2) progression to high adherence (20.8%), (3) progression to low adherence (10.5%), and (4) persistent low adherence (56.7%). Those who were initiated on ICS/LABA were less likely to have persistent low adherence (unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.44; 95% CI, 0.29-0.67) compared with those initiated on ICS monotherapy when \"persistent high adherence\" was used as the reference group. The relationship remained significant in adjusted regressions (adjusted OR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.24-0.59).Real-world evidence suggests that using ICS/LABA for IMT may decrease the likelihood of persistent low adherence over time among older adults with ACO compared with ICS monotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Cancer remains the second leading cause of death in the United States despite decades of treatment advances. While death rates have fallen for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers, death rates remain high for the majority of malignancies, primarily given the late stage at which they are diagnosed. The US Preventive Services Task Force currently recommends routine screening for just 4 cancers: breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung (for high-risk individuals); for prostate cancer, recommendations support individual decision making. However, cancers without recommended screening tests account for 71% of cancer deaths in the United States. In addition, screening rates remain below national goals, with numerous barriers to population-based screening. Recently, initial results of studies on blood-based multicancer early detection tests, which rely on measurement of a range of analytes, demonstrate the potential to identify multiple cancers in a single blood test and detect many cancers for which no screening tests are currently recommended. Blood-based tests have the potential to be more accessible and easier to disseminate than organ-specific tests. However, it remains unclear if their use can reduce deaths from these cancers. Other issues include cost-effectiveness, the impact of false-positive and false-negative results on patients and costs, and uptake among individuals and clinicians. Research and development of blood-based multicancer early detection tests continue.",

We also examined the factors associated with high and low rates of early use.Early use rates of sacubitril/valsartan were low: 1.9% in 2016, 3.3% in 2017, and 4.0% in 2018. Even after controlling for out-of-pocket co-payments, there was substantial geographic variation in early use, with most early use concentrated in the Northeast and South.There has been substantial variation in the early diffusion of sacubitril/valsartan.

Two reviewers independently extracted study population source and criteria for high-risk designation, segmentation method, data types included, model selection criteria, and model results from the identified studies.Our search identified 224 articles, 12 of which met criteria for full review. Of these, 8 segmented high-risk patients and 4 segmented diagnoses without assigning patients to unique groups. Studies segmenting patients more often had clinically interpretable results. Common groups were defined by high prevalence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, psychiatric conditions including substance use disorders, and neurologic disease (eg, stroke). Few studies incorporated patients' functional or social factors. Resulting patient and diagnosis clusters varied in ways closely linked to the model inputs, patient population inclusion criteria, and health care system context.Empiric segmentation can yield clinically relevant groups of patients with complex medical needs. Segmentation results are context dependent, suggesting the need for careful design and interpretation of segmentation models to ensure that results can inform clinical care and program design in the target setting.",

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis of patients' EMR drug profiles at a 46-bed hospital in Washington state. METHODS Patients' drug profiles were compared against hospital staff interviews. Drug profiles listing each medication the patient was taking, without listing drugs the patient was not taking, exhibited perfect accuracy. We evaluated associations between errors of commission and omission, copayment status between errors of commission and omission, and associations between errors of commission in primary and secondary sections of the drug profiles. RESULTS Demographics of study patients are similar to previously published research, and accuracy outcomes seem to be better than those of previously published studies. Fifty-six percent of drug profiles in our study hospital exhibited perfect accuracy. Errors of commission and omission were unassociated with copayment status; errors of commission in the primary section of the drug profile were unassociated with errors of commission in the secondary section of the drug profile. CONCLUSIONS A medication reconciliation program may have led to a high rate of perfectly accurate drug profiles; while its purpose is to increase accuracy and to decrease errors, it may also assist in reducing adverse drug events. Results show that copayment amounts influence drug utilization; these may be associated with errors of commission and omission and not simply with copayment status.",

    "abstract": "According to the American Heart Association, 7.9 million Americans have a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and 450,000 deaths occur each year in the US because of new and recurrent MI.1 Readmissions after MI are common and costly; for example, 30-day all-cause readmission after MI in 2006-2008 Medicare was 22.5%, 24.8%, and 23.0% among elderly White, Black, and Hispanic patients, respectively.2,3 Previous research on readmissions has focused primarily on 30-day all-cause readmission and has examined the association between readmissions and hospital-level factors. The focus on 30-day readmissions was stimulated in part because under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), Congress directed the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to reduce payments to hospitals with higher-than-expected 30-day readmission rates. However, as a recent article notes,4 the policymakers’ emphasis on 30-day readmission may be misguided, because the majority of readmissions take place outside the 30-day window; and patient-level factors outside the hospital's control may drive a considerable part of hospital readmission rates, especially for longer term readmission.\r\n\r\nOne key patient-level factor affecting readmission rates is believed to be patients’ compliance to essential medications, including β-blockers, lipid-lowering agents, aspirins, and either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB). Because these drugs have been shown very effective by clinical trials, they have become important components of lifelong medical therapy for these patients.5 Clinical guidelines now recommend that all patients with an acute MI receive these medications.6\r\n\r\nPrevious studies have shown that better medication adherence could reduce medical spending, 7-11 partially due to reduced hospitalization and emergency department use. However, previous researchers measured adherence and expenditures concurrently. Adherence has to be measured during a specific time period, while as readmissions can occur at any time during that period. We expect that readmissions are more likely to be influenced by drug adherence a short time before the reference period. In other words, both adherence and the likelihood of readmission are time-dependent variables. To solve the problem of time dependent variables, we use a retrospective nested case-control study design to examine the relationship between adherence and readmission 1-year post MI. This method is commonly used in medicine and health service research, but it has not been used to study adherence and readmission. We hypothesize that patients with better 6-month adherence to essential medications used to treat MI are less likely to have down-stream readmissions related to heart diseases.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To evaluate whether one summary metric of calculator performance sufficiently conveys equity across different demographic subgroups, as well as to evaluate how calculator predictive performance affects downstream health outcomes. Study Design: We evaluate 3 commonly used clinical calculators—Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD), CHA2DS2-VASc, and simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index (sPESI)—on the cohort extracted from the Stanford Medicine Research Data Repository, following the cohort selection process as described in respective calculator derivation papers. Methods: We quantified the predictive performance of the 3 clinical calculators across sex and race. Then, using the clinical guidelines that guide care based on these calculators' output, we quantified potential disparities in subsequent health outcomes. Results: Across the examined subgroups, the MELD calculator exhibited worse performance for female and White populations, CHA2DS2-VASc calculator for the male population, and sPESI for the Black population. The extent to which such performance differences translated into differential health outcomes depended on the distribution of the calculators' scores around the thresholds used to trigger a care action via the corresponding guidelines. In particular, under the old guideline for CHA2DS2-VASc, among those who would not have been offered anticoagulant therapy, the Hispanic subgroup exhibited the highest rate of stroke. Conclusions: Clinical calculators, even when they do not include variables such as sex and race as inputs, can have very different care consequences across those subgroups. These differences in health care outcomes across subgroups can be explained by examining the distribution of scores and their calibration around the thresholds encoded in the accompanying care guidelines.",

Time-stamped EHR-based audit log events for each week were used to create event frequencies and represented as a term frequency-inverse document frequency matrix. Primary classification outcome of interest was a physician's clinical work setting. Performance of multiple supervised machine learning classifiers were evaluated.A total of 24 attending physicians were included; physicians performed a median (IQR) of 2545 (906-5071) EHR-based actions per week and worked a median (IQR) of 5 (3-7) weeks in a surgical ICU. A random forest classifier yielded the best discriminative performance (mean [SD] area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.88 [0.05]; mean [SD] area under precision-recall curve, 0.72 [0.13]). Model explanations illustrated that clinical activities related to signing of clinical notes, printing handoff data, and updating diagnosis information were associated with the positive prediction of working in a surgical ICU setting.A random forest classifier using a frequency-based feature engineering approach successfully predicted work settings of physicians with multiple clinical responsibilities with high accuracy. These findings highlight opportunities for using audit logs for automated assessment of clinician activities and their work settings, thereby affording the ability to accurately assess context-specific work characteristics (eg, workload).",

We examine whether Medicaid comprehensive managed care (CMC) and fee for service (FFS) had different rates of POHS during pediatric medical visits. Study Design: Observational study using claims data (2009-2012). Methods: Using repeated cross-sections of 2009-2012 Florida Medicaid data for children 3.5 years or younger, we examined pediatric medical visits. We estimated a weighted logistic regression model to compare POHS rates among visits reimbursed by CMC and FFS Medicaid. The model controlled for FFS (vs CMC), years Florida had a policy allowing POHS in medical settings, an interaction between these 2 variables, and additional child- and county-level characteristics. Results are presented as regression-adjusted predictions. Results: Among 1,765,365 weighted well-child medical visits in Florida, POHS were included in 8.33% of CMC-reimbursed visits and 9.67% of FFS-reimbursed visits. Compared with FFS, CMC-reimbursed visits had a nonsignificant 1.29-percentage-point lower adjusted probability of including POHS (,P, = .25). When examining differences over time, although the POHS rate was 2.72 percentage points lower for CMC-reimbursed visits after 3 years of policy enactment (,P, = .03), rates were similar overall and increased over time. Conclusions: POHS rates among pediatric medical visits in Florida were similar for visits paid via FFS and CMC, with low rates that increased modestly over time. Our findings are important because more children continue to be enrolled in Medicaid CMC.",

Data from ALL Kids, Alabama’s Children’s Health Insurance Program, were used to evaluate the relationship between community-level social determinants of health (SDOH) and pediatric emergency department (ED) use and differences in these associations by age and race. Study Design: This was a retrospective, pooled cross-sectional analysis. Methods: We used ALL Kids data to identify ED visits (injury and all-cause) among children who were enrolled at any time from 2015 to 2017. Exploratory factor analysis was used to categorize SDOH from 18 selected Census tract–level variables. Multilevel Poisson regression models were used to evaluate the effects of community and individual factors and their interactions. Results: Census tract–level SDOH were grouped as low socioeconomic status (SES), urbanicity, and immigrant-density factors. Low SES and urbanicity factors were associated with ED visits (injury and all-cause). The low SES and urbanicity factors also moderated the association between race and ED visits (injury and all-cause). Conclusions: The environment in which children live influences their ED use; however, the impact varies by age, race, and Census tract factors. Further studies should focus on specific community factors to better understand the relationship among SDOH, individual characteristics, and ED utilization.",

Our first analysis assessed changes in utilization for patients with sepsis without COVID-19 prior to vs during the pandemic. Our second analysis assessed cost and utilization changes during the pandemic for patients with sepsis or pneumonia both with and without COVID-19. Study Design: A retrospective case-control study was utilized to determine differences in cost and utilization for patients with sepsis or pneumonia, relative to a COVID-19 diagnosis. Methods: Claims data from 8 teaching hospitals participating in sepsis and pneumonia episodes in the Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced (BPCIA) model were utilized. BPCIA is a Medicare value-based care bundled payment program that aims to decrease costs and increase quality of care through a 90-day total cost of care model. Results: The first analysis (N = 1092) found that non–COVID-19 patients with sepsis had 26% higher hospice utilization (,P, < .05) and 38% higher mortality (,P, < .0001) during the pandemic vs the prepandemic period. The second analysis (N = 640) found that during the pandemic, patients with sepsis or pneumonia with COVID-19 had 70% more skilled nursing facility (SNF) use (,P, < .0001), 132% higher SNF costs (,P, < .0001), and 21% higher total episode costs (,P, < .0001) compared with patients without COVID-19. Conclusions: COVID-19 has affected care patterns for all patients. Patients without COVID-19 postponed care and used lower-acuity care settings, whereas patients with COVID-19 were more costly and utilized postacute care at a higher rate. These analyses inform future care coordination initiatives, given the ongoing pandemic.",

This study assessed health care utilization and cost patterns for mental health diagnoses according to wage category among employees with health insurance. Study Design: This was an observational, retrospective cohort study for the year 2017 among 2,386,844 adult full-time employees (254,851 with mental health disorders; subgroup of 125,247 with depression) enrolled in self-insured plans in the IBM Watson Health MarketScan research database. Methods: Participants were stratified into annual wage categories: $34,000 or less; more than $34,000 to $45,000; more than $45,000 to $69,000; more than $69,000 to $103,000; and more than $103,000.

Results: Prevalence of diagnosed mental health disorders was 10.7% (9.3% in the lowest-wage category); prevalence of depression was 5.2% (4.2% in the lowest-wage category). Severity of mental health, and specifically depression episodes, was greater in lower-wage categories. All-cause utilization of health care services was higher in patients with mental health diagnoses vs the total population. Among patients with mental health diagnoses, specifically depression, utilization was highest in the lowest- vs highest-wage category for hospital admissions, emergency department visits, and prescription drug supply (all ,P ,< .0001).

    "abstract": "Objectives: The share of Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans with a preferred pharmacy network has grown from less than 9% in 2011 to 98% in 2021. This article assesses the financial incentives that such networks created for unsubsidized and subsidized beneficiaries and their pharmacy switching. Study Design: We analyzed prescription drug claims data for a nationally representative 20% sample of Medicare beneficiaries from 2010 through 2016. Methods: We evaluated the financial incentives for using preferred pharmacies by simulating unsubsidized and subsidized beneficiaries’ annual out-of-pocket spending differentials between using nonpreferred and preferred pharmacies for all their prescriptions. We then compared beneficiaries’ use of pharmacies before and after their plans adopted preferred networks. We also examined the amount of money that beneficiaries left on the table under such networks, based on their pharmacy use. Results: Unsubsidized beneficiaries faced substantial incentives—on average, $147 annually in out-of-pocket spending—and moderately switched toward preferred pharmacies, whereas subsidized beneficiaries were insulated from the incentives and demonstrated little switching. Among those who continued to mainly use nonpreferred pharmacies (half of the unsubsidized and about two-thirds of the subsidized), on average, the unsubsidized paid more out of pocket ($94) relative to if they had used preferred pharmacies, whereas Medicare bore the extra spending ($170) for the subsidized through cost-sharing subsidies. Conclusions: Preferred networks have important implications for beneficiaries’ out-of-pocket spending and the low-income subsidy program. Further research is needed about the impact on the quality of beneficiaries’ decision-making and cost savings to fully evaluate preferred networks.",

The mean (SD) Area Deprivation Index score was 54.4 (26), indicating that the majority of patients lived in disadvantaged neighborhoods. Patients with food insecurity were less likely to have a provider office visit (P < .001) but were expected to have 2.1 times greater acute health care utilization within 90 days (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.12; 95% CI, 1.90-2.37; P < .001) compared with those without food insecurity. Living in a disadvantaged neighborhood had a small effect on acute health care utilization (IRR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.08-1.17; P < .001).When considering social determinants of health for health system patients, food insecurity was a stronger predictor of acute health care utilization than was neighborhood disadvantage. Identifying patients with food insecurity and targeting appropriate interventions to high-risk populations may improve provider follow-up and acute health care utilization.",

We found that 340B-participating hospitals and non–rural referral center (RRC) hospitals that reported owning rural health clinics were less likely to administer the lower-cost biosimilars, whereas the opposite was true for hospitals that are RRCs. To our knowledge, our study offers a first look at an underappreciated source of disparities in access to lower-cost medications such as biosimilars. Results from our study reveal opportunities for targeted policies to encourage adoption of lower-cost treatments, particularly among hospitals that serve rural communities where patients often have fewer choices in care site.",

Generalized linear models estimated per-patient per-month (PPPM) costs during 1L treatment, and adjusted cost differences in 1L among treatment cohorts were calculated using recycled predictions.A total of 1317 IO-, 5315 CT-, and 1522 IO+CT-treated patients were identified. Utilization of CT declined from 72.3% to 47.6% between 2017 and 2019, replaced by use of IO+CT, which increased from 1.8% to 29.8%. Total PPPM costs in 1L were highest with IO+CT at $32,436, compared with $19,000 and $17,763 in the CT and IO cohorts, respectively. Adjusted analyses showed that PPPM costs were $13,933 (95% CI, $11,760-$16,105) higher in the IO+CT vs IO cohort (P < .001) and IO costs were $1024 (95% CI, $67-$1980) lower than CT (P = .04).IO+CT accounts for almost one-third of 1L aNSCLC treatment modalities, coinciding with a reduction in treatment with CT. Costs for patients treated with IO were lower than those for patients treated with both IO+CT and CT alone, driven primarily by antineoplastic drug and associated medical costs.",

The mean (SE) 7-day per-episode cost among employees and beneficiaries was lower for OnDemand encounters at $379.76 ($19.83) relative to non-OnDemand encounters at $493.49 ($25.53), a mean per-episode savings of $113.73 (95% CI, $50.36-$177.10; P < .001).

The hospital's emergency coordination and response efforts emphasized addressing patients' difficulties in obtaining medical care and hospitalization in the region and keeping the mortality rate of patients with pneumonia to a minimal level. It has been emulated by sister hospitals and was well received by the local populace and municipal government. The hospital made the following significant alterations and modifications to this emergency medical care: (1) immediate establishment of the General ICU (GICU), a temporary unit set up in emergency situations that had most of the functions of but was not as complete as the ICU and had a lower ratio of doctors to nurses; (2) dynamic adjustment of anesthesiologists and respiratory physicians jointly stationed in the GICU; (3) choice of nurses with extensive experience in internal medicine and allocation to the GICU according to a 2:3 ICU bed to nurse ratio; (4) emergency purchase or deployment of pneumonia-related treatment equipment; (5) implementation of the GICU resident rotation system; (6) \"twinning\" of internal medicine and other departments to add beds; and (7) implementation of uniform hospital bed allocation for inpatients.",

We highlight the importance of measuring patient engagement and intervention dosage in program evaluation. Study Design: We performed a secondary analysis of data collected between 2014 and 2018 as part of a randomized controlled trial of the Camden Coalition’s signature care management intervention. Our analytical sample consisted of 393 patients. Methods: We calculated a time-invariant cumulative dosage rank based on the number of hours spent by care teams working with or on behalf of patients and then divided patients into low- and high-dosage groups. We applied propensity score reweighting to compare hospital utilization outcomes between patients in these 2 groups. Results: Compared with patients in the low-dosage group, those in the high-dosage group had a lower readmission rate at 30 (21.6% vs 36.6%; ,P, < .001) and 90 (41.7% vs 55.2%; ,P, = .003) days post enrollment.

Conclusions: Our study elucidates a gap in how care management programs for patients with complex health and social needs are evaluated. Although the study shows an association between intervention dosage and care management outcomes, patients’ medical complexity and social circumstances are among the factors that can attenuate the dose-response relationship over time.",

As upper and lower motor neurons fail, inability to transmit messages to the muscles causes muscle stiffness, atrophy, and wasting. The incidence of this incurable disease is increasing in the United States, and its prognosis is grim. On average, patients survive about 3 to 5 years from symptom onset. Until recently, few risk factors were known, but some are newly emerging. About 10% of cases are related to genetic variants. Patients who develop ALS often experience diagnostic delays (10-16 months on average), and its heterogeneity contributes to that delay. Diagnosis is based primarily on clinical signs and symptoms and exclusion of other causes of motor neuron dysfunction. Reliable, accessible biomarkers are needed to aid early ALS diagnosis, differentiate from ALS-mimicking diseases, predict survival, and monitor disease progression and treatment response. Misdiagnosing ALS can have devastating consequences, including unnecessary emotional burden, delayed and/or inappropriate treatment, and undue financial burden. The grim prognosis and sure progression to death creates considerable burden and reduces quality of life for patients and caregivers.",

Analyses assessed the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of physical and, separately, mental health scales.Among HCHN adults, the physical health scale exhibited robust measure validity, reliability, and responsiveness across all age groups; the mental health scale did not. Mean physical health was 1.25 SDs lower in HCHN vs other patients (37.9 vs 51.0 on a 0-100 scale increasing in self-perceived health; pooled SD, 10.5). Regressions indicated that a 0.5-SD increase in year 1 physical health among HCHN adults predicted a 5-percentage-point (10%) decrease in the probability of top decile health spending in year 2. In contrast to health care spending, HRQOL did not exhibit reversion to the mean in HCHN patients.Patient-reported health outcomes remain poor in HCHN populations, even after health care utilization recedes.

This study investigates statin prescribing in primary care patients with NAFLD to identify opportunities to address cardiovascular disease risk in this cohort. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study of primary care electronic health record data from 2012-2018. Methods: This cohort included 652 patients with radiographic evidence of hepatic steatosis and no evidence of competing chronic liver disease. A statin prescription identified at any time during the study period was the primary outcome. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to evaluate the association of clinical signals and comorbidities with statin prescribing. Results: Of the 652 patients in the NAFLD cohort, 56% received a statin prescription during the study period.

    "abstract": "Objectives: Readmission is common and costly for hospitalized Medicaid patients with diabetes. We aimed to develop a model predicting risk of 30-day readmission in Medicaid patients with diabetes hospitalized for any cause. Study Design: Using 2016-2019 Medicaid claims from 7 US states, we identified patients who (1) had a diagnosis of diabetes or were prescribed any diabetes drug, (2) were hospitalized for any cause, and (3) were discharged to home or to a nonhospice facility. For each encounter, we assessed whether the patient was readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Methods: Applying least absolute shrinkage and selection operator variable selection, we included demographic data and claims history in a logistic regression model to predict 30-day readmission. We evaluated model fit graphically and measured predictive accuracy by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: Among 69,640 eligible patients, there were 129,170 hospitalizations, of which 29,410 (22.8%) were 30-day readmissions. The final model included age, sex, age-sex interaction, past diagnoses, US state of admission, number of admissions in the preceding year, index admission type, index admission diagnosis, discharge status, length of stay, and length of stay–sex interaction. The observed vs predicted plot showed good fit. The estimated AUROC of 0.761 was robust in analyses that assessed sensitivity to a range of model assumptions. Conclusions: Our model has moderate power for identifying hospitalized Medicaid patients with diabetes who are at high risk of readmission. It is a template for identifying patients at risk of readmission and for adjusting comparisons of 30-day readmission rates among sites or over time.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: First, to examine 7 large Medicare Advantage (MA) plans’ use of step therapy. Second, to compare step therapy that health plans imposed in their MA and commercial (employer) drug coverage policies. Study Design: Database analysis. Methods: Using data from the Tufts Medical Center Specialty Drug Evidence and Coverage Database, we evaluated 7 large MA plans’ use of step therapy in their Part B drug coverage policies. First, we determined the frequency with which different MA plans applied step therapy. Second, we determined the frequency with which plans imposed step therapy protocols across ,International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification, categories. Third, we compared each step therapy protocol against each drug’s corresponding FDA label indication. Fourth, we examined the consistency of step therapy protocols between the same insurer’s MA and commercial lines of business. Results: The frequency with which the included MA plans imposed step therapy ranged from 26.1% to 63.7%. Step therapy was most common for dermatology conditions (90.2%) and least common for oncology conditions (28.6%). On average, MA plans’ step therapy requirements were consistent with the drug’s FDA label indication 29.0% of the time. MA plans’ and commercial plans’ use of step therapy differed for the same drug-indication pairs 46.1% of the time. Conclusions: MA plans vary in the frequency with which they impose step therapy protocols in their Part B drug coverage policies. Moreover, insurers often impose different step therapy protocols in their MA plan and commercial plan offerings. Differences in plans’ step therapy requirements may result in variability in patients’ access to care within MA.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: The collaborative care model integrates mental health care into primary care. In 2017, CMS created new billing codes to reimburse collaborative care. We measured the impact of a program supported by these codes on medical spending. Study Design: Quasi-experimental. Methods: We identified a commercially insured and managed Medicare sample of 825 patients who received collaborative care services in 8 primary care practices. We used propensity score matching to match treated patients to potential controls, resulting in 569 patients per group. We performed a difference-in-differences regression analysis to evaluate the impact of collaborative care on total medical spending, including medical, psychiatric, and pharmaceutical claims. Results: Collaborative care patients’ mean total medical cost began to fall after a patient’s third month in the program and fell below the mean cost of control patients at month 7. Difference-in-differences regressions indicate a nonsignificant savings in total medical cost of $29.35 per member per month for patients in collaborative care compared with matched controls (95% CI, –$226.52 to $167.82). Treated members incurred $34.11 (95% CI, $31.95-$36.27) higher primary care costs that were directly attributed to collaborative care, $19.91 (95% CI, $4.84-$34.98) higher costs for other mental or behavioral health care, and a nonsignificant reduction of $91.34 (95% CI, –$319.32 to $136.63) in inpatient costs. Conclusions: Modest spending on collaborative care services to address the behavioral health needs of patients did not increase overall health care costs. This is the first economic study of a collaborative care program supported by the new billing codes.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Physician pay-for-performance (P4P) programs frequently target inappropriate antibiotics. Yet little is known about P4P programs’ effects on antibiotic prescribing among safety-net populations at risk for unintended harms from reducing care. We evaluated effects of P4P-motivated interventions to reduce antibiotic prescriptions for safety-net patients with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs). Study Design: Interrupted time series. Methods: A nonrandomized intervention (5/28/2015-2/1/2018) was conducted at 2 large academic safety-net hospitals: Los Angeles County+University of Southern California (LAC+USC) and Olive View-UCLA (OV-UCLA). In response to California’s 2016 P4P program to reduce antibiotics for acute bronchitis, 5 staggered Choosing Wisely–based interventions were launched in combination: audit and feedback, clinician education, suggested alternatives, procalcitonin, and public commitment. We also assessed 5 unintended effects: reductions in Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS)–appropriate prescribing, diagnosis shifting, substituting antibiotics with steroids, increasing antibiotics for ARTIs not penalized by the P4P program, and inappropriate withholding of antibiotics. Results: Among 3583 consecutive patients with ARTIs, mean antibiotic prescribing rates for ARTIs decreased from 35.9% to 22.9% (odds ratio [OR], 0.60; 95% CI, 0.39-0.93) at LAC+USC and from 48.7% to 27.3% (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.70-0.93) at OV-UCLA after the intervention. HEDIS-inappropriate prescribing rates decreased from 28.9% to 19.7% (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.39-1.21) at LAC+USC and from 40.9% to 12.5% (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59-0.88) at OV-UCLA. There was no evidence of unintended consequences. Conclusions: These real-world multicomponent interventions responding to P4P incentives were associated with substantial reductions in antibiotic prescriptions for ARTIs in 2 safety-net health systems without unintended harms.",

Yet, little is known about barriers to and facilitators of MH care access when services are delivered via synchronous telehealth to Medicaid-enrolled youth.Between December 2020 and March 2021, we conducted in-depth interviews with 19 therapists from a large safety-net organization who served Medicaid-enrolled youth (< 18 years of age) to elucidate their perspectives on barriers to and facilitators of access to telemental health services among this population.We conducted a thematic content analysis, guided by the 5 dimensions of health care access identified by Fortney and colleagues: geographical, temporal, digital, cultural (including acceptability of services), and financial access.Therapists noted that when components of digital access are met (ie, access to hardware and software, connectivity, and technological literacy), then telehealth could facilitate temporal access and eliminate geographic barriers; elimination of these barriers was particularly beneficial for youth in rural and hard-to-reach communities. Notably, many families depended on smartphones for telemental health access, and many youth depended on their caregiver's smartphone. When considering acceptability of services, some youth preferred in-person services, whereas other youth (especially some teenagers with high technological literacy) had a preference for telemental health.Our results highlight the need for flexibility in reimbursement policies that allows providers to optimize MH care access by offering telehealth delivered via telephone and video as well as in-person services, depending on the needs and preferences of youth and families.",

This index builds on the proprietary Epic Deterioration Index, which was not developed for predicting respiratory deterioration events among patients with COVID-19. Study Design: ,A retrospective observational cohort was used to develop and validate the COVID-HDI model to predict respiratory deterioration or death among hospitalized patients with COVID-19. Deterioration events were defined as death or requiring high-flow oxygen, bilevel positive airway pressure, mechanical ventilation, or intensive-level care within 72 hours of run time. The sample included hospitalized patients with COVID-19 diagnoses or positive tests at Kaiser Permanente Southern California between May 3, 2020, and October 17, 2020. Methods:, Machine learning models and 118 candidate predictors were used to generate benchmark performance. Logit regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and physician input were used to finalize the model. Split-sample cross-validation was used to train and test the model. Results: ,The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.83. COVID-HDI identifies patients at low risk (negative predictive value [NPV] > 98.5%) and borderline low risk (NPV > 95%) of an event. Of all patients, 74% were identified as being at low or borderline low risk at some point during their hospitalization and could be considered for discharge with or without home monitoring. A high-risk group with a positive predictive value of 51% included 12% of patients. Model performance remained high in a recent cohort of patients. Conclusions:, COVID-HDI is a parsimonious, well-calibrated, and accurate model that may support clinical decision-making around discharge and escalation of care.",

Descriptive statistics were calculated to characterize the dissatisfied population. Logistic regressions and predicted probabilities controlling for personal characteristics were calculated to determine the association between plan or provider attribute and unwillingness to recommend a plan.We found no personal characteristics that significantly differentiated individuals who reported their family was unwilling to recommend a health plan from those who were willing. The largest predictors of unwillingness to recommend a plan were dissatisfaction with choice of providers and preventive services coverage; in contrast, provider and personal characteristics were not significant predictors of dissatisfaction. We estimated the probability of being unwilling to recommend a health plan was 38% for individuals dissatisfied with the choice of providers and 34% for those dissatisfied with preventive services coverage. Although provider attributes were not found to be predictors of plan dissatisfaction for the entire sample, they were predictors of dissatisfaction for HMO and multiple plan members.Enrollee dissatisfaction with the choice of providers and preventive services coverage are major predictors of health plan dissatisfaction. Managers concerned about plan satisfaction may want to examine enrollee assessments of these measures.",

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional analyses of the 2003 California Health Interview Survey data. METHODS Using bivariate analysis and logistic regression models, we assessed the CT screening rate of 1659 sexually active women age 18-25 years, given various factors including type of health insurance coverage. We further assessed the CT screening rate of the subset of 533 sexually active women age 18-25 years enrolled in a private health plan and reexamined the relationship of various factors with CT screening rates. RESULTS Being older, an immigrant, or having 1 sexual partner reduced the likelihood of CT screening, while being a smoker, being single, or having had multiple doctor visits as well as a Pap test or clinical breast exam increased this likelihood. The uninsured had the lowest rate, and public managed care enrollees had the highest rate, of CT screening, but this insurance effect was superseded by other explanatory variables. A few differences in significantly associated factors were identified when private health plans were separately examined. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that self-reported CT screening rates were low, particularly among the uninsured. However, these rates were primarily influenced by CT risk factors rather than insurance coverage. Continued efforts to increase CT screening rates are warranted.",

We examined the impact of the program on medication adherence and adjustments for patients with chronic conditions.A randomized quality improvement trial was conducted in 5 sites in which high-risk patients were randomized into PIM or usual primary care; outcomes were measured in the 12 months before and after randomization. Interdisciplinary PIM teams assessed patients for unmet needs and offered services including pharmaceutical care and care coordination.Outcomes included adherence, measured by proportion of days covered, and several measures of medication adjustments for diabetes, depression, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension medications. Differences-in-differences methods were used to estimate changes in outcomes between PIM and usual care groups.There were 1527 patients in the medication adherence cohort and 1719 in the medication adjustments cohort. Mean adherence was mostly similar between groups but 16% higher among PIM patients for dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (for diabetes) after randomization (0.12 vs -0.04; P = .02). The mean number of hyperlipidemia drugs filled was higher among PIM patients (1.1 vs 1.0; P = .006). The mean number of discontinued depression medications was higher and the mean number of dose changes for hypertension medications was lower for PIM patients, although these comparisons did not reach statistical significance.Medication adherence improved for DPP-4 inhibitors, and more hyperlipidemia drugs were prescribed for PIM patients. Overall impacts of PIM were modest.",

Activity OverviewLong-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAODs) are a group of rare and life-threatening autosomal recessive genetic diseases caused by metabolic deficiencies that prevent the body from converting longchain fatty acids into energy.The clinical manifestations of these rare genetic disorders due to the resultant energy deficiency cause substantial morbidity and mortality.LC-FAODs significantly affect patient and caregiver quality of life.Current recommended management of LC-FAODs includes nutrition support by avoidance of fasting combined with the use of low-fat/high-carbohydrate diets, medium-chain triglyceride supplementation and in some cases, carnitine supplementation.The recent approval of the odd-chain fatty acid triheptanoin, a highly purified, pharmaceutical-grade, medium-chain triglyceride, marks the first FDA-approved therapy for this rare disease.This supplement highlights the pathophysiology and clinical findings, management strategies, and clinical trial data for the recently approved therapy and agents under investigation.",

This study aims to investigate the factors associated with utilization controls in Medicare fee-for-service Part D formularies. Study design Cross-sectional analysis. Methods We used multivariate logistic regression to assess the association between orphan drug characteristics and use of formulary utilization controls in 2016. We controlled for number of beneficiaries per drug, exclusivity expiration, and the number of plans and beneficiaries per formulary. We conducted sensitivity analyses using fixed and random effects. Results On average, 85% of orphan drugs on a formulary were placed on its highest cost-sharing tier and 76% were subject to prior authorization (PA). Orphan drugs with annual costs of $50,000 or more had twice the odds of having PA requirements compared with less expensive ones. Relative to orphan drugs with a single indication, drugs with multiple indications were more likely to have restrictions. Less effective drugs had 1.5 times the odds of highest tier placement relative to more effective drugs. The presence of black box warnings and patient assistance programs were associated with more restricted access. Orphan drugs with generics were less likely to undergo restrictions than those without generics (all P Conclusions Plans are making evidence-based decisions by rewarding more clinically effective and safer orphan drugs. They are penalizing drugs with multiple indications. Surprisingly, plans place fewer restrictions on orphan drugs that have a generic equivalent, which may further discourage generic entry into the orphan space, where competition is already sparse.",

We used multivariate linear regression to examine the impact of a geriatric syndrome risk measure, assessed as high risk, moderate risk, or nonrisk, on outcomes in MA and FFS cohorts. Outcome measures included postacute destination and inpatient utilization. We then examined if this risk measure was associated with differences in outcomes between MA and FFS cohorts.Patients with high geriatric syndrome risk (in both MA and FFS cohorts) are less likely to be discharged to home or to home health care. They also have longer inpatient lengths of stay and higher inpatient costs. This risk measure also explains differences in postacute skilled nursing destination between MA and FFS cohorts.Geriatric syndrome risk factors not only play a role in postacute care and inpatient utilization in MA and FFS cohorts but also explain different utilizations between MA and FFS cohorts. This study's results can be applied to guide discharge planning among a group of high-risk patients and evaluate alternative delivery models for this high-cost, high-need cohort.",

In the second analysis, the rate of emergent hospitalization due to respiratory infections was compared between beneficiaries who went to an SNF with lower predicted risk of infections using ML and beneficiaries who did not.In the community setting, beneficiaries predicted to be at highest risk had significantly increased rates of emergency department visits (13-fold) and hospitalizations (18-fold) due to respiratory infections. In the postacute setting, beneficiaries who received care at top-recommended SNFs had a relative reduction of 37% for emergent care and 36% for inpatient hospitalization due to respiratory infection.Precision management through personalized and predictive ML offers the opportunity to reduce the burden of outbreaks of respiratory infections. In the community setting, ML can identify vulnerable subpopulations at highest risk of severe infections.

Obtained were descriptive statistics, Pearson product moment correlations between resource use and quality of care, and 90% confidence intervals around each health plan's composite measures of resource use and quality of care. Health plans were classified based on their results. RESULTS For patients with diabetes, the correlation between combined medical care services resource use and composite quality of care is negative (-0.201, p = .008); the correlation between ambulatory pharmacy services resource use and composite quality of care is positive (0.162, p = .03). For patients with cardiovascular disease, no significant correlation was found between combined medical care services resource use and composite quality of care (-0.007, p = .94) or ambulatory pharmacy services resource use (0.170, p = .06). CONCLUSIONS Measures of resource use and quality of care provide important information about the value of a health plan. Although our analysis did not determine causality, the statistically weak or absent correlations between resource use and quality of care suggest that health plans and practices can create higher value by improving quality of care without large increases in resource use or by maintaining the same quality of care with decreased resource use.",

Study design and methods Clalit Health Services is the largest managed care health fund in Israel, a country that uses a universal healthcare system. We randomly sampled 30,000 primary care patients over the age of 22 years. Our analytic sample consisted of those 949 patients who did not purchase antidepressant medication during the last quarter of 2005 and purchased antidepressant medication at least once in 2006. We used multilevel analysis, with whether or not medication was purchased for at least 6 months as an indicator of adherence. Patient and physician characteristics were evaluated as potential predictors. Results Only 23% of the sample was classified as adherent. Physician characteristics explained only a small portion of the variance in adherence and, as a result, were not included in multivariate analysis. Patients who did not have a somatic diagnosis, had a depression diagnosis, and were of higher socioeconomic status were more likely to be classified as adherent. Patients who purchased tricyclic antidepressants were less likely to be classified as adherent. Conclusions The findings suggest that in a managed care setting, there is high uniformity among physicians. Although physician characteristics explain little of the variability associated with adherence, certain patient characteristics as determined by their physicians (eg, antidepressant drug class, psychiatric diagnosis) do play a role in adherence.",

    "abstract": "The burden of epilepsy for patients and payers is large and onerous. The heterogeneous nature of the condition and the lack of diagnostic or treatment biomarkers present considerable clinical challenge. Despite expansion of the treatment armamentarium, selection of maximally appropriate therapy for individual patients remains a challenge, especially in those with treatment-refractory epilepsy. While numerous factors play a role in resolving these uncertainties, 3 key factors stand out. An overwhelming quantity of clinical data support the notion that the most effective therapies-measured by the ability to control seizures while minimizing adverse effects-are typically the most cost-effective. A second consideration is maximizing adherence to prescribed therapies, which has been an ongoing dilemma in the treatment of epilepsy because the condition occurs episodically. Poor adherence has a profound effect on treatment and costs, and several strategies for improving adherence have been identified. If properly observed, these can improve outcomes and lower expenditures. The third consideration is the monitoring of therapeutic response. This is essentially through ongoing care by the prescriber with careful assessment of seizures, patient satisfaction with treatment, dose-related adverse effects, and the subjective aspects of idiosyncratic toxicity; however, laboratory testing can also have a role. The resources needed to provide this monitoring vary across treatments. From a systemic point of view, engagement of all stakeholders-patients, payers, and physicians-in overseeing the effective and efficient use of healthcare resources will benefit all parties involved.",

Standardized TKA pathways improve outcomes but have not been studied extensively in minority populations. This study evaluated the impact of TKA standardization at an urban teaching hospital that predominantly treats minority patients. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohort study. METHODS This study compared primary TKA outcomes before and after implementation of a standardized multidisciplinary that emphasized preoperative education and discharge planning, preemptive multimodal pain control, and early rehabilitation. Patients were grouped as (n = 144) or pathway (n = 182) based on whether they underwent TKA before or after implementation. Outcomes included length of stay (LOS), patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) use, blood transfusion, postoperative hemoglobin, complications, and discharge disposition. Analysis involved negative binomial and multiple logistic regression models, t tests, and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS Mean (SD) age was 61.6 (8.7) years, and 36.5% were men. Ethnicity of the patients included Hispanic (44.5%), African American (27.9%), Asian (14.1%), and White (12.9%). Pathway and nonpathway patients were similar demographically and racially. Pathway patients had shorter LOS (P = .04), less PCA use (P < .001), more frequent discharge home (P = .03), fewer transfusions (P = .002), and higher postoperative hemoglobin (P < .001). Overall incidence of complications was similar (P = .61). Nonpathway patients developed more cardiopulmonary complications (P = .02), whereas patients had more wound dehiscence (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS Compared with nonpathway patients, standardized TKA patients had shorter LOS, decreased PCA use, increased discharge to home, fewer blood transfusions, and higher postoperative hemoglobin, with no difference in total incidence of complication.",

Patients who had breast cancer diagnoses were selected based on the primary International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision or Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. A negative binomial regression and a generalized linear model with a gamma distribution and log-link function were conducted to estimate the LOS and hospital costs after controlling for sociodemographics, clinical characteristics (eg, metastatic status, Elixhauser Comorbidity Index [ECI] score), and hospital characteristics.On average, male patients with breast cancer stayed for 2.42 days and expensed $9059 per hospital visit. Patients with metastatic status had longer LOS (5.39 vs 3.24 days; P = .005) and higher hospital costs ($11,185 vs $8547; P = .03) than those without. Patients with an ECI score of 3 or more showed longer LOS (4.05 vs 2.68 days; P = .003) and higher hospital costs ($10,043 vs $7022; P < .001) than those with an ECI score of 0.LOS and hospital costs for male patients with breast cancer were associated with metastatic status and comorbidities.

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective analysis of health insurance claims data obtained from a large employer in western New York covering a 25-month period between 2016 and 2018. Those employees treated by the employer-sponsored BH program were compared against a contemporaneous comparison group of employees of the same employer who had eligible BH diagnoses for the program but were treated elsewhere. METHODS A difference-in-differences method was used to estimate the program's impact on all-cause care utilization (physician office visits and acute care utilization) and total cost of care, including prescription drug costs. RESULTS Program participation was associated with a reduction of approximately 28% in total cost of care including prescription drug costs (P = .043) over an 18-month period following the initial program encounter, as well as 27% reductions in primary care provider (PCP) visits (P = .001) and non-BH specialist visits (P = .005). No significant impacts were observed for acute care utilization and BH specialist visit rates. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that the employer-sponsored BH program implementation may have shifted treatments of certain BH conditions away from PCPs and non-BH specialists who may not have the proper training or resources to manage such conditions. Therefore, these results are consistent with the expectation that improved access to BH care is likely to improve efficiency in the health care system via provision of more appropriate care for those who need it.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by a type 2 immune response and characterized by the accumulation of immune cells (eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells) in the esophagus. Patients may present with EoE at any age, and its prevalence is similar across age groups in the United States. If EoE is suspected, an endoscopy with biopsy is required to confirm the diagnosis; endoscopy allows clinicians to evaluate for the presence of rings, furrows, exudates, edemas, and/or strictures and biopsy helps to identify the associated histological changes, including eosinophilic infiltration of the esophageal mucosa. Symptoms of EoE vary by age and include dysphagia, impaction, regurgitation, chest and/or abdominal pain, and vomiting. Allergic comorbidities (eg, allergic rhinitis, asthma, or atopic dermatitis) are common among patients with EoE, which suggests that there may be a shared pathophysiology underlying these conditions. The symptoms of EoE vary widely from patient to patient, and delays in diagnosis are common. Disease progression may lead to lasting damage, including scarring and fibrosis of the esophagus, underscoring the need for early diagnosis and treatment to reduce the clinical, economic, and humanistic burden associated with EoE. Current standard of care treatment options include diet therapy, esophageal dilation, proton pump inhibitors, and topical swallowed corticosteroids; however, these treatments may not provide optimal disease management over the long term. The symptoms of EoE, its complications, and disease management considerations (eg, dietary limitations) are associated with diminished quality of life. There remains an unmet need for long-term management options. It is important for stakeholders to understand the current treatment landscape and unmet needs when considering the assessment of future therapies.",

    "abstract": "Most transparency tools are provided by individual insurers for enrollees shopping for services within their networks. This paper seeks to understand the impact of a marketwide price transparency tool with an embedded randomized experiment to offer provider-level charge information.In September 2017, FAIR Health released an independent, publicly accessible statewide consumer shopping tool, New York Healthcare Online Shopping Tool, or NYHOST, that displays individual provider charges (list prices) for common procedures in each of New York State's 3-digit geozips, as well as the estimated insurer-allowed amounts and educational resources. The rollout was accompanied by an extensive, multipronged marketing effort. It also incorporated a randomized experiment: The set of procedures with provider-level information varied across areas.We characterized the types of services that were most searched on the consumer shopping tool. Utilizing negative binomial models with procedure and area fixed effects, we report on market and procedural characteristics that influence price search.Consumers utilized the tool strategically, searching more in procedure markets with provider-specific price information availability, more frequent out-of-network utilization, higher charges, significant charge dispersion, and substantial provider competition. We also found that the majority of searches using the tool were for emergent services not usually classified as shoppable, suggesting that consumers may also have used the tool to compare searchable prices against those in bills for services already received.Our findings confirm aspects of price search theory that have been developed by studying other industries and may prove instructive for further study of price transparency tools.",

    "abstract": "Use of anesthesia-assisted (AA) sedation for routine gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy has increased markedly. Clinical uncertainty about which patients are most likely to benefit from AA sedation contributes to this increased use. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of failed endoscopist-directed sedation and to identify patients at elevated risk of failing standard sedation.Retrospective longitudinal study of national Veterans Health Administration (VA) data of all patients who underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy and/or colonoscopy in 2009-2013.Using multivariable logistic regression, we sought to identify patient and procedural risk factors for failed sedation. Failed sedation cases were identified electronically and validated by chart review.Of 302,247 standard sedation procedures performed at VA facilities offering AA sedation, we identified 313 cases of failed sedation (prevalence, 0.10%). None of the factors found to be associated with increased risk of failed sedation (eg, high-dose opioid use, younger age) had an odds ratio greater than 3. Even among the highest-risk patients (top decile), the prevalence of failed sedation was only 0.29%.Failed sedation among patients undergoing routine outpatient GI endoscopy with standard sedation is very rare, even among patients at highest risk. This suggests that concerns regarding failed sedation due to commonly cited factors such as chronic opioid use and obesity do not justify forgoing standard sedation in favor of AA sedation in most patients. It also suggests that use of AA sedation is generally unnecessary. Reinstatement of endoscopist-directed sedation, rather than AA sedation, as the default sedation standard is warranted to reduce low-value care and prevent undue financial burdens on patients.",

These approaches include lean process improvements initiatives, sustained by efforts to impact daily team member work flows. The electronic health record (EHR) serves as a powerful supportive instrument in improving processes and sustaining performance. For UCLA, the secret to EHR effectiveness lies in creating win-win situations, where organizational objectives are achieved and team member work flows also are improved. Recent UCLA initiatives with medication bar-coding and a stroke telemedicine network highlight such opportunities. Carried out on a national level, such efforts can significantly affect healthcare in the United States. The US Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009's EHR provisions provide a national impetus for broad improvements in healthcare.",

HIV infection has also become a complex chronic condition that requires a high degree of specialized clinical skills among managing clinicians. This evolving infection requires a multidisciplinary approach, which links HIV treatment with prevention and traditional healthcare screening and management. With improved immune function from HAART, non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining conditions are responsible for an increasing proportion of the morbidity and mortality experienced by HIV-infected patients. The focus of HIV care must shift from reducing short-term morbidity and mortality to maintaining long-term survival and quality-of-life goals. Reimbursement for HIV treatment is extremely low. The disconnect between treatment cost and reimbursement is not sustainable, and will become more acute as individual patient care needs begin to extend over multiple decades. Policy leaders must transition to a long-term view of HIV care and shift funding priorities to maintain a viable and engaged HIV workforce.",

We found that 50.8% (range across physicians, 34.5%-61.9%) of the messages were concerned with medical issues and 34.1% (range, 23.0%-48.9%) focused on administrative matters. More specifically, 13.6% (range, 7.1%-22.6%) of the messages involved ambiguous diagnosis issues, 13.2% (range, 6.9%-18.8%) involved condition management issues, 6.7% (range, 1.9%-13.4%) involved identified symptoms issues, 9.5% (range, 5.2%-28.9%) involved paperwork issues, and 17.6% (range, 9.3%-27.1%) involved scheduling issues. Additionally, there was significant variability among physicians and practices.This study demonstrated that advanced text analytics provide a reliable data-driven methodology to understand the individual physician's EHR inbox management work with a significantly greater level of detail than previous approaches. This methodology can inform decision makers on appropriate workflow redesign to eliminate unnecessary workload on PCPs and to improve cost and quality of care, as well as staff work satisfaction.",

However, little is known about how beneficiaries would be affected.We estimated multivariate linear regression models to determine which beneficiary characteristics were associated with the greatest savings under each proposed OOP maximum and simulated a potential behavioral response by beneficiaries.Using Part D 2017 claims data for beneficiaries in stand-alone prescription drug plans (PDPs) and Medicare Advantage prescription drug (MA-PD) plans, we estimated the number of beneficiaries affected, their demographic characteristics, and their drug utilization patterns. We then simulated a potential behavioral response by beneficiaries.Under the $2000 OOP proposed threshold, only 7% of PDP and 4% of MA-PD plan beneficiaries would have spending high enough to reach the OOP maximum. Annual mean (SD) savings would be $1301 ($1849) for PDP beneficiaries and $1363 ($1888) for MA-PD plan beneficiaries, concentrated among beneficiaries taking specialty drugs. As the threshold increases, fewer beneficiaries would accrue savings, but savings would increase. For the highest proposed OOP maximum, mean (SD) savings would be $2720 ($3465) and $2473 ($2805) for PDP and MA-PD plan beneficiaries, respectively. In our simulations, we estimated that the number of beneficiaries affected by an OOP maximum could increase by 2% to 11%, depending on the magnitude of response, but changes in savings would be minimal.As currently drafted, proposed OOP maximums would reduce OOP spending for a small population of Part D beneficiaries, with savings concentrated among beneficiaries with the very highest costs who are taking specialty medications.",

Three questions were administered at the conclusion of the CMR, with 2 questions conducted during a follow-up review.

Seventy-eight percent of patients indicated satisfaction with the MTM program, 63.5% reported that the medication review was helpful, and 80% reported experiencing a very good level of care. In addition, 59% found the patient takeaway documents received after the CMR to be helpful and 81% felt they had a better understanding of their medications. A subgroup analysis found that of the patients who reported feeling that the CMR was helpful, 66% were taking 7 or more medications.Overall, Medicaid patients in this study were very satisfied with the telephonic MTM services provided and found the information relayed during the conversation with the pharmacist to be helpful.

Exploratory analyses specific to reimbursement were conducted in a second phase. For each payment structure, we calculated the (1) mean (SD) total reimbursement and (2) number of weeks that a health care system would receive reimbursement, with both weekly and PMPM (4-week) averages. The third phase was designed to quantify any within-person (paired) differences in reimbursement between the original PACSSI and the PACSSI-F.PACSSI-F provides reimbursement for sustainable PC services and was cost-advantageous over PACSSI by $69.92 PMPM for 28.6% of the seriously ill population.Modeling of the PACSSI-F using secondary data provides a novel example of economic forecasting for alternative reimbursement structures in PC.

The experimental effect of the MA bonus payment policy was estimated as the interaction between plan type (MAPD plan vs PDP) and period (pre- vs post period) controlling for the main effects of plan type (MAPD vs PDP), timing of the observation (pre- vs post period), and other potential confounders.The study sample included 40,369 person-years of data in the preperiod and 27,703 person-years of data in the post period. Vaccination rates increased by 3.8% in MAPD plans compared with 2.7% in PDPs, leading to a relative MAPD-favored difference that was nonsignificant (P = .31). However, the effect was statistically significant (odds ratio [OR], 1.12; P = .03) in the main multivariate DID model. A larger relative difference was observed among beneficiaries 75 years and older (OR, 1.18; P = .03).The Medicare bonus payment policy led to a small increase in beneficiaries' flu vaccination rates, suggesting that expanding the star measure set could be an effective way to increase uptake for other recommended adult vaccines.",

Using 2012-2018 Adult Medicaid Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems surveys, we estimated changes in MCO enrollee characteristics and 4 outcomes: having access to needed care, having a personal doctor, having timely access to a checkup, and having timely access to specialty care. We estimated multivariable linear probability models comparing pre- vs postexpansion changes in expansion vs nonexpansion states. The postexpansion period was modeled as an event-study regression to account for changes over time. The coefficient of interest was a Medicaid expansion-by-year term. Medicaid expansion was associated with statistically significant decreases in the proportion of female enrollees (-8.4 percentage points [PP]; P < .01) and increases in the proportion of enrollees who were aged 55 to 64 years (6.8 PP; P < .01) and were non-Hispanic White (4.4 PP; P < .01). Relative to enrollees in nonexpansion states, MCO enrollees in expansion states were significantly less likely to report access to a personal doctor (-1.6 PP; 95% CI, -3.0 to -0.1 PP) and less likely to report timely access to specialty care (-2.1 PP; 95% CI, -3.4 to -0.8 PP; P < .01) in the first year after expansion. Differences were not statistically significant by the second year post expansion. There were not significant changes in the other 2 outcomes. State policy makers may need to account for the role that Medicaid expansion may have in changing Medicaid MCO enrollee composition to prevent unfair penalization on performance metrics.",

    "abstract": "CMS created the Oncology Care Model (OCM) to increase the delivery of cost-efficient cancer care, but in linking medical oncologist compensation to total costs of care, the model also prompted concerns about reductions in radiation therapy utilization. We compare practices that participated in the model with those that did not through its launch to estimate whether radiation therapy utilization was reduced under the OCM.Retrospective analysis of a secondary claims-based data set.We used 5 years of reimbursement claims data from a large community oncology network in which approximately half of the practices participated in the OCM to measure the relative change in utilization following OCM participation compared with practices that did not participate in the OCM. We evaluated use of radiation therapy for all cancer diagnoses and, more specifically, bone metastases, lung cancer, and breast cancer to assess whether effects varied by setting using 3 quasi-experimental estimation techniques (difference-in-differences, event study, and triple differences regressions).We found no evidence of reductions in radiation therapy utilization associated with the OCM between participant and nonparticipant practices in any of the specifications or subpopulations analyzed.Despite the potential incentives for medical oncologists to reduce radiation therapy utilization, we found no evidence that such reduction occurred.",

Study Design: Retrospective analysis of commercial pharmacy claims and pharmacy co-payment offsets. Methods: We assessed Basaglar uptake by examining trends in the composition of the long-acting insulin market in the United States from 2014 to 2018. As patient demographics and plan type may be important determinants of biosimilar uptake, we also assessed characteristics of all long-acting insulin users by drug. We examined Basaglar OOP costs by assessing mean OOP costs per claim for users of Basaglar and other long-acting insulins, overall and by plan type, and the number and source of co-payment offsets for Basaglar and other insulin glargine products from Basaglar market entry through 2018. We used multivariate linear models to examine the relationship between Basaglar OOP expenditures and insurer-negotiated amounts, overall and by plan type. Results: Basaglar experienced a rapid uptake. However, there was no evidence that Basaglar users had lower OOP costs than reference product (Lantus) users. Conclusions: Given our results and the approval of the first interchangeable biosimilar, we recommend the empirical evaluation of biosimilar cost savings to patients and insurers prior to promoting their automatic substitution.",

Guideline-recommended obesity treatment begins with lifestyle intervention, and weight management may be enhanced by metabolic and bariatric surgery or anti-obesity medication (AOM) use. However, patient and provider perceptions surrounding obesity and different treatment modalities may present barriers to discussion and uptake of these interventions. Furthermore, it is uncommon for all effective obesity treatments (particularly AOMs) to be covered by insurance. Limited patient access to these treatments carries the potential for negative health consequences and higher health care costs. For these reasons, managed care decision makers are encouraged to improve access to effective obesity treatments, including coverage of AOMs such as semaglutide 2.4 mg.",

Supplemental benefits, Part B cost-sharing differences, and prescription drug benefits should be valued with a series of structured comparisons. Making this information transparent to beneficiaries through the plan finder would improve beneficiary decision-making. Finally, pragmatic comparisons would support policy makers in making improvements to Medicare Advantage program policy, undertaking comparative program evaluation, and engaging in Medigap plan oversight.",

    "abstract": "Objectives:, Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and albuminuria, the current standard-of-care tests that predict risk of kidney function decline in early-stage diabetic kidney disease (DKD), are only modestly useful. We evaluated the decision-making impact of an artificial intelligence–enabled prognostic test, KidneyIntelX, in the management of DKD by primary care physicians (PCPs). Study Design: ,This was a prospective web-based survey administered among PCPs in the United States. Methods:, We used conjoint analysis with multivariable logit models to estimate PCP preferences. The survey included hypothetical patient profiles with 6 attributes: albuminuria, eGFR, age, blood pressure (BP), hemoglobin A,1c, (HbA,1c,), and KidneyIntelX result. Each PCP viewed 8 patient profiles randomly selected from 42 unique profiles having 1 level from each attribute. For each patient, PCPs were asked to indicate whether they would prescribe a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, increase angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) dose, and/or refer to a nephrologist. Results:, A total of401 PCPs completed the survey (response rate, 8.8%). The relative importance of the top 2 attributes for each decision were HbA,1c, (52%) and KidneyIntelX result (23%) for prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors, BP (62%) and KidneyIntelX result (13%) for increasing ARB dose, and eGFR (42%) and KidneyIntelX result (27%) for nephrologist referral. A high-risk KidneyIntelX result was associated with significantly higher odds of PCPs prescribing SGLT2 inhibitors (odds ratio [OR], 1.64; 95% CI, 1.29-2.08), increasing ARB dose (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.17-1.89), and referring to a nephrologist (OR, 2.47; 95% CI, 1.99-3.08) compared with no test. Conclusions:, The KidneyIntelX test had greater relative importance than albuminuria and eGFR to PCPs in making treatment decisions and was second only to eGFR for nephrologist referrals. Because of its significant impact on decision-making, KidneyIntelX has high clinical utility in DKD management.",

Therapeutic advantages of LMWH over unfractionated heparin (UFH) are also discussed, including once- or twice-daily subcutaneous dosing, reduced hospital stays, elimination of therapeutic monitoring for most patients, and possibly less bone density loss. Studies have demonstrated that enoxaparin is at least equivalent to UFH with regard to efficacy and safety. Opportunities for future study include evaluation of enoxaparin's efficacy for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis within high-risk groups and for the treatment of thrombosis in such conditions as pregnancy, cancer, obesity, and renal insufficiency, and in children.",

We used random effects negative binomial models to assess whether mental health diagnosis, opioid use, and medication nonadherence were associated with preventable and overall hospitalizations and ED visits stratified by age (18-64 vs ≥65 years).Overall chronic disease medication nonadherence was associated with more frequent hospitalizations and ED visits for both younger (hospitalizations: incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.16-1.47; ED visits: IRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.14-1.55) and older (hospitalizations: IRR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.20-1.49; ED visits: IRR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.02-1.38) beneficiaries.

Total Medicare expenditures over the 5-year period, as well as all inpatient admissions, were not statistically different between the MDVIP and comparison groups.Our finding of reduced unplanned inpatient admissions and ED utilization supports the previous findings regarding MDVIP enrollees. We did not find significant changes in overall third-party expenditures, although savings were estimated in year 5, the last year of observation, and may occur later. Our approach, however, strengthens controls for baseline characteristics of the population and uses a comparison population drawn from the same markets who do not experience the loss of their primary care physician at the time of enrollment.",

At the end of follow-up, the associations with all-cause hospitalizations and mortality were determined with the Andersen-Gill model and Cox regression multivariate analysis, respectively. Results There were no associations of health literacy, numeracy, or graph literacy with all-cause hospitalization or mortality after multivariate adjustment. In subgroup analysis, subjective numeracy was associated with hospitalizations in African Americans. Higher objective and subjective numeracy were associated with future hospitalizations only for those with a history of hospitalization. Higher graph literacy was associated with lower mortality in those with a history of hospitalization. Conclusions This study did not show associations of health literacy, numeracy, or graph literacy scores with lower risk of all-cause hospitalization or mortality.

We performed fixed-effects regression analysis at the person-month level to examine the effect of medical home enrollment on the probabilities of emergency department (ED) use, inpatient admission, and outpatient care use and on amount of Medicaid spending.Medical home enrollment had no effect on ED use in either cohort and was associated with a lower probability of inpatient admission in the depression cohort (P <.05). Medical home enrollees in both cohorts experienced an increase in the probability of having any outpatient visits (P <.05). Medical home enrollment was associated with an increase in mean monthly spending among those with schizophrenia ($65.8; P <.05) and a decrease among those with depression (-$66.4; P <.05).Among Medicaid beneficiaries with comorbid mental and physical illness, medical home enrollment appears to increase outpatient healthcare use and has mixed effects on acute care use. For individuals in this population who previously had no engagement with the healthcare system, use of the medical home model may represent an investment in providing improved access to needed outpatient services with cost savings potential for beneficiaries with depression.",

    "abstract": "To determine whether a program that eliminated pharmacy co-pays, the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana (BCBSLA) Zero Dollar Co-pay (ZDC) program, decreased health care spending. Previous studies have found that value-based insurance designs like the ZDC program have little or no impact on total health care spending. ZDC included an expansive set of medications related to 4 chronic diseases rather than a limited set of medications for 1 or 2 chronic diseases. Additionally, ZDC focused on the most at-risk patients.ZDC began in 2014 and enrolled patients over time based on (1) when a patient answered a call from a nurse care manager and (2) when a patient or their employer changed the benefit structure to meet the program criteria. During 2015 and 2016, 265 patients with at least 1 chronic condition (asthma, diabetes, hypertension, mental illness) enrolled in ZDC.Observational study using within-patient variation and variation in patient enrollment month to identify the impact of the ZDC program on health spending measures. We used 100% BCBSLA claims data from January 2015 to June 2018. Monthly level event studies were used to test for differential spending patterns prior to ZDC enrollment.We found that total spending decreased by $205.9 (P = .049) per member per month, or approximately 18%. We saw a decrease in medical spending ($195.0; P = .023) but did not detect a change in pharmacy spending ($7.59; P = .752). We found no evidence of changes in spending patterns prior to ZDC enrollment.The ZDC program provides evidence that value-based insurance designs that incorporate a comprehensive set of medications and focus on populations with chronic disease can reduce spending.",

In addition to succinctly summarizing cumulative limitations, we addressed 2 main questions: (1) Which limitations have stronger associations with self-rated health? and (2) How does severity (from 0, no difficulty, to 3, unable to do) relate to self-rated health? We generated a respondent-level summary score based on a model predicting self-rated health from the 5 linearly scored (0-3) items and used splines to account for nonlinear severity-self-rated health associations.The strongest association of specific functional limitations with self-rated health involved mobility; the weakest associations involved sensory limitations. The association of severity with self-rated health was nonlinear and largest moving from no difficulty to somewhat difficult. Nationally, 5% of noninstitutionalized adults were considered most limited, 8% somewhat limited, and 87% least limited. Great mobility limitations (defined as a lot of difficulty or unable to do) most distinguished limitation groups (present in 0% of least limited, 25% of somewhat limited, and 70% of most limited).The FLI is an easy-to-administer, easy-to-interpret, and valid summary measure of disability that health plans and health care organizations can use for quality-of-care monitoring across a variety of settings to improve care for patients with disabilities.",

This study estimated the costs of developing and implementing the autopend functionality within an existing electronic health maintenance (HM) reminder system.Human resource time was measured by triangulating in-depth key informant interviews with Microsoft Outlook Calendar metadata (meetings attended) for managers and hourly data from a time-based project management tool (Project Web App) for Epic programmers. Employee time spent was multiplied by the Bureau of Labor Statistics California state hourly wages. Sutter Health is an integrated health care delivery network with more than 12,000 physicians across 100 communities serving 3 million patients.Activity-based costing methodology was used to divide the implementation into activities and the human resources required to complete them.Developing and implementing the autopend CDS took more than 3 years, involved 6 managers and 3 Epic programmers, and cost $201,500 (2013 US$) (2670 total hours), which excluded the costs of implementing the initial HM reminder system. Managers spent 90.5% of the total costs (86.6% of total hours) integrating autopend into the health system compared with 9.5% of the total costs (13.4% of total hours) spent programming the functionality.The autopend CDS might be similarly costly for other organizations to implement if their managers need to complete comparable activities. However, electronic health record vendors could include autopend as a standard package to reduce development costs and improve the uptake of this promising CDS tool.",

Among other questions, the survey asks about adequacy of physical activity, healthy eating, abstinence from tobacco, limited alcohol consumption, adequate sleep, and whether the respondent takes time to think about the good things that happen to them (hereafter referred to as \"healthy thinking\"). We assessed the association of demographic characteristics and the 6 behaviors with life satisfaction.We found that although all 6 behaviors were positively associated with life satisfaction, healthy thinking was the behavior associated with the greatest difference in life satisfaction between individuals who did and those who did not practice the behavior. We also found that although members insured through Medicaid or who had a psychosocial diagnosis tended to report significantly lower levels of life satisfaction, two-thirds of the opportunity to improve life satisfaction across the member population was among individuals with neither of these attributes.The most effective strategy to promote both overall life satisfaction and equity will address social determinants for members with unmet social needs, provide the behavioral and mental health services that benefit members with these needs, and promote healthy lifestyles with an emphasis on healthy thinking for the entire population.",

We explored adherence to current guidelines for appropriateness of (1) initial telemetry assignment and (2) duration of the assignment. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective study. METHODS After institutional review board approval, 695 consecutive adult patients (≥ 18 years) who were admitted with any diagnosis to general medical floors and assigned telemetry at the time of admission over 3 months were enrolled. Patients on surgical service and transferred from critical care were excluded. Data were collected from electronic health records (EHRs). RESULTS We observed that 155 of 695 (22.3%) patients had been inappropriately assigned telemetry at the time of initial assignment. Of the 540 patients appropriately assigned telemetry, 56.3% of patients had longer than the recommended duration of telemetry monitoring with a median (interquartile range) of 3 (2-4) nonindicated days per patient. The annualized additional cost of telemetry monitoring due to the inefficient utilization was found to be more than $500,000 per year. CONCLUSIONS Our data further support the need for frequent reassessment of telemetry indication, which can be facilitated by the utilization of EHR-based automated monitoring.",

    "abstract": "The Massachusetts Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program, MassHealth, offers comprehensive Senior Care Options (SCO) plans to its Medicare-eligible members 65 years and older. Historically, MassHealth has paid a fixed per-person capitation rate for any \"nursing home-certifiable\" SCO member despite considerable heterogeneity of need. Our objective was to develop a model to predict long-term services and supports (LTSS) costs for community-dwelling SCO members.Concurrent predictive modeling.We studied nursing home-certifiable SCO members who were enrolled for at least 183 days during 2016-2017 and used linear models to predict annual cost of community-based LTSS from demographic, medical, social determinants of health, and functional characteristics. We evaluated model performance using predictive performance (R2) and predictive ratios (observed costs divided by predicted costs) for various vulnerable subgroups.The modeling population included 35,259 enrollees. Mean (SD) annualized LTSS cost was $14,071 ($13,174). Functional status (ie, activities of daily living [ADLs] and instrumental ADLs) accounted for most of the variability in community LTSS cost (R2 = 18.4%) explainable by available variables. The Massachusetts SCO (MA-SCO) model (R2 = 21.6%) predicts accurately for several high-cost, vulnerable subgroups. Compared with fixed per-member capitation payments for all, the MA-SCO model reduces, for example, the payment to one plan by 28% and increases that to another by 35%.Predictive models using administrative data and functional status information can appropriately allocate payments for subgroups of members with LTSS needs that differ substantially from average. Calibrating payment to need mitigates incentives for population skimming and promotes the sustainability of mission-oriented organizations.",

    "abstract": "To assess the effects of abolishing coinsurance for oral antihyperglycemic agents (OAAs) on the social insurance fund budget in Greece.A mathematical model estimating the effect of a decrease in patient coinsurance rate on demand for and adherence to OAAs and the subsequent clinical and economic outcomes.Price elasticity of demand for antidiabetic agents was used to estimate quantity demand change as a result of a coinsurance rate decrease and consequent increased adherence to OAAs. Given the inverse relationship between OAA adherence and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) level, the model calculated the mean decrease in A1C level and associated cost savings based on the cost difference between patients with controlled versus uncontrolled A1C levels.A decrease in patient coinsurance rate from 25% to 0% led to an incremental increase in OAA adherence of 30.5% and a mean decrease in A1C level of 0.6%. The A1C level decrease contributed to an 18.5% \"shift\" of uncontrolled patients to controlled A1C levels (<7%), which in economic terms translated into savings of 324 euro per patient over a 3-year period and an investment return rate of 122.8%. A series of 1-way and 2-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to verify the robustness and validity of the outcomes.The introduction of policies aimed at abolishing coinsurance for OAAs can result in improved patient outcomes and cost savings for the healthcare system.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To determine whether electronic prescribing transaction data can be used to accurately and efficiently track national and regional electronic health record (EHR) adoption in order to evaluate progress toward national goals and identify and address regional disparities. STUDY DESIGN This study compared national EHR use estimates derived from Surescripts electronic prescribing data for 2007 and 2008 with contemporary National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) estimates. METHODS The ratio of relative risks was adapted to test the statistical significance of the difference in the differences between Surescripts and NAMCS estimates in 2007 and 2008. RESULTS In 2007, the relative ratio (RR) of NAMCS to Surescripts data was 3.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.27, 4.26). In 2008, the RR was 2.06 (95% CI = 1.75, 2.42). The ratio of RRs for 2007 compared with 2008 was 1.81 (P <.0001), suggesting that Surescripts transactional data for providers prescribing through an EHR is becoming better aligned with accepted measures of EHR adoption in the United States with time. Surescripts-derived state estimates for EHR use ranged from less than 8% (North Dakota, New Jersey, New Mexico) to more than 37% (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Massachusetts, Iowa). CONCLUSIONS Surescripts transactional data may allow for the ongoing identification of regional trends and assist policy makers in identifying and mitigating emerging disparities in EHR adoption. Further analysis is needed to ensure that Surescripts data continue to correlate with NAMCS results for 2009-2010.",

    "abstract": "Although only part of the entire treatment regimen, antithrombotic therapy represents a large portion of the total costs associated with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) treatment. Unfractionated heparin (UFH), the mainstay of antithrombotic therapy, carries the risk of bleeding and associated interventions, and must be closely monitored. UFH therapy also has an increased risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and osteoporosis. These drawbacks prompted the development of newer antithrombotic agents, particularly low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) and factor Xa inhibitors. LMWH have several clinical advantages over UFH and has been demonstrated to be more effective than UFH in ACS. Because UFH is inexpensive, newer therapies need to demonstrate economic attractiveness over UFH. In addition to acquisition costs, it is important to consider the cost of all key components throughout the continuum of care. Health economic analyses show that the clinical advantages of the LMWH enoxaparin are also likely to result in net cost-saving benefits, due to reductions in diagnostic catheterization, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and intensive care unit length of stay. Fondaparinux, an indirect inhibitor of factor Xa, does not require routine monitoring or multiple daily dosing, and is unlikely to interact with HIT antibodies. Large randomized clinical trials have shown that fondaparinux is at least as safe and efficacious as enoxaparin or UFH in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and treatment of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Data from 2 recently published trials are similarly indicating noninferiority of fondaparinux in ACS patients. Health economic analysis of fondaparinux treatment is currently limited to VTE scenarios but point to a cost benefit associated with fondaparinux compared with enoxaparin.

STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis of 79 Veterans Health Administration facilities serving 250 317 patients with diabetes mellitus between October 1, 1999, and September 30, 2000. METHODS Primary outcome measures were poor glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) control and good low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and blood pressure (BP) control. Facility performance for each measure was calculated using 150 separate random samples and was compared with results using the bootstrap method as the criterion standard for determining outlier status (defined as a >/=5% difference from the mean, within the 10th or 90th percentile, or >/=2 SDs from the mean). RESULTS The study population was largely male (97.4%), with 54.0% of subjects being 65 years or older. The facility-level mean performances were 22.8% for poor A1C control, 53.1% for good LDL-C control, and 55.3% for good BP control. Comparing the random sampling method with the bootstrap method, the sensitivity ranged between 0.64 and 0.83 for the 3 outcome measures, positive predictive values ranged between 0.55 and 0.88, and specificity and negative predictive values ranged between 0.88 and 0.99. CONCLUSIONS The specificity and negative predictive value of the random sampling method in identifying nonoutliers in performance were generally high, while its sensitivity and positive predictive value were moderate. The use of random sampling to determine performance for individual outcome measures may be most appropriate for internal quality improvement rather than for public reporting.",

Study design Retrospective drug utilization analysis of electronic patient prescription data. Methods In a managed care setting involving approximately 1000 physicians who issue approximately 1.4 million prescriptions annually, the rate of prescription of sex-specific drugs to patients of the opposite sex for which the drugs are indicated was evaluated for 2003. The categories of drugs included in the analysis were drugs for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia or erectile dysfunction that were prescribed to women, as well as oral contraceptives, vaginal pessaries, hormone therapy, or raloxifene hydrochloride prescribed to men. Results Throughout the study year, 193 different physicians wrote 341 prescriptions that matched the drug inclusion criteria for 210 different patients. The most frequently observed scenario involved the prescription for women of selective alpha-blockers, including alfuzosin hydrochloride, tamsulosin hydrochloride, and terazosin hydrochloride, that are indicated exclusively for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Conclusions The electronic patient record system used in the health maintenance organization studied was programmed to block the prescription of sex-specific drugs for patients of the opposite sex for which they are intended unless proper authorization has been obtained. Furthermore, periodic investigation into prescription impropriety may be easily accomplished through the implementation of pharmacoepidemiological methods commonly used in drug utilization studies.",

These important meetings were integral to patient care, facilitated care coordination, and improved the managed care of the patient. During COVID-19 and beyond, these important relationships should be fostered via digital means. We aimed to identify opportunities of digital health integration for the optimization of physician integration. Study design Cross-sectional study. Methods Prior to COVID-19, we conducted a survey of PCPs at a large multidisciplinary group with more than 1500 physicians that staffs multiple hospitals within a health system. The survey was sent via email with only 1 reminder. Results Thirty-six PCPs responded to the survey; 25% (9/36) were very satisfied and 19.4% (7/36) were moderately satisfied with the current in-person introductions. The PCPs found introductions to specialists helpful; 83.7% (31/37) wanted to put a name to the face, and 64.9% (24/37) wanted to understand the range of service provided by the specialist. Fifty-one percent (19/37) and 54% (20/37) said I can better manage patient care and know when to refer to a and I learn more about a particular specialist, respectively, with specialist introductions. If made easy, 67.6% (25/37) of PCPs would be interested in TeleConnect to facilitate introductions to specialists. Conclusions Referrals between PCPs and specialists have been an integral aspect of medical care within managed care organizations. With the advent of technology during COVID-19, and along with this brief survey, the need for digital means to introduce PCPs and specialists is underscored.",

STUDY DESIGN 2017 Ohio Medicaid Assessment Survey data were analyzed. METHODS Descriptive, bivariate analysis and multiple weighted logistic regressions were conducted. First, weighted logistic regression assessed the association of aggregated social risk (food insecurity, housing instability, financial strain) and health insurance type with avoiding/delaying health care after controlling for sociodemographic covariates. Next, weighted logistic regression assessed the association of social risks with ED visits after controlling for avoiding/delaying health care and sociodemographic covariates. RESULTS Among 39,711 respondents, 21.7% reported avoiding/delaying health care and 27.2% reported having at least 1 ED visit in the past year. Individuals with higher vs lower aggregated social risk had higher odds of avoiding/delaying health care (odds ratio [OR], 1.30; 95% CI, 1.26-1.34) and were more likely to have any ED visits (OR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.07-1.13). Uninsured individuals compared with those with private insurance were more likely to avoid/delay health care (OR, 1.98; 95% CI, 1.73-2.26) and have higher likelihood of any ED visits (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.06-1.42). Finally, individuals who reported avoiding/delaying getting health care were more likely to have higher odds of any ED visits (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.23-1.45). CONCLUSIONS Social risks are important factors in patients' decisions to avoid/delay health care and are associated with increased odds of any ED visits. To reduce ED visits, policy-level efforts need to be made to address these social challenges.",

The present commentary offers 8 additional promising approaches forming a framework known as PANDEMIC. This acronym stands for the following strategies: presumptive language, asking for advice, norms on an anonymous level, description of favorable attributes, emphasizing clinicians' own experiences, mandated choice, images, and communication of risk. Each of the strategies is discussed in turn. Many of the proposed strategies have empirical support for achieving desired outcomes in other domains. However, the PANDEMIC framework is untested in regard to increasing the uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations. Therefore, the strategies should be carefully evaluated before they are widely disseminated through public health announcements, email distribution lists, electronic health record messages, and other outlets.",

We check the validity of this comparison in terms of accuracy and definitions and suggest expanding its scope to include expanded financial data of the 2 Medicare systems. STUDY DESIGN: Using annual Medicare Boards of Trustees and National Health Expenditure Accounts data from CMS and health insurers' financial statement data, we compare the level and percentage of the administrative expenses of the Medicare systems and show incompatible and not reconcilable definitions of administrative expenses. We expand our analysis to income, benefits, gains and losses, and loss ratios of the programs. METHODS: Our methodology is a careful comparison of categories of expenses between public and private insurers using official data sources. The comparison is both qualitative and quantitative. RESULTS: We validate the low administrative expenses of Medicare parts A, B, and D (1.35% of benefits in 2018) compared with Medicare Part C (10.86% of benefits without loss adjustment expenses [LAE] and 14.84% with LAE for 2018). Expanding the focus, the income and benefits per beneficiary grew faster and larger in Medicare parts A, B, and D than in Medicare Part C-a reversal of earlier trends. The public Medicare program suffered losses in 11 years during 2002-2018, whereas private insurers' Medicare remained solvent with about an 85% loss ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Comparisons of the systems in the United States would benefit from expanding the focus beyond incomparable administrative expenses. For the current period of coronavirus disease 2019, if the trends continue, public Medicare may suffer greater deficits relative to the private Medicare Part C.",

There were no major differences in 1L, second-line, or third-line therapy by site of care. Patients with aNSCLC in physician office had longer 1L duration (hospital outpatient, 96 days vs physician office, 102 days; P < .01), but there were no differences in duration of therapy by site of care for mBC or mCRC. Costs were higher in the hospital outpatient setting for mCRC and mBC, but there were no differences in OS for any of the cancers.Although patients received similar care in hospital outpatient and physician office settings, the differences in duration of treatment and costs warrant further evaluation.",

Outcomes included end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) or kidney failure, a composite cardiovascular (CV) outcome, and all-cause mortality assessed with multivariable adjusted survival models. Days out of the home and all-cause total costs were assessed using multivariable adjusted generalized linear models.A total of 288,170 patients were included. The adjusted HR for ESKD or kidney failure was 4.38 (95% CI, 3.99-4.81) in patients with 40% or greater decline versus those with a decline of less than 40%. The adjusted HR was 1.67 (95% CI, 1.53-1.82) for the composite CV outcome and 1.98 (95% CI, 1.87-2.10) for all-cause mortality. Patients with a 40% or greater relative decline had 2.23 times higher all-cause total per patient per month costs ($1910 difference) and 1.82 times higher odds of 7 or more days out of the home versus those with less than 40% relative eGFR decline.Our results indicate that a relative eGFR decline of 40% or greater is associated with an increased risk of ESKD or kidney failure, CV outcomes and all-cause mortality, and increased health care resource utilization and costs.",

Although HFrEF and HFpEF share some characteristics, treatment approaches are different, and treatment options for HFpEF are more limited. All patients would benefit from guideline-directed medical treatment. The FDA has expanded the indications for sacubitril/valsartan to encompass both patients with HFrEF and selected patients with HFpEF, and the sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors to reduce heart failure hospitalizations and the risk of cardiovascular death in symptomatic patients with HFrEF. It has also approved vericiguat, an oral soluble guanylyl cyclase activator. In addition, investigators are examining possible uses of omecamtiv mecarbil and nonsteroidal aldosterone antagonists in heart failure. Addressing heart failure is a team effort, and such teams need overlapping expertise, innovative approaches, and resources that support and sustain their efforts. Team members should familiarize themselves with the American College of Cardiology 2021 Update to the 2017 Expert Consensus Decision Pathway as a means to offer the best care to the patients that they serve.",

Over the past several months in epicenters of the COVID-19 pandemic, PC providers have responded to the increased need for PC services through innovative digital programs including telepalliative care programs. In this article, we explore how PC innovations during COVID-19 could transform the PC consult to address workforce shortages and expand access to PC services during and beyond the pandemic. We propose a 3-pronged strategy of bolstering inpatient telepalliative care services, expanding electronic consults, and increasing training and educational tools for providers to help meet the increased need for PC services in the future.",

    "abstract": "As of May 2021, the United States remains the world leader with 33 million of 165 million cases worldwide (20%) and 590,000 of 3.4 million deaths worldwide (17%) from COVID-19. Achieving herd immunity by disease spread and vaccination may result in 2 million to 4 million total US deaths. The future perfect of the vaccine should not be the enemy of the present good, which is masking. Masking, especially when combined with social distancing, crowd avoidance, frequent hand and face washing, increased testing capabilities, and contact tracing, is likely to prevent at least as many premature deaths as the widespread utilization of an effective and safe vaccine. Worldwide, masking is the oldest and simplest engineered control to prevent transmission of respiratory pathogens. Masking has been a cornerstone of infection control in hospitals, operating rooms, and clinics for more than a century. Unfortunately, since the epidemic began in the United States, masking has become politicized. All countries, but especially the United States, must adopt masking as an urgent necessity and a component of coordinated public health strategies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Any economic advantages of pandemic politics are short-lived and shortsighted in comparison with public health strategies of proven benefit that can prevent needless and mostly avoidable premature deaths from COVID-19. During the worst epidemic in more than 100 years, most Americans (75%) trust their health care providers. As competent and compassionate health care professionals, we recommend that effective strategies, especially masking, and not pandemic politics, should inform all rational clinical and public health decision-making.",

The COVID-19 pandemic, however, accelerated legislative action on health care proposals, leading to the last-minute passage of the No Surprises Act at the end of 2020. The law marks a rare bipartisan success that promises to secure patient protections while also adding price transparency tools. Importantly, it creates an independent dispute resolution process that balances the demands of payers and providers in negotiating surprise billing. While the cost implications of this process will not be known until after implementation in 2022, it creates a template for states to emulate. Furthermore, it will reorient the relationships among payers and provider groups that have historically relied on out-of-network billing. This new competitive reality is an important step for consumer financial protection in health care.",

    "abstract": "The Trump administration ended television advertising for the Health Insurance Marketplace prior to the 2018 open enrollment period, leaving insurers as the predominant source of health insurance advertising. Prior research findings are mixed on the effectiveness of private advertising on Marketplace enrollment, but no work to date has examined how competitive changes in health insurance markets are related to marketing patterns. This study provides the first evidence on how insurers are altering their marketing in response to changes in competition.This study links data capturing Marketplace participation (CMS Qualified Health Plan Landscape files) by county and health insurance advertising (Kantar Media/Campaign Media Analysis Group) by media market for the 2014 through 2018 open enrollment periods.We used population-weighted county fixed effects models to estimate the relationship between year-over-year changes in Marketplace competition and changes in (1) total private advertising and (2) advertising per insurer.Going from multiple insurers to a single insurer resulted in 465 fewer private ads aired within a county during open enrollment (P < .01), a 17% to 38% reduction. Losing monopoly status is associated with a drop in advertising of 452 airings per insurer (P < .01), and becoming a monopolist is associated with 293 more airings per insurer (P < .01).Insurers are not replacing the decline in government-sponsored advertising. We find that insurers behave as if they are responding to strategic incentives, advertising more when they become a monopolist but not filling the hole left by their former competitor, which has implications for the volume of messages seen by consumers.",

In this study, we examined the association between site of care and drug cost across reference filgrastim, tbo-filgrastim (Granix; a version of filgrastim approved as a biosimilar in Europe and as a new drug in the United States), and biosimilar filgrastim administrations among the commercially insured.Retrospective study using administrative claims data.We used OptumLabs Data Warehouse to identify the site of care of each short-acting filgrastim administration among commercial enrollees between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2019.For each filgrastim product, model-adjusted median drug costs were higher in the outpatient hospital setting than for the same drug administered in the office setting. Comparing drug costs within the same setting, in the office setting, costs of biosimilar and tbo-filgrastim were $103.61 and $94.07 lower than reference filgrastim, respectively (P < .001 for each comparison). In the outpatient hospital setting, adjusted median costs for tbo-filgrastim were lower than those for reference filgrastim (-$132.90; P < .001), but adjusted median costs of the biosimilar were slightly higher ($20.50; P = .025).Although previous work has found lower costs for biosimilar filgrastim compared with reference filgrastim, here we found that site of care can change this calculus, reducing savings. After adjusting for patient characteristics and geography, we found that drug cost savings for biosimilar filgrastim were limited to the office setting, with no savings in the outpatient hospital setting.",

Marginal savings (or costs) due to implementing the device are derived by comparing the aggregate costs between the 2 pathways. Sources of potential savings are 2-fold. First, VCTE/CAP tests result in early identification of patients with FLD (the majority are currently undiagnosed), allowing for proactive intervention and behavior change to slow the progression of disease in these patients. Second, VCTE/CAP tests can reduce the aggregate volume of some current diagnosis methods, such as liver biopsy, imaging, and laboratory work.Our model relied on administrative claims data consisting of 5 million commercial members and 3 million Medicare members to inform baseline statistics on disease prevalence, health care cost and utilization, and disease progression associated with different severities of liver disease. We consulted expert clinical opinion and medical literature to inform our assumptions related to device adoption and use.Scenario testing demonstrated positive net savings within 2 to 3 years after device deployment. Across a 5-year time span, we estimate net savings up to $2.64 per member per month (PMPM) for Medicare payers and up to $1.91 PMPM for commercial payers.We conclude that deploying VCTE/CAP devices is a financially advantageous solution to address the epidemic of FLD.",

However, no studies have assessed health care utilization (HCU) and patient flow across merged institutions. We aim to evaluate patient population distribution, HCU, and patient flow across a recent hospital merger of an academic medical center (AMC), a primary and specialty care alliance (PSC), and a community-based medical center (CMC).This was a retrospective observational study.The study used 2018 adult demographic and encounter data from electronic health records. Patients' parent health care institution was determined by the most frequently visited site of face-to-face visits. Differences in patient demographics and HCU (ie, emergency department [ED] visits, hospitalizations, primary care visits) were compared. Independent factors associated with utilization were identified using adjusted logistic regression models.A total of 406,303 adult patients were identified in the cohort. The PSC setting, compared with the AMC and the CMC, had significantly more female (62.7% vs 54.4% and 58.5%, respectively), older (mean [SD] age, 52.0 [18.1] vs 51.1 [17.8] and 49.2 [17.8] years), and privately insured (63.6% vs 51.3% and 56.0%) patients. A higher proportion of patients at the CMC (27.5%) visited the ED compared with patients at the AMC (10.8%). Approximately 1645 primary care patients (7%) at the CMC setting went to the AMC for specialized care such as oncology, surgery, and neurology.Hospital mergers are increasing across the United States, allowing AMCs to expand their reach. These findings suggest that patients mainly sought care at their parent health care institution, yet appropriately received specialized care at the AMC. These results provide insights for future mergers and guide resource allocation and opportunities for improving care delivery.",

All distinct line-item descriptions were classified into a more informative and consistent set of categories. We then applied higher conceptual dimensions (type of care input and type of ACO strategy) to these newly categorized expenses to facilitate additional analysis of spending patterns.AIM ACOs reported expenses of $264.8 million over the 3 performance years (2016-2018). The majority of the $264.8 million in expenditures was incurred for personnel (55.5%), followed by infrastructure (22.3%), management firm expenses (15.3%), and internal programs and systems (6.9%). The dominant identifiable ACO strategy was care coordination and management, accounting for 52.9% of related ACO expenses.AIM ACOs invested most heavily in personnel, information technology, and care management, with less than half of the investments explicitly tied to a strategy for improving quality or reducing spending. Efforts to change clinician practice patterns, alter the way patients access the health care system, and institute other practice redesigns were not primary targets for investment.",

Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (NPV), and percentage of population identified as high risk were compared for each risk predictor utilizing the McNemar test to identify statistically significant differences in risk prediction accuracy.A total of 214,452 children were included; the mean age was 7.8 years. HEDIS and revised HEDIS identified prohibitively large cohorts as high risk (67% and 48%, respectively). For the remaining measures, the NPV range is narrow (97%-99%), indicating high performance at identifying patients who would not benefit from intervention. The ED visit and ED/hospitalization measures have superior sensitivities (44% and 49%, respectively) compared with pharmacy claims-based measures (AMR [5%] and SABA count [10%]). Pharmacy claims-based measures identify a smaller proportion of patients as high risk and maintain high NPV.Pharmacy-based asthma exacerbation risk predictors such as the AMR and SABA count can rule out low-risk patients with a high degree of specificity and NPV, which is a primary goal of real-time risk monitoring in pediatric asthma.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have assessed the economic burden of concomitant joint disease in patients with psoriasis (PSO). This analysis compared health care resource utilization (HCRU) and health care costs in patients with PSO vs those with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).This was a retrospective database analysis of US commercially insured patients with PSO or PsA.Electronic health records (EHRs) and claims in Optum's deidentified Integrated Claims-Clinical data set from 2007 to 2018 were analyzed. Patients were followed up from the first PSO or PsA diagnosis for up to 5 years. Patients with claims or diagnosis codes in EHR data for PSO (\"PSO only\") were propensity score matched to patients with claims/diagnosis codes for both PSO and PsA (\"PSO-PsA\").The matching algorithm generated 4418 matched patient pairs. During follow-up, PSO-PsA patients had greater HCRU than PSO-only patients, including more cumulative all-cause outpatient claims (P ≤ .05 at each year of follow-up). Mean total annual health care costs per patient were higher in PSO-PsA patients than PSO-only patients (PSO only: $14,546-$15,800 vs PSO-PsA: $21,581-$22,868; P < .05 at each year of follow-up). All-cause outpatient and pharmacy costs were also higher in the PSO-PsA cohort (P < .05 at each year of follow-up).Comorbid joint disease in PSO is associated with greater costs and use of health care resources than PSO alone. These findings underscore the need for dermatologists to be vigilant about detection and treatment of joint symptoms. Early PsA diagnosis and therapy are crucial to improve patient outcomes and reduce the potential economic burden.",

    "abstract": "During the past decade, experts have devoted substantial efforts to quality improvement for managed care. Although a handful of studies have examined the effect of quality on enrollment, few have systematically investigated the association between managed care quality and plan disenrollment, especially among lowincome populations.To examine whether higher-quality measures in managed care plans are associated with lower disenrollment from the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) in New York State.Observational study of managed care plan disenrollment for a New York statewide cohort of 2206 new SCHIP enrollees.Managed care quality was measured by 7 Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey (CAHPS) scores and 3 Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) scores, obtained from the 2002 New York State Managed Care Plan Performance Report. Disenrollment was defined as being disenrolled from an SCHIP plan for 2 or more consecutive months based on the New York SCHIP universal billing files.Nearly 40% of children were disenrolled during the study period. No overall effects of plan quality on disenrollment were detected, but plans with higher scores in \"preventive care visits\" had a significantly lower disenrollment rate. The disenrollment rate in the eligibility recertification period was 3.2 percentage points higher than that in other time periods.Disenrollment was not associated with overall managed care plan quality as measured by CAHPS and HEDIS, suggesting that further study is warranted to determine optimal strategies for enhancing managed care quality in the SCHIP population.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States and among the most costly diseases. Most strokes are categorized as ischemic, and 10% to 15% are preceded by a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Stroke survivors suffer levels of disability and handicap that range from mild to very severe, and they rarely make a complete recovery. Initial stroke patients are at considerable risk for recurrent stroke, which can compound a patient's impairment and associated costs. This article discusses the burden of stroke on patients and caregivers, the risk of stroke recurrence, and the pharmacoeconomics of antiplatelet therapy. Studies show that effective secondary prevention such as antiplatelet therapy can improve clinical outcomes in patients who have experienced TIA or prior stroke. Recently updated guidelines for secondary stroke prevention from the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommend administering antiplatelet agents rather than anticoagulants for patients who experienced an ischemic noncardioembolic stroke or TIA to reduce the risk of stroke or other cardiovascular events. The guidelines state that aspirin (ASA), ASA + extended-release dipyridamole (DP), and clopidogrel are acceptable initial treatment options for these patients. A recent pharmacoeconomic analysis of all 3 therapies concluded that ASA and ASA + DP offer cost-effective secondary prevention for patients who have suffered a mild initial stroke. Understanding the role of antiplatelet therapy in secondary prevention can help the managed care community optimize clinical and economic outcomes, thereby reducing the overall burden of cerebrovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Transient ischemic attack (TIA) and stroke are commonly occurring cerebrovascular events that require prompt and appropriate treatment to reduce the risk of secondary stroke. The US Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Department of Defense constitute 2 large medical systems treating military personnel, both active and retired, as well as many of their dependents. In the area of stroke and TIA management, the VA in particular has instituted far-reaching measures, including those to ensure adherence to clinical treatment guidelines shown to produce optimal outcomes in stroke. The result of these measures has been that VA patients experience lower morbidity and mortality risk, as well as lower rates of stroke-related rehospitalization, than comparable patients treated through Medicare and Medicaid and in university hospitals. These successes in part may be an advantage derived from a relatively closed system with sufficient administrative discipline to maintain clinical guidelines treatment standards. It may also be the case that continuity of care in these systems produces better outcomes than more fragmentary treatment that may be experienced in the civilian realm. In addition, the VA system avoids incentivizing physicians for performing medical services, and instead incentivizes quality of care, which may provide a further advantage for patients treated within that system.",

Data from 2000-2001 and 2004-2005 are pooled together, and the year trend effect is represented by a dummy variable for 2004-2005.We find that the coefficient measuring the effects of managed care on drug formulary use declined from 0.37 (P <.01) in 2000-2001 to 0.27 (P <.01) in 2004-2005. However, this relative decline in the effects of managed care on formulary use reflects not an absolute decline in formulary use in managed care but an increase in formulary use in the nonmanaged care sector. For the typical physician who has a mix of managed care and nonmanaged care patients, drug formulary use increased over time.Differences in drug formulary use between managed care and nonmanaged care declined from 2000-2001 to 2004-2005. The overall level of drug formulary use increased, reflecting an increase in the nonmanaged care sector.",

We then determined the out-of-pocket costs for each drug for each Medicare PDP and compared those costs with Walmart's GDDP cash price.There were 62 and 43 generic medications used to treat common chronic diseases available through Walmart's GDDP in 2009 and 2017, respectively. Across all PDPs, the median beneficiary out-of-pocket expenditure for a 30-day supply of the GDDP-available medications for chronic diseases decreased from $5.70 (interquartile range [IQR], $2.55-$7.98) in 2009 to $2.00 (IQR, $0.00-$4.00) in 2017 (P <.001) Approximately three-fifths (60.2%) of PDPs required beneficiaries to pay out-of-pocket costs higher than those of Walmart's GDDP in 2009, but only one-third (33.4%) did so in 2017.Although Medicare beneficiary out-of-pocket costs for commonly used generic drug prescriptions generally decreased over time, Medicare beneficiaries may still be paying more for the same drugs than they would through Walmart's GDDP.

[6]][8] Insurance claims tell the organization which conditions its members are experiencing, but they also present a problem: Insurance claims are agnostic about the burden that the associated conditions place on an individual's health and function.It is therefore necessary to assign a weight to each claim that reflects the disease burden.We used the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) as our source of condition weights. 9o document whether and the extent to which our method of calculating DALYs is a valid measure of disease burden, as well as the extent to which it provides information that is not available with measures that are more straightforward, we asked the following questions: (1) Are the correlations between DALYs and function and health of the same magnitude as an accepted measure of risk: the number of disease conditions associated with an individual? 10,112) Do the correlations between DALYs and function and health provide information that differs from that of 2 simpler indicators: the number of members who have a particular condition and the healthcare costs associated with a condition?(3) Is simply calculating the function losses or the health losses associated with a disease or condition as useful as our method of calculating DALYs?",

Austin Health Center, a federally qualified health center, so that new patients were scheduled to see the pharmacist in a 15-minute encounter immediately before a 15-minute encounter with the primary care provider.Reports generated in the electronic health record were downloaded into Microsoft Excel for statistical analysis. Two-sample 2-tailed t tests assuming unequal variances were used to evaluate changes in the mean number of appointments checked in and canceled before and after the project's implementation to study provider productivity, the primary study outcome. Descriptive statistics were used to report the pharmacist's productivity.Statistically significant increases in the number of checked-in new patient visits and in all visits of any type were observed at site A; however, these changes were not observed at site B.The linked visits between the pharmacist and provider allowed for increased provider productivity at 1 of the sites. Based on these results and provider feedback from both sites, this project was viewed as a positive initiative. Scheduling challenges were a barrier to project success at site B.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to establish a claims-based mechanism for identifying patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (mNSCLC) and high levels of patient-reported cancer-related symptoms who could benefit from engagement with health care programs.A cross-sectional survey of patients with mNSCLC was conducted from July 2017 to May 2018. Surveys were mailed to patients who were within 3 months of cancer treatment and enrolled in a Medicare Advantage health plan.Pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance were measured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2. Medical claims were linked to survey results to identify comorbidities and assess preindex health care resource utilization. Cluster analysis was used to differentiate patients based on patient-reported pain interference, pain intensity, depression, and sleep disturbance. Logistic regression was used to identify claims-based measures associated with more severe symptoms.For 698 respondents, 2 distinct symptom clusters were identified: a less severe (38.4%) cluster and a more severe (61.6%) cluster. Patients in the more severe cluster were younger, were more frequently dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, and more frequently had prescription fills for opioids. Claims-based factors associated with the more severe cluster included 2 or more 30-day fills for opioids in the prior 6 months, age younger than 75 years, depression diagnosis or antidepressants, bone metastases, and pain-related outpatient visits.The claims-based factors associated with the severe symptom cluster can enable identification of patients with mNSCLC who could benefit from clinical outreach programs to enhance the care and support provided to these patients.",

VBAs link payment for a medication to its performance in real-world clinical practice measured against prespecified outcomes that are aligned to existing evidence. Given its high prevalence, economic burden, and impact on mortality, cardiovascular disease (namely, coronary heart disease) represents an opportunity for VBAs to contribute to improved health outcomes and patient experiences while reducing or containing total medical costs. AstraZeneca developed a VBA framework directly comparing 2 antiplatelet therapies indicated to treat acute coronary syndrome (ACS)-ticagrelor and clopidogrel-based on the PLATO trial, which demonstrated superiority for ticagrelor in reducing the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) in patients with ACS. Between 2015 and 2018, 11 contract-years of VBAs utilizing this framework were implemented in commercial and Part D health insurance plans, totaling nearly 32,000 unique patients in which pooled analyses were conducted. Aggregated VBA results indicate that ticagrelor consistently outperformed expectations in reducing recurrent MI vs clopidogrel, while also illustrating how comparative VBA frameworks of this nature may overcome challenges noted for VBAs and be utilized more broadly in future applications.",

Six regional market factors were used to characterize veterans' health care insurance coverage and affluence. A logistic regression was used to examine changes in individual-level patient-provider communication experience when regional market factors increase or decrease the demand for VHA primary care services.Our findings supported our hypothesis that changes in regional market factors shift patient demand for VHA care and affect patient-provider communication measured by patient experience surveys. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of positive patient-provider communication was associated with a regional increase (first to third quartile) of employer-sponsored insurance (AOR, 1.028; 95% CI, 1.001-1.055) and a decrease (third to first quartile) in the veterans' unemployment rate (AOR, 0.966; 95% CI, 0.944-0.990). Higher primary care capacity (first to third quartile) was also associated with positive patient-provider communication (AOR, 1.050; 95% CI, 1.018-1.082).Findings from this study raise concerns that safety net hospitals could be unfairly penalized by value-based payment programs and Medicare Hospital Compare. Such policies and programs could improve resource allocation by accounting for regional market factors before acting on quality of care measures.",

However, there is considerable variation in generic use across plans, even within a therapeutic class. Our objective is to understand the extent of variation in generic use in Part D and to understand factors associated with generic use.We used an observational study design using Medicare Part D claims from 2006 to 2016.We used descriptive statistics and regression analysis to examine the variation in generic and brand use across plans and the extent to which patient, plan, and area characteristics are associated with the choice of medication within a therapeutic class.Although generic use has increased markedly over time in Part D, substantial variation across plans persists in a number of common therapeutic classes. Beneficiary characteristics such as gender and health status are associated with higher/lower generic use, as are plan characteristics such as plan type (stand-alone prescription drug plan or Medicare Advantage), premium, and parent company.Because we cannot study the impact of brand-name drug rebates on generic use, we can study the variation in generic use across Part D plans as an indirect way to assess pharmacy benefit manager and plan incentives. We find circumstantial evidence that, in certain classes, rebates may play a role in influencing brand over generic use, although the exact relationship is unknowable given the proprietary nature of rebates.",

Study design We used the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's 2009 and 2014 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project State Inpatient Databases for 4 states with reliable sources of payment identifiers, linking these data to local area characteristics. Our outcome was the probability of a hospital readmission within 30 days of an index admission. We computed readmission rates overall and by subgroups, including for patients with multiple chronic conditions, by patients' state of residence, and by type of index admission. Methods We estimated linear probability models with hospital fixed effects including a wide array of patient-level characteristics relating to health status and sociodemographic characteristics. Standard errors were adjusted for clustering at the area level. Results Significantly lower all-cause readmission rates were found among MA enrollees relative to those in TM in both 2009 and 2014, suggesting an association between MA enrollment and higher quality of care. However, over the 2009-2014 period, MA enrollment was not associated with an increased reduction in readmission rates relative to TM. Conclusions Although our focus was on a single measure of performance, the claims that managed care plans are spearheading changes in the delivery system are not supported by our finding that relative readmission rates were stable over the 2009-2014 period.",

The data reported are specific to mental health services and include the number of authorization requests, number of clinical denials, and the reasons specified for each denial. Analyses were undertaken to determine the UR denial rates and most common reasons for denials.A total of 264,901 requests for inpatient mental health service authorizations and 53,687 requests for outpatient mental health service authorizations were made in 2017 and 2018. Of these, 1.5% of inpatient authorization requests and 0.4% of outpatient authorization requests were denied for reasons related to medical necessity. The most common reason for inpatient mental health service denials was that the patient no longer met the standard for the requested level of care.Low UR denial rates warrant further examination of the relationship between UR and both quality of care and patient outcomes in mental health care. With the substantial resources spent on UR, findings could point to areas of potential reforms to the system that may minimize these costs and improve care for patients with mental illness.",

In particular, in HRRs where the wage index is half the national mean there is a 35% decline in the rate of TAVR use and in HRRs where the wage index is 50% higher than the national mean there is a 52% increase in the rate of TAVR use.Consistent with our framework and hypothesis, our results highlight the importance of adjusting Medicare hospital inpatient payments for device-intensive procedures. Absent such adjustment, access to appropriate interventions may be reduced in areas with low wage index, and lower reimbursement, when driven by wage index adjustment, may influence the treatment approach selected.",

Understanding opioid use in patients with cancer can facilitate effective pain management regimens while minimizing safety concerns. This study characterized patterns of and factors associated with opioid use following a new cancer diagnosis.Retrospective cohort study.Our study included patients with a new cancer diagnosis aged 18 to 64 years in IQVIA PharMetrics Plus 2007-2013 who were continuously enrolled 12 months before receiving their cancer diagnosis and 24 months after. Study outcomes included opioid prevalence and measures of potentially high-risk opioid use (total days supplied, number of prescriptions, and morphine equivalent daily dose [MEDD]). Descriptive analyses and logistic regression were implemented.Of 191,616 eligible individuals, 93,739 (48.9%) received opioid prescriptions; of these, 56,025 (59.8%) were new opioid users. Opioid users received 4.6 prescriptions on average, covering 65 total days with a mean MEDD of 31.8 mg. Only 2387 (2.5%) patients received higher than recommended (≥ 90 mg) MEDD. Predictors of opioid use post cancer included prior opioid use, select comorbidities, use of nonopioid pain treatment adjuvants (muscle relaxants, sedative/hypnotics, anticonvulsants, antidepressants, and steroids), cancer site, and metastatic cancer.Fewer than half of patients received opioids in the 2 years following cancer onset. Among users, we found a relatively small proportion of potentially problematic opioid use. Further research is warranted to assess the adequacy of cancer pain treatment and determinants of high-risk opioid use.",

    "abstract": "The opioid abuse epidemic has focused attention on efforts to decrease opioid prescribing. Although education and feedback interventions are potential levers to affect opioid prescribing, their incremental contribution against a background of declining opioid prescriptions is unclear.We retrospectively evaluated opioid prescribing frequencies after an emergency physician-specific education and feedback initiative in an integrated health care system.We evaluated opioid prescriptions for adult patients discharged from 21 emergency departments (EDs) between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018. Applying interrupted time series methodology to account for time trends, we analyzed pre- to postintervention changes in prescribing of any opioid and in opioid prescriptions for greater than 20 tablets. We studied all ED visits, visits for back pain and acute extremity fracture, and visits stratified by physicians with high vs low frequency of opioid prescribing. We identified patient, physician, and visit characteristics associated with postintervention ED opioid prescriptions (2018).Of 1.01 million preintervention and 1.59 million postintervention ED visits, after adjusting for the background trend over time, the intervention was associated with a 3.4% decrease in frequency of opioid prescriptions post intervention (95% CI, -4% to -2.8%), with similar decreases in high-quantity prescriptions (> 20 tablets) and back pain- and acute extremity fracture-related ED visits. Postintervention adjusted analyses indicated no significant association between opioid prescription and race/ethnicity or prior history of opioid abuse.The ED Opioid Safety Initiative was associated with a near-term decrease in multiple categories of opioid prescribing, including for selected subgroups of common painful conditions.",

    "abstract": "Covishield and Covaxin vaccines have been introduced after rapid approval in India, the nation that has the second most COVID-19 cases globally. These vaccines have been administered in a 2-dose schedule since January 16, 2021. This study deals with the clinical profile of individuals who developed COVID-19 infection post COVID-19 vaccination. This is the first study of its kind in India.Descriptive cross-sectional study.The study population was composed of individuals who were COVID-19 positive more than 4 weeks post vaccination and were compared with individuals who were COVID-19 positive within the first 4 weeks of vaccination. Data were collected in a digital questionnaire format and analyzed with SPSS version 23 software. Clinical features were profiled in detail. Chi-square analysis was done to find out the association of various demographic features with the severity of the disease.In the study population, fever was the most common symptom (75.1%), followed by anosmia (72.1%) and shortness of breath (16.3%). There was a lower incidence of fever, cough, dyspnea, and requirement of hospitalization in the study population compared with the control group and previous epidemiological data. The time required for complete recovery and disease severity was favorable in our study population. There was a significant correlation in the rate of hospitalization among the study group and the comparative group (P = .0001) and between the number of doses of COVID-19 vaccine and the lowest oxygen saturation recorded (P = .001).The findings of this study should boost the ongoing initiative of maximizing the vaccinated population countrywide and emphasize the need for 2 doses of vaccination.",

Several sources of 2016 national public data were used.The key variable is county-level Medicare home health expenditures per home health beneficiary. Counties were grouped into quintiles based on per-beneficiary expenditures. Analyses included calculation of coefficients of variation, computation of the ratio of 90th percentile to 10th percentile in expenditures, and linear regression predicting expenditure. The control variables included characteristics of patients, agencies, and communities.Significant variation in home health expenditures was identified across county quintiles, with a 90th-to-10th-percentile expenditure ratio of 2.5. The percentage of for-profit agencies in the lowest quintile was 15.7 compared with 81.7 in the highest quintile of spending. Unadjusted spending differed by $3864 (95% CI, $3793-$3936), compared with $3611 (95% CI, $3514-$3708) in the adjusted model, between counties in spending quintiles 1 and 5. Although state fixed effects explained nearly 20% of the variation in home health expenditures, 42% of the variation remained unexplained.Home health care exhibits considerable unwarranted variation in per-patient expenditures across counties, signifying inefficiency and waste. Given the expected growth in home health demand, strategies to reduce unwarranted geographic variation are needed.",

Three waves of surveys were mailed (n = 5000) to collect information on activation (Consumer Health Activation Index; Influence, Motivation, and Patient Activation for Diabetes) and health-related quality of life (Healthy Days). Generalized linear models and predictive models evaluated the associations of unhealthy days and HbA1c with physical activity and activation factors. Additional models tested the relationship between physical activity and future acute care visits, accounting for potential confounders via inverse probability of treatment weighting.Respondents to all 3 waves (n = 1147) had higher comorbidity indices but lower HbA1c than individuals with T2D without physical activity data (P < .0001). Individuals with moderate and high activation levels had 67.4% to 74.0% and 71.6% to 85.6% fewer unhealthy days, respectively, than those with lower activation (P < .01). Individuals with high (> 8000/day) step counts at baseline were predicted to have 2.04 fewer unhealthy days/month at follow-up (P < .05) and 0.19% (P < .02) lower HbA1c units, respectively, compared with those with less than 4000 steps per day. High SilverSneakers activity (> 2 activities per week) reduced subsequent acute care visits by 49%.Increasing patient activation levels encourages physical activity, which can help improve glycemic control and health-related quality of life, especially among older adults.",

Fisher exact test was used for categorical variables and Student's t test with equal variances was used for continuous variables.The setting was a multidisciplinary pediatric chronic pain management clinic in Florida. Participants were 362 patients scheduled for an initial pain clinic evaluation 1 year prior to and after the implementation of a preappointment survey on August 19, 2019. Our main outcome measures were show rate and appointment length.Patients who completed a preappointment survey were significantly more likely to attend their clinic appointment than noncompleters (97.2% vs 36.2%) and spent significantly less time in their appointment.With new patients, preappointment surveys can improve clinic show rate and decrease time spent in initial appointments. Clinics may consider policies targeting completion of preappointment surveys to assist with show rate, but they must consider their patients' barriers to completing surveys so access to care is not limited.",

    "abstract": "The No Surprises Act took effect in 2022 and prevents patients from receiving unexpected emergency department (ED) out-of-network physician bills from in-network hospitals and restricts out-of-network co-payments to in-network co-payment levels. By studying similar state bans, we examine whether the large reduction in out-of-pocket payments under bans will have an unintended consequence of an increase in ED visits and spending.We examine 16 million nonelderly, fully funded, privately insured health maintenance organization (HMO) enrollees between 2007 and 2018 from 15 states with balance billing bans for HMO ED visits and 16 states without bans as the control group.Using MarketScan data, we conduct an event study analysis and a difference-in-difference analysis of the impact of state balance billing bans on the probability of an ED visit. We use a 2-part expenditure model to estimate the impact on spending.By analyzing 15 state-level bans, we find that the bans reduced spending per visit by 14% but spurred a demand response, an increase of 3 percentage points in ED visits, which wiped away the cost savings. Based on an ED severity index, these extra ED visits were 9% less urgent than prior to the bans.We predict that the federal ban will result in $5.1 billion in savings but 3.5 million more ED visits at $4.2 billion in extra spending per year, largely negating expected savings. Health plans must be prepared to manage this spike in ED visits as the No Surprises Act takes effect.",

CC is a diagnosis of exclusion associated with a substantial economic burden related to increased healthcare and medication utilization, decreased work productivity, a greater incidence of cough-related comorbidities, and reduced quality of life. CC treatment guidelines recommend stepwise treatment with specific nonpharmacologic therapies and pharmacologic agents. However, many patients may still have incomplete or no symptom relief, encounter response attenuation over time, or experience intolerable adverse effects. New targeted therapies for refractory CC are currently under development, including the purinergic 2X3 receptor antagonists gefapixant, BLU-5937, and sivopixant (S-600918) and the neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist orvepitant. These targeted agents may have improved efficacy and safety profiles, helping fill unmet treatment needs. If approved, managed care organizations must develop formulary placement and utilization management criteria based on clinical guideline recommendations, expert opinion, and cost-effectiveness analyses to support the clinically appropriate use of these targeted therapies for best patient outcomes.",

Study Design:, Survey data from a representative sample of 1048 members enrolled in Commonwealth Coordinated Care Plus, a Virginia Medicaid MLTSS program. Methods:, The survey ascertained whether beneficiaries changed plans at the previous open enrollment period, whether they wanted to change plans but did not, and reasons for not following through with a plan change. Logistic regression analysis examined the association between the intention to change plans and satisfaction with the current health plan. Results:, Seven percent of respondents changed plans during the previous open enrollment. However, twice as many respondents (15%) wanted to change plans but did not. The main reason for not changing plans was uncertainty about whether the new plan would meet their needs better than their current plan. Logistic regression analysis shows that an intention to change plans (realized or not) was associated with higher odds (3.5 times higher) of being dissatisfied with the current health plan compared with beneficiaries who had no intention to change plans. Conclusions:, Greater dissatisfaction after a recent plan change may indicate that these members have specific needs beyond the scope of services offered by managed care organizations.",

The intervention group was matched to members with similar concurrent medical risk profiles, based on the DxCG/Verisk score, who received the same DM outreach through the insurer's standard process (low-LOH intervention group). This approach allowed an evaluation of the predictive algorithm in targeting individuals suitable for DM outreach.Regression models showed that high-LOH intervention members had a lower probability of hospitalization (0.032; P = .075) and emergency department (ED) visit (0.039; P = .043) in the year after the outreach compared with low-LOH intervention members, leading to lower total outpatient spending ($1517; P < .001). Analyses for no-intervention members showed that predictive outreach members would have been expected to have higher inpatient and ED utilization and higher medical spending compared with the traditional care members.A prediction-driven DM outreach program among patients with CHF was effective in reducing medical spending in the year after the outreach compared with traditional DM outreach programs.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: COVID-19 has strained the household finances of many Americans who are already experiencing increasing health care expenses. Concerns about the cost of care may deter patients from seeking even urgent care from the emergency department (ED). This study examines predictors of older Americans' concerns about ED visit costs and how cost concerns may have influenced their ED use in the early stages of the pandemic. Study Design: This was a cross-sectional survey study using a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 50 to 80 years (N = 2074) in June 2020. Methods: Multivariate logistic regressions assessed the relationships of sociodemographic, insurance, and health factors with cost concerns for ED care. Results: Of the respondents, 80% were concerned (45% very, 35% somewhat) about costs of an ED visit and 18% were not confident in their ability to afford an ED visit. Of the entire sample, 7% had avoided ED care because of cost concerns in the past 2 years. Of those who may have needed ED care, 22% had avoided care. Predictors of cost-related ED avoidance included being aged 50 to 54 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 4.57; 95% CI, 1.44-14.54), being uninsured (AOR, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.35-6.52), having poor or fair mental health (AOR, 2.82; 95% CI, 1.62-4.89), and having an annual household income of less than $30,000 (AOR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.19-4.46). Conclusions: During the early COVID-19 pandemic, most older US adults expressed concerns about the financial impact of ED use. Further research should examine how insurance design could alleviate the perceived financial burden of ED use and prevent cost-related care avoidance, especially for those at higher risk in future pandemic surges.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To compare how in-person evaluation and management (E&M) visits and telehealth use differed during the COVID-19 pandemic between commercially insured and Medicaid enrollees, and to assess how insurance plan type—fee-for-service (FFS) vs managed care (MC)—and enrollee characteristics contributed to these differences. Study Design: Retrospective cohort analysis of 2019 and 2020 data from the commercially insured California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS) and the California Medicaid program (Medi-Cal). Methods: We conducted unadjusted comparisons of per capita E&M visits and the share of visits conducted via telehealth by payer (CalPERS vs Medi-Cal) and plan type (FFS vs MC). We estimated linear regressions of telehealth use that adjusted for patient demographics, rurality, and internet access. Among Medi-Cal enrollees, we examined telehealth use differences based on race, language, and citizenship status. Results: Regression-adjusted share of telehealth visits as a proportion of all E&M visits was 22.6% for CalPERS FFS patients (the reference group), 38.2% for Medi-Cal FFS patients, 46.0% for Medi-Cal MC patients, and 53.5% for CalPERS MC patients. Among Medi-Cal enrollees, telehealth use as a share of all E&M visits was higher among Spanish speakers, female enrollees, and rural enrollees. Across most demographic characteristics, Medi-Cal patients enrolled in FFS were less likely to receive telehealth compared with those enrolled in MC. Conclusions: During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, California MC enrollees had higher rates of telehealth use compared with FFS enrollees, regardless of insurer. Among FFS enrollees, those enrolled in Medicaid had higher rates of telehealth use compared with those insured by CalPERS. Telehealth policies should be aware of this heterogeneity, as well as its implications for equity of telehealth access.",

We then described how EHR data were used among hospitals with access and whether use varied by developer.The share of hospitals with access to EHR documentation time measures increased significantly each year between 2017 and 2021, when more than two-thirds of hospitals reported having access to these measures. Despite hospitals' increased access to measures that track EHR time, lower-resourced hospitals, nonteaching hospitals, and hospitals with non-market-leading EHR developers were less likely to report having access than their counterparts. In 2021, the 2 most common uses of EHR data were \"identifying providers in need of training and support\" and \"identifying areas to improve clinical workflow.\" The share of hospitals indicating use of EHR data increased between 2019 and 2021 for all studied uses.A higher proportion of hospitals with access to EHR documentation time measures used them for more purposes over time, suggesting their increased value. Although hospitals' access to and use of EHR documentation measures increased significantly in the last 5 years, future research efforts should investigate whether the use of these measures translates into reduced burden for providers.",

Study Design: Patient experience scores are calculated from the 2018-2019 Massachusetts Statewide Survey of Adult Patient Experience of Primary Care. Physicians were attributed to physician practices using the Massachusetts Healthcare Quality Provider database. Scores were matched to information on the collection or use of clinician performance information from the National Survey of Healthcare Organizations and Systems using practice name and location. Methods: We conducted observational multivariant generalized linear regression at the patient level where the dependent variables were 1 of 9 patient experience scores and the independent variables were 1 of 5 domains in the collection or use of performance information of the practice. Patient-level controls included self-reported general health, self-reported mental health, age, sex, education, and race/ethnicity. Practice-level controls include the size of the practice and the availability of weekend and evening hours. Results: Nearly 90% of practices in our sample collect or use clinician performance information. High patient experience scores were associated with whether any information was collected and used, especially with whether the practice shared this information internally to compare. Among practices that used clinician performance information, patient experience was not associated with whether the information was used in more aspects of care. Conclusions: The collection and use of clinician performance information were associated with better primary care patient experience among physician practices. Deliberate efforts to use clinician performance information in ways that cultivate clinicians’ intrinsic motivation may be especially effective for quality improvement.",

Our objective was to categorize patients with complex chronic conditions into distinct groups by pattern of outpatient care use and COC to tailor interventions. Study Design: Observational cohort study from 2014 to 2015. Methods: We identified patients whose 1-year hospitalization risk was in at least the 90th percentile in 2014 who had a chronic gastrointestinal disease (cirrhosis, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic pancreatitis) as case examples of complex chronic disease. We described frequency of office visits, number of outpatient providers, and 2 COC measures (usual provider of care, Bice-Boxerman COC indices) over 12 months. We used latent profile analysis, a statistical method for identifying distinct subgroups, to categorize patients based on overall, primary care, gastroenterology, and mental health continuity patterns. Results: The 26,751 veterans in the cohort had a mean (SD) of 13.3 (8.6) office visits and 7.2 (3.8) providers in 2014. Patients were classified into 5 subgroups: (1) high gastroenterology-specific COC with mental health use; (2) high gastroenterology-specific COC without mental health use; (3) high overall utilization with mental health use; (4) low overall COC with mental health use; and (5) low overall COC without mental health use. These groups varied in their sociodemographic characteristics and risk for hospitalization, emergency department use, and mortality. Conclusions: Patients at high risk for health care utilization with specialty care needs can be grouped by varying propensity for health care continuity patterns.",

There are few observational studies evaluating the effects that transplant case management programs have on clinical outcomes following a solid organ transplant. This limits the understanding of the quantitative effectiveness of such programs. Study Design: This retrospective cohort study of solid organ transplant recipients with access to a transplant case management program used a case-control study design. Propensity score 1:1 matching was used to balance the comparison groups on demographic and pretransplant clinical characteristics. Methods: Health care claims data were used to determine whether program participation affected clinical outcomes following the transplant. A cohort of 1756 adults 18 years and older (878 cases and 878 controls) who had a solid organ transplant between 2018 and 2020 was followed beginning at the time of referral to transplant until 90 days following the transplant procedure. Results: Transplant recipients who participated in the case management program had significantly lower 30-day and 90-day rejection rates, fewer 90-day readmissions, lower discharge mortality and 90-day mortality, and fewer bed days post transplant compared with those who did not participate in case management. Conclusions: Patients undergoing a solid organ transplant had improved clinical outcomes when they participated in a specialized case management program sponsored by their health plan.",

COVID-19 has significantly disrupted health care delivery and overall economic activity in the United States. We examined how partnerships between Medicaid MCOs and CBOs to address social determinants of health have been affected by the pandemic. Study Design: Guided by questions and recruitment strategies developed with our stakeholder advisory board, we conducted 26 interviews with representatives from all 6 of Kentucky's Medicaid MCOs. Methods: In-depth, structured interviews for data collection and iterative content analyses to identify themes. Results: Several themes emerged, including substantial increases in enrollees' unmet needs and the demand to find new ways to be responsive, changing funding patterns, disruptions to and evolving modes of communication, and shifting partner relationships. In virtually all areas of impact, COVID-19 has been associated with both negative and positive change. Conclusions: Unmet social needs associated with the pandemic placed tremendous strain on CBOs, limiting their capacity to sustain some programs and partnerships. Isolation associated with COVID-19 also had wide-ranging effects on service delivery, communication with enrollees and partners, and the ability to maintain relationships. Nonetheless, the pandemic also had some silver linings, including additional resources and flexibility for addressing unmet needs. Federal and state agencies, along with MCO leaders, should carefully evaluate what innovations have been particularly effective during the pandemic and craft new flexibilities into their policies, procedures, and regulations.",

The impact evaluation was a historical cohort comparison tracking outcomes of interest over the time frame of the intervention.Using risk-adjusted Medicare data, we defined opportunity gaps in the following outcomes: density of KR surgery, site of KR surgery, postacute care placement, and complications.Opportunity gap analysis demonstrated the following variation on a regional basis: a 2-fold difference in density of KR, a 3-fold difference in outpatient surgery, and a 2.5-fold difference in institutional postacute care placement. In the impact evaluation comparing 2019 with 2021, the primary care group's patients had reduced density of KR surgeries from 15.5 per 1000 to 13.0 per 1000, an increase in outpatient surgery from 31.0% to 81.6%, and a reduction in institutional postacute care utilization from 16.0% to 6.1%. Less pronounced trends were seen in the region for all Medicare FFS patients. These results were achieved with stable complication rates, which had an observed/expected ratio of 0.61 in 2019 and 0.63 in 2021.We achieved alignment of incentives through use of performance information with specific goals and promise of referrals to value-based partners.

The objectives of this analysis were to estimate health care resource utilization (HCRU) and benchmark spending per OCM episode of BC, and to model spending drivers and quality metrics.Retrospective cohort study.A retrospective cohort study was conducted of OCM episodes triggered by receipt of anticancer therapy among Medicare beneficiaries from 2016 to 2018. Based on this, an average performance estimation was conducted to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in novel therapy use by OCM practices.BC accounted for approximately 3% (n = 60,099) of identified OCM episodes. Relative to low-risk episodes, high-risk episodes were associated with greater HCRU and worse OCM quality metrics. Mean spending per high-risk episode was $37,857 (low-risk episode: $9204), with $11,051 spent on systemic therapies and $7158 on inpatient services. In the estimation, high- and low-risk BC exceeded the spending target by 1.7% and 9.4%, respectively. This did not affect payments to practices and no retrospective payments were necessary.As 3% of OCM episodes were attributed to BC, with only one-third classified as high-risk, controlling expenditure on novel therapies for advanced BC is unlikely to affect overall practice performance. The average performance estimation further emphasized the minimal impact that novel therapy spending in high-risk BC has on OCM payments to practices.",

Although there are established management guidelines, referral and management patterns can vary. We aimed to explore identification, practice patterns, and management of identified SRMs in an integrated health system.Retrospective analysis.We identified patients with a newly diagnosed SRM measuring 3 cm or less from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2017, at Kaiser Permanente Southern California. These patients were flagged at the time of radiographic identification to ensure adequate notification of findings. Diagnostic modality, referral, and treatment patterns were analyzed.Of 519 patients with SRMs, 65% were found on abdominal CT and 22% on renal/abdominal ultrasounds. Within 6 months, 70% of patients consulted with a urologist. Initial management patterns were as follows: active surveillance (60%), partial/radical nephrectomy (18%), and ablation (4%). Among 312 patients on surveillance, 14% eventually received treatment. The majority of patients (69.4%) did not receive guideline-recommended chest imaging for initial staging. Urologist visit within 6 months of SRM diagnosis was associated with increased adherence to staging (P = .003) and subsequent surveillance imaging (P < .001).In this contemporary analysis of an integrated health system's experience, referral to a urologist was associated with guideline-concordant staging and surveillance imaging. Frequent utilization of active surveillance with a low rate of progression to active treatment was noted in both groups. These findings shed light on care patterns upstream of urologic evaluation and support the need for clinical pathways to be implemented at the time of radiologic diagnosis.",

This study examines the availability of cost-effectiveness analyses for medical devices, in terms of both the number of studies and when studies are published. Study Design: Analysis of the number of years between FDA approval/clearance and publication for cost-effectiveness analyses of medical devices in the United States published between 2002 and 2020 (n = 86). Methods: Cost-effectiveness analyses of medical devices were identified using the Tufts University Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry. Studies in which the model and manufacturer of the medical device used in the intervention were identifiable were linked to FDA databases. Years between FDA approval/clearance and publication of cost-effectiveness analyses were calculated. Results: A total of 218 cost-effectiveness analyses of medical devices in the United States published between 2002 and 2020 were identified. Of these studies, 86 (39.4%) were linked to FDA databases. Studies examining devices approved via premarket approval were published a mean of 6.0 years after the device received FDA approval (median, 4 years), whereas studies examining devices that were cleared via the 510(k) process were published a mean of 6.5 years after the device received FDA clearance (median, 5 years). Conclusions: There are few studies describing the cost-effectiveness of medical devices. Most of these studies’ findings are not published until several years after the studied devices received FDA approval/clearance, meaning that decision makers will likely not have evidence of cost-effectiveness when making initial decisions related to newly available medical devices.",

Treatment approaches include both nonpharmacologic methods and pharmacologic therapies, with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy being the standard of care. Anti-VEGF therapy is an effective treatment option for both nAMD and DME; however, long-term patient compliance may be reduced due to the burden of costs, monthly intravitreal injections, and repeat clinic visits to assess clinical response parameters. Emerging treatments and dosing strategies aim to decrease treatment burden and increase patient safety.

    "abstract": "Johns Hopkins Medicine underwent a significant evolution with a new Office of Population Health (OPH), inclusive of a hybrid clinical and administrative structure, to optimally align expertise with care delivery functions. Initial priorities included identification of high-risk patients to receive care management, integrated behavioral health, and wraparound supports to address social determinants of health. A cross-functional care team provides multidisciplinary support for primary care practice patient needs, and efforts through the Baltimore Metropolitan Diabetes Regional Partnership have helped accelerate scaling of evidence-based diabetes prevention and management programs across the state. Through a multistakeholder process, OPH and partners developed a 3-year strategic plan, with guiding stars of reducing avoidable utilization and disparities in care. The plan prioritized (1) generation of a data and analytics road map, (2) advanced population management clinical services for priority populations, (3) improved performance on value-based care programming, and (4) enhanced health system coordination. With a new OPH, Johns Hopkins Medicine is better positioned to execute on value-based initiatives in support of its patients.",

Study Design: Using US Census data and 2017-2018 commercial claims from a large national insurer, we estimated association between neighborhood-level SDOH and the probability of being a high-cost utilizer. Methods: Observational study using administrative claims from a national insurer and US Census data. Data included a 50% random sample of commercially insured individuals who were younger than 89 years and had 1 year of continuous eligibility in 2017 and at least 30 days in 2018. Probit models assessed impact of SDOH and neighborhood conditions on predicting cost status. Results: SDOH did not improve predictive power of evaluated models. However, disadvantaged neighborhood residence was still associated with being a high-cost utilizer. Adults 65 years and older in disadvantaged neighborhoods had increased likelihood of high-cost utilization. Children and younger adults in disadvantaged neighborhoods had lower risk of becoming high-cost utilizers. Conclusions: Policy makers and industry stakeholders should be aware of the mechanisms behind the relationship between neighborhood social conditions and health outcomes and how the relationship differs across age groups.",

    "abstract": "DELIVERING A SCARY DIAGNOSIS in an honest way is an unhappy part of an oncologist's job.But as tough as it is to tell a patient they have cancer, many oncologists are now confronting how to tell patients with cancer that the drugs used to treat them are so scarce that they may not receive a full dose.And that's assuming the preferred therapy will be available at their next appointment.More than a dozen (the number fluctuates) oncology drugs were officially listed by the FDA as in short supply as of late July 2023. 1 Drug shortages are a recurring reality of practicing medicine in America, but the current shortages of cisplatin and carboplatin are particularly acute, with 93% of the 27 members of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network reporting shortages in June. 2 \"The crisis is a chronic problem,\" said Lucio N. Gordan, MD, in an interview.Gordan is president and managing physician at Florida Cancer Specialists & Research Institute, which has approximately 100 sites of care in its network.\"It got worse around the beginning of the year.We did well until March, but in May we started running out of product.\"The practice instituted \"dose rounding,\" or reducing injections by up to 10%-which Gordan said is accepted practice-and this continued until as long as the supplies of carboplatin and cisplatin lasted.\"There was a period when we were without any drugs.We changed to a second-best practice,\" he said.Changing therapies from the standard treatments to alternatives triggered a chain reaction of new challenges, such as explaining the situation to patients, getting a new set of approvals from insurance companies that were slow to give consent, worrying that out-ofpocket costs for patients would increase, and realizing that \"second best\" is just a gentler way of saying \"not as good.\"",

Study Design: This study used data from the Part D Prescription Drug Plan Formulary, Pharmacy Network, and Pricing Information Files from 2015 to 2022, which provide information on all stand-alone Medicare/Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plans. Methods: We examined the percentage of plans that provided coverage of brand-name and generic buprenorphine-naloxone films with strength 8 mg/2 mg during 2015-2022. Median out-of-pocket (OOP) cost for a 30-day supply was estimated among all plans that provided coverage. Results: Generic buprenorphine-naloxone film was covered by 82% of Medicare Part D plans in 2020, 2 years after market entry. Coverage of brand-name Suboxone film decreased from 76% in 2019 to 42% in 2020. The median OOP cost of buprenorphine-naloxone films faced by Medicare enrollees decreased from $99 in 2019 to $42 in 2020, driven by the lower price of generic films. In contrast, the OOP cost for brand-name buprenorphine-naloxone film increased gradually from $85 in 2015 to $100 in 2022. Conclusions: Medicare Part D plan formularies replaced brand-name buprenorphine-naloxone films with the newly approved generic versions. This was accompanied by a substantial decrease in estimated OOP cost faced by Part D enrollees. These changes could potentially increase access to buprenorphine among Medicare enrollees with opioid use disorder.",

Study Design: A prospective, cross-sectional, correlational survey design was used. A nationwide face-to-face interview survey of community-dwelling older adults was conducted, and the survey participants' health claims records were retrieved and linked under the universal health insurance system of Taiwan in 2018. Methods: Health care outcomes were measured subjectively (patient satisfaction and perceived lack of coordination) and objectively (likelihood of hospital admissions and emergency department [ED] visits). COC was measured using claims-based and multidimensional patient-reported COC. Ordered logit and logit models were used to examine the relationship between the 2 types of COC measures, and health care outcomes were measured subjectively and objectively. Average marginal effects with bootstrapped SEs were computed for health care outcomes. Results: This study demonstrated that the correlations of claims-based and patient-reported COC measures were quite low and mainly insignificant. A higher claims-based COC was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of hospital admissions, ED visits, and perceived lack of coordination. No significant relationship was identified between claims-based COC and patient satisfaction. Participants reporting higher COC had better patient satisfaction and less perceived lack of coordination. However, no relationship was identified between patient-reported COC and the likelihood of hospital admissions and ED visits. Conclusions: The correlation between claims-based and patient-reported COC measures is low, and claims-based and patient-reported COC measures are associated with different subjective and objective health care outcomes. We suggest that claims-based COC indicators representing the pattern of physician visits might be considered a unique dimension of COC.",

Study Design: Instrumental variables analysis of retrospective administrative data. Methods: Data were acquired on 1039 patients treated operatively for a musculoskeletal injury between 2011 and 2015 at 2 level I trauma centers. State registry data were used to track all postoperative opioid prescription fills. Discharge surgical resident was identified for each patient. We categorized residents in the top one-third of opioid prescribing as high-supply residents and others as low-supply residents, with adjustment for service attending physician and month. The primary outcome was subsequent opioid use, defined as new opioid prescriptions and cumulative prescribed opioid supply 7 to 8 months after injury. Results: On average, patients of high-supply residents received an additional 96 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) at discharge (95% CI, 29-163 MME; ,P, < .01), or 16% more, compared with patients of low-supply residents, which is equivalent to an additional 2-day supply at a typical dosage. In the seventh or eighth month after surgery, patients of high-supply residents received a greater total MME volume than patients of low-supply residents (difference, 13.0 MME; 95% CI, 3.1-22.9 MME; ,P, < .01) despite receiving a greater cumulative supply of opioid medications through the sixth month after surgery. Conclusions: After surgery for musculoskeletal injury, patients discharged by residents who prescribe greater supplies of opioid pain medications received higher supplies of opioids 7 to 8 months after surgery than patients discharged by residents who tend to prescribe less. Thus, limiting postoperative supplies of opioid pain medication may help reduce chronic opioid use.",

However, the medications’ real-world utilization was not well understood. Our study assessed patient factors associated with the use of second-generation antidiabetic medications in a nationally representative sample of patients with T2D. Study Design: This retrospective, cross-sectional analysis used the 2005 to 2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Methods: Survey participants 18 years and older who had a diagnosis of T2D and had used antidiabetic medications in the past 30 days were included. The primary outcome was the prescription of any second-generation antidiabetic medication. Weighted stepwise multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between the use of second-generation antidiabetic medications and patients’ characteristics. Results: Among 4493 patients with T2D, 533 (weighted %, 13.67%) reported using at least 1 second-generation antidiabetic drug. In multivariable analyses, patients with incomes at least 400% of the federal poverty level (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.30; 95% CI, 1.58-3.34), with higher hemoglobin A1c levels (AOR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.18), and taking more medications (AOR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.09-1.20) were more likely to use second-generation antidiabetic drugs compared with their counterparts. Conclusions: The uptake of second-generation antidiabetic medications was 14% among patients with T2D in the United States. Prescription benefit design that targets lower out-of-pocket payments for these newer drugs may improve patient access and clinical outcomes for patients with T2D.",

Mean PMPM medical spending decreased from $370.92 in January-February 2020 to $281.00 in March-April 2020. Between May and December 2020, mean PMPM medical spending recovered to-but did not exceed-prepandemic levels. Mean PMPM medical spending stayed below prepandemic levels between January and March 2021, rose above prepandemic baselines between April and June 2021, and decreased below baseline between July and December 2021.The COVID-19 pandemic induced a spending shock in 2020, and health care spending did not recover to near baseline until mid-2021, with some emerging evidence of pent-up demand. The observed spending below baseline through the end of 2021 will pose challenges to setting spending benchmarks for alternative payment and shared savings models.",

Assuming that reviews are read prior to appointment creation, an ordinary least squares regression model was run with a time series analysis to compare patient volume in the period immediately prior to the posting of a 1-star review with patient volume in the period immediately after a 1-star review was posted. An additional sensitivity analysis was performed at 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 weeks to validate a robust effect.The majority of reviews on PRWs were overwhelmingly positive, with only 6.7% of reviews (n = 733) rating a physician with 1 star. A mean of 6.2 new patient appointments were made per half-day session. The mean new patient volume decreased 2.3% to 2.6% following a 1-star review, with effects of the 1-star review affecting patient volume for at least 16 weeks.Given the limited yet longitudinal negative impact of 1-star reviews and the growing influence of PRWs, physicians should consider the magnitude of the effect as they consider responding to bad reviews.",

We analyzed the distribution of covered lives across shared-savings, shared-risk, and full-risk contracts and analyzed changes between 2018 and 2022. Results: Respondents reported 15.5 million covered lives in value-based contracts. All respondents have Medicare ACO contracts, and roughly 75% reported value-based contracts with commercial and MA plans. Approximately one-third reported such contracts with Medicaid managed care plans. Seventy percent of covered lives in respondents’ Medicare ACO contracts included downside risk for losses compared with 51% of lives in commercial plans and 45% in MA plans. Compared with a similar 2018 survey, the proportion of respondents in value-based MA contracts doubled, and the proportion in commercial contracts rose by half. Conclusions: Organizations that participate in Medicare ACO models have substantially increased their participation in value-based contracts with other payers. They reported a higher proportion of Medicare ACO covered lives in downside risk arrangements than in commercial or MA contracts.",

Although these measures protected the health of patients and providers, their impact on OR efficiency remains unclear. Our objective was to further elucidate the effects of COVID-19 on orthopedic surgery OR efficiency. Study Design: This was a retrospective study of 14,856 orthopedic surgeries performed between December 1, 2019, and October 31, 2021. Methods: Institutional perioperative databases were used to identify relevant orthopedic surgeries. The onset of the COVID-19 period was set as March 12, 2020, when a state of emergency was declared in Tennessee. Both 90-day periods before and after this date were used for comparative analysis of the pre–COVID-19, peak-restrictions, and post–peak-restrictions time periods. Delay of first case start time and turnover time between cases were used as primary measures of efficiency. Results: There were 1853 pre–COVID-19 cases, 1299 peak-restrictions cases, and 11,704 post–peak-restrictions cases analyzed. Delay of first case start time was found to be significantly different among the time periods (mean [SD] minutes, 7 [14] vs 8 [18] vs 7 [17], respectively; ,P, < .001). Turnover time between cases was also significantly different among the time periods (62 [49] vs 66 [51] vs 64 [51]; ,P, = .002). Conclusions: Although significant, there was minimal absolute change in orthopedic OR efficiency during the onset of the pandemic. These results suggest that the protocols enacted at our institution appropriately maintained orthopedic OR efficiency, even in the context of the rapidly increasing COVID-19 burden.",

Study Design: To assess the societal-level cost-effectiveness of DAA treatment for HCV, we extended a previously published discrete-time Markov simulation model of HCV transmission and progression to include market dynamics and broader elements of value. Methods: We followed a stepwise process to add novel value elements to a traditional CEA model for HCV treatments. For each additional element of value, we estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of DAAs compared with PEG/riba. Results: The health technology assessment (HTA)–style model yielded an ICER value of $64,512 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Adding transmission dynamics resulted in an ICER value of $52,971 per QALY, whereas accounting for transmission dynamics and dynamic price and efficacy further decreased ICER values by 90% to $6406 per QALY. Incorporating genericization, productivity loss, caregiver spillover, and differential valuations of LYs vs quality of life, disease severity, and insurance value further decreased the ICER value to $4487 per QALY, a 93% reduction from the baseline HTA-style CEA to the fully realized GCEA. Conclusions: Our GCEA study results confirm that DAAs are a cost-effective treatment for HCV compared with PEG/riba even when using conventional cost-effectiveness approaches. Incorporating broader elements of value resulted in more than a 10-fold improvement in cost-effectiveness, emphasizing the substantive impact of a generalized approach and the importance of incorporating GCEAs into decision-making.",

Methods: At ED discharge, participants were randomly assigned to usual care (controls) or usual care plus the pharmacist’s review (intervention group). Eligible individuals included those being discharged from the ED to home with 8 or more medications. A pharmacist telephoned patients in the intervention group within 48 to 96 hours after ED discharge. The medications in the patient’s record from the ED were compared with what the patient was taking at home. Discrepancies were communicated to the primary provider via fax or telephone.

    "abstract": "Objectives: Generic medications represent 90% of prescriptions in the US market and provide a tremendous financial benefit for patients. Recently, multiple generic drugs have been recalled due to the presence of carcinogens, predominantly ,N,-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), including an extensive recall of extended-release (ER) metformin products in 2020. Study Design: Primary pharmaceutical quality testing and database analysis. Methods: We tested marketed metformin immediate-release (IR) and ER tablets from a wide sample of generic manufacturers for the presence of carcinogenic impurities NDMA and ,N,N,-dimethylformamide (DMF). We examined the association of level of impurity with drug price and the impact of the 2020 FDA recalls on unit price and prescription fill rate. Results: Postrecall NDMA levels were significantly lower in metformin ER samples (standardized mean difference = –2.0; ,P, = .01); however, we found continued presence of carcinogens above the FDA threshold in 2 of 30 IR samples (6.67%). Overall, the presence of contaminant levels was not significantly associated with price for either IR (NDMA: ,R,2 = 0.142; ,P, = .981; DMF: ,R,2 = 0.382; ,P, = .436) or ER (NDMA: ,R,2 = 0.124; ,P, = .142; DMF: ,R,2 = 0.199; ,P, = .073) samples. Despite recalls, metformin ER prescription fills increased by 8.9% while unit price decreased by 19.61% (,P, < .05). Conclusions: Recalls of metformin ER medications were effective in lowering NDMA levels below the FDA threshold; however, some samples of generic metformin still contained carcinogens even after FDA-announced recalls. The absence of any correlation with price indicates that potentially safer products are available on the market for the same price as poorer-quality products.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To examine the impact of a mandatory managed care behavioral health program on utilization and cost of alcohol treatment services for high-risk Medicaid patients. STUDY DESIGN Pre-post nonequivalent comparison group design to compare managed care clients with fee-for-service (FFS) clients in terms of behavioral treatment costs and use. METHODS Study subjects were adult Medicaid enrollees diagnosed with alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence. Chi-square tests and analysis of variance were used to determine significant differences between managed care and FFS programs in characteristics of the subjects, service use rates, and intensity of care. A regression model was used to examine predisposing, enabling, and need factors that might explain cost differences between programs. RESULTS The managed care site had reduced behavioral healthcare costs compared with the FFS site. However, the regression analysis, which explained 35% of the variance in behavioral health service cost per user, showed that treatment cost was not significantly lowered by the managed care intervention once predisposing and need factors were controlled for. Nineteen percent of the variance in cost was explained by increased mental health comorbidity and 12% by drug comorbidity. CONCLUSION Consistent with other studies, the results show lower behavioral healthcare costs after the managed care intervention because of changes in management practices, service substitution, and negotiation of lower hospital fees. However, the managed care influence was insignificant in explaining cost variation between sites due to higher morbidity in the FSS site post managed care.",

It is largely preventable with adherence to evidence-based guidelines for thromboprophylaxis. Nevertheless, many clinicians are either unaware of the serious consequences of venous thromboembolism or skeptical of the value of the guidelines. Now, however, government and quality agencies are stepping in with new initiatives that affect reimbursement for preventable events and are designed to reduce the number of thromboembolic events that occur as the result of insufficient or no prophylactic therapy. The development of new oral anticoagulants will play an important role in increasing the effectiveness, safety, and convenience of thromboprophylactic therapy, which may improve adherence to guidelines for thromboprophylaxis.",

However, several new challenges have arisen. Better data are needed to guide formulary guidelines concerning the reuse of nonpreferred antidepressants for patients with recurrent episodes of depression and the risks associated with switching long-term patients to generic SSRIs. Managed care organizations need more information on the appropriateness of expanding the use of generic SSRIs to treat less severe forms of depression. An expansion of the use of antidepressant therapy will likely reduce HEDIS compliance performance, which could adversely affect the marketing of the plan to potential enrollees. Plans must also consider FDA concerns that the newer antidepressants may increase suicidality in a small number of patients. Finally, more research is needed to determine if the generic SSRIs adequately meet the therapeutic needs of more severely ill patients, such as treatment refractory depressed patients and patients with bipolar disorders.",

The annual rates of change in the capitation amounts are then compared with the annual rates of change in the mean dental office overhead expenses across the United States, as well as with the rates of change in income and expenses of the average US worker.The compensation (capitation amount) paid to participating providers decreased dramatically every year over the past 13 years, while the mean office overhead costs of participating providers increased every year.Solo general dentists with office overhead costs greater than or equal to the national mean likely find that the capitation amounts paid by insurance companies are an unfair compensation or are incompatible with their income objectives. Participation by solo general practitioners in capitation plans with such compensation levels would be problematic or unlikely.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To report outcomes of a pilot online curriculum educating clinicians about off-label prescribing, finding unbiased sources of pharmaceutical information, and responding to patient inquiries about direct-to-consumer advertised medications. STUDY DESIGN Case study. METHODS We developed 3 case-oriented Internet modules to educate healthcare professionals about off-label prescribing, accessing and appraising unbiased drug information, and talking with patients about direct-to-consumer advertising. Modules included reflective questions and opportunities to asynchronously ask questions of faculty. Pilot testing occurred among 52 Kaiser Permanente Colorado prescribing clinicians from May 2007 through September 2007. We assessed self-reported changes in knowledge, intent-to-change practice, and barriers to practice change. We also examined curriculum participant pre-post changes in prescribing of selected highly advertised medications. RESULTS Most participants reported changes in knowledge after curriculum completion, many made intent-to-change practice statements at curriculum completion, and several reported changes in practice 3 to 6 months after curriculum completion. Six categories of barriers to practice change were noted. Prescribing of targeted medications rose by 0.8 prescription per month in the intervention group and by 6.3 prescriptions per month in the control group, but this difference was not significant (P = .17). CONCLUSIONS Targeted curricula on aspects of the pharmaceutical development, approval, and marketing process can lead to subjective changes in clinician knowledge and can facilitate intent-to-change practice. Larger studies are needed to assess the effect of such interventions on prescribing patterns.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To develop a multiattribute decision model (MADM) to aid in the selection of preferred medications for the treatment of bipolar disorder. STUDY DESIGN Data were obtained via a self-administered online survey among psychiatric pharmacist specialists. These survey data were used to construct a MADM based on multiattribute utility technology. METHODS Anticonvulsant mood stabilizers, atypical antipsychotics, olanzapine-fluoxetine combination, and lithium carbonate were evaluated using a MADM. Attributes included in the model were effectiveness, safety and tolerability, cost, monitoring burden, and dosing frequency. A survey instrument was developed to score the relative importance of each attribute and the factor scores for each medication. Four iterations of the model were performed to ascertain the medication with the highest total utility score when the effectiveness factors were weighted to consider the following: overall effectiveness, effectiveness in acute mania, effectiveness in acute bipolar depression, and effectiveness in maintenance treatment. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the stability of the MADM results. RESULTS When overall effectiveness, effectiveness in acute mania, or effectiveness in maintenance treatment was considered, lithium carbonate had the highest total utility score. When effectiveness in acute bipolar depression was considered, lamotrigine had the highest total utility score. When considering only atypical antipsychotics, aripiprazole was associated with the highest total utility score for all iterations of the MADM. CONCLUSION The use of a MADM may be a beneficial tool to assist in making formulary or preferred therapeutic agent decisions.",

Recent federal initiatives seek to foster widespread health information technology adoption in the hopes of improving the efficiency and efficacy of our nation's health system. Development of a framework for codifying clinical outcomes would support those objectives primarily though making it easier to uncover associative patterns in patient care data. Put simply, the explicit classification of patient outcomes at the point of care seems to be a prerequisite to foster the most rapid exploration of achievable outcomes and their determinants. Considerations in such an endeavor include attributional validity, accounting for treatment appropriateness, incorporating patient perspectives, and evaluating the impacts of linkages to pay-for-performance programs.",

Study design Observational, retrospective, chart review study assessing care among patients with diabetes. Methods Diabetic patients aged > or =5 years who were prescribed insulin or oral hypoglycemics/antihyperglycemics for at least 12 months by 1 of 14 DPRP-participating physicians from the provider organization were eligible. A sample of patient medical charts was collected. Descriptive statistics were generated to assess demographic and clinical variables, with subanalyses for patients in the 3 glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) cohorts. Data were used to describe the demographics, disease prevalence, comorbidities, clinical outcomes, and treatment patterns of the study population. Results were assessed according to national treatment guidelines. Results Almost all DPRP recognition measures were met and/or exceeded. More than 90% of patients received appropriate assessments. The majority achieved the A1C, blood pressure, and low-density lipoprotein control levels recommended by national treatment guidelines. Patients with multiple comorbidities had worse levels of control, with only 14.3% of patients achieving all 3 treatment goals. Nearly 30% of patients had diabetes-related complications, most commonly kidney disease. Conclusions Differences in control and treatment patterns exist in patients with varying levels of glycemic control. Opportunities exist to improve diabetes care through goal attainment. Further research is needed to determine whether specific measures of care correlate with levels of glycemic control.",

This cue-to-action pilot project sought to determine if outreach, education, and incentive would increase uptake of screening mammography among women aged 52 to 74 years who are members of a community-based health insurance plan.Cohort study design with retrospective and prospective components.Women were eligible to participate in accordance with the CMS Quality Rating System technical specification for breast cancer screening. Eligible women with no documented screening for a mammogram from January 1, 2016, through November 7, 2017, were invited to participate in a campaign that included outreach about screening mammography as a no-cost covered benefit, education about screening mammography to detect asymptomatic disease, and a gift card to a local grocery merchant if the member obtained screening mammography by December 31, 2017.During December 2017, 20.8% (27/130) of eligible women obtained a screening mammogram compared with 7.8% (5/64) of eligible women during the nonintervention reference period of December 2016. Mammography screening increased by 170% during the study period in comparison with the reference period of a year earlier (prevalence ratio [PR], 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1-6.6; P = .02).A one-time, time-limited cue-to-action pilot project consisting of outreach, education, and incentive increased uptake of screening mammography by women enrolled in a community health insurance plan providing health insurance coverage as part of the Affordable Care Act. This increase is statistically significant in the intervention period compared with the reference period (PR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1-6.6; P = .02). Despite a small sample size, the magnitude of the effect for this pilot study is encouraging and warrants future studies in a larger population.",

Regression models accounted for patient characteristics and health care utilization in the 180 days prior to the proximal hospitalization and characteristics of the proximal hospitalization using backward variable selection and fixed effects for MA enrollment. To control for observable differences between individuals who selected MA vs TM, inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was conducted.The MA cohort was younger than the TM cohort (median age, 77 vs 81 years), more likely to have qualified for Medicare based on disability (29% vs 20%), and less likely to have dual Medicare/Medicaid eligibility (16% vs 23%). After adjustment, MA was associated with 22% decreased odds of hospitalization during the 180 days post SNF discharge, 19% increased odds of successful community discharge, a 4% increase in the proportion of days at home (equating to 6.7 additional days), and a 24% decrease in medical costs post SNF discharge. Results using IPTW were similar.MA was associated with better outcomes and lower costs post SNF discharge, suggesting efficiencies in care for SNF patients with MA. Further research is needed to evaluate specific MA features that may lead to better value.",

Hospitals did not consistently perform well or poorly across the range of measures and quality groups included in the Star Ratings. On average, for a given quality measure included in the Star Rating program, 12% of 1-star hospitals received top-quartile scores and 16% of 5-star hospitals received bottom-quartile scores. No significant associations were found between hospitals' overall Star Ratings and their performance on a set of condition-specific quality measures for hospitals in California and New York State.Hospitals' overall scores clustered in the middle of the potential distribution of scores; no hospitals were either best at everything or worst at everything. The Star Ratings did not predict hospital quality scores for separate quality measures related to specific medical conditions or health care needs. These 2 observations suggest that the Star Ratings are of limited value to consumers choosing hospitals for specific care needs.",

We analyzed the effect of ECS for women who were not found to be at increased reproductive risk on (1) utilization of mental health services in the period between randomization and initial results disclosure; (2) utilization of general outpatient and inpatient services, specialty services, and mental health-related services in the year following randomization; and (3) utilization and refusal of pregnancy-related services among pregnant women (n = 129) prior to and following randomization.No significant differences in health care utilization were found between women randomized to receive ECS and those receiving usual care. Women who received negative ECS results did not refuse recommended screening for conditions that are not identified via ECS at a higher rate than women in the usual care arm.These results suggest that ECS does not have unintended negative impacts on the health care system for the majority of patients who are not at increased reproductive risk.",

The objective of this study was to examine the medical diagnoses at the time of enrollment of patients with persistent high health care utilization over 24 months following enrollment in Medicaid managed care in a large integrated care setting.Retrospective cohort study in a large integrated managed health care system.We identified a cohort of high utilizers (top 5% of health care costs in 2014) and extracted their electronic health record data (2014-2016). Differences in baseline characteristics of high utilizers and the general Medicaid population were determined using bivariate analysis. We used multivariable regression to determine the independent association between medical comorbidities and demographics with persistent high health care utilization over the 2 years following enrollment.Compared with the general Medicaid managed care enrollee population, schizophrenia was the only mental health diagnosis at the time of enrollment associated with persistent high health care utilization (risk ratio [RR], 1.50; 95% CI, 1.20-1.86). Additional characteristics associated with persistent high utilization included age between 31 and 50 years (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02-1.41), dual enrollment in Medicaid and Medicare (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.09-1.45), chronic pain diagnoses (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.53), and multimorbidity (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.25-1.63).Among adults newly enrolled in Medicaid managed care, certain diagnoses noted at the time of enrollment into the plan are associated with persistent high health care utilization over the first 2 years, suggesting that targeting early supportive case management to these individuals could optimize care and reduce health care costs.",

By doing so, these programs are intended to drive beneficiaries to lower-priced generic alternatives. A rule finalized in July 2020 makes such programs permissible even when a brand-name drug does not have a generic or medically appropriate alternative, while not requiring transparency from payers about the existence of such programs.

To help address this issue, the Philadelphia Medicaid Opioid Prescribing Initiative, a type of community quality collaborative, mailed thousands of local Medicaid providers an individualized prescribing report card in 2017 and 2018. The report card featured details of providers' opioid prescribing, including peer comparison measures and inappropriate prescribing measures like concomitant opioid and benzodiazepine prescribing. This case study describes the unique process of developing and distributing the opioid prescribing report cards, with a particular focus on the role of Medicaid managed care organizations. Using Medicaid pharmacy claims, the extensive variation in prescribing measures within and across specialties is also illustrated. The report card's implementation points to the potential value of collaborations between public health departments and Medicaid managed care organizations and can provide insight for other locally grown policies.",

    "abstract": "In the outpatient setting, combining remote therapy monitoring (RTM) with negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) can support improved adherence to prescribed therapy. A recent study reported that patients receiving NPWT with RTM required fewer therapy days than patients receiving NPWT alone, possibly reducing costs of care. Our objective was to determine whether RTM reduced 90-day costs in patients undergoing NPWT.We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients receiving NPWT with or without RTM in the postacute setting.Patients beginning NPWT between March 2018 and May 2019 were included. Payer claims data were collected and analyzed with t test for continuous variables and χ2 test for categorical variables. Multiple regressions were performed to control for confounding variables.Of the 1105 patients included the study, 675 (61%) received RTM and 430 (39%) did not. RTM patients were significantly older (P < .0001), had more ulcers (P = .0004), and had higher Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores (P < .0001). The unadjusted mean 90-day wound-related cost was not significantly higher for non-RTM patients than for RTM patients (P = .0799). After controlling for differences in age, payer type, CCI score, and wound type, there was a significant reduction in 90-day wound-related costs in the RTM group compared with the non-RTM group ($11,119 vs $14,752; P = .0131). The RTM group had higher NPWT costs ($3757 vs $3289; P = .0035) but lower wound-related non-NPWT costs ($7361 vs $11,462; P = .0045).This study demonstrated the value of RTM in supporting NPWT adherence and decreasing the costs of wound care in these patients.",

In the United States, insomnia is among the 3 most common complaints. Often it is younger people who have difficulty falling asleep, whereas their elders report more difficulty remaining asleep. Currently, people in the United States sleep 25% fewer hours than they did 100 years ago. Chronic sleep deprivation may be a choice driven by economic or social factors. Industrialized countries engage about 20% of the work force in shifts, and people working night shifts are thought to average 8 fewer hours of sleep each week than day workers. Falling asleep behind the wheel is the single most imminent risk associated with excessive sleepiness. Nonpharmacologic treatments for EDS include light variations, positive-airway pressure, dental and oral devices, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. When used, any pharmacologic treatment must carefully balance the amount of wakeful stimulation with bedtime drowsiness.",

Study Design: We synthesized multiple rounds of surveys and interviews (2017-2022) from a mixed-methods evaluation of Comprehensive Primary Care Plus (CPC+), a multipayer model developed by CMS. CPC+ was the first federal advanced primary care reform effort that formalized health IT vendors' roles in supporting health IT implementation and specified detailed health IT requirements for practices. Methods: We conducted content analysis to identify cross-cutting themes related to health IT for both practices and vendors, comparing similarities and differences across participants and (when possible) over time. Results: Vendors and practices reported advances in registries and dashboards for improved information management within the practice as well as strengthened relationships between vendors and practices that supported health IT implementation. However, CPC+ practices noted several gaps or challenges using existing functionalities, and both vendors and practices reported broader challenges for more transformative health IT change, particularly the lack of interoperable health information exchange needed to support care management and care coordination. Key factors constraining vendors' investment in further advances included long product development schedules, making it difficult to respond to rapidly evolving model requirements. Vendors also shared that CPC+ practices represented a small fraction of their client base, so investing in developing new functionality was not strategic unless it was more broadly relevant outside CPC+. Conclusions: Continued collaboration among health IT vendors, practices, policy makers, and payers could support continued technological improvements, particularly related to information exchange and communication. Aligning requirements more closely with other federal and private models could also help mitigate the risk for vendors.",

Methods: Patients were included if they had least 1 outpatient pharmaceutical claim for lenvatinib paid on a noncapitated basis from 2015 to 2019. Median and IQR costs were estimated and inflation adjusted to 2019 US$ for 30-day supplies and reported as total, insurance liability, coordination of benefits, and out-of-pocket costs. Results: A total of 685 patients had at least 1 pharmaceutical claim for lenvatinib, which included patients with thyroid (n = 251; 36.6%), renal cell (n = 202; 29.5%), hepatocellular (n = 160; 23.4%), and endometrial (n = 48; 7.0%) cancer. The median (IQR) number of prescriptions per patient was 3 (2-7), and the median (IQR) total days of supply was 90 (45-210) days. The median (IQR) 30-day cost of lenvatinib was $17,253 ($15,597-$18,120). Median (IQR) 30-day insurance liability was $16,847 ($15,000-$17,981). Median (IQR) 30-day coordination of benefits was $0 ($0-$0). Median (IQR) 30-day patient out-of-pocket cost was $32 ($0-$100). However, the maximum 30-day out-of-pocket cost in our patient cohort was $12,538. Conclusions: In this cohort, insurance was liable for the majority of total lenvatinib drug costs, and 75% of patients paid $100 or less per month out of pocket. This information can be used by care teams to counsel insured patients. Health systems and drug manufacturers must identify patients with high out-of-pocket costs and provide convenient access to financial assistance programs so that patients are not forced to forgo the benefits of these drugs due to financial barriers. Value-based payment models and drug pricing reform are also needed to address underlying drivers of high drug costs.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To analyze US commercial insurance payments associated with COVID-19 as a function of severity and duration of disease. Study Design: Retrospective database analysis. Methods: Patients with COVID-19 between April 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021, in the Merative MarketScan Commercial database were identified and stratified as having asymptomatic, mild, moderate (with and without lower respiratory disease), or severe/critical (S/C) disease based on the severity of the acute COVID-19 infection. Duration of disease (DOD) was estimated for all patients. Patients with DOD longer than 12 weeks were defined as having post–COVID-19 condition (PCC). Outcomes were all-cause payments (ACP) and disease-specific payments (DSP) for the entire DOD. Variables included demographic and comorbidities at the time of acute disease. Adjusted payments by disease severity were estimated using generalized linear models (γ distribution with log link). Results: A total of 738,339 patients were included (374,401 asymptomatic, 156,220 mild, 180,213 moderate, and 27,505 S/C cases). DSP increased from $217 (95% CI, $214-221) for asymptomatic cases to $2744 (95% CI, $2678-$2811) for moderate cases with lower respiratory disease and $28,250 (95% CI, $26,963-$29,538) for S/C cases. ACP increased from $505 (95% CI, $497-$512) for asymptomatic cases to $46,538 (95% CI, $44,096-$48,979) for S/C cases. The DSP and ACP further increased by $50,736 (95% CI, $45,337-$56,136) and $94,839 (95% CI, $88,029-$101,649), respectively, in S/C cases with PCC vs a DOD of fewer than 4 weeks. Conclusions: COVID-19 payments for S/C cases were more than 10-fold greater than those of moderate cases and further increased by nearly $95,000 in S/C cases with PCC vs a DOD of fewer than 4 weeks.",

Study Design: In this retrospective cohort study, we used administrative claims from the HealthCore Integrated Research Environment, a repository of medical and pharmacy data from US health plans representing more than 80 million members, between January 1, 2016, and March 31, 2021. Methods: We used linear probability models to investigate the relation between the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and 4 guideline-based metrics of low-value cancer care: (1) conventional fractionation radiotherapy instead of hypofractionated radiotherapy for early-stage breast cancer; (2) non–guideline-based antiemetic use for minimal-, low-, or moderate- to high-risk chemotherapies; (3) off-pathway systemic therapy; and (4) aggressive end-of-life care. We identified patients with new diagnoses of breast, colorectal, and/or lung cancer. We excluded members who did not have at least 6 months of continuous insurance coverage and members with prevalent cancers. Results: Among 117,116 members (median [IQR] age, 60 [53-69] years; 72.4% women), 59,729 (51.0%) had breast cancer, 25,751 (22.0%) had colorectal cancer, and 31,862 (27.2%) had lung cancer. The payer mix was 18.7% Medicare Advantage or Medicare supplemental and 81.2% commercial non-Medicare. Rates of low-value cancer services exhibited minimal changes during the pandemic, as adjusted percentage-point differences were 3.93 (95% CI, 1.50-6.36) for conventional radiotherapy, 0.82 (95% CI, –0.62 to 2.25) for off-pathway systemic therapy, –3.62 (95% CI, –4.97 to –2.27) for non–guideline-based antiemetics, and 2.71 (95% CI, –0.59 to 6.02) for aggressive end-of-life care. Conclusions: Low-value cancer care remained prevalent throughout the pandemic. Policy makers should consider changes to payment and incentive design to turn the tide against low-value cancer care.",

Methods: Analysis of responses to a 12-question web-based survey from 101 respondents representing 174 ACOs participating in the Medicare Shared Savings Program or the Realizing Equity, Access, and Community Health ACO model in 2023. Results: Improving specialist alignment was a high priority for 62% of the 101 respondents and a medium priority for 34%. Only 11% reported that employed specialists were highly aligned and 7% reported that contracted specialists were highly aligned. A subset of ACOs reported major efforts to engage specialists in quality improvement projects (38%) and to convene specialists to develop evidence-based care pathways (30%). They also reported supporting primary care physicians through providing specialist directories (44%), specialist e-consults (23%), and sharing specialist cost data (20%). The most common challenges reported were the influence of fee-for-service payment on specialist behavior (58%), lack of data to evaluate specialist performance (53%), and insufficient bandwidth or ACO resources to address specialist alignment (49%). Conclusions: Engaging specialists in accountable care is an emerging area for ACOs but one with numerous challenges. Making better data on specialist costs and outcomes available to Medicare ACOs is essential for accelerating progress.",

Ultimately, the goal of the program is to allow care teams to achieve the triple aim of improving the patient experience, improving clinical outcomes, and reducing the total cost of health care. Study Design: This is a retrospective examination of the first year of the Shared Patient Care Coordination (SPCC) program. Methods: The analysis consisted of 2 parts. First, rates of hospitalizations and emergency department visits were compared between the SPCC patients and other patients of the integrated health system who had ESKD but did not participate in SPCC. Second, rates of clinical indicators—central venous catheter (CVC) use, home dialysis, advance care planning, and missed dialysis treatments—were benchmarked vs normative data taken by bootstrap sampling of the kidney care organization's patient population. Results: Overall, dialysis patients participating in the SPCC program had a 15% lower rate of hospital admissions than those not participating (,P, = .02). Additionally, the bootstrap analysis showed that by the second year, dialysis patients in the program had favorable rates (above the 95th percentile) of CVC use, dialysis treatment absenteeism, and completion of advance care plans. Conclusions: Enhanced and structured communication between dialysis providers and patient care teams provides a unique opportunity to coordinate patient-centered care and improve patient outcomes.",

The adoption of delivering cancer medications from medically integrated pharmacies (MIPs) has become popular in recent years. On May 12, 2023, CMS introduced guidelines restricting MIPs from delivering cancer-specific medications by mail or to oncology satellite offices and also requiring patients themselves to pick up the medications in person. This regulatory change has had a devastating impact on patients with cancer in rural and underserved communities, exacerbating existing health care disparities.

Study Design: Retrospective longitudinal analysis of CMS readmissions data from 2017 through 2022, and cross-sectional analysis using CMS quality metrics data. Methods: CMS SNF quality performance data were aggregated and compared with risk-adjusted readmissions by facility and time period. Each SNF was assigned to a cohort based on location, referral relationship with LGH, and whether it had implemented IA. Multivariable mixed effects modeling was used to compare readmissions by cohort, whereas quality measures from the fourth quarter of 2022 were compared descriptively. Results: LGH profiles differed significantly from both state and national profiles, with LGH facilities leveraging IA demonstrating an even greater divergence. In the most recent 12 months ending in the fourth quarter of 2022, LGH SNFs with IA had estimated readmission rates that were 15.24, 12.30, and 13.06 percentage points lower than the LGH SNFs without IA, Pennsylvania, and national cohorts, respectively (all pairwise ,P, < .0001). SNFs with IA also demonstrated superior CMS claims-based quality metric outcomes for the 12 months ending in the fourth quarter of 2022. Conclusions: SNFs implementing the studied IA platform demonstrated statistically and clinically significant superior risk-adjusted readmission rate profiles compared with peers nationally, statewide, and within the same SNF referral network (,P, < .0001). A more detailed study on the use of IA in this setting is warranted.",

Study Design: Qualitative arm of an explanatory sequential mixed-methods study involving semistructured interviews with hospital leaders participating in a statewide quality improvement collaborative with novel episode-based incentive payments introduced by the state's largest commercial payer. Methods: We recruited 21 leaders from 8 purposively selected, diverse hospitals with both high and low performance. Video teleconference–based interviews followed a standardized protocol and addressed 4 domains: choice of clinical condition for evaluation, strategies for episode spending reduction, best practices for success in earning incentives, and barriers to achievement. Rapid qualitative analysis with purposeful data reduction was employed to generate a matrix of key themes within the study domains. Results: Strategies were similar between high- and low-performing hospitals. When selecting conditions, some hospitals focused on areas of underperformance, aiming for improvement opportunities, whereas others chose conditions already achieving highest efficiency. Many tried to synergize with other ongoing improvement initiatives and clinical areas with established leaders and champions. Key strategies included data-driven improvement, care standardization, and protocol dissemination. Best practices for success included readmission prevention and postacute care spending containment. Conclusions: The findings highlighted hospitals' most common strategies and approaches, providing several insights into optimal design of commercial episode-based incentives: They must be lucrative enough to earn attention or consistent with larger federal programs; hospitals need opportunities to succeed through both improved performance and sustained excellence; and programs may incur malalignment between hospitals and credentialed physicians.",

Limited English proficiency (LEP) has also been associated with worse outcomes in this setting, including requiring intensive care unit (ICU) level of care and in-hospital death. Whether non–English-language preference (NELP) modifies the association between cardiovascular risk factors or disease and outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is unknown. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study of adult patients admitted to a large New England health system between March 1 and December 31, 2020, who tested positive for COVID-19. ,NELP, was defined as having a preferred language that was not English noted in the electronic health record. Methods: Cardiovascular risk factors, history of cardiovascular disease, and NELP were related to the primary composite clinical outcome—death or ICU admission—using multivariable binary logistic regression adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics. Interaction terms for NELP and model covariates were evaluated. Results: Of 3582 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 1024 (28.6%) had NELP; 812 (79.3%) of the patients with NELP received interpreter services. Death or ICU admission occurred in 794 (22.2%) of the hospitalized patients. NELP was not significantly associated with the primary composite outcome in unadjusted or adjusted analyses. In the adjusted analyses, only male gender, coronary artery disease, pulmonary circulatory disease, and liver disease significantly predicted the primary outcome. NELP did not modify the effect of these associations. Conclusions: NELP was not significantly associated with odds of death or ICU admission, nor did it modify the association between cardiovascular risk factors or history of cardiovascular disease and this composite outcome. Because most patients with NELP received interpreter services, these findings may support the role of such services in ensuring equitable outcomes.",

Results: We found that BPCI participation was associated with a decrease in the number of SNF referrals and no significant change in the number of SNF partners or concentration of SNF partners. BPCI participation was associated with discharge to SNFs with a higher patient outcome rating by 0.04 stars (95% CI, 0.04-0.26). BPCI participation was not associated with improvements in discharge to SNFs with a higher facility survey rating (95% CI, –0.03 to 0.11), staffing rating (95% CI, –0.07 to 0.04), or registered nurse staffing rating (95% CI, –0.09 to 0.02). Conclusions: BPCI participation was associated with lower volume of SNF referrals and small increases in the quality of SNFs to which patients were discharged, without narrowing hospital-SNF referral networks.",

    "abstract": "Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is a chronic inflammatory airway disease that results in permanent lung damage and can correlate with considerable clinical and economic burden. There are gaps in knowledge surrounding bronchiectasis, for which there are no published US-based treatment guidelines or FDA-approved therapies. Given the current challenges and gaps in care, the authors of this article convened for an AJMC® roundtable in March 2024. This publication summarizes the main findings of that roundtable and situates them in a scholarly context. Panelists agreed that patients with unexplained chronic cough or fatigue, purulent sputum production, hemoptysis, or repeated infection should undergo CT scanning to assess the presence of bronchiectasis, which has been estimated to affect approximately 364,000 to 558,000 individuals at least 18 years of age. They noted that disease symptoms and treatment burden can considerably diminish patient health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and that an exacerbation uniformly signifies deteriorating health and substantially impacts disease progression, hospitalization rates, and mortality. Absent an FDA-approved therapy, panelists' top management priorities were preventing or reducing exacerbations and maintaining or improving HRQOL. Panelists concluded that providers are ill-equipped to change the course of this heterogenous disease and that there is a real need for options to manage symptoms, for US-based guidelines, and for more research into epidemiology, etiology, and treatment.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Hospitals in the US operate under various value-based payment programs, but little is known regarding the strategies they use in this context to improve quality and reduce costs, overall or in voluntary programs including Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Advanced (BPCI-A). Study Design: A survey was administered to hospital leaders at 588 randomly selected acute care hospitals, with oversampling of BPCI-A participants, from November 2020 to June 2021. Twenty strategies and 20 barriers were queried in 4 domains: inpatient, postacute, outpatient, and community resources for vulnerable patients. Methods: Summary statistics were tabulated, and responses were adjusted for sampling strategy and nonresponse. Results: There were 203 respondents (35%), of which 159 (78%) were BPCI-A participants and 44 (22%) were nonparticipants. On average, respondents reported implementing 89% of queried strategies in the inpatient domain, such as care pathways or predictive analytics; 65% of postacute strategies, such as forming partnerships with skilled nursing facilities; 84% of outpatient strategies, such as scheduling close follow-up to prevent emergency department visits/hospitalizations; and 82% of strategies aimed at high-risk populations, such as building connections with community resources. There were no differences between BPCI-A and non–BPCI-A hospitals in 19 of 20 care redesign strategies queried. However, 78.3% of BPCI-A–participating hospitals reported programs aimed at reducing utilization of skilled nursing and inpatient rehabilitation facilities compared with 37.6% of non–BPCI-A hospitals (,P, < .0001). Conclusions: Hospitals pursue a broad range of efforts to improve quality. BPCI-A hospitals have attempted to reduce use of postacute care, but otherwise the strategies they pursue are similar to other hospitals.",

    "abstract": "This article examines how predictive analytics can enhance payer initiatives to improve medication adherence. Despite its known impact on health outcomes and costs, medication nonadherence remains a widespread and persistent challenge in health care. Although payers are increasingly involved in addressing nonadherence, traditional approaches typically lead to suboptimal results due to their reactive nature and generic intervention. With improved access to data and more sophisticated machine learning tools, there is a growing opportunity for payers to use predictive analytics to stratify and target members at high risk, predict potential primary and secondary nonadherence, and preemptively intervene with tailored solutions. The potential benefit of this approach includes prevention, not only resolution, of nonadherence and leads to improved health outcomes, reduced health care costs, and increased member satisfaction. The article also discusses potential caveats to consider, such as data sharing, bias mitigation, and regulatory compliance, when implementing predictive analytics in this context.",

Patients at high risk of ILD should be screened using high-resolution CT (HRCT), but there is no consensus as to which risk factors-or combination of risk factors-should prompt referral for HRCT. The course of autoimmune disease-associated ILD is highly variable, and it may not mirror the activity of the underlying autoimmune disease. Patients require close monitoring with periodic pulmonary function testing and symptom assessment and with repeat HRCT considered based on clinical assessment. The relevance of clinical and radiologic signs of progression-and their implications for management-ideally should be discussed by a multidisciplinary team. Management of autoimmune disease-associated ILD may involve immunosuppressant and/or antifibrotic therapy in addition to supportive care. It is important that treatment decisions be individualized to the needs and wishes of the patient. Regular follow-up is important to monitor disease progression and manage the adverse effects related to treatment.",

    "abstract": "The Center for Integrated and Novel Approaches in Vascular-Metabolic Disease (CINEMA) program is an innovative, patient-centered system of care developed by the University Hospitals Harrington Heart and Vascular Institute in Cleveland, Ohio in the US for the management of high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and prediabetes at high risk for cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome and its consequences. At its core, CINEMA is a multidisciplinary team of care experts, working together outside of traditional silos. The patient meets with the entire team up to 4 times each year to address all aspects of cardiovascular (CV) and T2D care. At the first visit, the team formulates a personalized approach that is evidence based and centered on optimal strategies to improve the patient's lifestyle, reduce their risk of CV and kidney disease events, and increase their access and adherence to guideline-directed pharmacologic therapies. A community health worker is utilized to address social determinants of health as needed. The program has a substantial research component, with the intent of developing evidence for novel care paradigms. The multiyear results of the CINEMA program indicate that a multidisciplinary approach to management of high-risk patients is highly effective in reducing CKM syndrome risk factors and increases use of guideline-directed therapies. The aim of this review is to describe the structure, operation, and eligibility criteria for admission to the CINEMA program, provide an overview of how CKM syndrome risks are determined and managed for each patient, and discuss how the integrated approach to care is supported by current recommendations from professional societies and results from other coordinated care/multidisciplinary programs. Lastly, the scalability challenges of a wider rollout of the CINEMA program are considered.",

    "abstract": "Direct and indirect costs for diabetes mellitus place a large economic burden on the US healthcare system. Diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are closely interrelated, and it is estimated that much of the burden of CVD too is attributable to diabetes. Insulin resistance may be the common link between diabetes and CVD, often manifested clinically as the metabolic syndrome. The thiazolidinediones (TZDs) reduce insulin resistance and have favorable effects on lipids, blood pressure, and other cardiovascular risk factors. Large clinical trials have shown that early, aggressive intervention with lifestyle changes and pharmacotherapy with TZDs and other agents may slow progression to overt diabetes in high-risk patients and reduce the risk of cardiovascular and other complications; this could reduce healthcare resource utilization and costs.",

We estimated individual patient value as the monetized gain in quality-adjusted life-years as estimated in the cost-effectiveness literature, net of device costs and cost offsets. We estimated manufacturer value by applying an assumed profit margin to revenue from device sales. We created population-level estimates by combining these individual-level estimates with age-stratified Census Bureau population projections and estimates of the incidence of AS. We assessed model uncertainty through the use of probabilistic sensitivity analyses.Between 2018 and 2028, approximately 465,000 inoperable Americans with SSAS will be treated with TAVR. These procedures will yield a cumulative social benefit of up to $48 billion, with roughly 80% of that benefit accruing to patients and 20% accruing to device manufacturers.Policy makers and payers should take this social value into account when considering decisions related to the care of inoperable patients with SSAS.",

This study evaluated the impact of care management on reducing infant mortality in the largest Medicaid MCO in Ohio.Observational study using infant and maternal individual-level enrollment and claims data (2009-2015), which used a quasi-experimental research design built on a sibling-comparison approach that controls for within-family confounders.Using individual-level data from the largest MCO in Ohio, we estimated linear probability models to examine the effect of infant engagement in care management on infant mortality. We used a within-family fixed-effects research design to determine if care management reduced infant mortality and estimated models separately for healthy infants and nonhealthy infants.Infant engagement in care management was associated with a reduction of 7.4 percentage points (95% CI, -10.7 to -4.1; P <.001) in infant mortality among the most vulnerable infants, those identified as not well at birth. This effect was larger in recent years and likely driven by new statewide enhanced care management requirements. Infant mortality was unchanged for healthy infants engaged in care management (coefficient = 0.03; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.08).This study provides evidence that care management can be effective in reducing infant mortality among Medicaid MCO enrollees, a population at high risk of mortality. Few infants were engaged in care management, suggesting to policy makers that there is room for many additional infants to benefit from this intervention.",

We estimated the program's impact on all-cause inpatient admissions, emergency department visits, and total medical expenditures (TME) relative to a matched cohort of nonparticipants. In a subanalysis, we studied the modifying effects of intervention fidelity on program impact.We created 1897 propensity score-matched case-control pairs based on preprogram similarities in disease profile, predictive risk score, medical cost, and utilization. Changes in outcomes 6 months post program were measured using difference-in-differences analyses. We used principal components analysis to identify program features associated with reduced inpatient admissions, classified cases according to intervention fidelity, and measured postprogram changes in TME for each subgroup.Program participation was associated with a 21% reduction in all-cause inpatient admissions (P = .03) and a 22% reduction in TME (P = .02) 6 months after program completion. Relative spending reductions were 2.1 times greater for high-fidelity interventions compared with overall program participation (P < .001).Centrally staffed complex care management programs can reduce costs and improve outcomes for high-risk Medicare beneficiaries. Integrating predictive risk stratification, evidence-based intervention design, and performance monitoring can ensure consistent outcomes.",

Study design Retrospective, repeated cross-sectional analysis using Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data. Methods The study population included elderly Part D beneficiaries without a low-income subsidy, with continuous enrollment in a Part D plan, and with at least 1 prescription fill for a given year. We assessed annual trends for 3 outcomes: (1) proportion of beneficiaries entering each benefit phase and the number of days taken to enter these phases, (2) number of 30-day prescription drug fills, and (3) total and out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs. Results The proportion of beneficiaries reaching the catastrophic coverage phase increased after the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and they reached the threshold earlier in the year. The overall number of 30-day drug fills increased over the study period, although no statistically significant changes in utilization were seen among those reaching the catastrophic coverage phase. Total drug spending steadily increased over time, particularly after the ACA, with the largest increase seen in those reaching the catastrophic threshold; however, out-of-pocket spending significantly decreased. Conclusions Although this study provides support for reductions in financial barriers to prescription drugs under the ACA, substantial increases in both total drug spending and the proportion of high-cost beneficiaries in the Part D program indicate a growing burden of Part D spending on the Medicare program, which is expected to continue to grow in the future.",

Revenue was estimated by analyzing Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for BHNP visits from the Epic electronic health record and corresponding relative value units (RVUs), based on 135% of 2018 nationally unadjusted Medicare rates.We estimate 2-year revenue of $144,449 and personnel costs (salary + benefits) of $90,431. The BHNP work totaled 1083 hours, and MA support totaled 312 hours. Using a nurse practitioner wage of $53.70/hour and an MA wage of $16.95/hour, total salary costs were $63,451; we then added benefits costs. Using the CPT codes assigned to the 768 encounters with 207 unique patients, we estimated generation of 1640 RVUs and total revenue of $144,449.This analysis found that personnel costs ($90,514) of a primary care-embedded BHNP are 63% of the potential revenue generated ($144,449). This analysis suggests that a primary care BHNP could be a cost-saving and patient-centered way to reduce the burden on primary care providers while meeting the growing needs of adolescents with behavioral health needs.",

No metric within the control of the individual hospitalist has been identified to support the individual hospitalist's contribution to the hospitalist group's ALOS goals. This study's objective was to evaluate the correlation between the follow-up to discharge ratio (F:D ratio) and ALOS and assess the relationship between F:D ratio and hospitalist experience. Study design We systematically evaluated the relationship between hospitalist-level billing data for daily inpatient follow-up encounters and discharge visits (F:D ratio) and the attributed ALOS across consecutive hospitalist encounters at a tertiary care center. Results Over the study period of 10 quarters from 2017 to 2019, there were 103,080 follow-up or discharge inpatient encounters. The mean (SD) provider F:D ratio and ALOS were 3.94 (0.36) and 4.45 (0.24) days, respectively. The mean (SD) case mix index (CMI) was 1.68 (0.04). There was a strong linear relationship between the F:D ratio and both ALOS and CMI-adjusted ALOS (r = 0.807; P = .014; and r = 0.814; P = .001, respectively). The mean (SD) F:D ratio for hospitalists with 1 year or less of experience compared with those with more than 1 year of experience was 4.23 (0.80) vs 3.88 (0.39), respectively (P = .012). Conclusions A strong linear relationship exists between the F:D ratio and ALOS. Additionally, the F:D ratio improves with experience. Provider-level billing data applied as the F:D ratio can be used as a hospitalist management and assessment tool.",

This can help ensure that patients achieve optimal response, that those experiencing adverse events are appropriately managed, and that treatment is tailored for those with pre-existing conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of death in patients with T2D. The American Diabetes Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology recommend a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) or sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor with proven cardiovascular (CV) benefit in patients with established CVD or those at high risk of CVD. Injectable semaglutide is approved by the FDA for reducing the risk of major CV events in adults with T2D and established CVD. In PIONEER 6, the CV safety of the first GLP-1RA tablet, oral semaglutide, was noninferior to placebo, and a longer-term study (SOUL; NCT03914326) powered to assess a potential CV benefit is ongoing. The safety and tolerability profile of oral semaglutide across the PIONEER clinical trial program was consistent with the GLP-1RA class. The most common adverse events were gastrointestinal (GI) (eg, nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting), which were typically mild to moderate and transient. In clinical practice, oral semaglutide expands the treatment options available to patients with T2D and can be considered in patient populations suitable for injectable GLP-1RAs.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES To measure variation in spending and inpatient prices associated with the primary care physician (PCP) practice to which patients are attributed. STUDY DESIGN Cross-sectional analysis of claims data. METHODS We used random effect models to estimate case mix-adjusted spending across large PCP practices within 3-digit zip codes. We compare inpatient prices for patients in high-spending practices with those in low-spending practices. RESULTS The physician practice to which a patient was attributed is associated with significant differences in spending after controlling for patient comorbidities and geography. Patients attributed to practices in the top quartile of total medical expenses have about 30% higher spending than patients attributed to practices in the bottom quartile of adjusted spending in their 3-digit zip code. If patients attributed to practices in the top 2 quartiles had spending equivalent to those in the median practice, total spending would drop by 8%. Price variation accounts for a meaningful amount of the variation, with inpatient prices 17% higher in top-quartile vs bottom-quartile practices. We cannot disaggregate the large variation in utilization into practice patterns and unmeasured case mix (including unmeasured differences in patients' socioeconomic status) vs random health shocks, but correlation in spending patterns across years suggests that some persistent differences in spending patterns exist. CONCLUSIONS There are meaningful opportunities to reduce spending by changing patient PCP selection, encouraging patients to use lower-priced specialists and hospitals, and eliminating wasteful care. Attention must be paid to the best ways to reap these savings.",

The association of discharge to home health with reduced readmission and reduced costs varied by subpopulations defined by surgical vs medical diagnosis-related group and receipt of intensive care management following discharge.The PACT policy may be promoting greater value by reducing readmissions while lowering total expenditures for patients who do not require intensive postacute care. Findings were in contrast to those of previous studies, in which discharge to home health has been associated with higher rates of readmission.

The secondary outcome was total spending on the low-value services. Independent variables of interest were price quintiles based on each physician's mean geographically adjusted price of a mid-level office visit, the most commonly billed service by general internal medicine (GIM) physicians. We estimated the association between physician price quintile and provision of low-value services via negative binomial or generalized linear models with adjustments for measure, region, and patient and physician characteristics.This study included 750,452 commercially insured patients attributed to 28,951 GIM physicians. In 2014, the mean geographically adjusted price for physicians in the highest price quintile was $122.6 vs $54.7 for physicians in the lowest quintile ($67.9 difference; 95% CI, $67.5-$68.3). Relative to patients attributed to the lowest-priced physicians, those attributed to the highest-priced physicians received 3.6, or 22.9%, fewer low-value services per 100 patients (95% CI, 2.7-4.7 services per 100 patients). Spending on low-value services attributed to the highest-priced physicians was 10.9% higher ($520 difference per 100 patients; 95% CI, $167-$872).Commercially insured patients of high-priced physicians received fewer low-value services, although spending on low-value services was higher.

Attribution results are compared with the rule-based benchmark method for 7 CMS-defined clinical cohorts, including a COVID-19 cohort.Using 6,835,460 unique patient encounters during 2020 (n = 136,339 in out-of-sample cohort), the proposed approach favored specialists generally considered responsible for primary clinical conditions when compared with the benchmark. The most salient shift within the acute myocardial infarction (+17.0%), heart failure (+20.2%), and coronary artery bypass graft (+4.0%) cohorts was toward the cardiovascular diseases specialty, and the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (+24.0%) and pneumonia (+16.2%) cohorts resulted in a shift toward the pulmonary diseases specialty. The COVID-19 cohort resulted in considerable shifts toward infectious diseases and pulmonary diseases specialties (+17.4% and +14.1%, respectively). The stroke cohort experienced a considerable shift toward the neurology specialty (+42.2%).We provide a robust method to attribute physicians to patients, which is a necessary tool to understand physician-level variation in quality of care within the inpatient acute care setting.

Millions currently purchase PTC-ineligible plans off of the marketplace. We estimate the proportion of off-marketplace enrollees who would be eligible for the expanded PTCs under ARPA, calculate PTC amounts for eligible enrollees, and examine factors influencing plan choice that could inform outreach efforts.We analyzed data from a survey of a random sample of off-marketplace enrollees in California in 2017 (n = 829).Using survey data including self-reported income, household size, and employment status combined with 2021 benchmark premium data from Covered California, we estimate eligibility for PTCs and potential PTC amounts under ARPA among off-marketplace enrollees. We adjust for both survey design weights and poststratification weights.Among off-marketplace enrollees, we estimate that approximately 12% are potentially ineligible for PTCs because they reported incomes less than 100% of the poverty level or because they had access to employer-sponsored coverage for their family through themselves or their partner. The median annual PTC in 2021 for eligible off-marketplace enrollees was $311 but varied greatly by age, family or individual plan, and household income (5%-95% range, $0-$14,836). In 2017, 69% of off-marketplace enrollees were unaware that they had to enroll in marketplace plans to receive PTCs, and 51% received enrollment assistance from insurance brokers.These findings suggest the need for targeted outreach to encourage off-marketplace enrollees to switch to marketplace plans.",

Recent initiatives in the United States to address the issue have focused on judicious prescribing patterns and quality measurement to minimize opioid dispensing. However, policy gaps have limited the effectiveness of current interventions. Expanded policy considerations are warranted, including patient-focused opioid risk screening and preferences for nonopioid pain management, with broader plan coverage for multimodal opioid-sparing pain management (OSPM). Additionally, formalized clinician education regarding specific nonopioid pain management alternatives may increase utilization, as will incorporation into perioperative OSPM clinical pathways. It is also important for patients to have access to the option for multimodal OSPM in the perioperative setting without financial disincentives, which may arise in surgery-specific bundled payment models. Finally, expansion of research activities regarding clinical and cost-efficacy outcomes may help to advance use of these options, laying the groundwork for development of a broader set of quality measures reflecting utilization and outcomes of multimodal OSPM in the perioperative setting.",

Adults 65 years and older who had diabetes and were taking at least 1 OHA were included. Respondents with a medication possession ratio (MPR) of at least 80% were considered adherent. Health care utilization and expenditure were compared among adherent and nonadherent respondents for preventive and reactive services. Utilization data were analyzed using negative binomial regression and expenditure data using γ-family generalized linear regression models.Approximately 67% of the cohort (n = 1279) were adherent. The adherent group had greater health care expenditure overall than nonadherent respondents ($29,985 [95% CI, $27,161-$32,743] vs $24,623 [95% CI, $21,623-$28,122]; P < .05). Although expenditure was higher for prescription medications and office visits, mean emergency department expenditures were higher for adherent respondents. The utilization and proportion of expenditure on preventive vs reactive health care services did not differ by adherence as defined by an MPR of at least 80%.Increasing adherence provides an opportunity to improve CMS quality ratings. Our finding that adherence does not affect the financial burden of disease might be explained by the increased costs of preventive medication and increased comorbidity burden of these patients. Low adherence to OHAs encourages clinicians to be more proactive in ensuring that prescription medications are refilled regularly. By emphasizing equitable diabetes education and tailoring quality initiatives that minimize racial disparities, adherence can be better achieved.",

We describe the impact of NMS on patients, health care workers, and health systems, focusing on NMS to in-class biologic alternatives in US patients with chronic, immune-mediated rheumatic and dermatologic conditions. Additionally, we evaluate the ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate the physical, psychological, and economic impacts of NMS. Study Design:, Narrative review. Methods:, We performed a search of MEDLINE’s PubMed database from October 2015 to October 2020, with a repeat search in October 2021. Search terms included relevant keywords pertaining to NMS, biologics, and disease areas. Results were supplemented by a search of key congress abstracts from 2015 to 2021 and a targeted internet search. Results:, NMS increases medication abandonment, errors, and adverse effects, and it can lead to longer patient visits, increased follow-up visits, additional laboratory tests and procedures, and greater overall health care resource utilization (HCRU). The increased HCRU associated with NMS increases patients’ financial burden due to additional co-pays and out-of-pocket costs. Conclusions:, The decision to switch treatments should result from shared decision-making between health care providers (HCPs) and patients to achieve the best clinical outcomes and optimal HCRU. The issues related to NMS may be compounded by the financial and psychosocial stress on HCPs and patients created by the COVID-19 pandemic. HCPs should advocate for continuous patient treatment and be familiar with continuity of care legislation, appeals processes, and manufacturer assistance programs.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: The Advance Premium Tax Credit (APTC) is designed to remedy lack of health insurance due to cost; however, approximately 30 million Americans remain without health insurance and millions of households leave billions in tax credits unclaimed each year. A prerequisite of APTC is to file one’s taxes; however, few studies have examined tax filing and APTC jointly. This study examined the relationship between tax filing and applying for APTC, as well as perceived barriers to and sociodemographic characteristics associated with applying for the APTC. Study Design: Descriptive study. Methods: Researchers surveyed 372 Marketplace-insured members who were eligible for APTC. Results: Most of the sample filed personal taxes in 2019 and planned to file taxes in 2020, yet only 23% applied for the APTC in 2019, and 26.3% were planning to apply in 2020. Most commonly, respondents were not going to apply because they believed they were not eligible (53.5%), they did not know about the APTC (15.8%), and they did not know whether they were eligible (9.9%). Logistic regression modeling found that employment, income, and race were significantly associated with applying for the APTC. Conclusions: Barriers to applying for the APTC were unrelated to tax filing and were specific to a lack of knowledge about the APTC and eligibility. These results indicate the need to build knowledge and awareness of the APTC and eligibility and to target groups least likely to apply. Implications and future directions are discussed.",

Although statins are the foundational evidence-based treatment option, significant gaps in care exist as approximately 5% to 30% of patients do not tolerate statin therapy. Ezetimibe provides additional, but modest, reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and ASCVD risk. The PCSK9 enzyme has emerged as a viable therapeutic target, resulting in the approval of 2 monoclonal antibodies, alirocumab and evolocumab, and a small interfering RNA molecule, inclisiran, that reduce LDL-C levels by approximately 60% and 50%, respectively. Alirocumab and evolocumab were approved in 2015 and have been shown to reduce ASCVD risk in secondary prevention patients; however, the cost of therapy has been a barrier to uptake despite significant price reductions. Inclisiran is unique in that it requires administration by a healthcare professional, thus creating challenges and unknowns when it comes to implementing this drug in clinical practice. Managed care professionals have considerable experience with developing approaches to providing access to novel injectable lipid-lowering therapies, such as alirocumab and evolocumab, and with the approval of inclisiran, they now have an expanding list of such therapies to incorporate into their care plans.",

Study Design: Retrospective data analysis of Indiana Medicaid enrollment and claims data (2015-2018) and the Area Health Resources Files. Methods: An instrumental variable (IV) approach was used to estimate the relationship between PDVs and medical and pharmacy expenditures among Medicaid enrollees. The instrument was defined as the number of adult enrollees with at least 1 nonpreventive dental claim per total Medicaid enrollees within a Census tract per year. Results: In naive analyses, enrollees had on average greater medical expenditures if they had a prior-year PDV (β = $397.21; 95% CI, $184.23-$610.18) and a PDV in the same year as expenditures were measured (β = $344.81; 95% CI, $193.06-$496.56). No significant differences in pharmacy expenditures were observed in naive analyses. Using the IV approach, point estimates of overall medical expenditures for the marginal enrollee who had a prior-year PDV (β = $325.17; 95% CI, –$708.03 to $1358.37) or same-year PDV (β = $170.31; 95% CI, –$598.89 to $939.52) were similar to naive results, although not significant. Our IV approach indicated that PDV was not endogenous in some specifications. Conclusions: This is the first study to present estimates with causal inference from a quasi-experimental study of the effect of PDVs on overall medical expenditures. We observed that prior- or same-year PDVs were not related to overall medical or pharmacy expenditures.",

Developing innovative models of care is crucial to improving diabetes outcomes. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of virtual interdisciplinary diabetes rounds in improving glycemic control. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study using observational data from July 2018 to December 2021. Methods: This study employed difference-in-differences analysis to compare change in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in a group of patients whose providers received advice as part of virtual interdisciplinary rounds and a group of patients whose providers did not receive rounds advice. Patients with diabetes were identified for rounding (1) based on attribution to an accountable care organization along with an upcoming primary care appointment and an HbA1c between 8% and 9% or (2) via provider referral. Results: The rounded group consisted of 481 patients and the comparison group included 1806 patients. There was a 0.3-point reduction in HbA1c (95% CI, 0.1-0.4) associated with rounds overall. In a subanalysis comparing provider adoption of recommendations among those rounded, provider adoption was associated with an HbA1c reduction of 0.5 points (95% CI, 0.1-0.9) at 6 months post rounds, although there was no significant difference in the full year post rounds. Conclusions: Interdisciplinary rounds can be an effective approach to proactively provide diabetes-focused recommendations. This modality allows for efficient, low-cost, and timely access to an endocrinologist and team to support primary care providers in diabetes management.",

Study Design: We used administrative claims from the IBM MarketScan Research Databases to evaluate the appropriateness of wrist MRI in a national cohort of patients with commercial insurance or Medicare Advantage. Methods: Adult patients with a diagnosis of wrist pain between 2016 and 2019 were included and followed for 1 year. We made assessments of appropriateness based on ACR guidelines for specific wrist pain etiologies. We tabulated the total costs and out-of-pocket expenses associated with inappropriate MRI studies using weighted mean payments for facility and professional fees. We performed segmented logistic regression on interrupted time series data to identify predictors of receiving inappropriate imaging and the impact of guideline publication on MRI use. Results: The study cohort consisted of 867,119 individuals. Of these, 40,164 individuals (4.6%) had MRI, of whom 52.6% received an inappropriate study. Inappropriate studies accounted for $44,493,234 in total payments and $8,307,540 in out-of-pocket expenses. The interrupted time series found an approximately 1% monthly decrease in the odds of receiving an inappropriate study after guideline dissemination. Conclusions: MRI as a diagnostic tool for wrist pain is often inappropriate and expensive.

    "abstract": "Objectives: This study explores the concern that annual high-deductible commercial insurance plan design may yield higher out-of-pocket costs when an episode of maternity care spans 2 years, exposing patients to their cost-sharing limits twice during their episode of care. Study Design: Cross-sectional study of Health Care Cost Institute commercial claims. Methods: The study sample comprises 1,379,300 deliveries among high-deductible health plan enrollees in years 2012 through 2021. Patients' mean cost sharing is calculated across all service types for 3 time periods: (1) delivery hospitalization, (2) maternity episode from 40 weeks prior to delivery hospitalization through 12 weeks after discharge, and (3) extended period spanning 3 years from January of the year before delivery through December of the year after delivery. Results: For each of the 3 episode measurements, mean out-of-pocket spending is highest among those who deliver in January and declines in each subsequent month until August and September (the delivery months with most pregnancy and postpartum periods within the same year), then flattens for the remainder of the year. Mean cost sharing for the maternity episode was $6308 in January and $4998 in December, a difference of $1310. Patients delivering in January also had mean out-of-pocket costs $1491 greater for delivery hospitalization and $1005 greater over the 3-year period than patients delivering in December. Conclusions: Higher out-of-pocket spending is observed when patients face their cost-sharing limits twice within an episode of maternity care, and this difference persists even when evaluating 3 calendar years of patients' out-of-pocket spending.",

All admitted patients with 1 of the following diagnoses were included in this study: acute myocardial infarction, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, pneumonia, and sepsis.No interventions were applied in this retrospective study. Data collected from patients admitted under 1 of the 5 diagnoses included mortality, length of stay (LOS), readmission, and discharge disposition.MORIS strata can predict condition-specific mortality and readmissions but not length of stay or discharge disposition.Stewardship of resources is necessary to obtain high value in care. A long LOS, discharge to skilled nursing facilities, and unplanned readmissions contribute to a significant utilization of resources. The MORIS strata are useful in predicting disease-specific mortality and readmission, but they are not useful in predicting LOS or discharge disposition.",

The percentage of new enrollees completing a PC visit within 90, 180, and 365 days of enrollment fell markedly in the first half of 2014 and then rebounded to pre-ACA levels thereafter. Conversely, the percentage of new enrollees remaining enrolled at 90, 180, and 365 days spiked upward in the first half of 2014 and gradually fell thereafter. Among established enrollees, PC visits per person exhibited a downward trend throughout the post-ACA period, driven mostly by a decline in the percentage of individuals with any PC visits.The first 6 months of ACA implementation in New Jersey were marked by a surge in Medicaid/CHIP enrollment that extended beyond the ACA target population, greater enrollment retention, and apparent bottlenecks in PC delivery. After the initial surge, new enrollees used PC at rates at least as high as in the pre-ACA period, whereas established enrollees used PC at a declining rate throughout the post-ACA period. PC delivery for new enrollees may have limited the availability of services for some established enrollees.",

However, predicted fracture risks and outcomes for US East Asian individuals remain understudied. Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods Using standardized clinical profiles for East Asian women aged 70 years, fracture probabilities were estimated using the US Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) version 4.1 and corresponding FRAX tools for East Asian countries. Next, clinical and BMD data from 3785 US Asian women aged 65 to 74 years were used to estimate 10-year hip fracture risk (US-Asian FRAX-v3.1) in comparison with actual observed 10-year hip fracture risk (Kaplan-Meier product limit estimate). Results For the same patient profile entered in the US-Asian FRAX and country-specific FRAX, the calculated 10-year hip fracture probability varied. Compared with the US-Asian FRAX calculator, the estimate was 2-fold higher using the Taiwan FRAX and Hong Kong FRAX, somewhat higher using the South Korea FRAX and Japan FRAX, and similar using the China FRAX. Among 3785 US Asian women (mean [SD] age, 69 [3] years), 23 experienced a hip fracture during a median follow-up of 6.8 years. Their observed 10-year hip fracture risk was 1.5% (95% CI, 0.8%-2.7%), and their median (interquartile range) predicted fracture probability (US-Asian FRAX-v3.1) was 1.1% (0.6%-2.0%). Conclusions Country-specific FRAX estimates varied between the United States and East Asian countries. For US Asian women, the US FRAX-predicted hip fracture probabilities were in the lower range of observed risk. Although these findings support the use of the US-Asian FRAX for hip fracture risk assessment in US East Asian women, further studies are needed, including the examination of Asian subgroups.",

Given the vast number of progressive fibrosing ILDs and the disparities in clinical patterns and disease features, understanding their clinical and economic impact presents significant challenges. Historically, treatment options for progressive fibrosing ILDs include anti-inflammatory drugs and immunosuppressive. The lack of effective options and guideline recommendations, however, has rendered treatment difficult. In March 2020, nintedanib was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with chronic fibrosing ILDs with a progressive phenotype, becoming the first therapeutic agent to receive an indication for this set of diseases. The approval was based on data from the phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group INBUILD trial. Questions regarding the cost of medications, their effects on disease and comorbidities, patient selection, and combination strategies remain to be answered.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, a form of interstitial lung disease characterized by abnormal wound healing in the lung that leads to progressive scarring and loss of lung function. Comorbidities are highly prevalent in IPF and often lead to further complications and worse outcomes. In fact, undetected and untreated comorbidities are independently associated with poor outcomes. IPF not only affects patient quality of life (QOL) but also requires significant cost for delivering care. Given the potential for rapid progression of IPF and the associated risk for mortality, early diagnosis is critical for retaining the highest lung function and QOL for as long as possible. Delayed diagnosis of IPF is associated with increased costs in terms of investigations performed, and delayed referral can result in lower survival rates independent of disease severity or associated prognostic factors. Significant progress has been made in understanding IPF pathogenesis, which has, in turn, led to the development of novel therapeutic options that improve outcomes, extend life, and minimize disease burden on patients' daily lives. For patients with IPF in the absence of underlying liver disease, pirfenidone and nintedanib are licensed for the treatment of IPF. Additionally, a number of investigational therapeutic options are currently in development. The extent of clinical effectiveness compared with the cost of therapy has led to a lack of consensus on the cost-vs-benefit analyses for the drugs.",

This could affect the coverage of inhalers that prevent costly exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with impacts for the Medicare program and its beneficiaries. This study compared the coverage of guideline-recommended COPD inhalers between S-PDPs and MA-PD plans.A cross-sectional analysis of the formularies for all 689 S-PDPs and 2578 MA-PD plans offered in 2017.We assessed each prescription drug plan's coverage of inhalers in 6 therapeutic categories recommended by the 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) report and compared the use of prior authorization, step therapy, and coinsurance between S-PDPs and MA-PD plans.In 2017, all S-PDPs and MA-PD plans covered at least 1 inhaler from each GOLD therapeutic category, except for long-acting β agonist/long-acting muscarinic antagonist combination inhalers. S-PDPs were more likely to require coinsurance for inhalers across all therapeutic categories, whereas MA-PD plans required prior authorization more frequently for 3 of the 6 therapeutic categories. S-PDPs required coinsurance more frequently than MA-PD plans for inhalers that treat mild (20.8% vs 11.4%; P < .001), moderate (40.0 vs 13.2%; P < .001), and severe (45.4% vs 11.0%; P < .001) disease.Medicare Part D S-PDPs are more likely than MA-PD plans to require coinsurance for outpatient COPD inhalers, especially for severe disease. This likely reflects their different financial incentives and is an important consideration for providers and policy makers aiming to improve outpatient COPD management.",

Data include a balanced panel of 1889 general acute care hospitals for the years 2011 to 2015.Inpatient hospital commercial claims data from the Health Care Cost Institute were used to classify claims by contract type based on claim-line billed and allowed charges. Hospital-level performance measures-prices, charges, costs, and length of stay-were analyzed using linear regression models to identify the association of each measure with contract types. All measures were risk adjusted to control for differences in hospital case mix, and the regression specifications controlled for numerous hospital characteristics.Our estimate of the distribution of contract types in the data is similar to estimates using other methods. We find that discounted charges contracts are associated with higher prices and higher costs but not higher charges. Fixed-rate contracts are associated with lower prices as well as lower costs.Limited research exists on the relationship between contract structure and hospital performance. Our results suggest that hospital performance is related to contract structure, possibly due to factors such as differences in bargaining strategies or ex post incentives.",

Neither the level nor the growth of PMPM medical spending significantly differed in the full population sample, although point estimates suggest that the integrated benefit members may be on a lower cost growth trajectory over time.Members with chronic illnesses receiving an integrated pharmacy benefit experienced slower medical cost growth compared with members covered by a pharmacy carve-out.

We compared tiering changes and estimated out-of-pocket spending by tier for all Part D plans and by plan type (Medicare Advantage prescription drug [MA-PD] vs stand-alone prescription drug plan [PDP]) for covered generic drugs. Finally, we identified the generic products commonly placed on higher tiers in 2019 and categorized them based on clinical characteristics.Across 5,220,488 plan-product combinations in 2019, 76.4% of generic drug observations reflected coverage on Part D plan formularies, compared with only 12.1% of brand-name drugs. Between 2013 and 2019, the share of observations reflecting covered generics on lower tiers decreased from 76.8% to 53.9%, whereas the share on higher tiers increased from 7.5% to 28.0%. MA-PD plans were more likely than PDPs to place generic drugs on lower tiers, even among plan sponsors offering both plan types. Despite these trends, higher tier placement does not appear to be related to more generous coverage of brand-name products. Instead, in 2019, 70% of high-tier generics had multiple formulations, required heightened clinical monitoring, or had head-to-head treatment options available.Although Part D plans have increasingly placed covered generic drugs on higher formulary tiers over time, this may be partly explained by a drug's clinical profile and availability of substitutes rather than preferred brand-name drug coverage.",

We aimed to investigate whether implementation of ACP consults leads to improved advance directive (AD) completion rates.Retrospective case-control evaluation.Chart review was conducted among patients in hematology/oncology and primary care to compare AD completion rates of patients in each clinical area offered ACP consults between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2018, and those not offered ACP consults prior to July 1, 2017.Completed ADs increased from historic rates of 1% to 65.9% of primary care patient records. Among hematology/oncology patients offered consults, completed ADs were present in 28.1% of patient records compared with historic rates of 3%.Patients offered ACP consults had significantly higher AD completion rates than those without consults in both primary care and hematology/oncology practices. The difference in ACP consult attendance between the primary care and hematology/oncology groups clearly suggests that further improvements can be made to assist patients in accessing AD education and completion support.",

However, there was substantial disagreement on whom to exclude for red-flag diagnoses, leading to lower agreement (75%; κ = 0.61) on whom to include in the reference population of acute LBP without red flags, among whom imaging for LBP is considered of low value.Our findings demonstrate the need for further consensus surrounding how to translate guideline recommendations to administrative measures that assess overuse of imaging for acute LBP, particularly with respect to defining which patients should be excluded from the measures. This finding is also important for other overuse measures that rely on exclusions.",

Beyond clinical benefit of increased overall survival, it represents a class of medications with a favorable adverse effect profile compared with chemotherapy. Drugs that target programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) receptor and its ligand PD-L1 are ICIs that work by taking the brakes off the immune system and promote T-cell−mediated cancer cell destruction. Current NCCN guidelines recommend that all patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC have their PD-L1 status (amount of PD-L1 on cancer cells) assessed to guide treatment section. However, this recommendation is not always followed and may lead to inappropriate treatment selection and potential increased cost. Through appropriate biomarker testing, subsequent appropriate utilization of ICIs may help to drive down other costs and improve health-related quality of life. Managed care pharmacists should continue to focus on promotion of guideline concordant care that includes appropriate biomarker testing and selection of an evidence-based preferred treatment option.",

    "abstract": "To compare patterns of psychiatric hospitalization and readmission within 30 days for Medicaid expansion (expansion) vs previously insured (legacy) samples.Retrospective analysis using Medicaid behavioral health service claims.We identified 24,044 individuals with hospitalizations in calendar years 2017 and 2018 within the network of a behavioral health managed care organization in Pennsylvania. Logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with readmission.Individuals covered under expansion (n = 7747) vs legacy (n = 16,297) were older and more likely to be male and European American, with higher rates of cooccurring mental health (MH) and substance use disorder (SUD) diagnoses, as well as lower rates of MH and SUD services in the 30 days prior and any prior MH hospitalization. A higher proportion of individuals with expansion vs legacy status were readmitted (11.3% vs 9.0%; P < .0001). Controlling for factors associated with readmission, regression showed an increased likelihood of readmission for expansion vs legacy status (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.12-1.35; P < .0001). Increased risk for readmission was also found across populations for male patients (AOR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.02-1.22; P = .0124), those with prior MH hospitalizations (AOR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.51-1.81; P < .0001) or other behavioral health services (AOR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.03-1.26; P = .0142), those with longer hospitalization episodes (AOR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.01; P < .0001), and those with cooccurring SUD (AOR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.44-1.74; P < .0001).Individuals with coverage through Medicaid expansion compared with legacy coverage have an increased risk of psychiatric readmission and may warrant targeted interventions that also address service utilization and cooccurring SUD.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the methodological soundness and performance of 3 obesity quality measures aimed at promoting improvements in obesity care.Retrospective, clinical, and administrative data-based observational research study to evaluate scientific soundness, feasibility, and performance of obesity quality measures.Four test sites (clinicians/clinician groups) submitted clinical and administrative health data including patient demographics, diagnoses, and encounter information for patient panels encompassing individuals aged 18 to 79 years with at least 1 ambulatory visit between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2018 (measurement period). Clinician/clinician group data were supplemented by an Optum data set contributing patient information from 21 health care organizations with approximately 6 million qualifying patients to assess the impact of using a larger data set for measure testing. Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: were pregnant during the measurement period or in the 6 months prior to the measurement period, had died during the measurement year, or had evidence of palliative or hospice care during the measurement period.This study resulted in the identification of a clinician/clinician group-level measure, Documentation of Obesity Diagnosis, as being feasible and reliable; however, the measure requires additional evaluation and potential adjustments to determine validity. Other measures included in our evaluation had feasibility and methodological challenges due to data capture and coding limitations.Findings of our current study suggest that there are emerging opportunities to capture data and advance obesity measurement incrementally. A process measure focused on obesity diagnosis has the most potential for immediate implementation by clinicians, and additional measures focused on change in body mass index over time and use of evidence-based obesity treatment remain challenging to implement due to data capture and benefit coverage.",

The impact of CVD in patients with CKD is significant, inversely related to the level of kidney function, and exaggerated when compared with matched patients without CKD. CKD is associated with an increased risk of CVD, CVD events, and death, but the prevalence of traditional CVD risk factors is also increased compared with the general population. Proteinuria, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes are common in patients with CKD and contribute directly to CVD events. CKD-related factors (eg, disorders of electrolyte and mineral metabolism, anemia, and vascular calcification) also contribute to mortality associated with CKD.",

DPCA coordinates and connects a variety of interventions through HIT, including community-based services offered by YMCAs and local pharmacists. Our initial experience in operating DPCA gives us confidence that large-scale prevention and disease control management programs make economic sense, are worthy of front-end investment, and can achieve cost-effective results. Others who want to use our model will benefit from policymakers' efforts to prioritize future versions of transaction and coding standards that meet the needs of preventive healthcare as much as they do acute and chronic care.",

An effort called the National Oncology Working Group (NOW) Initiative is trying to change the sometimes adversarial relationship between payers and oncologists through a collaborative model. The group, which is supported by pharmaceutical manufacturer sanofi-aventis, is developing patient-centered strategies for successful and sustainable oncology benefits management. The focus includes finding consensus between payers and providers and devising solutions for oncology management such as decreasing variability of cancer care and improving end-of-life care for patients with terminal illness. NOW is designing tools that will be tested in small-scale regional demonstration projects, which NOW participants anticipate will set an example for successful oncology benefits management that can be replicated and expanded.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES To assess the lifetime cost-effectiveness of intermittent, reversible vagal nerve blocking (via the implantable weight loss device vBloc) therapy versus conventional therapy as treatment for patients who are class 2 obese with diabetes and for those who are class 3 obese with or without diabetes, who have found pharmacotherapy and behavioral therapies ineffective, but are not prepared or willing to undergo current bariatric surgical options. STUDY DESIGN A cost-effectiveness model was designed to simulate weight loss, diabetes remission, and costs in patients with obesity undergoing vagal nerve blocking therapy versus conventional therapy. METHODS The model compared 2 treatment arms, vagal nerve blocking therapy and conventional therapy, and for each treatment arm included 4 health states based on body mass index (BMI) class. Using Monte Carlo simulation, patients entered the model one at a time and could transition between health states by experiencing BMI change. The model focused on change in BMI and diabetes remission as predictors of healthcare costs, health-related quality of life, and survival. Inputs for vagal nerve blocking effectiveness were obtained from the ReCharge trial; however, remaining inputs were estimated from published literature. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were evaluated in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. RESULTS ICERs for vagal nerve blocking versus conventional therapy in patients who were class 2 and class 3 obese were estimated to be $17,274 and $21,713 per QALY gained, respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed results to be robust to reasonable variation in model inputs, with the upper limit of ICERs remaining below $30,000 for all sensitivity analysis scenarios assessed. CONCLUSIONS Vagal nerve blocking therapy provides a cost-effective alternative to conventional therapy in patients who are class 2 obese with diabetes and in those who are class 3 with or without diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: The interaction between emerging physician practice models and the use of health information exchange (HIE) remains understudied. We examined associations between the use of emerging practice models and the use of HIE. We also examined barriers to HIE adoption among physicians who were not utilizing HIE. Study Design: Survey data came from a 2019-2021 statewide census of all physicians in Arizona collected at the time of license renewal (n = 3312, or 17.9% of all practicing physicians). Methods: Primary outcomes were physician-reported HIE use for patient care summaries and for laboratory results. Secondary outcomes were 5 common HIE barriers among non-HIE users. The primary predictor was physician practice model: accountable care organization (ACO), clinically integrated network (CIN), or integrated delivery network (IDN) vs traditional care delivery model. Covariates included physician specialty, age, gender, and county of practice. Results: Compared with physicians in traditional care delivery models, physicians in ACOs, CINs, or IDNs had significantly higher odds of using HIE to share both patient care summaries (,P, < .01) and laboratory results (,P, < .05 for ACOs), although associations varied across provider and practice characteristics. ACO providers not using HIE were more likely to cite a lack of connectivity and lack of information as HIE barriers. Conclusions: Providers in an emerging practice model are more likely to use HIE than those in a traditional care delivery model. However, nuances in these associations suggest a persistence of previously identified HIE gaps, and the barriers cited provide guidance for increasing HIE use among different practice types.",

Methods: The study included primary care physician practices recruited by the Great Lakes Practice Transformation Network (GLPTN), 1 of 29 CMS-awarded networks, and used data from 2015 to 2019. At enrollment, trained quality improvement advisers scored each of the PAT’s 27 milestones by its degree of implementation based on interviews with staff, review of documents, direct observation of practice activity, and professional judgment. The GLPTN also tracked each practice’s status regarding alternative payment model (APM) enrollment. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to identify summary scores; mixed-effects logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between derived scores with APM participation. Results: EFA revealed that the PAT’s 27 milestones could be summed into 1 overall score and 5 secondary scores. By the end of the 4-year project, 38% of practices were enrolled in an APM. A baseline overall score and 3 secondary scores were associated with increased odds of joining an APM (overall score: odds ratio [OR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.99-1.12; ,P, = .061; data-driven care quality score: OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.00-1.22; ,P, = .040; efficient care delivery score: OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.13; ,P, = .003; collaborative engagement score: OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.80-0.96; ,P, = .005). Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the PAT has adequate predictive validity for APM participation.",

Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: Claims data from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims Database were used to identify patients with T2D and a diagnosis of influenza between October 1, 2016, and April 30, 2017. Patients who received antiviral treatment within 2 days of influenza diagnosis were identified and propensity score–matched 1:1 with a comparator cohort of untreated patients. HCRU (number of outpatient visits, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and duration of hospitalization) and costs were assessed over 1 full year and over each quarter after influenza diagnosis. Results: Treated and untreated matched cohorts consisted of 2459 patients each.

    "abstract": "Objectives: We aimed to describe the experience of a state Medicaid agency incentivizing reduction of racial and ethnic disparities in a hospital quality incentive program (QIP). Study Design: Retrospective review of a decade of experience implementing a hospital health disparity (HD) composite measure. Methods: Observational analysis of programwide trends in missed opportunity rates and between-group variance (BGV) for the HD composite from 2011 to 2020 and subanalysis of 16 metrics included in the HD composite for at least 4 years over the decade. Results: Programwide missed opportunity rates and BGV fluctuated widely from 2011 to 2020, likely due to variation in measures included in the HD composite. When the 16 measures that were included in the HD composite for at least 4 years were collapsed into a hypothetical 4-year period, missed opportunity rates decreased across the 4 consecutive years, from 47% in year 1 to 20% in year 4. Differences among racial and ethnic subgroups also decreased across the 4-year period, as reflected in the BGV decrease from 7.85 × 10–4 in year 1 to 5.10 × 10–4 in year 4. Conclusions: Construction of a composite measure, use of a summary disparity statistic, and measure selection are key considerations in the design and interpretation of equity-focused payment programs. This analysis revealed improved aggregate quality performance and a modest reduction in racial and ethnic disparities for measures included in the HD composite for at least 4 years. Further research is needed to evaluate the association between equity-oriented incentives and health disparities.",

    "abstract": "Patients with rare diseases such as Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL), a hematologic malignancy affecting approximately 1500 new patients per year, experience barriers to care involving both clinical and administrative factors. Optimal patient outcomes depend on timely identification, diagnosis of disease, and treatment initiation. For patients living with Ph+ ALL, the process can be delayed by limited treatment options approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and administrative hurdles that often delay treatment initiation. An overhaul of utilization management processes, such as the requirement for prior authorization (PA) for treatment, are needed to ensure patients have access to appropriate treatments in a timely manner. An AJMC Roundtable in November 2022 brought together a panel of payers and providers to discuss the challenges and shortcomings of current PA processes and to present ideas for potential solutions for improving them. Panelists at the roundtable discussed approaches including the use of guideline-concordant electronic PAs and other digital solutions, expedited approval pathways for use in specific conditions, use of real-world evidence in decision-making, issuance of PA \"Gold Cards\" to select providers, and a shift to value-based care agreements. Roundtable attendees agreed that, regardless of the strategy for PA-process improvement, there is a need for improved communication between providers and payers to ensure that the decision-making system meets the essential need for timely patient access to optimal care. This article reviews utilization management and guideline-concordant care through the lens of rare diseases and then presents solutions to utilization.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a 3-year tele-messaging intervention for positive airway pressure (PAP) use in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Study Design: A post hoc cost-effectiveness analysis (from US payers’ perspective) of data from a 3-month tele-OSA trial, augmented with 33 months of epidemiologic follow-up. Methods: Cost-effectiveness was compared among 3 groups of participants with an apnea-hypopnea index of at least 15 events/hour: (1) no messaging (n = 172), (2) messaging for 3 months (n = 124), and (3) messaging for 3 years (n = 46). We report the incremental cost (2020 US$) per incremental hour of PAP use and the fraction probability of acceptability based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of $1825 per year ($5/day). Results: The use of 3 years of messaging had similar mean annual costs ($5825) compared with no messaging ($5889; ,P ,= .89) but lower mean cost compared with 3 months of messaging ($7376; ,P ,= .02). Those who received messaging for 3 years had the highest mean PAP use (4.11 hours/night), followed by no messaging (3.03 hours/night) and 3 months of messaging (2.84 hours/night) (all ,P ,< .05). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios indicated that 3 years of messaging showed lower costs and greater hours of PAP use compared with both no messaging and 3 months of messaging. Based on a willingness-to-pay threshold of $1825, there is a greater than 97.5% chance (ie, 95% confidence) that 3 years of messaging is acceptable compared with the other 2 interventions. Conclusions: Long-term tele-messaging is highly likely to be cost-effective compared with both no and short-term messaging, with an acceptable willingness-to-pay threshold. Future long-term cost-effectiveness studies in a randomized controlled trial setting are warranted.",

Study Design: Retrospective cohort study of high-risk individuals (n = 487) in a population of 365,413 individuals aged 18 to 64 years within the Mass General Brigham health system who were part of commercial ACO contracts with 3 large insurers between 2015 and 2019. Methods: Using medical spending claims and other enrollment data, the study assessed the demographic and clinical characteristics, medical spending, and clinical event rates of patients in the ACO and its high-risk care management program. The study then examined the impact of the program using a staggered difference-in-difference design with individual-level fixed effects and compared outcomes of those who had entered the program with those of similar patients who had not entered. Results: The commercially insured ACO population was healthy on average but included several hundred high-risk patients (n = 487). After adjustment, patients within the ACO’s integrated care management program for high-risk patients had lower monthly medical spending (by $1361 per person per month) as well as lower emergency department visit and hospitalization rates compared with similar patients who had yet to start the program. Accounting for early ACO departure decreased the magnitude of the program effects as expected. Conclusions: Commercial ACO populations may be healthy on average but still include some high-risk patients. Identifying which patients might benefit from more intensive care management could be critical for reaping the potential savings.",

Indeed, leaders in health care innovation recently called for primary care payment reform proposals to be tested in accountable care organizations (ACOs) consisting of independent practices (ie, practices not owned by hospitals). Yet these same practices may have less experience with the kind of systematic innovation that leads to generalizable insights, because what little funding is available for primary care research is mostly awarded to large academic medical centers. In this commentary, we report on lessons learned over 2 years (2020-2022) from conducting primary care research through a novel alliance of an ACO consisting of independent practices, a health plan, and several academic researchers, with the support of a private foundation. This collaboration is also notable because it was specifically assembled to address racial and ethnic inequities in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Equitable access to appropriate medication-pharmacoequity-is foundational to equitable health care, with medication formularies representing a key determinant of medication access. Critical formulary design elements include clinical criteria, prescription processes, and patient access policies. Facets of each can be refined to ensure more equitable access to medications, including avoidance of prior authorization requirements, awareness of the complex determinants of human behavior, streamlined authorization processes, and optimized costs and convenience for patients. Optimizing these factors for proven treatments of conditions disproportionately borne by vulnerable communities is especially critical in the pursuit of equitable access. For policy makers at payer and pharmacy benefit manager organizations to successfully pursue corresponding changes in formulary policy, it is critical that teams educate leadership regarding the importance of policy change, invest in comprehensive patient data, and engage community members in their efforts.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Tele–intensive care unit (tele-ICU) use has become increasingly common as an extension of bedside care for critically ill patients. The objective of this work was to illustrate the degree of tele-ICU involvement in critical care processes and evaluate the impact of tele-ICU decision-making authority. Study Design: Previous studies examining tele-ICU impact on patient outcomes do not sufficiently account for the extent of decision-making authority between remote and bedside providers. In this study, we examine patient outcomes with respect to different levels of remote intervention. Methods: Analysis and summary statistics were generated to characterize demographics and patient outcomes across different levels of tele-ICU intervention for 82,049 critically ill patients. Multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate odds of mortality, readmission, and likelihood of patients being assigned to a particular remote intervention category. Results: Managing (vs consulting) physician type influenced the level of remote intervention (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 2.42). A higher level of tele-ICU intervention was a significant factor for patient mortality (AOR, 1.25). Female sex (AOR, 1.05), illness severity (AOR, 1.01), and higher tele-ICU intervention level (AOR, 1.13) increased odds of ICU readmission, whereas length of stay in number of days (AOR, 0.93) and consulting (vs managing) physician type (AOR, 0.79) decreased readmission odds. Conclusions: This study’s findings suggest that higher levels of tele-ICU intervention do not negatively affect patient outcomes. Our results are a step toward understanding tele-ICU impact on patient outcomes by accounting for extent of decision-making authority, and they suggest that the level of remote intervention may reflect patient severity. Further research using more granular data is needed to better understand assignment of intervention category and how variable levels of authority affect clinical decision-making in tele-ICU settings.",

    "abstract": "Families with incomes above 400% of the federal poverty level were ineligible for marketplace premium tax credits before 2021 and may again be after 2025. Current laws temporarily removed this income cap, but because credits cap out-of-pocket premiums for a reference plan as a share of income, some higher-income families still receive zero tax credits. We quantified (1) premium differences between on- and off-marketplace plans and (2) the association between these premium differences and state decisions to finance cost-sharing reductions (CSRs) for lower-income families.We created a comprehensive database of on- and off-marketplace plans in each county (including both federal and state-based marketplaces).By county and metal level, we compared on- and off-marketplace (1) plan premiums in 2020 and (2) growth rates in the numbers of plans. We contrasted outcomes for states by how insurers were instructed to finance CSRs.In 2020, 89% of the US population lived in counties where some plans were offered exclusively off-marketplace. In these counties, for a 45-year-old choosing among silver plans in 2020 and who did not qualify for premium subsidies, premiums for the lowest-cost off-marketplace plans averaged 11.3% less than premiums for the lowest-cost on-marketplace plans. In contrast, for bronze and gold plans, the lowest-cost off-marketplace plans were, on average, more expensive. Silver plan premiums were 6.1% higher off-marketplace than on-marketplace in states that loaded CSRs on all silver plans, and 13.5% lower in states that loaded CSRs only on on-marketplace silver plans.Higher-income individuals and families may consider purchasing Affordable Care Act-compliant silver plans off-marketplace and thereby reduce their premiums. State and federal policy makers should consider the impact of their decisions on the choice between on- and off-marketplace plans.",

However, little is known about whether and to what extent providers' patient-sharing relationships influence patient outcomes. This study aimed to examine whether patients with stroke who were discharged to PAC hospitals with which the originating hospital had a strong patient-sharing relationship have a lower rate of rehospitalization and lower mortality risk.This population-based retrospective cohort study used the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. A total of 1988 patients initially hospitalized for stroke between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2018, who were newly discharged to 193 PAC hospitals from 175 originating hospitals were included.We described the partnership between originating acute hospitals and PAC hospitals using tie strength and referral concentration. The main outcome included unplanned readmission and mortality. Hierarchical logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were applied.A dose-response relationship was clearly observed between tie strength and patient outcomes. Patients with stroke who were discharged to a PAC hospital that had the strongest tie strength with the originating hospital were least likely to be readmitted and had the lowest mortality risk. Moreover, patients who received care from hospital pairs with highly or moderately concentrated referrals also had lower readmission and mortality risk.A greater number of shared patients and a more concentrated referral linkage between acute and PAC providers may reduce potential adverse outcomes in PAC patients. Instead of attaining more partners, PAC policies should encourage providers to strengthen their patient-sharing relationship with their existing PAC partners.",

This analysis estimated the association between NFFCCM and utilization of inpatient, outpatient, and emergency services. Study Design: We implemented a doubly robust estimator using propensity score matching in a regression context to compare eligible patients who used NFFCCM (n = 282) with eligible patients who did not use NFFCCM (n = 26,759). Methods: We tested 4 definitions of treatment: having any NFFCCM encounters and having 1 NFFCCM encounter per month, per 2 months, and per 3 months. Two-tailed statistical inference testing was conducted at the 5% level. We examined the utilization differences among patients with diabetes 65 years and older using merged electronic health records for 4 health systems in Louisiana from the Research Action for Health Network database in 2013 through 2018. Results: We found NFFCCM was associated with increased utilization of care in the outpatient setting by 0.056 visits per month (95% CI, 0.027-0.086) and with lower utilization in the inpatient setting (–0.024 visits per month; 95% CI, –0.038 to –0.010) and in the emergency department setting (–0.017 visits per month; 95% CI, –0.031 to –0.003). Alternative specifications of treatment showed similar associations. Conclusions: CMS implementation of reimbursement codes for NFFCCM, and subsequent utilization of that reimbursement by health systems, was associated with a shift in patient utilization from high-cost settings (inpatient and emergency department) to a lower-cost setting (outpatient office).",

Study Design: This is a single-center, 2-phase, pilot project led by 2 pharmacy students and the lead clinical pharmacist at a federally qualified health center in Trenton, New Jersey. Methods: The primary outcome of the study is the number and percentage of patients whose prescription was changed inappropriately from empagliflozin to ertugliflozin. Secondary outcomes include the number and percentage of patients whose prescription was changed inappropriately because of failure to consider cardiovascular history and/or missed renal function checks and whether pharmacists were able to optimize therapy.

Results: A total of 126 unique patients were identified as receiving empagliflozin and/or ertugliflozin and 16 patients were switched from empagliflozin to ertugliflozin, all of whom had HNJH Medicaid HMO. Thirteen of the 16 (81.3%) patients were managed inappropriately based on their history of cardiovascular disease or inappropriate renal monitoring. Pharmacists recommended 22 interventions for patients who received empagliflozin and/or ertugliflozin, and all recommendations were accepted by providers.

    "abstract": "Objectives: Continuity of care measures are widely used to evaluate the quality of health care delivery, but which visits are included vary across studies. Our objective was to determine how the provider specialties included affect continuity values, year-to-year stability, and association with emergency department (ED) visits. Study Design: Retrospective study of Alabama Medicaid administrative data. Methods: We included beneficiaries with diabetes who had at least 3 outpatient visits in each of 2018 and 2019 (N = 9578). We defined 3 provider groupings: all providers, diabetes-broad (primary care, cardiology, neurology, endocrinology, ophthalmology, nephrology, and psychiatry), and diabetes-narrow (primary care and endocrinology). Continuity of care was calculated using the Continuity of Care Index (COCI) for each provider grouping. We compared correlation between measures and from year to year using Spearman correlations, and we used multivariable logistic regression to determine association with ED visits. Results: The mean COCI was 0.54 using visits with all providers, 0.64 with diabetes-broad providers, and 0.83 with diabetes-narrow providers. COCI with diabetes-narrow providers was moderately correlated with the broader sets of providers (Spearman ρ, 0.52-0.65). Comparing each participant’s COCI in 2018 with that in 2019, the mean intraperson difference was similar (0.16-0.22), and correlation was moderate (Spearman ρ, 0.41-0.47) for each measure. COCI had similar weak association with ED visits using each provider grouping (odds ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.98-0.99 for each 0.1-unit difference in COCI). Conclusions: Continuity values differed substantially depending on which provider specialties were included. The importance of this variation is uncertain, as continuity was weakly associated with ED visits using each of the measures.",

The large care systems had larger clinics (clinicians per clinic, 8.6 in large vs 4.3 in small and 5.2 in medium; P = .03) and more clinicians per care coordinator (5.7 vs 3.3 and 4.0; P = .04). They also more frequently included a social worker in their care coordination team: 82% vs 25% of small and 40% of medium care systems (P = .01). However, the services provided and complexity tools used were similar. Nearly all reported addressing both medical and social needs for their complex patients with multiple chronic conditions.Although there are large differences in resources and capabilities between large and small care systems, they were not associated with much difference in the approach taken to care coordination. This map of the care coordination territory in Minnesota has the potential to be valuable to researchers and care system leaders for understanding current implementation trends and directing further evaluations.",

    "abstract": "To develop a method for determining the effect of including drug costs in alternative payment models (APMs).Retrospective claims analysis.Using the Oncology Care Model as an example, we developed an oncology episode payment model for a commercial payer using historical claims data. We defined 6-month episodes of chemotherapy. Using claims data, we characterized episodes and developed a risk adjustment model. We used bootstrapping to estimate the variation in episode cost with drugs included and without.Episode costs were approximately $100,000. Although absolute cost variation was higher when we included drugs, the percent of total cost represented by variation was lower. Under reasonable assumptions about potential savings from drug and nondrug spending, our results suggest that including drugs in APMs can improve the risk-benefit trade-off faced by provider groups. We introduce a risk-mitigated sharing rate that may enable inclusion of drugs in APMs without substantially increasing downside risk.We have developed a method to assess whether the inclusion of drug spending in APMs is a good decision for provider groups. Including drug costs in episode payments for oncology patients may be preferable for many provider groups.",

Available data from real-world studies comparing rituximab biosimilar and reference use have focused predominantly on oncology indications. This is the first study to assess the utilization of the 3 US rituximab biosimilars vs the reference product. Study Design: Comparative analysis. Methods: Deidentified real-world data of rituximab, rituximab-abbs, rituximab-pvvr, and rituximab-arrx dispensations between December 31, 2018, and February 1, 2022, were extracted using Trisus Medication Compare (The Craneware Group). The primary outcome was rituximab reference vs biosimilar utilization for oncology vs nononcology indications. Results were stratified by on-label and off-label use and treatment settings. Results: A total of 28,025 encounters were captured for rituximab and its biosimilars across 193 facilities (rituximab: n = 23,395; biosimilars, n = 4631 [rituximab-abbs: n = 2550; rituximab-pvvr, n = 2081; rituximab-arrx: n = 0]). Rituximab reference had higher dispensations for oncology (78.4%) and nononcology (88.3%) indications than its biosimilars (21.6% and 11.7%, respectively; ,P, < .01). The 3-year annual trends from 2019 to 2021 revealed decreased rituximab reference utilization (99.99% to 40.1%) and increased biosimilar use (0.01% to 59.9%). Most oncology dispensations were on label (94.5%), whereas most nononcology dispensations were off label (73.6%; ,P, < .01). A higher proportion of biosimilar use was attributed to on-label indications (67.7%; off-label, 32.2%) compared with rituximab reference (58.0% vs42.0%, respectively; ,P, < .01). Nonacademic settings showed higher biosimilar adoption than academic settings (22.2% vs 10.3%, respectively; ,P, < .01). Conclusions: Real-world evidence shows an increase in rituximab biosimilar adoption over time, with higher adoption for oncology vs nononcology indications and in nonacademic settings.",

Study Design: This was a pilot, single-center, retrospective observational study. Methods: Uninsured patients with diabetes who were newly established with Ascension Medical Group clinics for the treatment of T2D were included in this study. Participants were prescribed insulin glargine, insulin isophane, or insulin isophane/insulin regular insulin therapy between March 2020 and August 2021. A retrospective chart review was conducted. Information collected included participants’ hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months; change in HbA1c level; insulin prescribed; fill history; whether they had been referred to a patient assistance program; and whether they were seen by a pharmacist under a collaborative practice agreement. Results: Thirty-eight participants were assessed, and 22 met criteria for the primary outcome. The mean HbA1c level decreased from 11.2% at baseline to 8.9% at 3 months and 8.8% at 6 months, resulting in a mean change in HbA1c of –2.4 percentage points(,P, = .033). Eleven participants (50%) had an HbA1c level of less than 9% at 6 months. The mean proportion of days covered was 76%. The mean monthly savings for insulin ranged from $183.74 (insulin isophane) to $253.84 (insulin glargine) per participant. Conclusions: Our results showed a significant improvement in glycemic control among participants, demonstrating the substantial impact that pharmacies partnered with charitable medication distributors such as the Dispensary of Hope can have on individuals with insulin-treated T2D.",

Descriptive statistics summarized transaction journeys by type of formulary restriction. Multivariable regression assessed patient characteristics associated with not receiving an OAC within 60 days after initial rejection.Among 18,434 patients in the analytic sample, QL was the most common reason for rejection (68.7%), followed by PA (21.2%) and FE (10.2%). Most patients received a paid OAC claim within 60 days after rejection (82.2%-85.5% across restriction types). Mean time from rejection to paid claim ranged from 5.2 to 10.7 days among patients with a paid OAC claim and 12.4 to 17.6 days among those with multiple attempts before OAC receipt. Characteristics associated with higher odds of not receiving OAC treatment included being male, beingAfrican American, having Medicaid coverage, possessing a high stroke risk score, exhibiting no evidence of prior apixaban treatment, and being prescribed a low dose of apixaban on the initial rejected claim.Most patients with a claim rejection for apixaban received approval for apixaban within 60 days, suggesting that initial rejection merely created a delay in treatment. Vulnerable populations were at greater risk of not receiving a paid OAC claim.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: CMS implemented the Categorical Adjustment Index (CAI) to address measurement bias in the Medicare Advantage (MA) Star Ratings, as unadjusted scores may disadvantage MA contracts serving more enrollees at greater social risk. CAI values are added to a contract’s Star Ratings to adjust for the mean within-contract performance disparity associated with its percentage of enrollees with low socioeconomic status (ie, receipt of a Part D low-income subsidy or dual eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid [LIS/DE]) and who are disabled. We examined the CAI’s effect on Star Ratings and the type of contracts affected. Study Design: Observational study of MA contracts with health and prescription drug coverage. Methods: We compared adjusted and unadjusted 2017-2020 Star Ratings overall and by contracts’ proportion of LIS/DE and disabled enrollees. We assessed the CAI’s effect on qualifying for quality bonus payments (QBPs), eligibility for rebate payments, and high-performing and low-performing designations. Results: The CAI’s impact was modest overall (3.2%-14.9% of contracts experienced one-half Star Rating changes). Upward changes were concentrated among contracts with high percentages of LIS/DE or disabled enrollees (7.7%-32.3% of these contracts saw increased Star Ratings). In 2020, 26.0% of contracts with a high proportion of LIS/DE or disabled enrollees that qualified for a QBP did so because of the CAI. Conclusions: The CAI primarily affected contracts with high LIS/DE or disabled enrollment, which received higher Star Ratings because of the CAI. The adjustment helps ensure that such contracts’ performance is not understated and reduces incentives for MA contracts to avoid patients at greater social risk.",

    "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the effect of a statewide multipayer patient-centered medical home (PCMH) demonstration on patients consistently within the highest ranks of health services expenditure across Maryland. Study Design: Post hoc longitudinal analyses of administrative data on privately insured patients of medical homes that participated in the Maryland Multi-Payer PCMH Program (MMPP), matched for comparison to medical homes in a single-payer PCMH program and to non-PCMH practices. Methods: Consistently high-cost patients (CHPs) were defined as being in the top statewide quintile of payer expenditure over a 2-year baseline period. Using population-averaged generalized linear regression models, we evaluated the odds of CHPs remaining in the highest-cost quintile during the 2-year MMPP implementation period and assessed changes in their utilization patterns. Results: Six percent of included patients were CHPs and accounted for one-third of total expenditure. For CHPs in multipayer PCMHs, estimated odds of remaining in this status after 2 years were lower by 34% (adjusted OR [AOR], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.41-0.90; ,P, = .03) relative to CHPs in non-PCMH practices and higher by 41% (AOR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.08-1.75; ,P, = .004) compared with CHPs in single-payer PCMHs. Relative to CHPs in non-PCMH practices, CHPs in multipayer PCMHs had inpatient admissions decline by 40% (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.60; 95% CI, 0.36-1.00; ,P, = .049) and visits to the attributed primary care provider increase by 21% (IRR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.05-1.39; ,P, = .01). Conclusions: Relative to routine primary care, the PCMH model significantly reduces the probability that CHPs remain in this expensive category and enhances continuity of care.",

This study investigates whether a home hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test kit intervention increases frequency of HbA1c testing and leads to changes in HbA1c 6 months post testing and whether self-reinforcement education improves maintenance of HbA1c testing. Study Design: Retrospective analysis of a randomized, controlled quality improvement intervention among members with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a large commercial health plan. Methods: Participants were 41,214 commercial fully insured members with T2D without an HbA1c test in the past 6 months or with only 1 HbA1c test in the last 12 months. Members were randomly assigned to either a control group or an at-home HbA1c testing intervention group consisting of either an opt-in test or a direct-to-member opt-out HbA1c test kit shipment. A third cohort of members was assigned to a self-reinforcement group to encourage continued testing twice per year. Main outcomes were HbA1c testing rates and HbA1c levels (in %). Results: A total of 11.1% (508 of 4590) at-home HbA1c kits were completed. At-home HbA1c test kits increased testing rates by 4.9% compared with controls (,P, < .001). Members with an HbA1c level of at least 7% who requested and completed at-home HbA1c testing had a 0.38% reduction in HbA1c in the 6 months post intervention when controlling for baseline HbA1c (,P, < .001). Members who received self-reinforcement messaging had a 0.37% HbA1c reduction post intervention (,P, = .015). Conclusions: This novel, at-home approach to test HbA1c is an effective intervention to increase testing rates and facilitate HbA1c reduction over time in patients with T2D.",

STUDY DESIGN Descriptive, retrospective observational data extracted from electronic health records. METHODS Observational data derived from the electronic health records of solid-organ transplant recipients who were hospitalized patients 18 years and older, admitted for any cause between January 2011 and December 2013. ABG levels were classified into categories: 70 to 110 mg/dL (normal), 111 to 140 mg/dL (mildly elevated), 141 to 180 mg/dL (moderately elevated), and greater than 180 mg/dL (markedly elevated). The main outcome was all-cause mortality. RESULTS Our study included 832 patients (median [SD] age = 59 [14] years; 62% male; 68% kidney transplant recipients), 503 (61%) of whom did not have diabetes. Just over half of patients without diabetes had normal ABG (54%), whereas most of those with diabetes had moderately or markedly increased ABG (58%). In patients without diabetes, markedly elevated ABG was associated with increased 30-day mortality risk compared with normal ABG (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.6; 95% CI, 1.9-22.1). The same pattern was evident with investigation of the mortality risk after 1 year (aOR, 5.9; 95% CI, 2.4-14.7) and 3 years (aOR, 10.2; 95% CI, 4.3-24.0). Among patients with diabetes, there was no difference in mortality risk with different ABG. With a competing risk model for 90-day readmission and mortality, there was no association between ABG and risk for readmissions in patients with or without diabetes. CONCLUSIONS In organ transplant recipients admitted for any cause to a general ward, markedly elevated ABG in patients without diabetes was found to be independently associated with higher mortality risk compared with normal ABG levels. In patients with diabetes, there was no association between ABG level and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Objectives Scholars have highlighted the importance of preventing hospital admissions and readmissions for individuals with costly chronic conditions. Providing effective care management strategies can help reduce inpatient admissions, thereby reducing rising health care costs. However, implementing effective care management strategies may be more difficult for independent physician associations (IPAs) that contract with multiple organizations that have competing interests and agendas. This study aims to identify and investigate strategies that facilitate the implementation of evidence-based best practices among IPAs. Study design The research synthesized peer-reviewed literature to identify best practices in chronic disease management for Medicare beneficiaries. Subsequently, 20 key informant interviews were conducted to explore barriers and facilitators in adapting these best practices in IPA settings. Informant interviews were conducted with 3 key groups: executives, medical directors, and care managers. Methods Key informant interviews were conducted to explore barriers and facilitators in implementing best care management practices. Results Key informants provided unique insights regarding the challenges of implementing best care management practices among IPAs. These challenges included implementing and sustaining the operations of evidence-based care management programs while maintaining contractual obligations to health plans, engaging physicians in large and diverse networks, and building high-touch programs in large geographic areas using risk-stratifying algorithms. Conclusions IPA managed care organizations require unique considerations in regard to selected strategies used to manage chronic disease in Medicare populations. These considerations are critical for optimal management of the population, particularly in a risk-based or pay-for-performance environment.",

Study subjects were matched on characteristics not assessed by LACE+, including race and duration of surgery. For comparison of outcomes, LACE+ score was divided into quartiles and otherwise matched populations were compared in reference to LACE+ quartile (Q): Q4 vs Q1, Q4 vs Q2, Q4 vs Q3.A total of 1715 patients were matched for Q1 to Q4, 1951 patients were matched for Q2 to Q4, and 1822 patients were matched for Q3 to Q4. Escalating LACE+ score significantly predicted increased readmission, reoperation, and emergency department (ED) visits from 30 to 90 postoperative days as well as readmission, reoperation, and ED visits from 0 to 90 postoperative days.The results of this study suggest that the LACE+ index is suitable as a prediction model for important patient outcomes in a gynecologic surgery population.",

Because safety-net hospitals may fare more poorly than other hospitals under value-based reforms, we evaluated the relationship between safety-net status and CEBP episode spending.Observational study.We used data from Medicare and the American Hospital Association to identify and describe characteristics of safety-net and non-safety-net hospitals subject to CEBP measures nationwide. Multivariable linear regression, controlled for hospital characteristics, was used to evaluate the association between hospital safety-net status and risk-adjusted, standardized episode spending for each CEBP episode type.Of 1771 hospitals eligible for CEBPs, 28% (491) were safety-net and 72% (1280) were non-safety-net hospitals, with the former being larger and more likely to be nonprofit, nonteaching hospitals. The magnitude of episode spending varied by episode type, ranging from the lowest for cellulitis episodes to the highest for aortic aneurysm episodes. Skilled nursing facility care accounted for a considerable proportion of spending variation for procedure-based episodes but not condition-based episodes. In multivariable analysis, safety-net status was not associated with risk-adjusted episode spending for any of the 6 episode types (spending differences ranging from -$111 to $638 by episode; P > .05 for all).These findings provide the first description of baseline episode spending patterns for safety-net hospitals and suggest that such spending does not vary by safety-net status.",

    "abstract": "IN THE UNITED STATES, employers are the top source of health insurance, accounting for nearly half (49.6%) of the coverage in 2019, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. 1 As job-based health care costs have climbed more than 50% over the past decade, 2 it makes sense that employers are scrutinizing these costs.But employers are doing more than just looking at the spending: They want to know their health care dollars are being spent in ways that make a diff erence for employees.Among the conditions covered by employer-funded insurance, cancer stands out.Today's treatment options can exceed $1 million per patient if successive therapies are used, and cancer accounts for 12% of employer medical spending and 12% of time away from work. 3 Leaders from City of Hope, a National Cancer Institute-designated research and treatment center in Duarte, California, say employers tell them that beyond these costs, a cancer diagnosis can have ripple eff ects across a team; thus, the quality of care aff ects more than just the patient.Last fall, City of Hope responded to employers' desire to deliver better cancer care by creating AccessHope, a wholly owned subsidiary.City of Hope has invested $40 million in AccessHope's program of cancer support, designed to connect expertise from National Cancer Institute-designated centers with patients and their local oncologists-in their own communities.",

    "abstract": "Alternative payment models (APMs) encouraging provider collaboration may help small practices overcome the participation challenges that they face in APMs. We aimed to determine whether small practices in accountable care organizations (ACOs) reduced their beneficiaries' spending more than large practices in ACOs.Retrospective cohort study of Medicare patients attributed to ACOs and non-ACOs.We conducted a modified difference-in-differences analysis that allowed us to compare large vs small practices before and after the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) ACO started, between 2010 and 2016. Our sample included Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with 12 months of Medicare Part A and Part B (unless death) who were attributed to small (≤ 15 providers) and large (> 15 providers) practices participating in ACOs and non-ACOs. The outcome was patient annual spending based on CMS' total per capita costs.Patients attributed to small practices in ACOs had annual Medicare spending decreases of $269 (95% CI, $213-$325; P < .001) more than patients attributed to large practices in ACOs. Small ACO practices reduced spending more than large practices by $165 for physician services (95% CI, $140-$190; P < .001), $113 for hospital/acute care (95% CI, $65-162; P < .001), and $52 for other services (95% CI, $27-$77; P < .001). Small practices in ACOs spent $253 more on average at baseline than small practices in non-ACOs. ACOs with a higher proportion of small practices were more likely to receive shared savings payments.Small practices in ACOs controlled costs more so than large practices. Small practice participation may generate higher savings for ACOs.",

    "abstract": "To change blood pressure treatment, clinicians can modify medication count or dose. However, existing studies have measured count modification, which may miss clinically important dose change in the absence of count change. This research demonstrates how dose modification captures more information about management than medication count alone.Retrospective cohort study.We included patients 65 years and older with established primary care at the Veterans Health Administration (July 2011-June 2013). We captured medication count and standardized dose change over 90 to 120 days using a validated pharmacy fill algorithm. We determined frequency of dose change without count change (and vice versa), no change in either, change in same direction (\"concordant\"), and change in opposite direction (\"discordant\"). We compared change according to systolic blood pressure (SBP) and compared concordance using a minimum threshold definition of dose change of at least 50% (instead of any change) of baseline dose modification.Among 440,801 patients, 64.2% had dose change; 22.0%, count change; 35.6%, no change in either; 42.4%, dose change without count modification; and 0.2%, count change without dose modification. Discordance occurred in 2.1% of observations. Using the minimum threshold definition of change, 68.7% had no change in either dose or count. Treatment was more frequently changed at SBP greater than 140 mm Hg.Measuring change in antihypertensive treatment using medication count frequently missed an isolated dose change in treatment modification and less often misclassified regimen modifications where there was no modification in total dose. In future research, measuring dose modification using our new algorithm would capture change in hypertension treatment intensity more precisely than current methods.",

We used 4 Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems scores (2 pain care items and 2 global items) as measures of care experiences of women hospitalized for VD.We used 4 inverse probability-weighted logit regressions to estimate the relationship between inpatient opioid receipt and each patient care experience measure. In supplementary analyses, we used the same inverse probability-weighted methods to estimate the relationship between receipt of opioids and patient care experience measures in 3 patient subgroups based on mean patient-reported pain score during hospitalization (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain).We found no relationship between inpatient opioid receipt and inpatient pain care experiences. As an exception, we found that women hospitalized for VD were 5 (95% CI, 2-8) percentage points more likely to rate the hospital as 10 (\"the best hospital possible\") during hospitalizations in which an opioid was received. We also found higher overall ratings of the hospital among hospitalized women who reported mild pain if they received an opioid (marginal effects = 0.05; 95% CI, 2-8 percentage points).Receipt of opioids may not be a significant determinant of the pain-specific patient care experiences of women hospitalized for VD.",

Then, using these regroupings, we employ numerical optimization to estimate the recommended budget levels that could minimize the number of audits across those groupings. We simulate the effects of this proposed methodology on FY 2019 plans of service and compare the resulting number of simulated audits with actual experience.Using optimal regrouping and numerical optimization, this method could reduce the number of audits by 10.4% to 36.7% relative to the status quo, depending on the search space parameters. This reduction is a result of resetting recommended budget levels across acuity groupings, with no anticipated increase in the total recommended budget amount across plans of service. These reductions are driven, in general, by an increase in recommended budget level for acuity groupings with low variance in plan-of-service spending and a reduction in recommended budget level for acuity groupings with high variance in plan-of-service spending.Using machine learning and optimization methods, it is possible to design recommended budget thresholds that could lead to significant reductions in administrative burden without encouraging overall cost growth.",

Efficacy outcomes, HF-related hospitalizations and ED visits, and cost outcomes for HF-related medical and pharmacy claims were compared 1 year pre- and post index date.

A subgroup analysis evaluated the outcomes for members who were adherent to sacubitril/valsartan.A total of 22 members were identified for the study. There were fewer hospitalizations and ED visits post sacubitril/valsartan initiation in the overall population (post vs pre-: 23 vs 26) and among 12 members adherent to sacubitril/valsartan (10 vs 12). The median (IQR) cost for hospitalizations and ED visits was lower during the postindex period ($576 [$19,439] vs $132 [$11,692]) whereas the median (IQR) cost for HF pharmacotherapies was greater during the postindex period ($4578 [$3033] vs $270 [$255]). The benefit-cost ratio and net benefit were 0.91 and -$336, respectively, for all members and 1.43 and $2337, respectively, for members adherent to sacubitril/valsartan.The benefit as demonstrated by the cost avoidance of HF-related hospitalizations and ED visits did not outweigh the additional costs of sacubitril/valsartan, but cost-benefit was observed in members who were adherent to sacubitril/valsartan.",

We asked patients to reflect upon their personal experience when selecting their oncologist, utilization of an oncologist selection tool, and establishing an advance directive.PCPs tend to refer patients to oncologists who are part of their health system (67.9%). Most PCPs (79.2%) were not currently utilizing an oncologist selection tool; most (77.3%) expressed a willingness to use such a tool. Most PCPs (69.8%) believe the best time to talk about an advance directive is at the time of cancer diagnosis. Patients ranked a PCP referral (52.7%) as \"very important\" when selecting an oncologist. One-third of patients used a web-based oncologist selection tool; 65.2% responded that an oncologist selection tool would be \"somewhat\" or \"very\" important. Most (54.5%) patients had an advance directive.These results present a compelling rationale for developing a data-driven oncologist selection tool, optimizing patient and provider involvement in care, and expanding the portion of patients who have an advance directive at the start of their cancer care to optimize their cancer journey.",

    "abstract": "To understand primary care visits and medication utilization among older patients with hypertension to gauge opportunity for service redesign.Data came from 1,880,331 Medicare Advantage members with hypertension who had a primary care visit and a pharmacy claim for an antihypertensive, antidiabetic, or antilipemic medication. To determine activities associated with a primary care visit, we analyzed 43,258,454 medical claims, 245 procedure codes, and medication management associated with those visits. Models for predicting both hypertension visits and medication management were evaluated and applied.Logistic regression was used to identify which features were predictive of a medication change or a provider visit.Almost 40% of visits were consultation only, not associated with a procedure, and 26.5% of individuals had no medication change in a year. For prescription changes, 75% were a return to a previously prescribed medication or a medication discontinuation. Twenty percent of the population accounted for 47.9% of visits. Type 2 diabetes and a prior medication change were the strongest predictors of a medication change. A previous medication change was also the strongest predictor of a subsequent provider visit.Our analysis suggests that a significant portion of care-consultation-only visits-may be relatively low value. Further, much of medication management may not require an office-based visit. Finally, utilization behavior of patients with hypertension and predictive models are likely to allow informed provisioning of new service models to specific population segments.",

    "abstract": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) is a clinical program providing training, a monthly stipend, and other services to caregivers of qualifying post-9/11 veterans with service-related injuries. Veteran-caregiver discharge from the program occurs when veteran recovery is achieved, participation is no longer in the veteran's best interest, or caregiving ceases. Public scrutiny about potentially inappropriate discharges resulted in a nationwide freeze on all discharges. PCAFC expanded to pre-9/11 veterans in October 2020; thus, lessons learned can continue to inform the expanded program. We pursued 3 objectives: (1) describe the discharge rate, reasons for discharge, and veteran and caregiver characteristics by discharge status; (2) identify factors associated with discharge from PCAFC nationally; and (3) characterize network variation in discharge predictors.Retrospective observational study using VA administrative data from fiscal year (FY) 2011 to FY 2017.Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, we examined factors associated with PCAFC discharge among veterans and caregivers enrolled in PCAFC during FY 2011 to FY 2016.A total of 40.5% of all participants were discharged. Nonspouse caregivers and those applying in later years had the highest rates of discharge; spouse caregivers and those applying in earlier years had the lowest rates of discharge. In 4 of 18 networks, caregivers of Black veterans faced higher rates of discharge compared with caregivers of White veterans, and in 1 network, they faced lower rates of discharge. Substantial variability in rates of discharge was also observed across Veterans Integrated Service Networks.Training on clinically appropriate discharge criteria could improve practice and increase equity.",

    "abstract": "Because physicians' decisions drive health care costs and quality, there is growing interest in applying behavioral economics approaches, including behavioral nudges, to influence physicians' decisions. This paper investigates adoption of behavioral nudges by health system-affiliated physician organizations (POs), types of nudges being used, PO leader perceptions of nudge effectiveness, and implementation challenges.Mixed-methods study design (PO leader survey followed by in-depth qualitative interviews). Purposive sample of 30 health system-affiliated POs in 4 states; POs varied in size and quality performance.We collected data between October 2017 and June 2019. The survey asked PO leaders to report their organization's use of 5 categories of nudges to influence primary and specialty physicians' actions. We conducted semistructured phone interviews to confirm survey responses, elicit examples of the nudges that POs reported using, understand how nudges were structured, and identify implementation challenges. We present descriptive tabulations of nudge use and effectiveness ratings. We applied thematic analysis to the interview data.Almost all POs in this study reported nudge use. Clinical templates, patient action lists, and altered order entry were most commonly used. However, PO leaders reported that nudge use was limited to a narrow range of clinical applications, not widespread across the organization, and mostly structured as suggestions rather than default actions or hard stops.Nudge use remains limited in practice. Opportunities exist to expand use of nudges to influence physician behavior; however, expanding use of behavioral nudges will require PO investment of resources to support their construction and maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Medicare beneficiaries dually eligible for Medicaid are a low-income group who are often in poor health. Little research has examined sex differences in patient experience by dual/low-income subsidy (LIS) status.Cross-sectional comparison by sex and low-income status.We used linear regression to compare 6 case mix-adjusted patient experience measures (on a 0-100 scale) by sex within non-dual/LIS and dual/LIS beneficiary groups among 549,603 respondents 65 years and older to the 2016-2017 Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems surveys of beneficiary experience with Medicare (mail with telephone follow-up of nonrespondents, 42% response rate).Dual/LIS male beneficiaries reported worse patient experiences on all 6 measures than female beneficiaries, with scores 1 to 2 percentage points lower for 3 measures and less than 1 percentage point lower for the other 3 measures. For 4 of the 6 measures, sex differences among dual/LIS beneficiaries were significantly larger than those among non-dual/LIS beneficiaries. In all 4 instances, the gaps between men and women among dual/LIS beneficiaries favored women; P < .05 for all differences discussed.Low-income male Medicare beneficiaries are more likely to report poor patient experiences, possibly because of lower health literacy, less patient activation, and smaller social networks, along with provider responses to these characteristics. Efforts to address these patient-level factors should happen in parallel with structural-level approaches to train and prepare providers to ensure attentive, respectful patient-centered care for all patients. Additionally, targeted use of ombudsmen and interventions may help reduce inequities.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: After the release of the CDC guidelines in March 2016, the rate of opioid prescriptions decreased. How or whether pharmaceutical companies changed their opioid marketing practices post release of the CDC guidelines is unknown. Our objectives were to (1) evaluate whether the release of the guidelines was associated with changes in total monthly marketing spending received per physician, monthly marketing encounter frequency per physician, and spending per encounter during opioid marketing; and (2) evaluate whether such changes in marketing differed between specialist physicians and primary care physicians (PCPs) and between urban and rural primary care service areas (PCSAs). Study Design: Retrospective observational cross-sectional study using opioid marketing spending data from the CMS Open Payments database between August 2013 and December 2017. Methods: Single-group and multiple-group interrupted time series analyses were used to evaluate differences in the immediate changes in level and trend over time in opioid marketing practices post release of the CDC guidelines. Results: Post release of the CDC guidelines, the monthly number of marketing encounters per physician and total monthly amount received per physician decreased. However, the amount spent at each marketing encounter increased. The release of the CDC guidelines was associated with an immediate increase in level of opioid marketing spending per encounter by $0.59 (95% CI, $0.51-$0.68; ,P, < .001) and an over-time increase in rate of spending per encounter of $0.04 per month (95% CI, $0.03-$0.05; ,P, < .001). These changes differed between specialists and PCPs and between urban and rural PCSAs. Conclusions: It is important to continue ongoing education for physicians on changes in pharmaceutical opioid marketing practices.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: This study aims to estimate the burden of food affordability on diabetes-related preventable hospitalizations among Medicaid enrollees in the United States. Study Design: This study used a retrospective observational design with Medicaid administrative claims data from 17 states from 2014. Methods: Data were linked with county-level social determinants of health (SDOH) from the American Community Survey. The rate of diabetes-related preventable hospitalizations was measured using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality’s Prevention Quality Diabetes Composite, which includes hospitalization for short-term complications, long-term complications, lower extremity amputations, and uncontrolled diabetes. Multivariable logistic regression was used to predict the occurrence of diabetes-related preventable hospitalization. Results: Among the 16 million eligible individuals, diabetes-related preventable hospitalizations were identified at the rate of 1.91 per 1000 individuals and contributed to more than $160 million in charges. Rates were higher among men compared with women (0.25% vs 0.15%; ,P, < .001) and among Black adults compared with White adults (0.29% vs 0.18%; ,P, < .001). Compared with individuals residing in counties with low food affordability, those residing in counties with high (odds ratio [OR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78-0.91; ,P, < .001) or medium (OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.81-0.90; ,P, < .001) food affordability had lower odds of hospitalization. Conclusions: This study provides real-world evidence about the impact of SDOH on diabetes-related preventable hospitalizations. Federal and state policies that can help improve accessibility of healthy foods are needed to ameliorate the burden of diabetes on society.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To assess the relationship between self-rated mental health (SRMH) and infrequent routine care among Medicare beneficiaries and to investigate the roles of managed care and having a personal doctor. Study Design: Cross-sectional analysis of data from the 2018 Medicare Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey. Methods: Logistic regression was used to predict infrequent routine care (having not made an appointment for routine care in the last 6 months) from SRMH, Medicare coverage type (fee-for-service [FFS] vs Medicare Advantage [MA], the managed care version of Medicare), and the interaction of these variables. Models that did and did not include having a personal doctor were compared. All models controlled for demographics and physical health. Results: Overall, 14.9% of beneficiaries did not make a routine care appointment in the last 6 months, with rates adjusted for demographics and physical health ranging from 14.5% for those with “excellent” SRMH to 19.2% for those with “poor” SRMH. Beneficiaries with poor SRMH were less likely to make a routine care appointment in FFS than in MA (20.1% vs 16.4%, respectively, had not done so in the last 6 months; ,P ,< .05). Accounting for having a personal doctor reduced the association between SRMH and infrequent routine care by about a third. Conclusions: Extra efforts are needed to ensure receipt of routine care by beneficiaries with poor mental health—particularly in FFS, where more should be done to ensure that beneficiaries have a personal doctor.",

The study included 1800 adults with substance use disorder (SUD), anxiety, or depression who were eligible for the intervention. Treated members (n = 900) graduated from the program. Matched control members (n = 900) were eligible but never enrolled. Primary outcomes included all-cause and disease-attributable health care cost and utilization PMPM, categorized by place of service.There were statistically significant reductions in total all-cause medical costs of $485 PMPM (P < .001) and a 66% pre-post reduction in inpatient encounters, with $488 PMPM DID savings for inpatient admissions (P < .001) among the treated cohort compared with the control cohort over 36 months. Conversely, there were statistically significant cost increases ($110 PMPM; P < .001) for all-cause office visits in the treated cohort compared with the control cohort. Similar results were seen in SUD-attributable and BH-attributable costs.Although the results could be affected by unmeasured confounding, they suggest that care coaching interventions that offer BH provider referrals may produce long-term savings, reductions in avoidable utilization, and increases in targeted services to treat BH conditions. Rigorous evaluations are needed to confirm these findings.",

Survey questions examined capacity in 4 areas: (1) physician performance feedback, (2) care management, (3) postacute care provider utilization, and (4) health information technology.Our sample included 114 hospitals reporting experience in Medicare or commercial bundled payment programs. Both Medicare-only and multipayer hospitals reported high organizational capacities in performance measurement of physician-level quality and cost feedback and in incorporation of health information technology. More multipayer hospitals reported high capacity for coordinating hospital to postacute care settings (88% vs 52%). Although nearly all hospitals in both groups reported formalized relationships with skilled nursing facilities (98%), fewer hospitals reported such relationships with long-term acute care hospitals (83%) and inpatient rehabilitation facilities (80%).Although they have similar capacity in a number of areas, Medicare-only and multipayer hospitals differed with respect to other aspects of organizational capacity.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, immune-mediated, neurodegenerative condition that results in progressive accumulation of disability over the course of the disease. MS presents heterogeneously, and, as the disease progresses, patients develop a range of physical and neurologic problems that include reduced mobility, cognitive impairment, weakness, fatigue, pain, and defects in speech or vision. Economically, MS is costly, including both direct costs stemming from clinical care and medications and the indirect costs of productivity losses. These costs pose a substantial burden to patients, families, caregivers, employers, and society. There are 21 approved disease-modifying therapies for MS across several drug classes. The importance of early MS treatment has been confirmed, and progress has been made in the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS, although this progress has not been replicated for progressive presentations of the disease. Ongoing research continues to elucidate the exact mechanisms of disease in MS as well as potential new treatment strategies that may better address current gaps, such as disability progression in secondary progressive MS without activity. One of the novel pathways under investigation is the inhibition of Bruton tyrosine kinase, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, which is expressed in B cells and other potentially targetable hematopoietic lineage cells. This review examines emerging hypotheses that targeting both B cells and myeloid cells within the periphery and central nervous system could yield clinical effects in key areas of MS pathophysiology that are currently unaddressed.",

    "abstract": "Recently, significant reductions were made to align the PCSK9 inhibitors with cost-effectiveness parameters.However, despite the pricing of PCSK9 agents becoming more in line with cost-effectiveness criteria, significant barriers to physician prescribing, payer approval, and patient adherence still exist.The barriers for PCSK9 inhibitor use were insurer processes, provider documentation, and administrative burden.This activity will help managed care professionals become more aware of the prevalence of hyperlipidemia and opportunities to optimize care of patients with elevated cholesterol using a more aggressive treatment approach.Managed care professionals need to understand how management of hypercholesterolemia in cardiovascular disease can prevent cardiac complications later and develop managed care protocols to support the use of effective treatment that reflects recent revisions to the most used treatment guideline. Educational ObjectivesUpon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: • Explain the prevalence of patients who present with hyperlipidemia and quality-of-life challenges.• Identify guideline recommendations, updates in clinical data, and new and emerging PCSK9 inhibitors.• Examine healthcare costs associated with hyperlipidemia.• Explore strategies that support current best practices and new therapies to help mitigate healthcare utilization costs associated with disease progression and poor treatment response.

The primary outcome was live singleton birth earlier than 35 weeks. Covariates were medical/mental/behavioral comorbidities, obstetric history, sociodemographic characteristics, and health services utilization. Of multiple models built, the most parsimonious was selected to classify pregnancies as very high, high, medium, and low risk. Model performance was evaluated using positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, case identification ratio (1 / PPV), and timing of prediction.The model was built on 6689 pregnancies and validated on 7855 pregnancies. PTB rate earlier than 35 weeks was approximately 3.3%. Significant risk predictors included prenatal visit attendance, insurance gap days, and medical/obstetrical comorbidities. Model PPV was approximately 4-fold higher for very high-risk women (14.7%) vs cohort (3.3%) and so was the case identification ratio (1:7 vs 1:30, respectively). Sensitivity was good, with 57% of PTBs classified as medium risk or higher. Timing of prediction was clinically relevant, with more than 80% of PTBs risk stratified before 24 weeks.We report a novel PTB prediction model among pregnant Medicaid women without PTB history, which is timely, accurate, practical, and scalable. We leverage Medicaid and community data readily accessible by Medicaid plans to support population-level interventions to prevent PTBs.",

Although not all proposals referred to as \"value based\" are well suited to advance this mission, health plans must select among them under the influence of competing demands and constraints of their market and nonmarket environments. To understand the implications for health policy, we sought to explore how health plans might select among and implement these approaches for specialty pharmacy (SP) under the incentives and barriers that these conditions create.An experienced research team conducted a qualitative study with Blue Cross Blue Shield health plans interested in implementing value-based SP management.Plans'objectives, operational strategies, and factors influencing their ability to execute on these strategies were elicited in 3 focus groups.Four business objectives were identified, centering on spending levels, spending variability, access to new treatments, and evidence generation for new treatments. Supporting operational strategies included increased utilization management (UM), provider and patient engagement, expanded data analytics, and adjustments to staffing models. Factors that influence their ability to act on these strategies include regional and national scale, strength of provider network relationships, disease management capabilities, business and data silos, and potential legislative actions to limit UM.Health plans' preferences for different forms of SP management may not be aligned with policy objectives, particularly those that advance innovation. Policy makers should consider market and nonmarket factors that influence these preferences, including the need to mitigate spending variability and generate evidence to guide coverage decisions.",

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study comparing MCPs with an age- and gender-matched mirror group in Florida from April 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020. METHODS: A total of 38,193 MCPs in a Florida primary care group were monitored for COVID-19 incidence, hospitalization, and mortality. The highest-risk patients were managed by the medical group's COVID-19 Task Force. As part of a population health program, the COVID-19 Task Force contacted patients, conducted medical encounters, and tracked data including comorbidities and medical outcomes. The MCPs enrolled in the medical group were compared with a mirror group from the state of Florida. RESULTS: The mean (SD) age among the MCPs was 67.9 (15.2) years, and 60% were female. Older age and hypertension were the most important factors in predicting COVID-19. Obesity, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and congestive heart failure (CHF) were linked to higher rates of hospitalizations. Patients prescribed off-label outpatient medications had 73% lower likelihood of hospitalization (P < .05). Compared with the mirror group, MCPs had 60% lower COVID-19 mortality (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: MCPs have risk factors similar to the general population for COVID-19 incidence and progression, including older age, hypertension, obesity, CHF, and CKD. Outpatient treatment with off-label medicines decreased hospitalizations. A comprehensive population health program decreased COVID-19 mortality.",

By contrast, human synthetic insulins are available at a fraction of the cost. The objective of this study was to examine whether patients with financial constraints were more likely to use low-cost human insulins compared with higher-cost analogue insulins and to determine whether outcomes differ between users of each type of insulin.Retrospective cohort study.Analysis of 4 cycles of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey was performed. Adults with diabetes who reported use of insulin were included. The primary outcome was use of human insulin or analogue insulin. The dependent variable was self-reported financial constraints, a composite variable. Secondary analysis examined the association between use of human vs analogue insulin and patient outcomes.Of 22,263 eligible respondents, 698 (3.1%) reported use of insulin and the type of insulin used, representing 485,228 patients nationally. Patients with 1 or more financial risk factors were more likely to use human insulin compared with patients without any financial risk factors (88.5% vs 76.7%; P = .014). There was no association between use of human vs analogue insulin on diabetic or other patient outcomes among patients regardless of financial risk.Patients with financial risk factors may be more likely to use low-cost human synthetic insulins compared with insulin analogues.

    "abstract": "Activity OverviewIron deficiency anemia (IDA) is closely linked to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Treatment often consists of iron replacement therapy, and novel intravenous (IV) iron formulations have impacted the management of patients with both IBD and IDA.Managed care professionals must understand the role of IV iron in treating patients with IBD and IDA, as well as safety and efficacy considerations.This activity will review the role of IV iron replacement in IBD and IDA and focus on the economic burden of these disease states and the impact of IV iron on healthcare resource use. Statement of Educational NeedInflammation in the gastrointestinal tract can result in iron deficiency anemia (IDA), which is the most common complication of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).Treatment options for IBD can also contribute to the condition, with between 36% and 90% of patients with IBD developing IDA.These patients experience higher rates of hospitalization, longer lengths of stay, and high healthcare costs.Managed care professionals should be familiar with newer intravenous (IV) iron replacement therapies that are entering the treatment landscape of iron deficiency in IBD with the potential to reduce healthcare resource utilization and lessen disease severity for patients.The market for IV iron is expected to increase considerably through 2026, and payers must be equipped to address challenges affecting utilization of and access to these therapies, such as ensuring access to infusions when products require higher doses.To appropriately individualize the treatment of IDA in patients with IBD, managed care professionals must recognize the indications, risks, and benefits of IV iron replacement therapies to develop and implement evidence-based pathways and management plans. Educational ObjectivesUpon completion of this activity, participants should be able to: • Examine the biologic pathways relevant to iron hemostasis in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as well as appropriate monitoring of iron status.• Compare iron replacement therapies, including risks and benefits, for the treatment of patients with IBD and iron deficiency.• Explore the health-related quality of life and economic burden of iron deficiency anemia in relation to the evolving evidence-based treatment protocols for patients with IBD and iron deficiency to improve outcomes and efficiently allocate healthcare resources.",

Patients were assigned to 1 of 5 provider specialty cohorts. During the 1-year follow-up period, we collected psoriatic arthritis treatment agent and regimen type and total annual medical and health care costs. We used multivariate regression models to determine the conditional associations of provider specialty with costs.A total of 2132 patients with incident psoriatic arthritis qualified. Most providers were rheumatologists (n = 1365; 64%). Rheumatologists commonly prescribed oral small molecules (methotrexate, 56.3% of prescriptions; sulfasalazine, 8.6%; apremilast, 7.0%) as the index therapy, whereas 23.8% of prescriptions were for tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (adalimumab, 14.2%; etanercept, 7.9%; and infliximab, 1.7%). Compared with other specialists, dermatologists prescribed biologics and other specialty drugs more frequently-adalimumab (32.7%), apremilast (14.3%), etanercept (11.6%), and ustekinumab (8.8%)-and methotrexate less frequently (30.6%). The greatest unadjusted median health care costs were observed among dermatologists ($45,548) compared with rheumatologists ($30,411), primary care physicians ($29,927), rheumatologists/dermatologists ($27,393), and other specialists ($27,774). However, after adjusting for patient-level factors, multivariate regression analyses found that provider specialty was not associated with higher health care costs.In patients with newly diagnosed psoriatic arthritis, physician specialty was associated with different medication choices but not costs.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES Reducing hospital admissions in patients with multiple complex chronic conditions is both a quality indicator and cost-effective to health care systems. This study assesses and compares utilization rates and cost of encounters between patients referred and seen in an outpatient critical care transition clinic (Healthy Transitions Clinic [HTC]) and those referred and not seen. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective cohorts. METHODS Patients with complex chronic conditions discharged from a tertiary/quaternary acute care hospital or emergency department (March 1, 2015, to February 29, 2016) were referred to an outpatient critical care transition clinic. Comparative cohorts were those patients who attended this transition clinic and those who did not. Pre- and post-HTC referral visits, with health care utilization evaluations including admissions/readmissions, attention to social determinants of health, and cost assessments, were compared among the cohorts. RESULTS Insurance coverage differed significantly in its distribution between the groups (χ2 = 22.99; P < .001); therefore, an adjusted relative risk model was used. Inpatient admissions significantly increased, by 31%, in the non-HTC cohort (P = .03); a significant increase in the rate of 30-day readmissions (69%) occurred in the HTC group (P < .001) at 6 months post index admission. Length of stay did not differ pre- and post HTC visit. Although not statistically significant, visits to the HTC reduced median all-cost and HTC cohort cost by more than $1 million. CONCLUSIONS In patients with complex chronic medical conditions with recent hospital admissions, the HTC model appears to reduce both admissions and encounter costs. Further community/regional studies are needed to better define this observation on a longitudinal basis.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVES High-sensitivity troponin T (hsTnT) testing was approved in the United States to better facilitate diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Although hsTnT has been widely studied internationally, the impact of hsTnT on discharge diagnoses and health care utilization within the United States is less known. We sought to evaluate the effects of implementing hsTnT on diagnosis patterns and stress testing utilization. STUDY DESIGN We performed a retrospective cohort analysis consisting of patients with suspected ACS undergoing either conventional troponin I (n = 14,631) or hsTnT (n = 7237) testing between January 2016 and February 2019. METHODS Log-binomial regression with interrupted time series modeled diagnosis patterns, and logistic regression with segmented time trends modeled stress testing rates. Observed trends were compared with expected trends using average marginal effect (AME). RESULTS Rates of acute myocardial infarction-related diagnoses were similar in the post-hsTnT period (AME, -0.6%; P = .065). Post hsTnT introduction, patients were more likely to receive a diagnosis of heart failure (2.1%; P < .001) or atrial fibrillation/flutter (0.9%; P < .001) and less likely to receive a diagnosis of hypertensive heart disease (-10.2%; P < .01) or hypertensive heart disease with chronic kidney disease (-3.7%; P < .001). Likelihood of receiving stress testing increased after hsTnT implementation (2.3%; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS Variations in discharge diagnosis patterns and increases in stress test utilization were observed following hsTnT implementation. Hospitals can expect similar changes, which may have long-term implications on health care utilization, cost, and hospital reimbursement.",

Provider outreach, including telephonic and fax attempts, was conducted over a 2-week period prior to PA expiration. Outcomes were classified as positive or negative based on provider conversation coupled with the result (eg, PA submission) for the intervention group and based solely on pharmacy claims for the control group. The primary end point was the percentage of positive outcomes between the groups, analyzed via χ2 test. The time from PA expiration to the new PA submission was evaluated via t test.A total of 342 outreach attempts were conducted for 270 PAs representing 193 unique patients. Outreach was more likely to result in positive outcomes in the intervention group vs no outreach in the control group (87% vs 25%; P < .00001). On average, PAs were submitted 3.5 days prior to expiration in the intervention group vs 13.0 days after expiration in the control group (t = -7.50; P < .00001).Proactive outreach resulted in a greater percentage of PA submissions and a significantly reduced time to PA submission. These findings provide important information for payers in guiding clinical programs to enhance continuity of care among at-risk populations.",

Between 29 and 53 schools participated in a particular year.Cronbach's α was 0.79, intraclass correlation was 0.36 (95% CI, 0.22-0.53), and sensitivity to change was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.17-0.66) per 1-year change in the standardized SEI score. The median (interquartile range) time required to complete the survey was 11 (7-21) minutes. On only 8 surveys was an entire domain of the SEI skipped or only a single response to the domain recorded.The SEI shows adequate internal consistency and sensitivity to change in this pilot evaluation. It is also feasible and useful to identify opportunities to improve practices and policies related to student nutrition and physical activity in partnership with the participating elementary schools. However, it lacks reliability as used. Increasing the number of respondents per school might moderate the impact of individual respondents and thereby increase reliability.",

The first method identified program characteristics that were common among programs that had estimated reductions in costs and service use and uncommon among those that did not. The second approach compared median impacts among awardees with a given distinguishing feature with median impacts among awardees that lacked the characteristic.Of the 23 program features examined, 7 were associated with favorable estimated impacts: 3 intervention components (behavioral health, telehealth, and health information technology) and 4 program design and organizational characteristics (having prior experience implementing similar programs, targeting patients with substantial nonmedical needs in addition to medical problems, being focused on individual patient care rather than transforming provider practice, and using nonclinical staff as frontline providers of the intervention).Innovative health care service delivery models with 2 or more of these 7 identified features were more likely than programs without them to reduce Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries' needs for costly health care services.",

We aimed to develop national estimates of QI actions undertaken by hospitals and to explore their relationship to performance on CMS quality measures.Nationally representative cross-sectional survey of acute care hospitals in 2016 (n = 1313 respondents; 64% response rate).We assessed 23 possible QI changes. Using multivariate linear regression, we estimated the relationship between reported QI changes and performance on composite measures derived from 26 Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program measures (scaled 0-100), controlling for case mix and facility characteristics.Hospitals reported implementing a mean of 17 QI changes (median [interquartile range], 17 [15-20]). Large hospitals reported significantly higher adoption rates than small hospitals for 18 QI changes. Most hospitals that reported making QI changes (63%-96% for the 23 changes) responded that the specific change made helped improve performance. In multivariate regression analyses, adoption of 92% of QI changes (90th percentile among hospitals), compared with adoption of 50% of QI changes (10th percentile), was associated with a 2.3-point higher overall performance score (95% CI, 0.7-4.0) and higher process (8.7 points; 95% CI, 5.7-11.7) and patient experience (3.0 points; 95% CI, 0.1-5.9) composite scores.Hospitals reported widespread adoption of QI changes in response to CMS quality measurement and reporting.

    "abstract": "Recently, changes in antihypertensive therapies with similar properties have been made based primarily on cost savings for hospital formularies. To assess blood pressure (BP) control and adverse side effects associated with a switch of patients on nifedipine GITS to felodipine at our Veteran's Administration Medical Center (VAMC), we prospectively studied physician records and patient-reported side effects (both from the medical record and patient questionnaires) in 127 hypertensive patients (70 ± 10 years, 95% men, 88% nonblack, 44% with coronary disease) who underwent the forced switch in therapy. During the period of patient visits/chart review, physicians were unaware that the study was being conducted. A minimum of 2 months and two visits on each therapy was required for patient inclusion. The mean doses of nifedipine GITS and felodipine used were 55 ± 24 mg/day and 8 ± 2.6 mg/day, respectively. The use of supplemental antihypertensive agents was similar in both calcium channel blocker groups. Systolic BPs and heart rates were similar in patients taking the two drugs, and the diastolic BP was modestly lower in patients taking felodipine (78 ± 10 mm Hg for felodipine and 80 ± 10 mm Hg for nifedipine, P",
