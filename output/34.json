    "abstract": "Computational thinking (CT) is broadly defined as the mental activity for abstracting problems and formulating solutions that can be automated. In an increasingly information-based society, CT is becoming an essential skill for everyone. To ensure that students develop this ability at the K-12 level, it is important to provide teachers with an adequate knowledge about CT and how to incorporate it into their teaching. This article describes a study on designing and introducing computational thinking modules and assessing their impact on preservice teachers’ understanding of CT concepts, as well as their attitude towards computing. Results demonstrate that introducing computational thinking into education courses can effectively influence preservice teachers’ understanding of CT concepts.",

    "abstract": "Efforts to improve computer science education are underway, and teachers of computer science are challenged in introductory programming courses to help learners develop their understanding of programming and computer science. Identifying and addressing students’ misconceptions is a key part of a computer science teacher's competence. However, relevant research on this topic is not as fully developed in the computer science education field as it is in mathematics and science education. In this article, we first review relevant literature on general definitions of misconceptions and studies about students’ misconceptions and other difficulties in introductory programming. Next, we investigate the factors that contribute to the difficulties. Finally, strategies and tools to address difficulties including misconceptions are discussed. Based on the review of literature, we found that students exhibit various misconceptions and other difficulties in syntactic knowledge, conceptual knowledge, and strategic knowledge. These difficulties experienced by students are related to many factors including unfamiliarity of syntax, natural language, math knowledge, inaccurate mental models, lack of strategies, programming environments, and teachers’ knowledge and instruction. However, many sources of students’ difficulties have connections with students’ prior knowledge. To better understand and address students’ misconceptions and other difficulties, various instructional approaches and tools have been developed. Nevertheless, the dissemination of these approaches and tools has been limited. Thus, first, we suggest enhancing the dissemination of existing tools and approaches and investigating their long-term effects. Second, we recommend that computing education research move beyond documenting misconceptions to address the development of students’ (mis)conceptions by integrating conceptual change theories. Third, we believe that developing and enhancing instructors’ pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), including their knowledge of students’ misconceptions and ability to apply effective instructional approaches and tools to address students’ difficulties, is vital to the success of teaching introductory programming.",

    "abstract": "This article is a survey of program visualization systems intended for teaching beginners about the runtime behavior of computer programs. Our focus is on generic systems that are capable of illustrating many kinds of programs and behaviors. We inclusively describe such systems from the last three decades and review findings from their empirical evaluations. A comparable review on the topic does not previously exist; ours is intended to serve as a reference for the creators, evaluators, and users of educational program visualization systems. Moreover, we revisit the issue of learner engagement which has been identified as a potentially key factor in the success of educational software visualization and summarize what little is known about engagement in the context of the generic program visualization systems for beginners that we have reviewed; a proposed refinement of the frameworks previously used by computing education researchers to rank types of learner engagement is a side product of this effort. Overall, our review illustrates that program visualization systems for beginners are often short-lived research prototypes that support the user-controlled viewing of program animations; a recent trend is to support more engaging modes of user interaction. The results of evaluations largely support the use of program visualization in introductory programming education, but research to date is insufficient for drawing more nuanced conclusions with respect to learner engagement. On the basis of our review, we identify interesting questions to answer for future research in relation to themes such as engagement, the authenticity of learning tasks, cognitive load, and the integration of program visualization into introductory programming pedagogy.",

Increasingly, these students are learning with graphical, block-based programming environments either in place of or prior to traditional text-based programming languages. Despite their growing use in formal settings, relatively little empirical work has been done to understand the impacts of using block-based programming environments in high school classrooms. In this article, we present the results of a 5-week, quasi-experimental study comparing isomorphic block-based and text-based programming environments in an introductory high school programming class. The findings from this study show students in both conditions improved their scores between pre- and postassessments; however, students in the blocks condition showed greater learning gains and a higher level of interest in future computing courses. Students in the text condition viewed their programming experience as more similar to what professional programmers do and as more effective at improving their programming ability. No difference was found between students in the two conditions with respect to confidence or enjoyment. The implications of these findings with respect to pedagogy and design are discussed, along with directions for future work.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies in the literature have shown that syntax remains a significant barrier to novice computer science students in the field. While this syntax barrier is known to exist, whether and how it varies across programming languages has not been carefully investigated. For this article, we conducted four empirical studies on programming language syntax as part of a larger analysis into the, so called, programming language wars. We first present two surveys conducted with students on the intuitiveness of syntax, which we used to garner formative clues on what words and symbols might be easy for novices to understand. We followed up with two studies on the accuracy rates of novices using a total of six programming languages: Ruby, Java, Perl, Python, Randomo, and Quorum. Randomo was designed by randomly choosing some keywords from the ASCII table (a metaphorical placebo). To our surprise, we found that languages using a more traditional C-style syntax (both Perl and Java) did not afford accuracy rates significantly higher than a language with randomly generated keywords, but that languages which deviate (Quorum, Python, and Ruby) did. These results, including the specifics of syntax that are particularly problematic for novices, may help teachers of introductory programming courses in choosing appropriate first languages and in helping students to overcome the challenges they face with syntax.",

More specifically, the review covers the literature on programming misconceptions, the cognitive theory of mental models, constructivist theory of knowledge and learning, phenomenographic research on experiencing programming, and the theory of threshold concepts. These bodies of work are examined in relation to the concept of a “notional machine”—an abstract computer for executing programs of a particular kind. As a whole, the literature points to notional machines as a major challenge in introductory programming education. It is argued that instructors should acknowledge the notional machine as an explicit learning objective and address it in teaching. Teaching within some programming paradigms, such as object-oriented programming, may benefit from using multiple notional machines at different levels of abstraction. Pointers to some promising pedagogical techniques are provided.",

We have designed a labelling to classify the tools, and use Narciss’ feedback content categories to classify feedback messages. We report on the results of coding a total of 101 tools. We have found that feedback mostly focuses on identifying mistakes and less on fixing problems and taking a next step. Furthermore, teachers cannot easily adapt tools to their own needs.

In this article, we look at the transition from studying CS with the visual Scratch environment in middle school to studying CS with a professional textual programming language (C# or Java) in secondary school. We found that the programming knowledge and experience of students who had learned Scratch greatly facilitated learning the more advanced material in secondary school: less time was needed to learn new topics, there were fewer learning difficulties, and they achieved higher cognitive levels of understanding of most concepts (although at the end of the teaching process, there were no significant differences in achievements compared to students who had not studied Scratch). Furthermore, there was increased enrollment in CS classes, and students were observed to display higher levels of motivation and self-efficacy. This research justifies teaching CS in general and visual programming in particular in middle schools.",

    "abstract": "Practical programming competencies are critical to the success in computer science (CS) education and go-to-market of fresh graduates. Acquiring the required level of skills is a long journey of discovery, trial and error, and optimization seeking through a broad range of programming activities that learners must perform themselves. It is not reasonable to consider that teachers could evaluate all attempts that the average learner should develop multiplied by the number of students enrolled in a course, much less in a timely, deep, and fair fashion. Unsurprisingly, exploring the formal structure of programs to automate the assessment of certain features has long been a hot topic among CS education practitioners. Assessing a program is considerably more complex than asserting its functional correctness, as the proliferation of tools and techniques in the literature over the past decades indicates. Program efficiency, behavior, and readability, among many other features, assessed either statically or dynamically, are now also relevant for automatic evaluation. The outcome of an evaluation evolved from the primordial Boolean values to information about errors and tips on how to advance, possibly taking into account similar solutions. This work surveys the state of the art in the automated assessment of CS assignments, focusing on the supported types of exercises, security measures adopted, testing techniques used, type of feedback produced, and the information they offer the teacher to understand and optimize learning. A new era of automated assessment, capitalizing on static analysis techniques and containerization, has been identified. Furthermore, this review presents several other findings from the conducted review, discusses the current challenges of the field, and proposes some future research directions.",

In our investigation, we built a comprehensive corpus of papers on metacognition and self-regulation in programming education, and then employed backward snowballing to provide a deeper examination of foundational theories from outside computing education, some of which have been explored in programming education, and others that have yet to be but hold much promise. In addition, we make new observations about the way these theories are used by the computing education community, and present recommendations on how metacognition and self-regulation can help inform programming education in the future. In particular, we discuss exemplars of studies that have used existing theories to support their design and discussion of results as well as studies that have proposed their own metacognitive theories in the context of programming education. Readers will also find the article a useful resource for helping students in programming courses develop effective strategies for metacognition and self-regulation.",

We analysed 121 research papers from 2017 to 2021 inclusive and categorised them based on skills assessed, approach, language paradigm, degree of automation, and evaluation techniques. Most papers assess the correctness of assignments in object-oriented languages. Typically, these tools use a dynamic technique, primarily unit testing, to provide grades and feedback to the students or static analysis techniques to compare a submission with a reference solution or with a set of correct student submissions. However, these techniques’ feedback is often limited to whether the unit tests have passed or failed, the expected and actual output, or how they differ from the reference solution. Furthermore, few tools assess the maintainability, readability, or documentation of the source code, with most using static analysis techniques, such as code quality metrics, in conjunction with grading correctness. Additionally, we found that most tools offered fully automated assessment to allow for near-instantaneous feedback and multiple resubmissions, which can increase student satisfaction and provide them with more opportunities to succeed. In terms of techniques used to evaluate the tools’ performance, most papers primarily use student surveys or compare the automatic assessment tools to grades or feedback provided by human graders. However, because the evaluation dataset is frequently unavailable, it is more difficult to reproduce results and compare tools to a collection of common assignments.",

To examine the state of our field, we present a systematic literature review of papers in the Association for Computing Machinery computing education venues that describe teaching ethics in higher-education computing courses. Our review spans all papers published to SIGCSE, ICER, ITiCSE, CompEd, Koli Calling, and TOCE venues through 2022, with 100 papers fulfilling our inclusion criteria. Overall, we found a wide variety in content, teaching strategies, challenges, and recommendations. The majority of the papers did not articulate a conception of “ethics,” and those that did used many different conceptions, from broadly applicable ethical theories to social impact to specific computing application areas (e.g., data privacy and hacking). Instructors used many different pedagogical strategies (e.g., discussions, lectures, assignments) and formats (e.g., stand-alone courses, incorporated within a technical course). Many papers identified measuring student knowledge as a particular challenge, and 59% of papers included mention of assessments or grading. Of the 69% of papers that evaluated their ethics instruction, most used student self-report surveys, course evaluations, and instructor reflections. While many papers included calls for more ethics content in computing, specific recommendations were rarely broadly applicable, preventing a synthesis of guidelines. To continue building on the last 40 years of research and move toward a set of best practices for teaching ethics in computing, our community should delineate our varied conceptions of ethics, examine which teaching strategies are best suited for each, and explore how to measure student learning.",

    "abstract": "Research shows that the global society as organized today, with our current technological and economic system, is impossible to sustain. We are living in an era in which human activities in highly industrialized countries are responsible for overshooting several planetary boundaries, with poorer communities contributing the least to the problems but being impacted the most. At the same time, technical and economic gains fail to provide society at large with equal opportunities and improved quality of life. This article describes approaches taken in computing education to address the issue of sustainability. It presents results of a systematic review of the literature on sustainability in computing education. From a set of 572 publications extracted from six large digital libraries plus snowballing, we distilled and analyzed 89 relevant primary studies. Using an inductive and deductive thematic analysis, we study (i) conceptions of sustainability, computing, and education; (ii) implementations of sustainability in computing education; and (iii) research on sustainability in computing education. We present a framework capturing learning objectives and outcomes as well as pedagogical methods for sustainability in computing education. These results can be mapped to existing standards and curricula in future work. We find that only a few of the articles engage with the challenges as calling for drastic systemic change, along with radically new understandings of computing and education. We suggest that future work should connect to the substantial body of critical theory, such as feminist theories of science and technology. Existing research on sustainability in computing education may be considered rather immature, as the majority of articles are experience reports with limited empirical research.",

Unfortunately, we found that many AVs are of low quality, and coverage is skewed toward a few easier topics. This can make it hard for instructors to locate what they need. There are no effective repositories of AVs currently available, which puts many AVs at risk for being lost to the community over time. Thus, the field appears in need of improvement in disseminating materials, propagating known best practices, and informing developers about topic coverage.

    "abstract": "An educated citizenry that participates in and contributes to science technology engineering and mathematics innovation in the 21st century will require broad literacy and skills in computer science (CS). School systems will need to give increased attention to opportunities for students to engage in computational thinking and ways to promote a deeper understanding of how technologies and software are used as design tools. However, K-12 students in the United States are facing a broken pipeline for CS education. In response to this problem, we have developed the Scalable Game Design curriculum based on a strategy to integrate CS education into the regular school curriculum. This strategy includes opportunities for students to design and program games and science technology engineering and mathematics simulations. An approach called Computational Thinking Pattern Analysis has been developed to measure and correlate computational thinking skills relevant to game design and simulations. Results from a study with more than 10,000 students demonstrate rapid adoption of this curriculum by teachers from multiple disciplines, high student motivation, high levels of participation by women, and interest regardless of demographic background.",

    "abstract": "Teaching programming to beginners is a complex task. In this article, the effects of three factors—choice of programming language, problem-solving training, and the use of formative assessment—on learning to program were investigated. The study adopted an iterative methodological approach carried out across 4 consecutive years. To evaluate the effects of each factor (implemented as a single change in each iteration) on students’ learning performance, the study used quantitative, objective metrics. The findings revealed that using a syntactically simple language (Python) instead of a more complex one (Java) facilitated students’ learning of programming concepts. Moreover, teaching problem solving before programming yielded significant improvements in student performance. These two factors were found to have variable effects on the acquisition of basic programming concepts. Finally, it was observed that effective formative feedback in the context of introductory programming depends on multiple parameters. The article discusses the implications of these findings, identifies avenues for further research, and argues for the importance of studies in computer science education anchored on sound research methodologies to produce generalizable results.",

Following a survey of the history of computing ethics and the current need for ethical consideration within ML, we consider the current state of ML ethics education via an exploratory analysis of course syllabi in computing programs. The results reveal that though ethics is part of the overall educational landscape in these programs, it is not frequently a part of core technical ML courses. To help address this gap, we offer a preliminary framework, developed via a systematic literature review, of relevant ethics questions that should be addressed within an ML project. A pilot study with 85 students confirms that this framework helped them identify and articulate key ethical considerations within their ML projects. Building from this work, we also provide three example ML course modules that bring ethical thinking directly into learning core ML content. Collectively, this research demonstrates: (1) the need for ethics to be taught as integrated within ML coursework, (2) a structured set of questions useful for identifying and addressing potential issues within an ML project, and (3) novel course models that provide examples for how to practically teach ML ethics without sacrificing core course content. An additional by-product of this research is the collection and integration of recent publications in the emerging field of ML ethics education.",

However, few empirical studies evaluate the effectiveness of a robotics programming curriculum for developing computational thinking knowledge and skills. This study measures pre/post gains with new computational thinking assessments given to middle school students who participated in a virtual robotics programming curriculum. Overall, participation in the virtual robotics curriculum was related to significant gains in pre- to posttest scores, with larger gains for students who made further progress through the curriculum. The success of this intervention suggests that participation in a scaffolded programming curriculum, within the context of virtual robotics, supports the development of generalizable computational thinking knowledge and skills that are associated with increased problem-solving performance on nonrobotics computing tasks. Furthermore, the particular units that students engage in may determine their level of growth in these competencies.",

    "abstract": "There is an acknowledged need for teaching realistic software development in project courses. The design space for such courses is wide, ranging from single-semester to two-semester courses, from single-client to multicustomer courses, from local to globally distributed courses, and from toy projects to projects with real clients. The challenge for a nontrivial project course is how to make the project complex enough to enrich students’ software engineering experience, yet realistic enough to have a teaching environment that does not unduly burden students or the instructor. We describe a methodology for project courses that is realizable for instructors, improves students’ skills, and leads to viable results for industry partners. In particular, recent advances in release management and collaboration workflows reduce the effort of students and instructors during delivery and increase the quality of the deliverables. To enable release and feedback management, we introduce Rugby, an agile process model based on Scrum that allows reacting to changing requirements. To improve early communication, we use Tornado, a scenario-based design approach that emphasizes the use of informal models for the interaction between clients and students. The combination of Rugby and Tornado allows students to deal with changing requirements, produce multiple releases, and obtain client feedback through the duration of the course. We describe our experience with more than 300 students working on 40 projects with external clients over a 4-year period. In the latest instance of our course, the students have produced more than 7000 builds with 600 releases for eleven clients. In an evaluation of the courses, we found that the introduction of Rugby and Tornado significantly increased students’ technical skills, especially with respect to software engineering, usability engineering, and configuration management, as well as their nontechnical skills such as communication with the client, teamwork, presentation, and demo management. Finally, we discuss how other instructors can adapt the course concept.",

However the influences of perceived self-efficacy and social support appear to differ for men and women: while low self-efficacy is tied to less social support for males, we see no similar tendency for females. In fact many females who report themselves as low in self-efficacy consider themselves to have high social support among their peers.

In order to address these difficulties, a series of learning activities called Computer Science Unplugged was developed by Tim Bell and his colleagues. These activities expose young people to central concepts in CS in an entertaining way without requiring a computer. The CS Unplugged activities have become more and more popular among CS educators and several activities are recommended in the ACM K-12 curriculum for elementary schools. CS Unplugged is used worldwide and has been translated into many languages. We examined the effect of the CS Unplugged activities on middle-school students’ ideas about CS and their desire to consider and study it in high school. The results indicate that following the activities the ideas of the students on what CS is about were partially improved, but their desire to study CS lessened. In order to provide possible explanations to these results, we analyzed the CS Unplugged activities to determine to what extent the objectives of CS Unplugged were addressed in the activities. In addition, we checked whether the activities were designed according to constructivist principles and whether they were explicitly linked to central concepts in CS. We found that only some of the objectives were addressed in the activities, that the activities do not engage with the students’ prior knowledge and that most of the activities are not explicitly linked to central concepts in CS. We offer suggestions for modifying the CS Unplugged activities so that they will be more likely to achieve their objectives.",

The author chose to use this robot and study its motivational effects on non-computer science students in a CS0 course. The purpose of this study was to determine whether using the IPRE robots motivates students to learn programming in a CS0 course. After considering various motivational theories and instruments designed to measure motivation, the author used Keller’s Instructional Materials Motivation Survey to measure four components of motivation: attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction. Additional items were added to the survey, including a set of open-ended questions. The results of this study indicate that the use of these robots had a positive influence on participants’ attitudes towards learning to program in a CS0 course, but little or no effect on relevance, confidence, or satisfaction. Results also indicate that although gender and students interests may affect individual components of motivation, gender, technical self-perception, and interest in software development have no bearing on the overall motivational levels of students.",

The research presented here developed an instrument to assess student learning of fundamental and object-oriented programming concepts, then used that instrument to investigate the impact of different teaching approaches and languages on university students’ ability to learn those concepts. Extensive data analysis showed that the instrument performed well overall. Reliability of the assessment tool was statistically satisfactory and content validity was supported by intrinsic characteristics, question response analysis, and expert review. Preliminary support for construct validity was provided through exploratory factor analysis. Three components that at least partly represented the construct “understanding of fundamental programming concepts” were identified: methods and functions, mathematical and logical expressions, and control structures. Analysis revealed significant differences in student performance based on instructional language and approach. The analyses showed differences on the overall score and questions involving assignment, mathematical and logical expressions, and code completion. Instructional language and approach did not appear to affect student performance on questions addressing object-oriented concepts.",

For this purpose, the article format was kept as large as possible, enabling the authors to explain many facets of their concepts and experiences in detail.

This model could serve as a unifying framework that might provide a proper structure for a well-founded critical discussion about the future of K-12 CSE. Curriculum designers or policy stakeholders, who have to decide, which approach an upcoming national initiative should follow, could benefit from this discussion as well as researchers who are investigating K12 CSE in any regard. With this goal in mind, we have selected six extensive and two short case studies from the UK, New Zealand, USA/Israel, France, Sweden, Georgia (USA), Russia, and Italy that provide an in-depth analysis of K-12 CSE in their respective country or state.",

    "abstract": "Context: Programming courses are compulsory for most engineering degrees, but students’ performance on these courses is often not as good as expected. Programming is difficult for students to learn, given that it includes a lot of new, complex, and abstract topics. All of this has led experts to the conclusion that new teaching techniques are required if students are to be motivated and engaged in learning on programming courses. Gamification has come to be an effective technique in education in general, and is especially useful in programming courses. This motivated us to develop an open source gamified platform, called UDPiler, for use in a programming course. Objective: The main goal of this article is to obtain empirical evidence on the improvement of students’ learning performance when using UDPiler in comparison to a non-gamified compiler. Method: A quasi-experiment was performed with two groups of first-year engineering students at Diego Portales University in Chile, using a non-gamified compiler and a gamified platform, respectively. Results: The results reveal that the students obtained better marks when the gamified platform was used to learn C programming. In addition, there is statistical significance in favor of there being a positive effect on the learning performance of those students who used the gamified platform. Conclusions: The results allow us to conclude that gamification is an encouraging approach with which to teach C programming, a finding that is aligned with previous empirical studies concerning gamification on programming courses, carried out in academic contexts. Nonetheless, we are aware that further validation is also required to corroborate and strengthen the findings obtained and to investigate whether the kind of gamified elements (mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics) used have any influence on students’ performance, among other issues that deserve further investigation and that are explained throughout this article.",

The high-school computer science curriculum has been in place for more than 20 years and is offered in all schools as an elective similar to biology, chemistry, and physics. The picture in the United States is more complex and therefore less amenable to generalization. Because educational policy is set at the state and sometimes even at the school district level, access to computer science courses and the content of those courses can vary even for schools within the same district.

    "abstract": "Teachers deal with plagiarism on a regular basis, so they try to prevent and detect plagiarism, a task that is complicated by the large size of some classes. Students who cheat often try to hide their plagiarism (obfuscate), and many different similarity detection engines (often called plagiarism detection tools) have been built to help teachers. This article focuses only on plagiarism detection and presents a detailed systematic review of the field of source-code plagiarism detection in academia. This review gives an overview of definitions of plagiarism, plagiarism detection tools, comparison metrics, obfuscation methods, datasets used for comparison, and algorithm types. Perspectives on the meaning of source-code plagiarism detection in academia are presented, together with categorisations of the available detection tools and analyses of their effectiveness. While writing the review, some interesting insights have been found about metrics and datasets for quantitative tool comparison and categorisation of detection algorithms. Also, existing obfuscation methods classifications have been expanded together with a new definition of “source-code plagiarism detection in academia.”",

    "abstract": "Teaching is the process of conveying knowledge and skills to learners. It involves preventing misunderstandings or correcting misconceptions that learners have acquired. Thus, effective teaching relies on solid knowledge of the discipline, but also a good grasp of where learners are likely to trip up or misunderstand. In programming, there is much opportunity for misunderstanding, and the penalties are harsh: failing to produce the correct syntax for a program, for example, can completely prevent any progress in learning how to program. Because programming is inherently computer-based, we have an opportunity to automatically observe programming behaviour -- more closely even than an educator in the room at the time. By observing students’ programming behaviour, and surveying educators, we can ask: do educators have an accurate understanding of the mistakes that students are likely to make? In this study, we combined two years of the Blackbox dataset (with more than 900 thousand users and almost 100 million compilation events) with a survey of 76 educators to investigate which mistakes students make while learning to program Java, and whether the educators could make an accurate estimate of which mistakes were most common. We find that educators’ estimates do not agree with one another or the student data, and discuss the implications of these results.",

Yet, as curricula and professional development opportunities are developed, key questions remain about what “works” for engaging youth in CS education, especially those who are historically underrepresented in the field (including young women, students of color, low-income students). In response, this study answers the questions: What teaching practices do students—who are historically underrepresented in CS—believe are most effective for engaging their interest in CS learning? What pedagogical actions do CS teachers identify as most effective for engaging students? And what do these engaging teaching practices look like in the classroom? Through a qualitative study following three different urban high school Exploring Computer Science classrooms over an entire school year (n = 70 students, 3 teachers; &gt;105h of observation data; &gt;50 interviews with students and teachers), key pedagogical practices that had greatest impact on youth's interest and engagement with CS included: (1) demystifying CS by showing its connections to everyday life; (2) addressing social issues impacting both CS and students’ communities; and (3) valuing students’ voices and perspectives. This article shares testimonies from students and teachers, as well as examples of these teaching practices in the classroom.",

    "abstract": "Gamification is the use of game elements in domains other than games. Gamification use is often suggested for difficult activities because it enhances users’ engagement and motivation level. Due to such benefits, the use of gamification is also proposed in education environments to improve students’ performance, engagement, and satisfaction. Computer science in higher education is a tough area of study and thus needs to utilize various already explored benefits of gamification. This research develops an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification in teaching computer science in higher education. Along with the learning outcomes, the effect of group size on students’ satisfaction level is also measured. Furthermore, the impact of gamification over time is analyzed throughout a semester to observe its effectiveness as a long-term learning technique. The analysis, covering both learning outcome and students’ satisfaction, suggests that gamification is an effective tool to teach tough courses at higher education level; however, group size should be taken into account for optimal classroom size and better learning experience.",

    "abstract": "Computer science (CS) has been identified as one of the fastest-growing professions, with demand for CS professionals far outpacing the supply of CS graduates. The necessity for a trained CS workforce has compelled industry and academia to evaluate strategies for broadening participation in CS. The current literature in CS education emphasizes the importance of social relationships and supports for individuals from underrepresented groups. Unfortunately, this literature has largely been limited to either the exploration of issues of women or that of underrepresented racial/ethnic groups. These limited views generalize characteristics of specific underrepresented groups without considering intersections between these groups. This quantitative study ( n = 3,206) addressed that shortcoming by leveraging inferential statistical methods to examine (i) the similarities and differences between the social CS-related experiences of Black women, Black men, and non-Black women in the United States; (ii) the relationship between these experiences and CS career choices; and (iii) the activities during which significant social experiences might occur. The results indicate that Black women's social experiences are often different from the experiences of both Black men and non-Black women. In particular, both Black men and non-Black women had more CS friends than Black women, whereas having these friends was more significant for the CS career choice for Black women. Introductions to CS in school, before college, were negatively related to career choice for all groups, whereas home support was positive for both Black women and men. This work suggests that considering intersectionality is important to understanding the needs of different individuals, as well as the importance of social supports for persistence in CS.",

    "abstract": "This paper expands on knowledge of computing identity by building on what is known about prior identity models in science and mathematics education. The model theorizes three primary sub-constructs that contribute to the development of a computing identity: belief in one's performance/competence, interest, and recognition in computing. Drawing on data from a nationally representative survey of more than 1,700 college students at 22 colleges and universities, the study tested the alignment of the theorized model to the measures on the survey. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was used to validate whether the appropriate measures loaded on the three separate sub-constructs. Criterion-related validity was also established by testing whether the computing identity measures predicted the choice of a computer science career. The results reveal that a computing identity proxy based on the theorized measures was a highly significant predictor of students' computer science and information technology career choice (p &lt; 0.0001). In addition, this work also established criterion-related validity by showing gender differences that had been found by prior work in computing. Finally, the theorized measures were found to be reliable and internally consistent. The educational understanding of computing identities may provide an important tool to help researchers and practitioners improve student persistence in computer science.",

    "abstract": "Despite the increasing number of women receiving bachelor’s degrees in computing (i.e., Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Information Technology, etc.), a closer look reveals that the percentage of Black women in computing has significantly dropped in recent years, highlighting the underrepresentation of Black women and its negative impact on broadening participation in the field of computing. The literature reveals that several K-16 interventions have been designed to increase the representation of Black women and girls in computing. Despite these best efforts, the needle seems to have barely moved in increasing the representation or the retention of Black women in computing. Instead, the primary goals have been to recruit and retain women in the CS pipeline using gender-focused efforts intended to increase the number of women who also identify as members of racialized groups. However, these gender-focused efforts have fallen short of increasing the number of Black women in computing because they fail to acknowledge or appreciate how intersectionality (the overlapping social constructs of gender, race, ethnicity, class, etc.) has shaped the lived experiences of Black women navigating the computing pipeline. Without honest dialogue about how power operates in the field of computing, the push for racial equality and social justice in CS education remains an elusive goal. Leveraging intersectionality as a critical framework to address systemic oppression (i.e., racism, gender discrimination, power, and privilege), we interview 24 Black women in different phases of the computing pipeline about their experiences navigating the field of computing. An intersectional analysis of Black women’s experiences reveals that CS education consists of saturated sites of violence in which interconnected systems of power converge to enact oppression. Findings reveal three primary saturated sites of violence within CS education: (1) traditional K-12 classrooms; (2) predominantly White institutions; and (3) internships as supplementary learning experiences. We conclude the article with implications for how the field of CS education can begin to address racial inequality that negatively impacts Black girls and women, thus contributing to a more equitable and socially just field of study that benefits all students.",

    "abstract": "With the immense interest in ChatGPT worldwide, education has seen a mix of both excitement and skepticism. To properly evaluate its impact on education, it is crucial to understand how far it can help students without prior knowledge answer assessment questions. This study aims to address this question as well as the impact of the question type. We conducted multiple experiments with computer engineering students (experiment group: n =41 to 56), who were asked to use ChatGPT to answer previous test questions before learning about the related topics. Their scores were then compared with the scores of previous-term students who answered the same questions in a quiz or exam setting (control group: n =24 to 61). The results showed a wide range of effect sizes, from -2.55 to 1.23, depending on the question type and content. The experiment group performed best answering code analysis and conceptual questions but struggled with code completion and questions that involved images. However, the performance in code generation tasks was inconsistent. Overall, the ChatGPT group’s answers lagged slightly behind the control group’s answers with an effect size of -0.16. We conclude that ChatGPT, at least in the field of this study, is not yet ready to rely on by students who do not have sufficient background to evaluate generated answers. We suggest that educators try using ChatGPT and educate students on effective questioning techniques and how to assess the generated responses. This study provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in education and informs future research and development.",

GaComputes’ interventions were multi-faceted and broad: summer camps and after-school/weekend programs for 4th--12th grade students, professional development for secondary teachers, and professional development for post-secondary instructors faculty. All of the efforts were carefully evaluated by an external team (led by the third and fourth authors), which provides us with an unusually detailed view into a computing education intervention across a region (about 59K square miles, about 9.9 million residents). Our dataset includes evaluations from over 2,000 students who attended after-school or weekend workshops, over 500 secondary school teachers who attended professional development, 120 post-secondary teachers who attended professional development, and over 2,000 students who attended a summer day (non-residential) camp. GaComputes evaluations provide insight into details of interventions and into influences on student motivation and learning. In this article, we describe the results of these evaluations and describe how GaComputes broadened participation in computing in Georgia through both direct interventions and indirect support of other projects.",

PI lectures present students with a series of multiple-choice questions, which they respond to both individually and in groups. PI has been widely successful in the physical sciences and, recently, has been successfully adopted by computer science instructors in lower-division, introductory courses. In this work, we challenge readers to consider PI for their upper-division courses as well. We present a PI curriculum for two upper-division computer science courses: Computer Architecture and Theory of Computation. These courses exemplify several perceived challenges to the adoption of PI in upper-division courses, including: exploration of abstract ideas, development of high-level judgment of engineering design trade-offs, and exercising advanced mathematical sophistication. This work includes selected course materials illustrating how these challenges are overcome, learning gains results comparing these upper-division courses with previous lower-division results in the literature, student attitudinal survey results (N = 501), and pragmatic advice to prospective developers and adopters. We present three main findings. First, we find that these upper-division courses achieved student learning gains equivalent to those reported in successful lower-division computing courses. Second, we find that student feedback for each class was overwhelmingly positive, with 88% of students recommending PI for use in other computer science classes. Third, we find that instructors adopting the materials introduced here were able to replicate the outcomes of the instructors who developed the materials in terms of student learning gains and student feedback.",

Inspired by the code inspection process used in the software industry, a PCR is a collaborative activity in which a small team of students, led by a trained moderator: (a) walk through segments of each other's programming solutions, (b) check the code against a list of best coding practices, and (c) discuss and log issues that arise. To evaluate the viability and effectiveness of this approach, we conducted a series of four mixed-method empirical studies of various implementations of PCRs in CS1 courses at Washington State University. The first study validated the viability of the PCR activity. Using a quasi-experimental design, the final three studies evaluated two alternative implementations of PCRs— face-to-face and online .

Informed by past literature and based on our empirical work examining a dataset from the use of the Fairy Assessment in the Alice programming environment in middle schools, we present a framework that formalizes a process where a hypothesis-driven approach informed by Evidence-Centered Design effectively complements data-driven learning analytics in interpreting students’ programming process and assessing CT in block-based programming environments.

    "abstract": "This article describes the use of fractal simulations of African design in a high school computing class. Fractal patterns---repetitions of shape at multiple scales---are a common feature in many aspects of African design. In African architecture we often see circular houses grouped in circular complexes, or rectangular houses in rectangular complexes. Typically the accompanying ceremonies, cosmologies, and other traditions make use of scaling and recursion in their conceptual models. African scaling designs include textiles, sculpture, adornment, and other forms; in many cases there are explicit geometric algorithms and other formal aspects (e.g., pseudorandom number generation in divination systems) embedded in the associated indigenous knowledge system. Thus African fractals provide a strong counter to stereotypes of African culture as primitive or simplistic. Following this fieldwork, we developed a Web site which uses Java simulations of these African designs to teach computational perspectives on fractals to high school students. 1 We hypothesized that this combination of anti-primitivist “ethnocomputing” and design-based creative learning would enhance both the engagement and performance of under-represented students in computing. A quasi-experimental study used two 10th grade computing classes, both taught by the same instructor, and both including more than 50% under-represented students (Latino and African American). The control class received six days of instruction using a popular Web site (with Java applets but no cultural content or design activities) for high school fractal lessons; the experimental class received the same amount of instruction using our Web site. Pre/post differences on both achievement and attitude tests indicate statistically significant improvement for the students in the experimental class. Potential implications for improving participation and achievement of under-represented students in computing education are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Providing students with the professional, communication, and technical skills necessary to contribute to an ongoing software project is critical, yet often difficult in higher education. Involving student teams in real-world projects developed by professional software engineers for actual users is invaluable. Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) has emerged as an important approach to creating, managing, and distributing software products. Involvement in a FOSS project provides students with experience developing within a professional environment, with a professional community, and has the additional benefit that all communication and artifacts are publicly accessible. Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software (HFOSS) projects benefit the human condition in some manner. They can range from disaster management to microfinance to election-monitoring applications. This article discusses the benefits and challenges of students participating in HFOSS projects within the context of undergraduate computing degree programs. This article reports on a 6-year study of students' self-reported attitudes and learning from participation in an HFOSS project. Results indicate that working on an HFOSS project increases interest in computing. In addition, students perceive that they are gaining experience in developing software in a distributed environment with the attendant skills of communication, distributed teamwork, and more.",

In both studies, we developed statistical measures derived from our data that significantly correlate with students’ course grades. Encouraged both by social theories of learning and a desire to improve the accuracy of our statistical models, we explore here the impact of incorporating our predictive measure derived from social behavior into three separate predictive measures derived from programming behaviors. We find that, in combining the measures, we are able to improve the overall predictive power of each measure. This finding affirms the importance of social interaction in the learning process, and provides evidence that predictive models derived from multiple sources of learning process data can provide significantly better predictive power by accounting for multiple factors responsible for student success.",

This identification must be performed early enough in the term to allow instructors to assist those students before they fall irreparably behind. This study describes a modeling methodology that predicts student final exam scores in the third week of the term by using the clicker data that is automatically collected for instructors when they employ the Peer Instruction pedagogy. The modeling technique uses a support vector machine binary classifier, trained on one term of a course, to predict outcomes in the subsequent term. We applied this modeling technique to five different courses across the computer science curriculum, taught by three different instructors at two different institutions. Our modeling approach includes a set of strengths not seen wholesale in prior work, while maintaining competitive levels of accuracy with that work. These strengths include using a lightweight source of student data, affording early detection of struggling students, and predicting outcomes across terms in a natural setting (different final exams, minor changes to course content), across multiple courses in a curriculum, and across multiple institutions.",

It then draws on research about design processes in engineering and creative practice to motivate a set of learning objectives for students who wish to design new creative artifacts with machine learning. The article then draws on education research and knowledge of creative computing practices to propose a set of teaching strategies that can be used to support creative computing students in achieving these objectives. Explanations of these strategies are accompanied by concrete descriptions of how they have been employed to develop new lectures and activities, and to design new experiential learning and scaffolding technologies, for teaching some of the first courses in the world focused on teaching machine learning to creative practitioners. The article subsequently draws on data collected from these courses—an online course as well as undergraduate and masters-level courses taught at a university—to begin to understand how this curriculum supported student learning, to understand learners’ challenges and mistakes, and to inform future teaching and research.",

Efforts to understand this phenomenon have considered a wide range of predictors of CS success, such as prior programming experience, math ability, learning style, and gender, with findings that are suggestive but inconclusive. The current quasiexperimental study extends this research by exploring how the pedagogical approach of the course (traditional lecture vs. Peer Instruction (PI) and clickers) in combination with student achievement goals (mastery goals vs. performance goals) relates to exam grades, interest in the subject matter, and course enjoyment. The research revealed that students with performance goals scored significantly lower on final exams in both the lecture and PI conditions. However, students with performance goals reported higher levels of subject matter interest when taught through PI. Students with mastery goals, in both conditions, scored significantly higher on the final exam, had higher levels of interest, and reported higher levels of course enjoyment than their performance-oriented counterparts. The results suggest that PI may improve the level of subject-matter interest for some students, thereby indicating the importance of studying pedagogical approach as we seek to understand student outcomes in CS1.",

There are many tangible hardware platforms for introducing computer programming to children, but there is limited comparative evaluation of them in the context of a formal classroom. In this work, we explore the benefits of learning to code for tangible computers, such as robots and wearable computers, in comparison to programming for the desktop computer. For this purpose, 36 students participated in a within-groups study that involved three types of target computer platform tangibility: (1) desktop, (2) wearable, and (3) robotic. We employed similar blocks-based visual programming environments, and we measured emotional engagement, attitudes, and computer programming performance. We found that students were more engaged by and had a higher intention of learning programming with the robotic rather than the desktop computer. Furthermore, tangible computing platforms, either robot or wearable, did not affect the students’ performance in learning basic computational concepts (e.g., sequence, repeat, and decision). Our findings suggest that computer programming should be introduced through multiple target platforms (e.g., robots, smartphones, wearables) to engage children.",

    "abstract": "The types of programming errors that novice programmers make and struggle to resolve have long been of interest to researchers. Various past studies have analyzed the frequency of compiler diagnostic messages. This information, however, does not have a direct correlation to the types of errors students make, due to the inaccuracy and imprecision of diagnostic messages. Furthermore, few attempts have been made to determine the severity of different kinds of errors in terms other than frequency of occurrence. Previously, we developed a method for meaningful categorization of errors, and produced a frequency distribution of these error categories; in this article, we extend the previous method to also make a determination of error difficulty, in order to give a better measurement of the overall severity of different kinds of errors. An error category hierarchy was developed and validated, and errors in snapshots of students source code were categorized accordingly. The result is a frequency table of logical error categories rather than diagnostic messages. Resolution time for each of the analyzed errors was calculated, and the average resolution time for each category of error was determined; this defines an error difficulty score. The combination of frequency and difficulty allow us to identify the types of error that are most problematic for novice programmers. The results show that ranking errors by severity—a product of frequency and difficulty—yields a significantly different ordering than ranking them by frequency alone, indicating that error frequency by itself may not be a suitable indicator for which errors are actually the most problematic for students.",

This article describes a meta-synthesis of research on children designing and programming computer games that investigates the extent to which there is evidence of benefits for computer science learning and motivation. Over 400 articles were identified, and 68 articles met the inclusion criteria. A systematic analysis and synthesis across studies showed some evidence that computer game design and programming can lead to changes in programming knowledge, problem solving, and computer science attitudes and confidence. However, most of the evidence described engagement in computing-related practices and did not measure learning. The findings were mostly positive, although several studies noted more negative attitudes toward programming after making games. The results were similar across different pedagogical approaches, although social interaction may provide unique opportunities for computer science learning. The synthesis resulted in a list of design elements for studying computer game design and programming activities; these can be used to increase the availability of evidence about learning.

    "abstract": "Global protests and civil unrest in 2020 has renewed the world’s interest in addressing injustice due to structural racism and oppression toward Black and Latinx people in all aspects of society, including computing. In this article, we argue that to address and repair the harm created by institutions, policies, and practices that have systematically excluded Black and Latina girls from computer science, an intersectional, transformative justice approach must be taken. Leveraging testimonial authority, we share our past 8 years of experience designing, implementing, and studying Digital Youth Divas, a programmatic and systemic approach to encouraging middle school Black and Latina girls to participate in STEM. Specifically, we propose three principles to counter structural racism and oppression embedded in society and computing education: computing education must (1) address local histories of injustice by engaging community members; (2) counter negative stereotypes perpetuated in computer science by creating inclusive safe spaces and counter-narratives; and (3) build sustainable, computational capacity in communities. To illustrate each principle, we provide specific examples of the harm created by racist policies and systems and their effect on a specific community. We then describe our attempt to create counter structures and the subsequent outcomes for the girls, their families, and the community. This work contributes a framework for STEM and computing educators to integrate transformative justice as a method of repairing the harm that both society and the field of computing has and continues to cause Black and Latinx communities. We charge policy makers, educators, researchers, and community leaders to examine histories of oppression in their communities and to adopt holistic, transformative approaches that counter structural oppression at the individual and system level.",

    "abstract": "Peer review is the standard process within academia for maintaining publication quality, but it is also widely employed in other settings, such as education and industry, for improving work quality and for generating actionable feedback to content authors. For example, in the software industry peer review of program source code—or peer code review—is a key technique for detecting bugs and maintaining coding standards. In a programming education context, although peer code review offers potential benefits to both code reviewers and code authors, individuals are typically less experienced, which presents a number of challenges. Some of these challenges are similar to those reported in the educational literature on peer review in other academic disciplines, but reviewing code presents unique difficulties. Better understanding these challenges and the conditions under which code review can be taught and implemented successfully in computer science courses is of value to the computing education community. In this work, we conduct a systematic review of the literature on peer code review in higher education to examine instructor motivations for conducting peer code review activities, how such activities have been implemented in practice, and the primary benefits and difficulties that have been reported. We initially identified 187 potential studies and analyzed 51 empirical studies pertinent to our goals. We report the most commonly cited benefits (e.g., the development of programming-related skills) and barriers (e.g., low student engagement), and we identify a wide variety of tools that have been used to facilitate the peer code review process. While we argue that more empirical work is needed to validate currently reported results related to learning outcomes, there is also a clear need to address the challenges around student motivation, which we believe could be an important avenue for future research.",

    "abstract": "Although computing occupations have some of the greatest projected growth rates, there remains a deficit of graduates in these fields. The struggle to engage enough students to meet demands is particularly pronounced for groups already underrepresented in computing, specifically, individuals that self-identify as a woman, or as Black, Hispanic/Latinx, or Native American. Prior studies have begun to examine issues surrounding engagement and retention, but more understanding is needed to close the gap, and to broaden participation. In this research, we provide quantitative evidence from the Multiple-Institution Database for Investigating Engineering Longitudinal Development—a longitudinal, multi-institutional database to describe participation trends of marginalized groups in computer science. Using descriptive statistics, we present the enrollment and graduation rates for those situated at the intersection of race/ethnicity and gender between 1987 and 2018. In this work, we observed periods of significant flux for Black men and women, and White women in particular, and consistently low participation of Hispanic/Latinx and Native American men and women, and Asian women. To provide framing for the evident peaks and valleys in participation, we applied historical context analysis to describe the political, economic, and social factors and events that may have impacted each group. These results put a spotlight on populations largely overlooked in statistical work and have the potential to inform educators, administrators, and researchers about how enrollments and graduation rates have changed over time in computing fields. In addition, they offer insight into potential causes for the vicissitudes, to encourage more equal access for all students going forward.",

However, the history and evolution of the emerging research topic, the milestone publications that have shaped its directions, and the timeline of the important developments may be better told through a quantitative, scientometric narrative. This article presents a bibliometric analysis of the drivers of the CT topic, as well as its main themes of research, international collaborations, influential authors, and seminal publications, and how authors and publications have influenced one another. The metadata of 1,874 documents were retrieved from the Scopus database using the keyword “computational thinking.” The results show that CT research has been US-centric from the start, and continues to be dominated by US researchers both in volume and impact. International collaboration is relatively low, but clusters of joint research are found between, for example, a number of Nordic countries, lusophone- and hispanophone countries, and central European countries. The results show that CT features the computing’s traditional tripartite disciplinary structure (design, modeling, and theory), a distinct emphasis on programming, and a strong pedagogical and educational backdrop including constructionism, self-efficacy, motivation, and teacher training.",

We find that the most common reason to cite CLT is to mention it briefly as a design influence; authors predominantly cite old versions of the theory; hypotheses phrased in terms of cognitive load components are rare; and only a small selection of cognitive load measures have been applied, sparsely. Overall, the theory’s evolution and recent themes in CLT appear to have had limited impact on CER so far. We recommend that studies in CER explain which version of the theory they use and why; clearly distinguish between load components (e.g., intrinsic and extraneous load); phrase hypotheses in terms of load components a priori ; look further into validating different measures of cognitive load; accompany cognitive load measures with complementary constructs, such as motivation; and explore themes such as collaborative CLT and individual differences in working-memory capacity.",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, innovations powered by artificial intelligence (AI) have extended into nearly all facets of human experience. Our ethnographic research suggests that while young people sense they can't “trust” AI, many are not sure how it works or how much control they have over its growing role in their lives. In this study, we attempt to answer the following questions: (1) What can we learn about young people's understanding of AI when they produce media with and about it? and (2) What are the design features of an ethics-centered pedagogy that promotes STEM engagement via AI? To answer these questions, we co-developed and documented three projects at YR Media, a national network of youth journalists and artists who create multimedia for public distribution. Participants are predominantly youth of color and those contending with economic and other barriers to full participation in STEM fields. Findings showed that by creating a learning ecology that centered the cultures and experiences of its learners while leveraging familiar tools for critical analysis, youth deepened their understanding of AI. Our study also showed that providing opportunities for youth to produce ethics-centered interactive stories interrogating invisibilized AI functionalities, and to release those stories to the public, empowered them to creatively express their understandings and apprehensions about AI.",

    "abstract": "Cheating has been a long-standing issue in university assessments. However, the release of ChatGPT and other free-to-use generative AI tools has provided a new and distinct method for cheating. Students can run many assessment questions through the tool and generate a superficially compelling answer, which may or may not be accurate. We ran a dual-anonymous “quality assurance” marking exercise across four end-of-module assessments across a distance university computer science (CS) curriculum. Each marker received five ChatGPT-generated scripts alongside 10 student scripts. A total of 90 scripts were marked; every ChatGPT-generated script for the undergraduate modules received at least a passing grade (&gt;40%), with all of the introductory module CS1 scripts receiving a distinction (&gt;85%). None of the ChatGPT-taught postgraduate scripts received a passing grade (&gt;50%). We also present the results of interviewing the markers and of running our sample scripts through a GPT-2 detector and the TurnItIn AI detector, which both identified every ChatGPT-generated script but differed in the number of false positives. As such, we contribute a baseline understanding of how the public release of generative AI is likely to significantly impact quality assurance processes. Our analysis demonstrates that in most cases, across a range of question formats, topics, and study levels, ChatGPT is at least capable of producing adequate answers for undergraduate assessment.",

    "abstract": "It has been estimated that more than two million students started computing studies in 1999 and 650,000 of them either dropped or failed their first programming course. For the individual student, dropping such a course can distract from the completion of later courses in a computing curriculum and may even result in changing their course of study to a curriculum without programming. In this article, we report on how we set out to rehabilitate a troubled first programming course, one for which the dropout statistic and repercussion was evident. The five-year longitudinal case study described in this article began by systematically tracking the pass rate of a first programming course, its throughput, as proposed by the Theory of Constraints. The analyses of these data indicated three main problems in the course: programming discipline difficulty, course arrangement complexity, and limited student motivation. The motivation problem was approached from the Two-Factor Theory point of view. It investigated those factors that led to dissatisfaction among the students, the hygiene factors, and those factors that led to satisfaction, the intrinsic and extrinsic motivators. The course arrangement complexity was found to be a hygiene factor, while the lack of extrinsic and intrinsic motivators contributed to the high dropout rates. The course improvement efforts made no attempt to change the inherent characteristics of the programming discipline, but introduced holistic changes in the course arrangements over a five-year period, from 2005 to 2009, to eliminate the hygiene factors and to increase motivational aspects of the course. This systems approach to course improvement resulted in an increase in the pass rate, from 44% prior to the changes to 68% thereafter, and the overall course atmosphere turned positive. This paper reports on the detailed changes that were made and the improvements that were achieved over this five-year period.",

The robotics programming tools and materials used in the workshops are designed with an accessibility focus for participants with different degrees of vision. Through the use of available assistive technology and open source software, robotics is accessible to the visually impaired. The quantitative and qualitative results from three robotics workshops conducted during the past three years will be discussed, including some initial long-term results. Strategies, based on our experiences, will also be shared to promote accessible outreach. While many of the participants are in middle and early high school, findings indicate that participant interest in computing is high regardless of whether their schools offer computer science courses or not.

Findings suggest that students’ games exhibited a range of GCS: programs composed of sequences of simple programming constructs; programs composed of programming constructs, some of which are used to implement higher-order patterns; and programs composed of game mechanics built from combinations of patterns “glued” together with simple programming constructs. We use case studies of students’ games to illustrate how variation in the use and integration of programming constructs, patterns, and game mechanics can be used to demonstrate evidence of CL. The study contributes to an understanding of what CL looks like in middle school, how to assess it, and how game-programming activities might promote CL.",

Teaching the topic of functional programming was found to be troublesome using a traditional lectured course format. The need to increase students’ amount of practice emerged while subsequent challenges relating to students’ independent practical coursework were observed. Particular concerns relating to group work, learning materials, and the attribute of flexibility were investigated during the third action research cycle. The research cycle was analyzed using a qualitative survey on students’ views, teacher narrative, and students’ study activity data. By this third research cycle, we found that (i) the “call for explanation” is an apt conceptualization for supporting independent work, and in particular for the design of learning materials; (ii) use of student-selected groups that can be flexibly resized or even disbanded enables spontaneous peer support and can avoid frustration about group work; and (iii) students greatly appreciate the high degree of flexibility in the course arrangements but find that it causes them to slip from their goals. The project has improved our understanding of a successful implementation of the target course based on group work and learning materials in the context of independent study, while the attribute of flexibility revealed a contradiction that indicates the need for further action.",

This has led to increased interest in the field of learning analytics , which is concerned with leveraging learning process data in order to better understand, and ultimately to improve, teaching and learning. In computing education, the logical place to collect learning process data is through integrated development environments (IDEs), where computing students typically spend large amounts of time working on programming assignments. While the primary purpose of IDEs is to support computer programming, they might also be used as a mechanism for delivering learning interventions designed to enhance student learning. The possibility of using IDEs both to collect learning process data, and to strategically intervene in the learning process, suggests an exciting design space for computing education research: that of IDE-based learning analytics . In order to facilitate the systematic exploration of this design space, we present an IDE-based data analytics process model with four primary activities: (1) Collect data, (2) Analyze data, (3) Design intervention, and (4) Deliver intervention . For each activity, we identify key design dimensions and review relevant computing education literature. To provide guidance on designing effective interventions, we describe four relevant learning theories, and consider their implications for design. Based on our review, we present a call-to-action for future research into IDE-based learning analytics.",

However, machine-learning education research is nascent, and research on this subject for non-majors thus far has only focused on curricula and courseware. We interviewed 10 instructors of ML courses for non-majors, inquiring as to what their students find both easy and difficult about machine learning. While ML has a reputation for having algorithms that are difficult to understand, in practice our participating instructors reported that it was not the algorithms that were difficult to teach, but the higher-level design decisions. We found that the learning goals that participants described as hard to teach were consistent with higher levels of the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy, such as making design decisions and comparing/contrasting models. We also found that the learning goals that were described as easy to teach, such as following the steps of particular algorithms, were consistent with the lower levels of the SOLO taxonomy. Realizing that higher-SOLO learning goals are more difficult to teach is useful for informing course design, public outreach, and the design of educational tools for teaching ML.",

For this reason, motivational concerns need to be addressed at an early age of a child, and reaching students who do not consider themselves candidates for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines is important as well if the broadest audience possible is to be engaged. This article describes a framework for teaching and assessing CT in the context of K-12 education. The framework is based on Agile software engineering methods, which rely on a set of principles and practices that can be mapped to the activities of CT. The article presents as well the results of an experiment applying this framework in two sixth-grade classes, with 42 participants in total. The results show that Agile software engineering methods are effective at teaching CT in middle schools, after the addition of some tasks to allow students to explore, project, and experience the potential product before using the software tools at hand. Moreover, according to the teachers’ feedback, the students reached all the educational objectives of the topics involved in the multidisciplinary activities. This result can be taken as an indicator that it is possible to use computing as a medium for teaching other subjects, besides computer science.",

The self-explanations were elicited as students’ in-code comments of a set of worked-examples, and the cases involved two different approaches to CSE education: glass box and black box. The glass-box approach corresponds to a programming course for materials science and engineering students that focuses on introducing programming concepts while solving disciplinary problems. The black-box approach involves the introduction of Python-based computational tools within a thermodynamics course to represent disciplinary phenomena. Two semesters of data collection for each case study allowed us to identify the effect of using in-code comments as a self-explanation strategy on students’ engagement with the worked-examples and students’ perceptions of these activities within each context. The results suggest that the use of in-code comments as a self-explanation strategy increased students’ awareness of the worked-examples while engaging with them. The students’ perceived uses of the in-code commenting activities include: understanding the example, making a connection between the programming code and the disciplinary problem, and becoming familiar with the programming language syntax, among others.",

The goal of the review is to summarize the main results found in the literature and highlight areas that need further work. Despite the the large body of work on plagiarism, no systematic reviews have been published so far. The reviewed papers were categorized and analyzed using a theoretical framework from the field of Fraud Deterrence named the Fraud Triangle . According to this framework, fraudulent behavior occurs when the person is under pressure , perceives the availability of an opportunity to commit fraud, and rationalizes the fraudulent behavior in a way that makes it seem not unethical to him or her. The review found the largest amount of the reviewed papers to discuss ways for reducing the opportunity to plagiarize, as well as tools for detecting plagiarism. However, there is a clear lack of empirical work evaluating the deterrent efficacy of these strategies and tools. The reviewed papers also included mentions of a wide range of rationalizations used by computing students when justifying plagiarism, the most important of which are rationalizations that stem from confusion about what constitutes plagiarism. Finally, work on the relationship between pressure in computing courses and plagiarism was found to be very scarce and incommensurate with the significant contribution of this factor to plagiarism.",

    "abstract": "As the societal demands for application and knowledge in computer science (CS) increase, CS student enrollment keeps growing rapidly around the world. By continuously improving the efficacy of computing education and providing guidelines for learning and teaching practice, computing education research plays a vital role in addressing both educational and societal challenges that emerge from the growth of CS students. Given the significant role of computing education research, it is important to ensure the reliability of studies in this field. The extent to which studies can be replicated in a field is one of the most important standards for reliability. Different fields have paid increasing attention to the replication rates of their studies, but the replication rate of computing education was never systematically studied. To fill this gap, this study investigated the replication rate of computing education between 2009 and 2018. We examined 2,269 published studies from three major conferences and two major journals in computing education, and found that the overall replication rate of computing education was 2.38%. This study demonstrated the need for more replication studies in computing education and discussed how to encourage replication studies through research initiatives and policy making.",

    "abstract": "Students’ lives, both in and out of school, are full of different forms of value. Wealthy students enjoy value in the form of financial capital; their fit to hegemonic social practices; excellent health care and so on. Low-income students, especially those from African American, Native American, and Latinx communities, often lack access to those resources. But there are other forms of value that low-income students do possess. Most examples of what we will call Counter-Hegemonic Practice (CHP) in the African American community involve some mixture of Indigenous African heritage, contemporary innovation in the Black community, and other influences. Moving between these value forms and the computing classroom is a non-trivial task, especially if we are to avoid merely using the appearance of culture to attract students. Our objective in this paper is to provide a framework for deeper investigations into the computational potentials for CHP; its potential as a link between education and community development; and a more dignified role for its utilization in the CS classroom. We report on a series of collaborative engagements with CHP, largely focused on African American communities.",

In the study, CT was conceptualized so that it encapsulates not only the knowledge of computational concepts (e.g., loops and conditionals) but also the use of CT practices (e.g., testing and debugging). Data were collected using a combination of knowledge of computational concepts tests, the Minecraft-based coding artifacts, and one-on-one student interviews focusing on the processes of developing computational artifacts. The participants were 20 fifth-grade middle school students from a low-income public school with very limited (if none) formal computer programming experiences before the study. The Minecraft-based coding activities were designed and implemented as an instructional program to last 6 weeks. The results of the study showed a statistically significant increase in students’ knowledge of computational concepts. Based on the analysis of the students’ final coding artifacts, we identified that students mostly used the concepts of sequences, events, loops, and parallelism correctly, whereas variables, operators, and conditionals appeared to be the least successfully used concepts. The qualitative analysis of the artifact-based interviews showed that students employed the CT practices of testing and debugging most of the time while developing an artifact through coding. In contrast, the least resorted CT practice appeared to be reusing and remixing.",

    "abstract": "Many practitioners might struggle with becoming productive in different software engineering (SE) roles due to misalignment of the skills learnt during the university time with what is expected in the industry. Companies spend significant resources to train the personnel, whose academic backgrounds are not only based on “computing disciplines”. Hiring properly trained practitioners allows employers to spend less time while incorporating them more efficiently into the workforce; for employees, knowing the most important skillset is helpful to increase their chance of employability. On the other hand, for academia, understanding the necessary skillset is critical to make curriculum updates. To achieve these objectives, we conducted a survey, which was responded to by 628 software practitioners, who completed their undergraduate degree in Turkey, working in 13 countries. This paper sheds light on the most important (hard and soft) skills in the industry by presenting various cross-factor analyses as well as their coverage in the academic curriculum (mostly in Turkish universities). The results showed that the most important skills are related to various factors such as profiles of the practitioners (e.g., SE role(s), work experience) and the characteristics of the product developed by the practitioner. The findings revealed that both academia and industry should invest in skills improvement: academia can make necessary educational updates according to industrial needs; whereas industry can provide practical experiences to students. By creating the awareness of the expected skillset, both practitioners and academics will benefit from the results, which help close the gaps that can and should be achieved through more Industry Academia Collaborations (IACs) .",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) models are fundamentally shaped by data, and building inclusive ML systems requires significant considerations around how to design representative datasets. Yet, few novice-oriented ML modeling tools are designed to foster hands-on learning of dataset design practices, including how to design for data diversity and inspect for data quality. To this end, we outline a set of four data design practices (DDPs) for designing inclusive ML models and share how we designed a tablet-based application called Co-ML to foster learning of DDPs through a collaborative ML model building experience. With Co-ML, beginners can build image classifiers through a distributed experience where data is synchronized across multiple devices, enabling multiple users to iteratively refine ML datasets in discussion and coordination with their peers. We deployed Co-ML in a 2-week-long educational AIML Summer Camp, where youth ages 13–18 worked in groups to build custom ML-powered mobile applications. Our analysis reveals how multi-user model building with Co-ML, in the context of student-driven projects created during the summer camp, supported development of DDPs including incorporating data diversity, evaluating model performance, and inspecting for data quality. Additionally, we found that students’ attempts to improve model performance often prioritized learnability over class balance. Through this work, we highlight how the combination of collaboration, model testing interfaces, and student-driven projects can empower learners to actively engage in exploring the role of data in ML systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a systematic literature review of professional development programs in computational thinking (CT). CT has emerged as an essential set of skills that everyone should develop to participate in a global society. However, there were no pre-service or in-service teacher programs to integrate CT into the K–12 classrooms until very recently. Thus, it is important to identify how educators and researchers address the challenges to prepare the next generation of students and what gaps persist in the current literature. We review existing work in this field from two perspectives: First, we analyze the learning outcomes, assessment methods, pedagogical approaches, and pedagogical tools used in the professional development programs in CT. Second, we examine how these programs assess the teachers’ knowledge and skills as outcomes. We used the technological pedagogical and content knowledge (TPACK) framework to characterize existing literature and identify possible gaps in the preparation of pre-service and in-service teachers in CT. Our results suggest that (1) existing evidence is limited to developed countries; (2) many studies are only focusing on teachers understanding the concepts but do not explore how the participants evaluate or create learning activities; (3) no studies look into classroom observations as part of the program, which limits our understanding to how these programs work; and (4) most programs use block-based programming languages as the tool to develop student CT. While block-based programming languages are used for introductory training programs, students are often expected to transfer their learning to more professional programming languages.",

    "abstract": "Objectives This study investigates gender biases in Artificial Intelligence (AI) perceptions among university students. It focuses on assessing self-perceptions regarding knowledge, impact, and support, with a specific emphasis on identifying any significant gender differences. The main hypotheses are focused on the existence of gender disparities in AI awareness, perceptions, and attitudes among higher education students. Participants The study involves 380 participants, enrolled in undergraduate courses across various academic disciplines. Participants are university students with diverse backgrounds in terms of age, academic majors, and prior exposure to AI technologies. Study Methods This research employs an observational study design. The sample size includes 380 participants. The study utilises a structured questionnaire as the primary instrument for data collection. Outcome measures focus on variables such as perceived knowledge of AI, perceived impact of AI, and levels of support or apprehension towards AI technologies. Findings The findings reveal significant gender differences, with females exhibiting lower levels than their male counterparts in the level of perceived knowledge about AI ( \\(p&lt;0.005\\) ), exposure awareness ( \\(p=0.001\\) ), perceived ability to apply AI ( \\(p=0.004\\) ), sensitivity towards AI use of private data ( \\(p=0.004\\) ), positive impact on society ( \\(p=0.002\\) ), support for AI development ( \\(p&lt;0.005\\) ), and positive expectations towards AI ( \\(p&lt;0.005\\) ). Statistical analysis, including non-parametric tests, was used to validate these observations. Conclusions There are notable gender biases in the knowledge and perception of AI among university students. These biases have implications for the future development and adoption of AI technologies, suggesting a need for more gender-inclusive educational strategies in AI. The findings underscore the importance of addressing gender disparities in AI education to ensure equitable access and understanding of these technologies. It is important to integrate gender perspectives in AI curriculum and policy-making to mitigate potential biases and enhance inclusivity in the field of AI.",

However, there is no consensus on the specific knowledge and skills that constitute children’s AI literacy, resulting in varied AI learning materials for young people. We systematically searched for educational practices for children’s AI learning in both formal and informal settings and examined the AI learning content taught to children. Our findings led to the development of a holistic AI literacy framework for children, which contains three high-level dimensions and eight content areas of AI literacy: AI awareness (AI definition, AI application, and AI history), AI mechanics (AI input, learning procedure, and AI output), and AI impacts (AI implication and responsible practice). Theoretically, we contribute a research-based, comprehensive, and current framework for children’s AI literacy, advancing its conceptualization in early life stages. Practically, our framework can guide researchers and practitioners in promoting AI education for the next generation.",

    "abstract": "Providing consistent summative assessment to students is important, as the grades they are awarded affect their progression through university and future career prospects. While small cohorts are typically assessed by a single assessor, such as the module/class leader, larger cohorts are often assessed by multiple assessors, typically teaching assistants, which increases the risk of inconsistent grading. To investigate the consistency of human grading of programming assignments, we asked 28 participants to each grade 40 CS1 introductory Java assignments, providing grades and feedback for correctness, code elegance, readability and documentation; the 40 assignments were split into two batches of 20. The 28 participants were divided into seven groups of four (where each group graded the same 40 assignments) to allow us to investigate the consistency of a group of assessors. In the second batch of 20, we duplicated one assignment from the first to analyse the internal consistency of individual assessors. We measured the inter-rater reliability of the groups using Krippendorff’s \\(\\alpha\\) —an \\(\\alpha &gt; 0.667\\) is recommended to make tentative conclusions based on the rating. Our groups were inconsistent, with an average \\(\\alpha=0.2\\) when grading correctness and an average \\(\\alpha &lt; 0.1\\) for code elegance, readability and documentation. To measure the individual consistency of graders, we measured the distance between the grades they awarded for the duplicated assignment in batch one and batch two. Only one participant of the 22 who didn’t notice that the assignment was a duplicate was awarded the same grade for correctness, code elegance, readability and documentation. The average grade difference was 1.79 for correctness and less than 1.6 for code elegance, readability and documentation. Our results show that human graders in our study cannot agree on the grade to give a piece of student work and are often individually inconsistent, suggesting that the idea of a ‘gold standard’ of human grading might be flawed. This highlights that a shared rubric alone is not enough to ensure consistency, and other aspects such as assessor training and alternative grading practices should be explored to improve the consistency of human grading further when grading programming assignments.",

The interviewed students exhibited great diversity in both socio-demographic and educational background. We identified no profiles that predicted student success or failure. At the same time, we found that expectations about programming resulted in challenges of time-management and communication. The time requirements of programming assignments were unpredictable, often disproportionate to expectations, and clashed with the external commitments of adult professionals. Too little communication was available to access adequate instructor help. On the basis of these findings, we suggest instructional design solutions for adult professionals studying introductory computer science education.",

    "abstract": "The Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) technique is nowadays the most popular programming technique among tertiary education institutions. However, learning OOP is a cognitively demanding task for undergraduate students. Several difficulties and misconceptions have been recorded in the literature for both OOP concepts and languages, mainly Java. This article focuses on reviewing and advancing research on the most fundamental OOP concepts, namely, the concepts of “object” and “class” and their role during program execution. The results of a long-term investigation on the subject are presented, focusing on a study exploring undergraduate students’ conceptions on “objects” and “classes.” The study advances related research on categories of conceptions on “objects” and “classes” by providing quantitative results, in addition to qualitative results, regarding the frequency of the recorded conceptions. Nearly half the students seem to comprehend the modeling and static/dynamic aspects of the concepts “object” and “class.” Implications for achieving a deep conceptual understanding of text, action, and modeling aspects of these fundamental concepts are also discussed. Information regarding the programming environments utilized in the course and key features of the applied teaching approach are presented, in order to facilitate both a better understanding of the context and a better employment of the results of the presented study. Finally, proposals for enhancing the contribution of this and similar studies are made.",

A better understanding of why some students choose to learn on their own may help us to motivate other students to develop this important skill. In addition, it may help in curriculum design; if we need to leave some topics out of our expanding curriculum, a good choice might be those topics that students readily learn on their own. Based on a thematic analysis of 17 semistructured interviews, we found that computing students’ motivations for self-directed learning fall into four general themes: projects, social and peer interactions, joy of learning, and fear. Under these, we describe several more specific subthemes, illustrated in the words of the students. The project-related and social motivations are quite prominent. Although these motivations appear in the literature, they received greater emphasis from our interviewees. Perhaps most characteristic of computing is the motivation to learn to complete some project, both projects done for fun and projects required for school or work.",

One critical juncture is the transition from high school to college. In our study, we examined factors predicting college persistence in computer science- and technology-related majors from data collected from female high school students. We fielded a survey that asked about students’ interest and confidence in computing as well as their intentions to learn programming, game design, or invent new technology. The survey also asked about perceived social support from friends and family for pursuing computing as well as experiences with computing, including the CS Advanced Placement (AP) exam, out-of-school time activities such as clubs, and internships. Multinomial regression was used to predict persistence in computing and tech majors in college. Programming during high school, taking the CS Advanced Placement exam, and participation in the Aspirations awards program were the best predictors of persistence three years after the high school survey in both CS and other technology-related majors. Participation in tech-related work, internships, or after-school programs was negatively associated with persistence, and involvement with computing sub-domains of game design and inventing new applications were not associated with persistence. Our results suggest that efforts to broaden participation in computing should emphasize education in computer programming.",

One goal has been to inform the endeavours of improving student engagement, retention, as well as under-representation of certain demographics in computing. Students of two computer science--related study programmes (CS/IT) reflected on their engagement in their field of study at different times during the first three study years. Drawing on social identity theory, the focus has been to analyse and describe different ways in which the students experience participation in CS/IT, i.e., doing, thinking, and feeling, in relation to CS/IT, negotiated among different people. Insights into participation in CS/IT were used to discuss what it entails to fit in and become a computing professional. Phenomenographic analysis yields an outcome space that describes increasingly broad ways in which first-, second-, and third-year students experience participation in CS/IT. Two further outcome spaces provide nuanced insights into experiences that are of increasing relevance as the students advance in their studies, participation as problem solving, and problem solving for others. Participation as problem solving appears to be central in this learning environment and the students integrate such experiences into their histories of engagement in CS/IT. In study year 3, the students also reason about participation as problem solving for others that they encounter in the human computer interaction course. However, at that time several students perform a technical problem solver identity and reject such broader ways of participating in CS/IT.",

In this article, we examined trends in computational participation in Scratch, an online community with over 1 million registered youth designers. Drawing on a random sample of 5,004 youth programmers and their activities over 3 months in early 2012, we examined programming concepts used in projects in relation to level of participation, gender, and length of membership of Scratch programmers. Latent class analysis results identified the same four groups of programmers in each month based on the usage of different programming concepts and showed how membership in these groups shifted in different ways across time. Strikingly, the largest group of project creators (named Loops) used the simplest and fewest programming concepts. Further, this group was the most stable in membership and was disproportionately female. In contrast, the more complex programming groups (named Variables, Low Booleans, and High Booleans) showed much movement across time. Further, the Low Booleans and High Booleans groups, the only groups to use “and,” “or,” and “not” statements in their programs, were disproportionately male. In the discussion, we address the challenges of analyzing young learners’ programming in informal online communities and opportunities for designing more equitable computational participation.",

However, teaching CS abstraction to novices is a very challenging task, and CS educational research has often demonstrated students' difficulties in learning this idea, in different contexts and at different age levels. The challenge in teaching CS abstraction is even greater when dealing with young students, since according to theories on children's cognitive development, their abstraction abilities may still be not fully developed. In 2013, Armoni [5] introduced a framework for teaching abstraction in the context of algorithmic problem solving, intended for novice students. We studied the effect of this framework in an introductory CS course for 7 th graders, in which Scratch was used as the programming language for implementing algorithmic solutions. Our findings indicate that the framework was highly effective for developing CS abstraction skills as well as other related skills and aspects, such as the tendency to provide explanations for solutions, the use of initialization processes, and the perception of the nature of CS. It also significantly improved students’ general CS performance in this course.",

However, teaching SQL effectively requires both pedagogical skill and considerable knowledge of the language. Educators and scholars have proposed numerous considerations for the betterment of SQL education, yet these considerations may be too numerous and scattered among different fora for educators to find and internalize, as no systematic mappings or literature reviews regarding SQL education have been conducted. The two main goals of this mapping study are to provide an overview of educational SQL research topics, research types, and publication fora, and to collect and propagate SQL teaching practices for educators to utilize. Additionally, we present a short future research agenda based on insights from the mapping process. We conducted a systematic mapping study complemented by snowballing techniques to identify applicable primary studies. We classified the primary studies according to research type and utilized directed content analysis to classify the primary studies by their topic. Out of our selected 89 primary studies, we identified six recurring topics: (i) student errors in query formulation; (ii) characteristics and presentation of the exercise database; (iii) specific and (iv) non-specific teaching approach suggestions; (v) patterns and visualization; and (vi) easing teacher workload. We list 66 teaching approaches the primary studies argued for (and in some cases against). For researchers, we provide a systematic map of educational SQL research and future research agenda. For educators, we present an aggregated body of knowledge on teaching practices in SQL education over a time frame of 30 years. In conclusion, we suggest that replication studies, studies on advanced SQL concepts, and studies on aspects other than data retrieval are needed to further educational SQL research.",

    "abstract": "Motivation. As K-12 computing education becomes more established throughout the world, there is an increasing focus on accessibility for all, whether in a particular country or setting or in areas of the world that may not yet have computing established. This is primarily articulated as an equity issue. The recently developed capacity for , access to , participation in , and experience of computer science education (CAPE) Framework is one way of demonstrating stages and dependencies and understanding relative equity, taking into consideration the disparities between sub-populations. While there is existing research that covers the state of computing education and equity issues, it is mostly in high-income countries; there is minimal research in the context of low-middle-income countries like the sub-Saharan African countries. Objectives. The objective of the article is therefore to report on a pilot study investigating the capacity (one of the equity issues), for delivering computing education in four sub-Saharan African countries: Botswana, Kenya, Nigeria and Uganda, countries that are in different geographic regions as well as in different income brackets (low-middle income). Method. In addition to reviewing the capacity issues of curriculum and policy around computing education in each country, we surveyed 58 teachers about the infrastructure, resources, professional development, and curriculum for computing in their country. We used a localized version of the MEasuring TeacheR Enacted Computing Curriculum (METRECC) instrument for this purpose. Results. We analyzed the results through the lens of the CAPE framework at the capacity level. We identified similarities and differences in the data from teachers who completed the original METRECC survey, all of whom were from high-income countries and African teachers. The data revealed statistically significant differences between the two datasets in relation to access to resources and professional development opportunities in computer studies/computer science, with the African teachers experiencing more barriers. Results further showed that African teachers focus less on teaching algorithms and programming than teachers from high-income countries. In addition, we found differences between African countries in the study, reflecting their relative access to IT infrastructure and resources. Discussion. The findings suggest that African countries are still struggling with the lowest level of the CAPE pyramid, Capacity for as compared to high-income countries. This level is concerned with the availability of resources that support the enactment of a computing curriculum of high quality. The CAPE framework helps map the progression from Capacity for to Experience of computer science education as a route to equity, but to support development in low and middle-income countries, it may be helpful to have the capacity level finely grained. Such an adaptation draws out dependencies between policy and vision, infrastructure, curriculum implementation, and teacher professional development. More research is recommended to investigate these dependencies further and thus support and facilitate the development of global computing education.",

    "abstract": "Students face several difficulties in introductory programming courses (CS1), often leading to high dropout rates, student demotivation, and lack of interest. The literature has indicated that the adequate use of gamification might improve learning in several domains, including CS1. However, the understanding of which (and how) factors influence gamification’s success, especially for CS1 education, is lacking. Thus, there is a clear need to shed light on pre-determinants of gamification’s impact. To tackle this gap, we investigate how user and contextual factors influence gamification’s effect on CS1 students through a quasi-experimental retrospective study ( \\( N = 399 \\) ), based on a between-subject design (conditions: gamified or non-gamified) in terms of final grade (academic achievement) and the number of programming assignments completed in an educational system (i.e., how much they practiced). Then, we evaluate whether and how user and contextual characteristics (e.g., age, gender, major, programming experience, working situation, internet access, and computer access/sharing) moderate that effect. Our findings indicate that gamification amplified to some extent the impact of practicing. Overall, students practicing in the gamified version presented higher academic achievement than those practicing the same amount in the non-gamified version. Intriguingly, those in the gamified version that practiced much more extensively than the average showed lower academic achievements than those who practiced comparable amounts in the non-gamified version. Furthermore, our results reveal gender as the only statistically significant moderator of gamification’s effect: in our data, it was positive for females but non-significant for males. These findings suggest which (and how) personal and contextual factors moderate gamification’s effects, indicate the need to further understand and examine context’s role, and show that gamification must be cautiously designed to prevent students from playing instead of learning.",

Students often experience anxiety and frustration when they encounter difficulties in writing programs. Continued frustration can discourage students from pursuing engineering and computing careers. Although prior research has shown how emotions affect students’ motivation and learning, little is known about students’ emotions in programming courses. In this qualitative study of first-year engineering students taking an introductory programming course, we examined the emotions that these students experienced during programming tasks and the reasons for experiencing those emotions. Our study was grounded in the control-value theory of achievement emotions. Each research participant came to two laboratory sessions: a programming session and a retrospective think-aloud interview session. In the programming session, each participant worked individually on programming problems. We collected screen capture, biometrics, and survey responses. In the interview session, each participant watched a video of their actions during the programming session. After every 2 minutes of viewing, the participants reported the emotions that they had experienced during this 2-minute period. We performed a thematic analysis of the interview data. Our results indicate that the participants experienced frustration most frequently. Sometimes they experienced multiple emotions. For example, one participant felt annoyed because she had made a mistake, but she felt joy and pride when she fixed the mistake. To promote student learning, educators should take students’ emotions into account in the design of curriculum and pedagogy for introductory programming courses.",

While the proliferation of programs dedicated to broadening participation in computing increases access, computing education research can benefit from more directly drawing on current interest development theory to improve interventions that increase the desire to participate and persist in computing. In this article, we present an overview of current interest development theory and provide guidance to computing education researchers on ways to ground their conceptualization and measurement of interest in contemporary theory and inform ways of interweaving interest theory throughout intervention or curriculum design. The central contribution of this work is presenting the Integrated Interest Development for Computing Education Framework. This framework is organized around three central dimensions of interest: value, knowledge, and belonging. For each of these dimensions, the framework presents key factors that link the dimension to strategies that can be employed in computing education contexts to help develop interest. The article also describes methods of measuring interest in computing that are consistent with interest development theory, and provides examples and resources for validated measures of interest. We conclude with a discussion of the implications and potential for improving the conceptualization and measurement of interest development in computing education and future work needed to advance an understanding of how interest in computing develops that can lead to improving the design of computing educational programs to support interest development.",

To answer these questions, we conducted a year-long Action Research investigation, in which 13 CS faculty integrated elements of inclusive design into 44 CS/IT offerings across a 4-year curriculum. The 613 affected students’ educational work products, grades, and/or climate questionnaire responses revealed significant improvements in students’ course outcomes (higher course grades and fewer course fails/incompletes/withdrawals), especially for marginalized groups; revealed that most students did learn and apply inclusive design concepts to their CS activities; and revealed that inclusion and teamwork in the courses significantly improved. These results suggest a new pathway for significantly improving students’ retention, their knowledge and usage of inclusive design, and their experiences across CS education—for marginalized groups and for all students.",

    "abstract": "Culturally responsive computing (CRC), that centers sociopolitical issues and transformational uses of technology, has been described as valuable for increasing engagement with computing, especially for historically underrepresented minoritized students. But what do high school students think? Through a sociocultural lens prioritizing student voices recorded in 56 interviews over a period of 2 years (1–3 years after students’ first experience with computer science (CS) education through Exploring Computer Science or Advanced Placement CS Principles in high school), this study centers the perspectives of 39 primarily low-income, Latine and Black youth from urban California and rural Mississippi public schools to understand what they perceive as the role of technology in our world and what they subsequently desire of their computing education. While none have studied CRC before, the majority responded with CRC ideas about the kind of pedagogy they believe would make for a more meaningful computing learning experience: They see computing as a form of power that impacts both good and bad in the world and want computing educators to prepare them to take on these issues of equity, ethics, social responsibility, and underrepresentation in the field. The students’ perspectives offer important pedagogical insight into how to support deeper engagement with computing in current CS for All initiatives, while also preparing youth for the rapidly evolving and increasingly complex computing landscape that impacts all of our lives.",

    "abstract": "As initiatives on artificial intelligence (AI) education in K-12 learning contexts continues to evolve, researchers have developed curricula among other resources to promote AI across grade levels. Yet, there is a need for more effort regarding curriculum, tools, and pedagogy, as well as assessment techniques to popularize AI at the middle school level. Drawing on prior work, we created original curriculum activities with innovative use of existing technology, a new computational teaching tool, and a series of approaches and assessments to evaluate students’ engagement with the learning resources. Our curriculum called AI MyData comprises elements of ML and data science infused with ethical orientation. In this paper, we describe the novel AI curriculum and further discuss how we engaged students in learning and critiquing AI ethical dilemmas. We gathered data from two pilot studies conducted in the Northeast United States, one Artificial Intelligence Afterschool (AIA) program, and one virtual AI summer camp. The AIA program was carried out in a local public school with four middle school students aged 12 to 13; the program consisted of eleven two-hour sessions. The summer camp consisted of two-hour sessions over four consecutive days, with eighteen students aged 12 to 15. We facilitated both pilot programs with hands-on plugged and unplugged activities. The method of capturing data included artifact collection, structured interviews, written assessments, and a pre- to post-questionnaire tapping participants’ dispositions about AI and its societal implication. Participant artifacts, written assessments, survey, observation, and analysis of tasks completed revealed that the children improved in their knowledge of AI. In addition, the AI curriculum units and accompanying approaches developed for this study successfully engaged the participants, even without prior knowledge of related concepts. We also found an indication that introducing ethics of AI to adolescents will help their development as ethically responsive citizens. Our study results also indicate that lessons establishing links with students’ personal lives (e.g., letting students choose personally meaningful datasets) and societal implications using unplugged activities and interactive tools were particularly valuable for promoting AI and the integration of AI in middle school education across the subject domains and settings. Based on these results, we discuss our findings, identify their limitations, and propose future work.",

Each regional partnership is led by a STARS member college or university with partners such as local chapters of the Girl Scouts, the Black Data Processors Association, public libraries, Citizen Schools, and companies that employ computing graduates. STARS goals include retaining and graduating undergraduates and recruiting and bridging undergraduates into graduate programs. The alliance works toward these goals through activities that advance the central values of Technical Excellence, Leadership, Community, and Service and Civic Engagement. In particular, all STARS college and university members implement the STARS Leadership Corps ( SLC ), an innovative model for enveloping a diverse set of BPC practices within a common framework for implementation within multiple organizations, common assessment, and sustainability through curricula integration. Herein, we describe the SLC model and its implementation in the STARS schools, including details of an SLC service-learning course that has been adopted by eight STARS schools. We report the results of our three-year study of the SLC in the 20 STARS schools. Our study found a positive effect of participation in the SLC on important student success variables, including self-efficacy, perceived social relevance of computing, grade point average, and commitment to remain in computing. Results indicate that the SLC model is effective for students under-represented in computing, as well as for those not from under-represented groups.",

    "abstract": "Despite much public discussion about the importance of creativity and innovation-friendly teaching in Finnish higher education, the impact of the general opinion on actual teaching practices has been limited. In the Finnish computer science education the teaching mostly follows a pattern of lectures, fixed exercise sets, and exams. With this article we want to open a discussion about possibilities of enhancing the learning environment by focusing on creative problem solving. We will present results from two research experiments in which we aimed to provide computer science students with a practically oriented learning environment with an explicit intention of supporting the creative work of students. There exists a vast amount of scientific theory about creativity, yet it is unclear on how to turn that theory into practice. Thus, our main interest was to find ways of applying creativity theory in practice in the context of computer science education. Our research experiments consist of a practically oriented computer science course, where LEGO®Mindstorms robots were used as the platform for the student work. Methodological tools used in this study included content analysis of student products, observations from our learning sessions and semi-structured interviews with the students. The course was organised two times: the first time was in spring 2009 and the second in spring 2010. The total number of attending students was 72. In this article we argue that our approach of providing a creativity-supporting practical computer science course was a success. We gained a lot of ideas on how to support creativity, the students were clearly motivated, and they began to learn a new kind of experimental working style. The robotics kit seemed to work well both as a trigger for motivation and as a platform to support experimental learning, enhancing students’ creativity and working style. In our opinion these findings are of great importance, and give promising practical ideas for the support of creativity in higher computer science education.",

    "abstract": "As software becomes more ubiquitous and complex, the cost of software bugs continues to grow at a staggering rate. To remedy this situation, there needs to be major improvement in the knowledge and application of software validation techniques. Although there are several software validation techniques, software testing continues to be one of the most widely used in industry. The high demand for software engineers in the next decade has resulted in more software engineering (SE) courses being offered in academic institutions. However, due to the number of topics to be covered in SE courses, little or no attention is given to software testing, resulting in students entering industry with little or no testing experience. We propose a minimally disruptive approach of integrating software testing into SE courses by providing students access to a collaborative learning environment containing learning materials on testing techniques and testing tools. In this article, we describe the learning environment and the studies conducted to measure the benefits accrued by students using the learning environment in the SE courses.",

Such capstone projects may be student-designed, instructor-designed, designed in conjunction with outside companies, or integrated with ongoing free and open source (FOSS) projects. The literature shows that the FOSS approach has attracted a great deal of interest, in particular when implemented with projects that have humanitarian goals (HFOSS). In this article, we describe five unique models from five distinct types of institutions for incorporating sustained FOSS or HFOSS (alternatively H/FOSS) project work into capstone experiences or courses. The goal is to provide instructors wishing to integrate open source experiences into their curriculum with additional perspectives and resources to help in adapting this approach to the specific needs and goals of their institution and students. All of the models presented are based on sustained engagement with H/FOSS projects that last at least one semester and often more. Each model is described in terms of its characteristics and how it fits the needs of the institution using the model. Assessment of each model is also presented. We then discuss the themes that are common across the models, such as project selection, team formation, mentoring, and student assessment. We examine the choices made by each model, as well as the challenges faced. We end with a discussion how the models have leveraged institutional initiatives and collaborations with outside organizations to address some of the challenges associated with these projects.",

The aim of this work is to assess the learning effectiveness and motivational appeal of digital games for learning basic programming concepts, involving secondary education students. For this purpose, the Code.org ® ’s activity named K-8 Intro to Computer Science was used. The study investigated students’ attitudes from gaming activities to reveal the quality of their learning experience. Next, students’ attitudes from games were correlated with their cognitive profile to reveal potential differences. Finally, students’ performance from the digital games was assessed to reveal game-based learning (GBL) effectiveness compared to their cognitive styles. In the study, 77 students of two Greek high schools participated in the context of the European Code Week. The results suggest that these specific games, or similar educational computer games, can be exploited as effective and motivational learning environments within schools, as they provide a high-quality learning experience. Cognitive style was found to be a significant learning characteristic that should be taken into consideration when using digital games to learn programming.",

To identify the cause of this recent phenomenon, we review the computer education environment using the Darmstadt model, including educational systems, curricula, and teaching environments. Then we examine what factors affected the decline of computer education. The major causes of failure are found to be the absence of policy and a comprehensive evaluation method. These causes have led to a reduction in the selection ratio of computer-related subjects and in the number of students taking computer classes.

In this article, we describe a study of undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory web development course taken by both computing majors and general education students. Using data collected during the initial weeks of the course, we investigate the nature of the syntax errors they make when learning HTML and CSS, and how they resolve them. This is accomplished through the deployment of openHTML, a lightweight web-based code editor that logs user activity. Our analysis reveals that nearly all students made syntax errors that remained unresolved in their assessments, and that these errors continued weeks into the course. Approximately 20% of these errors related to the relatively complex system of rules that dictates when it is valid for HTML elements to be nested in one another. On the other hand, 35% of errors related to the relatively simple tag syntax determining how HTML elements are nested. We also find that validation played a key role in resolving errors: While the majority of unresolved errors were present in untested code, nearly all of the errors that were detected through validation were eventually corrected. We conclude with a discussion of our findings and their implications for computing education.",

Through a case-study approach, we test a developed teamwork framework, using manual content analysis and sentiment analysis, to determine if the framework can provide insight into students’ teamwork behavior and to determine if the wiki task encouraged students to collaborate, share knowledge, and self-adopt teamwork roles. Analysis revealed the identification of both active and cohesive teams, disengaged students, and particular roles and behaviors that were lacking. Furthermore, sentiment analysis revealed that teams moved through positive and negative emotions over the course of developing their solution, toward satisfaction. The findings demonstrate the value of the detailed analysis of online teamwork. However, we propose the need for automated measures that provide real-time feedback to assist educators in the fair and efficient assessment of teamwork.

Aalborg University has since its creation in 1974 practiced PBL in all subjects, including computer science and software engineering, following a model that has become known as the Aalborg Model. Following a strategic decision in 2009, the Aalborg Model has been reshaped. We first report on the software engineering program as it was in the old Aalborg Model. We analyze the programme wrt competence levels according to Bloom’s taxonomy and compare it with the expected skills and competencies for an engineer passing a general software engineering 4-year program with an additional 4 years of experience as defined in the IEEE Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK) [Abran et al. 2004]. We also compare with the Graduate Software Engineering 2009 Curriculum Guidelines for Graduate Degree Programmes in Software Engineering (GSwE2009) [Pyster 2009]. We then describe the new curriculum and draw some preliminary conclusions based on analyzing the curriculum according to Bloom’s taxonomy and the results of running the program for 2 years. As the new program is structured to be compliant with the Bologna Process and thus presents all activities in multipla of 5 European Credit Transfer System points, we envision that elements of the program could be used in more traditional curricula. This should be especially easy for programs also complying with the Bologna Process.",

    "abstract": "The past few years has seen a proliferation of novice programming tools. The availability of a large number of systems has made it difficult for many users to choose among them. Even for education researchers, comparing the relative quality of these tools, or judging their respective suitability for a given context, is hard in many instances. For designers of such systems, assessing the respective quality of competing design decisions can be equally difficult. Heuristic evaluation provides a practical method of assessing the quality of alternatives in these situations and of identifying potential problems with existing systems for a given target group or context. Existing sets of heuristics, however, are not specific to the domain of novice programming and thus do not evaluate all aspects of interest to us in this specialised application domain. In this article, we propose a set of heuristics to be used in heuristic evaluations of novice programming systems. These heuristics have the potential to allow a useful assessment of the quality of a given system with lower cost than full formal user studies and greater precision than the use of existing sets of heuristics. The heuristics are described and discussed in detail. We present an evaluation of the effectiveness of the heuristics that suggests that the new set of heuristics provides additional useful information to designers not obtained with existing heuristics sets.",

To begin to understand whether or not these past activities have had long-term impact, we conducted a systematic literature review. Upon discovering that longitudinal studies were lacking, we investigated whether undergraduate students believed that their participation in computing activities prior to college contributed to their decision to major in a computing field. From the 770 participants in the study, we discovered that approximately 20% of males and 24% of females who were required to participate in computing activities chose a computing or related major, but that males perceived that the activity had a greater affect on their decision (20%) than females (6.9%). Females who participated in an outreach activity were more likely to major in computing. Compared with females who chose to major in computing, females who did not were less likely to indicate that the majority of students participating in activities were boys and that they were a welcome part of the groups. Results also showed that female participants who do not ultimately major in computing have a much stronger negative perception of the outreach activities than male participants who also chose a non-computing major. Although many computing outreach activities are designed to diversify computing, it may be the case that, overall, boys receive these activities more favorably than girls, although requiring participation yields approximately the same net positive impact.",

    "abstract": "The change in the English computing curriculum and the shift towards computer science (CS) has been closely observed by other countries. Female participation remains a concern in most jurisdictions, but female attainment in CS is relatively unstudied. Using the English national pupil database, we analyzed all exam results (n = 5,370,064) for students taking secondary school exams in 2016, focusing on those students taking GCSE CS (n = 60,736), contrasting this against ICT (n = 67,359). Combining gender with ethnicity and the IDACI poverty indicator, we find that females from the poorest areas were more likely to take CS than those from the richest areas and that CS was more popular among ethnic minority females than white females. ICT was far more equitable for females and poorer students than CS. CS females typically got better grades than their male peers. However, when controlling for average attainment in other subjects, males got 0.31 of a grade higher. Female relative underperformance in CS was most acute among large female cohorts and with girls studying in mixed-gender schools. Girls did significantly better than boys in English when controlling for CS scores, supporting theories around female relative strengths lying outside STEM subjects. The move to introduce CS into the English curriculum and the removal of the ICT qualifications look to be having a negative impact on female participation and attainment in computing. Using the theory of self-efficacy, we argue that the shift towards CS might decrease the number of girls choosing further computing qualifications or pursuing computing as a career. Computing curriculum designers and teachers need to carefully consider the inclusive nature of their computing courses.",

    "abstract": "This article provides a survey of methods and paradigms for teaching Computer Networks (CN). Since the theoretical concepts are rather abstract in this subject, and students often find them too technical and difficult to understand, many authors attempt to answer the question on how to improve students’ motivation and interest for the complex teaching material of CN. In this work, we follow a rigorous paper collection methodology and extract a large number of previous studies that relate to the stated research questions. Also, we find that there is no review article in the current literature that would provide a clear systematization or a guided study on this topic. Hence, this work provides a literature overview by binding all the previously used methods for teaching CN in one place, and brings contribution by classifying the existing approaches into four basic classes: methods based on using visualization objects such as network simulators, multimedia applications, packet-tracing tools or visual analogies; methods based on using the virtualization techniques; methods precipitating active learning paradigm and methods based on the practical hands-on laboratory exercises. Moreover, the research in this article goes beyond the proposed classification. The classes of methods and tools are compared and contrasted based on the findings from the literature. Methods are evaluated by a detailed cross-comparison based on their advantages, disadvantages and challenges in the perspective of both teachers and students. The review is additionally strengthened by comparing the educational effectiveness of the classified methods. We examine, classify, and contrast the usual approaches used in teaching CN, provide useful insights on how appropriate they are in achieving specific educational goals and determine the future research directions.",

    "abstract": "Courses in computer science curricula often involve group programming assignments. Instructors are required to take several decisions on assignment setup and monitoring, team formation policies, and grading systems. Group programming projects provide unique monitoring opportunities due to the availability of both product and process data, as well as challenges in team composition, with students of varying levels of prior programming experience. To gain insights into the experiences and perceptions of students about the assignment setup and grading policies in group programming projects, we interviewed 20 computer science students from four universities. The thematic analysis highlighted factors in group composition that are considered important, as well as advantages and disadvantages of the self-selection of the teams. It also indicated three grading strategies experienced by the students, namely, being assigned the same group grade, individual grades distributed by the instructor, and grade distribution determined by the team, with perceptions about them varying greatly. Several practices for monitoring team contributions were identified. Checking the source code repositories was considered useful in recognizing slacking members, but automated metrics are not always representative of the work distribution. The analysis also uncovered student perceptions on the grading factors for programming assignments, including coding efficiency and skill.",

    "abstract": "There is little empirical research related to how elementary students develop computational thinking (CT) and how they apply CT in problem-solving. To address this gap in knowledge, this study made use of learning trajectories (LTs; hypothesized learning goals, progressions, and activities) in CT concept areas such as sequence, repetition, conditionals, and decomposition to better understand students’ CT. This study implemented eight math-CT integrated lessons aligned to U.S. national mathematics education standards and the LTs with third- and fourth-grade students. This basic interpretive qualitative study aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of elementary students’ CT by having students express and articulate their CT in cognitive interviews. Participants’ ( n = 22) CT articulation was examined using a priori codes translated verbatim from the learning goals in the LTs and was mapped to the learning goals in the LTs. Results revealed a range of students’ CT in problem-solving, such as using precise and complete problem-solving instructions, recognizing repeating patterns, and decomposing arithmetic problems. By collecting empirical data on how students expressed and articulated their CT, this study makes theoretical contributions by generating initial empirical evidence to support the hypothesized learning goals and progressions in the LTs. This article also discusses the implications for integrated CT instruction and assessments at the elementary level.",

    "abstract": "To help address programming plagiarism and collusion, students should be informed about acceptable practices and about program similarity, both coincidental and non-coincidental. However, current approaches are usually manual, brief, and delivered well before students are in a situation where they might commit academic misconduct. This article presents an assessment submission system with automated, personalized, and timely formative feedback that can be used in institutions that apply some leniency in early instances of plagiarism and collusion. If a student’s submission shares coincidental or non-coincidental similarity with other submissions, then personalized similarity reports are generated for the involved submissions and the students are expected to explain the similarity and resubmit the work. Otherwise, a report simulating similarities is sent just to the author of the submitted program to enhance their knowledge. Results from two quasi-experiments involving two academic semesters suggest that students with our approach are more aware of programming plagiarism and collusion, including the futility of some program disguises. Further, their submitted programs have lower similarity even at the level of program flow, suggesting that they are less likely to have engaged in programming plagiarism and collusion. Student behavior while using the system is also analyzed based on the statistics of the generated reports and student justifications for the reported similarities.",

Although APCSP has drawn a more diverse population of course takers than the traditional Advanced Placement Computer Science A (APCSA) course, questions remain about whether the new course portends students’ longer-term interest in computing and technology. This study used data from more than 120,000 first-year college students in the United States to understand the relationship between taking APCSA, APCSP, or both APCS courses and students' aspirations to major in computing or to pursue a computing or technology career. Our results indicated that taking APCSA or taking both APCS courses positively predicted students’ major or career aspirations in computing and technology, but that taking only APCSP did not predict long-term computing interest (although positive associations were identified for women). The findings identify a possible tension in the function of APCSP, as it appears to broaden access to computing knowledge, but may not necessarily encourage longer-term computing aspirations for all groups of underrepresented students.",

    "abstract": "Motivation : Enrollments in Brazilian computing degrees are at an all-time high, but graduation numbers have not increased at the same rate. Moreover, enrollment growth has mainly attracted male students, steadily expanding the gender gap in Brazilian computing programs. Such high attrition rates have a great economic impact and may disproportionately affect women and students of color. Previous works investigated reasons for student drop-out and retention in specific courses or barriers to entrance in computing programs in narrower contexts or in a single institution. Objectives : We investigate potential actionable factors for intent to drop out in computing programs and what factors might lead students to remain in a computing program in several Brazilian institutions. We investigated how such factors may be affected by students’ race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status. Method : We analyzed Likert-style answers from an online survey with 3,193 students currently enrolled in Brazilian computing programs. Results : The results show that students value salary/job-related factors as the most important factors to potentially remain in a computing program. The excess of theoretical courses and the difficulty of programming and mathematics courses are the top-ranked factors by students to potentially abandon a computing degree. However, while there is little effect of gender, race/ethnicity, or socioeconomic status in retention factors, potential drop out factors such as a the fact that it is a male-dominated field, harassment, and the difficulty of courses were rated as more important by women. Also, costs and the difficulty of courses are relevant factors for the intent to drop out when analyzing students’ race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status. Discussion : We explore the implications of our findings for Computing programs, particularly (but not restricted to) the Brazilian context. We conjecture reasons for such students’ perspectives regarding intent to drop out and retention factors and provide recommendations of actions for instructional designers, curriculum developers, and other key stakeholders to address issues related to gender, students’ wellness, perceived authenticity of courses, and other relevant factors. Since we only observed small interactions between race/ethnicity and retention and intent to drop out factors, which may indicate a lack of sensitivity from the instrument, we present suggestions to address such limitations in future work.",

    "abstract": "Objectives . This article explores teacher readiness for introducing artificial intelligence (AI) into Sri Lankan schools, drawing on self-efficacy theory. Similar to some other countries, Sri Lanka plans to integrate AI into the school curriculum soon. However, a key question remains: Are teachers prepared to teach this advanced technical subject to schoolchildren? Assessing teacher readiness is crucial, as it is intricately linked to the overall success of this initiative and will inform the development of appropriate policies. Participants . This study surveyed over 1,300 Sri Lankan public school teachers who teach Information and Communication Technology (ICT) using the snowball sampling approach. The respondents represent approximately 20% of the total ICT teacher population in Sri Lanka. Their readiness to teach AI was assessed using a general teacher self-efficacy scale specifically developed based on the well-established Self-Efficacy Theory. While key demographic factors like gender, education level and educational background were also collected, their impact analysis is not included in this article. Study Method . The study was conducted based on the premise that teachers’ readiness to teach AI hinges on their self-efficacy towards teaching AI in the classroom. This premise was substantiated through a review of existing research, and a conceptual model of teachers’ self-efficacy for AI instruction was developed. To assess this model, a nationwide survey targeting school ICT teachers was conducted. The questionnaire used in the survey was based on existing research on evaluating teacher self-efficacy. Data analysis, focusing on testing and validating the conceptual model, primarily employed the PLS-SEM approach. Findings . This study identified several key findings: (1) Teachers generally reported low self-efficacy regarding their ability to teach AI; (2) Teachers’ self-efficacy was most influenced by their emotional and physiological states, as well as their imaginary experiences related to teaching AI; (3) Surprisingly, mastery experiences had a lesser impact on their self-efficacy for teaching AI; and (4) Neither vicarious experiences (observing others teach AI) nor verbal persuasion had a significant impact on teachers’ self-efficacy. Additionally, the study revealed that the teachers’ own level of expertise in AI, along with their social capital, is insufficient to deliver a standard AI curriculum. Conclusions . The analysis of the results found that Sri Lankan teachers currently lack the readiness to teach AI in schools effectively. Potential lapses in certain sources of self-efficacy were also identified. It further revealed the need for a more systemic approach to teacher professional development. Therefore, the study recommends further research exploring the potential of incorporating a socio-technical systems perspective into the government’s teacher training initiatives.",

    "abstract": "The recent integration of visual capabilities into Large Language Models (LLMs) has the potential to play a pivotal role in science and technology education, where visual elements such as diagrams, charts, and tables are commonly used to improve the learning experience. This study investigates the performance of ChatGPT-4 Vision, OpenAI’s most advanced visual model at the time the study was conducted, on the Bachelor in Computer Science section of Brazil’s 2021 National Undergraduate Exam (ENADE). By presenting the model with the exam’s open and multiple-choice questions in their original image format and allowing for reassessment in response to differing answer keys, we were able to evaluate the model’s reasoning and self-reflecting capabilities in a large-scale academic assessment involving textual and visual content. ChatGPT-4 Vision significantly outperformed the average exam participant, positioning itself within the top 10 best score percentile. While it excelled in questions that incorporated visual elements, it also encountered challenges with question interpretation, logical reasoning, and visual acuity. A positive correlation between the model’s performance in multiple-choice questions and the performance distribution of the human participants suggests multimodal LLMs can provide a useful tool for question testing and refinement. However, the involvement of an independent expert panel to review cases of disagreement between the model and the answer key revealed some poorly constructed questions containing vague or ambiguous statements, calling attention to the critical need for improved question design in future exams. Our findings suggest that while ChatGPT-4 Vision shows promise in multimodal academic evaluations, human oversight remains crucial for verifying the model’s accuracy and ensuring the fairness of high-stakes educational exams.

    "abstract": "Like digital technologies themselves, programming education is embedded in the colonial matrix of power, and access to programming knowledge demands immersion in the epistemologies of the Global North. While there is a growing body of work exploring ways to decolonise programming education, far more needs to be done. Current research focuses on the language of instruction and contextual curricula; outward-facing engagements with decolonisation. However, to move toward digital-decoloniality involves scrutinising how programming knowledge is recontextualised within curricula. Part of the project should be equipping both educators and students with the tools to recontextualise programming itself. To dismantle the colonial logic embedded in programming education, attention must be given to the knowledge formation of the discipline to identify moments of disruption. One such moment is the difficulty students face when recontextualising their mental models of computing, from programming skills to programming concepts. This occurs at the moment of reading, tracing and writing code. Programming requires one to refocus computational thinking and engage with a specific semiotic system, translating the authors' intention into an executable computational process. Disrupting this moment using the strategies of critical literacies opens computer programming and its resulting code to critical examination, allowing an inward-facing decolonial engagement with the discipline.",

    "abstract": "Background . Academic help-seeking benefits students’ achievement, but existing literature either studies important factors in students’ selection of all help resources via self-reported surveys or studies their help-seeking behavior in one or two separate help resources via actual help-seeking records. Little is known about whether computing students’ approaches and behavior match, and not much is understood about how they transition sequentially from one help resource to another. Objectives . We aim to study post-secondary computing students’ academic help-seeking approach and behavior. Specifically, we seek to investigate students’ self-reported orders of resource usage and whether these approaches match with students’ actual utilization of help resources. We also examine frequent patterns emerging from students’ chronological help-seeking records in course-affiliated help resources. Context and Study Method . We surveyed students’ self-reported orders of resource usage across 19 offerings of seven courses at two institutions, then analyzed their responses using various help resource dimensions identified by existing works. From two of these courses (an introduction to programming course and a data science course, 11 offerings), we obtained students’ help-seeking records in all course-affiliated help resources, along with code autograder records. We then compared students’ reported orders in these two courses against their actions in the records. Finally, we mined sequences of student help-seeking events from these two courses to reveal frequent sequential patterns. Findings . Students’ reported orders of help resource usage form a progression of clusters where resources in each cluster are more similar to each other by help resource dimensions than to resources outside of their cluster. This progression partially confirms phenomena and decision factors reported by existing literature, but no factor/dimension alone can explain the entire progression. We found students’ actual help-seeking records did not deviate much from their self-reported orders. Mining of the sequential records revealed that help-seeking from course-affiliated human resources led to measurable progress more often than not, and students’ usage of consulting/office hours (mainly run by undergraduate teaching assistants) itself was the best indicator for future usage within the lifespan of the same assignment. Implications . Our results demonstrate that computing students’ help resource selection/utilization is a sophisticated process that should be modeled and analyzed with sufficient awareness of its inherent sequentiality. We identify future research directions through this preliminary analysis, which can lead to a better understanding of computing students’ help-seeking behavior and better resource utilization/management in large-scale instructional contexts.",

This study addresses this gap by developing a Project-Based Arduino Robot Application (PARA) for teaching Robotics Programming to preservice teachers. A Research and Development (R&amp;D) design was employed, and data were collected from thirty-five (35) participants drawn from the Department of Computer and Robotics Education and the ICT Centre at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, using a total sampling technique. Three validated instruments were used: the Robotics Programming Needs Assessment Questionnaire (RPNEQ), PARA Expert Validation Questionnaire (PEVQ), and PARA User Satisfaction Scale (PUSC), with reliability coefficients of 0.87, 0.84, and 0.88, respectively. Data were analysed using mean, standard deviation and One-Sample T-Test. The results showed that effective strategies for teaching and learning programming include hands-on approaches, programming with tangible robotics kits that make learning engaging, using instructional videos, employing simple robotics projects that clarify control structures, and fostering teamwork in programming classes. Based on these findings, PARA was developed as a practical solution. Both experts and users expressed high levels of satisfaction with its design, usability, and educational impact. It is recommended that the Ministry of Education collaborate with schools to adopt project-based Arduino robot applications like PARA to enhance programming education, leveraging its benefits to improve learning outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Algorithm design is a vital skill developed in most undergraduate Computer Science (CS) programs, but few research studies focus on pedagogy related to algorithms coursework. To understand the work that has been done in the area, we present a systematic survey and literature review of CS Education studies. We search for research that is both related to algorithm design (as described by the ACM Curricular Guidelines) and evaluated on post-secondary-level students. Across all venues we searched prior to July 2024, we only find 102 such papers. We first classify these papers by topic, evaluation metric, evaluation methods, and intervention target. Through our classification, we find a broad sparsity of papers which indicates that many open questions remain about teaching algorithm design. We also note the need for papers using rigorous research methods, as only 43 out of 92 papers presenting quantitative data use statistical tests, and only 16 out of 47 papers presenting qualitative data follow a coding scheme. Only 18 papers report controlled trials. In addition, almost all authors only contribute to one publication, an indication that few groups are specializing on these topics. We then synthesize the results of the existing literature to give insights into what the corpus reveals about how we should teach algorithms. Broadly, we find that much of the literature explores implementing well-established practices, such as active learning or automated assessment, in the algorithms classroom. However, there are algorithms-specific results as well: a number of papers find that students may under-utilize certain algorithmic design techniques, and studies describe a variety of ways to select algorithms problems that increase student engagement and learning. The results we present, along with the publicly available set of papers collected, provide a detailed representation of the current corpus of CS Education work related to algorithm design and can orient further research in the area.",

Despite the age of SQL compilers, it still remains largely unclear what contributes to an effective SQL error message. With 2,052 answers yielded by 165 participants for qualitative analysis, this study is an attempt to understand what novices perceive as effective elements in SQL error messages. The results uniformly indicate that communicating the precise error position, articulating what is wrong in the query with clear natural language, and showing hints on how to fix the error are perceived as the most effective elements for error recovery. These insights have potential to be utilized in providing more effective error messages in SQL compilers and SQL learning environments, and for guiding generative artificial intelligence for enhanced error messages in order to minimize frustration caused by cryptic error messages, improving learning and adoption, and reducing debugging time.",

Teachers are critical to the efforts to expand access and equity in computer science education. Developing teachers’ knowledge, practice, and professional identity is one of the key standards for effective teachers. This study delves into the landscape of American computer science educators from the lens of teacher identity. Using survey data from 2,337 educators, we further developed and tested a measure of teacher identity specific to teachers of computer science. By investigating their sense of professional identity, this study identified five distinct profiles of computer science educators: committed, confident, and well-resourced proponents; committed, confident, but under-resourced proponents; moderates; unconfident and under-resourced proponents; and uncommitted, unconfident, and under-resourced skeptics. We further examined the professional backgrounds and teaching contexts of those educators in each profile. This study contributes a validated tool for understanding computer science teacher identity, offering empirical insights informing the preparation and development of effective educators for teaching computer science in schools.",

Contrary to relational databases, graph databases allow navigational queries with higher expressivity and lack an a priori schema. In this paper, we design a multi-step exploratory user study investigating these peculiarities and how they impact the student’s learning process. Focusing on the widely used Cypher graph query language, we studied a new taxonomy for classifying the errors around graph queries and conducted an in-depth analysis. Our investigation highlights several learning barriers, including misunderstanding the semantics of language constructs, the confusion between data and schema, and the pattern-matching mechanism. We expect the lessons learned and the derived best teaching practices to have an impact on database education and to influence future generations of students, researchers, and practitioners working on graph database technologies.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: In computing, Impostor Phenomenon (IP) has been viewed as a problem for many years, but little research has been done to show its prevalence. In 2020, IP in computing began to be explored at single institutions [68]. The results showed that IP is prevalent among undergraduate and graduate students in computing courses and that the rates of IP are higher for women. In 2022, these results were reaffirmed with a replication study including two institutions [82]. This is concerning due to the negative effects correlated with people who experience IP such as low self-esteem [19, 37] and anxiety [21, 38]. Objectives: This study aims to replicate these previous findings at a considerably larger scale to determine whether similar results are observed across institutions. To support future work, we conduct an exploratory analysis of student demographics, course factors, and institutional factors to gain insight into factors that may be associated with higher levels of IP among students. Methods: A survey consisting of Clance's IP scale (CIPS) and questions on students’ demographic and background information was given at 18 institutions. Higher CIPS scores indicate more IP experiences. Differences in CIPS scores were analyzed based on students’ demographics and background information (gender, race/ethnicity, transfer status, and chosen degree program), course factors (introductory computing courses vs. non-introductory computing courses, upper- vs. lower-division), and institutional factors (size of the institution, public vs. private, teaching- vs. research-centric). Results: Our results are consistent with previous findings that IP is prevalent among students in computing courses and that women have significantly higher CIPS scores of IP than men in computing, and that traditionally marginalized race/ethnicity status in computing and chosen degree program do not have an observable impact. In terms of course factors, we do not see a difference in scores based on whether students are enrolled in a lower- or upper-division course. We see that students enrolled in introductory computing (CS1) courses have statistically significant higher scores than students outside of CS1 courses. In terms of institutional factors, students in computing courses at public institutions have statistically significantly higher scores than students at private institutions. Students at medium-sized institutions have statistically significantly higher scores than students at small or large institutions. We do not find any difference based on whether an institution is teaching- or research-centric. Discussion: These results suggest that IP is prevalent in computing courses across the entire curriculum and across different types of institutions. Differences in demographic groups are consistent with prior work in computing, specifically higher rates among women, suggesting IP may be worth further inquiry as a potential factor in the gender participation gap in computing.",

    "abstract": "Programming is recognized as one of seven grand challenges in computing education. Decades of research have shown that the major problems novices experience are composition-based---they may know what the individual programming language constructs are, but they do not know how to put them together. Despite this fact, textbooks, educational practice, and programming education research hardly address the issue of teaching the skills needed for systematic development of programs. We provide a conceptual framework for incremental program development, called Stepwise Improvement, which unifies best practice in modern software development such as test-driven development and refactoring with the prevailing perspective of programming methodology, stepwise refinement. The conceptual framework enables well-defined characterizations of incremental program development. We utilize the conceptual framework to derive a programming process, STREAM, designed specifically for novices. STREAM is a carefully down-scaled version of a full and rich agile software engineering process particularly suited for novices learning object-oriented programming. In using it we hope to achieve two things: to help novice programmers learn faster and better while at the same time laying the foundation for a more thorough treatment of more advanced aspects of software engineering. In this article, two examples demonstrate the application of STREAM. The STREAM process has been taught in the introductory programming courses at our universities for the past three years and the results are very encouraging. We report on a small, preliminary study evaluating the learning outcome of teaching STREAM. The study indicates a positive effect on the development of students’ process competences.",

    "abstract": "At schools special learning and programming environments are often used in the field of algorithms. Particularly with regard to computer science lessons in secondary education, they are supposed to help novices to learn the basics of programming. In several parts of Germany (e.g., Bavaria) these fundamentals are taught as early as in the seventh grade, when pupils are 12 to 13 years old. Designed age-based learning and programming environments such as Karel the robot and Kara, the programmable ladybug, are used, but learners still underachieve. One possible approach to improving both the teaching and the learning process is to specify the knowledge concerning the learners’ individual problem solving strategies, their solutions, and their respective quality. A goal of the research project described here is to design the learning environment so that it can identify and categorize several problem-solving strategies automatically. Based on this knowledge, learning and programming environments can be improved, which will optimize the computer science lessons in which they are applied. Therefore, the environments must be enhanced with special analytic and diagnostic modules, the results of which can be given to the learner in the form of individualized system feedback messages in the future. In this text preliminary considerations are demonstrated. The research methodology as well as the design and the implementation of the research instruments are explained. We describe first studies, whose results are presented and discussed.",

Yet “liberal arts” can denote a philosophy of education that emphasizes broadly preparing students for all aspects of their future lives, and as computing becomes more central to the ways in which we think about the world, computer science becomes correspondingly more central in such an education. This, in turn, makes computer science more important in the programs of educational institutions that follow a liberal arts philosophy. This issue of Transactions on Computing Education presents three articles that examine the intersection of computer science and the liberal arts. Walker and Kelemen explore in detail how a liberal arts philosophy complements the needs of computer science education, and how computer science as a discipline fits the goals of a liberal arts philosophy. Bruce et al. present the history of a consortium of computer scientists from liberal arts colleges and the model computer science curricula they have developed for such colleges. Finally, Baldwin et al. describe the concrete computer science programs at five institutions, each with a distinct place in the liberal arts spectrum. We hope that these articles will advance understanding of computer science in the liberal arts, and inspire readers to incorporate liberal arts principles into their own computer science programs.",

The study identified the presence of a set of 42 CPs in computer programming (C language). The study used Verbal Protocol Analysis (VPA) in identifying these CPs. It is a qualitative study on the Verbal Protocols (VPs) of 19 students. Some of the CPs have been inferred by referring to the literature and some have been additionally identified by this study. The additional CPs found are confusion, hypothesis, interrogation, iteration, monitoring, recollection, recurrence, and translation. It is observed that programming involves the interplay of lower and higher CPs and needs various cognitive skills, which increase the processing load on the brain and make the programming process difficult and complex to learn and practice. The same set of CPs was found in both the effective and ineffective subjects. The research results can provide deeper knowledge to teachers on cognitive aspects of programming and the cognitive behavior of students during the programming process.",

    "abstract": "This article investigates relationships between media, mood, and communication in teams, and studies how they are related to project success. Team projects are an essential part of the software engineering curriculum. Student teams carry out full software projects, including requirements elicitation, project management, implementation, and testing. This requires various technical skills, but non-technical and psychological aspects are of utmost importance as well, just as in professional software teams. Modern software is often developed by distributed teams. In many cases, team members feel isolated and distant from each other. Indirect communication and inappropriate media create a similar feeling of distance as geographical location. This perceived distance could have an impact on their individual and group moods, and eventually on project success. Therefore, these factors should be considered in educational software engineering team projects. In a longitudinal study at Leibniz Universität Hannover, 20 student teams were observed over a period of 4 months. They were free to schedule team meetings when and where they wanted; and they could use any communication media they chose. Statistical correlations and non-parametric test are used for quantitative empirical analysis. Furthermore, we used analyses of variance for repeated measures to investigate conflicts over time. Results led to a number of recommendations for course organizers. They are interesting for software engineering in general.",

The course is a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC), as the attendance scales without an upper bound. Schools in Finland have offered the MOOC as an elective CS course for their students and granted formal school credits for completing (parts of) it. Since our MOOC is exactly the same programming course as our university-level CS1 course, we are able to use the MOOC also as a long-lasting entrance exam to the CS BSc and MSc degrees. After two spring semesters of operation, we have observed that there are school students dispersed around Finland who are ready and willing to take on a challenging programming course online, and bridging the MOOC to a full study right makes a strong incentive to keep working on the programming assignments, even without traditional teaching.",

    "abstract": "The computing education research literature contains a wide variety of methods that can be used to identify students who are either at risk of failing their studies or who could benefit from additional challenges. Many of these are based on machine-learning models that learn to make predictions based on previously observed data. However, in educational contexts, differences between courses set huge challenges for the generalizability of these methods. For example, traditional machine-learning methods assume identical distribution in all data—in our terms, traditional machine-learning methods assume that all teaching contexts are alike. In practice, data collected from different courses can be very different as a variety of factors may change, including grading, materials, teaching approach, and the students. Transfer-learning methodologies have been created to address this challenge. They relax the strict assumption of identical distribution for training and test data. Some similarity between the contexts is still needed for efficient learning. In this work, we review the concept of transfer learning especially for the purpose of predicting the outcome of an introductory programming course and contrast the results with those from traditional machine-learning methods. The methods are evaluated using data collected in situ from two separate introductory programming courses. We empirically show that transfer-learning methods are able to improve the predictions, especially in cases with limited amount of training data, for example, when making early predictions for a new context. The difference in predictive power is, however, rather subtle, and traditional machine-learning models can be sufficiently accurate assuming the contexts are closely related and the features describing the student activity are carefully chosen to be insensitive to the fine differences.",

Previous work in this area, conducted by Richard, coined the term “bidirectionally responsive design” (BRD) to describe the design of dual-feedback systems using multiple digital and physical interfaces. BRD also emphasizes using simplified fabrication tools, media and coding platforms, and microcontrollers common in youth content creation communities and makerspaces. This study provides a framework to analyze computational concepts, practices, and perspectives that leverage an integrated systems and multimodal learning approach, such as BRD, adding to, building on, and integrating previous analytic approaches to looking at Scratch coding, media design, physical computing and e-textiles. Using a detailed case study of one team during one of the early workshop iterations, we conduct a multimodal analysis of bidirectionally responsive making activities and discuss the ways that they present novel understanding of integrating diverse interests and encouraging collaborative and distributed computational thinking. We further examine how BRD operationalizes and extends multimodal learning theory by adding tangible and integrative dimensions as additional modalities learners can leverage to facilitate meaning making, metacognition, and agency. We also discuss how designing integrated systems, as facilitated through BRD, provides an opportunity to engage in authentic practices around the design of complex systems.",

This is especially true in K–12 contexts where computer science expertise is less prevalent. To aid in the decision-making process around computing curricula, this article introduces the TEC Rubric. The TEC Rubric is composed of three main categories: Teacher Accessibility, Equity, and Content designed to support educational decision makers and designers when it comes to computing instruction. Along with presenting the full rubric and the process used in its creation, this article describes two examples of the rubric in action. First, the TEC Rubric is used to evaluate two widespread computer science curricula to demonstrate its evaluative capacity highlighting differences between the two curricula. Second, we show how the TEC Rubric can be used to help inform the design of new K–12 computing curricula. Overall, the TEC Rubric is designed to serve as a useful resource in the ongoing quest to bring effective, equitable, and engaging computing instruction into schools around the world.",

Nevertheless, it is not well understood how the stereotypes that children hold about computer scientists contribute to CS interest and career choice. In this study, we set out to examine the complex relationships between CS interest, held stereotypes, and CS career choice. We surveyed participants in an after-school CS program offered to middle school boys who identified with racial and ethnic minority groups ( N = 110). We tested three linear regression models and confirmed that CS interest and socially divergent stereotypes—those that diverged from societal norms—of computer scientists play unique and contrary roles in young boys’ career decision-making process even when controlling for home and school factors. These models suggest educational CS programs should include curriculum to dispel participants’ socially divergent stereotypes about computer scientists rather than targeting CS interest alone, particularly if a goal is to inspire diverse young people to pursue careers in CS.",

    "abstract": "We define and describe the academic studio model for interdisciplinary, undergraduate, project-oriented education. This model brings faculty, students, and community partners together to investigate an open-ended academic question, and their collaboration yields an original product that represents their inquiry. The academic studio integrates agile software development practice, project-oriented pedagogy, and sociocultural cognition theories. Scrum provides the framework in which self-organizing, cross-functional teams define their methodology, and Scrum practices facilitate assessment of student learning outcomes. This model emerged from design-based research across six studio instances, each of which investigated the relationship of fun, games, and learning through the development of educational video games. Formal and informal analysis of these instances gives rise to several themes, including the importance of a formalized process to encourage learning and productivity, the critical role of an expert faculty mentor, the need to combine academic and industrial practice to manage the inherent challenges of collaborative software development, and the unique characteristics of learning outcomes arising from this model. We conclude that the academic studio model is beneficial to student learning and faculty development, and we encourage the adoption, adaptation, and evaluation of the model.",

    "abstract": "Electronic textiles, which integrate computation with fabrics through a redesigned interface of microcontrollers, sensors, and actuators, have expanded possibilities not only for engineering, fashion, and human-computer interaction but also for computer science education itself. While individual studies involving electronic textiles have shown promise to diversify participation, raise interest, and deepen learning in computing, especially for female students, we recognized a need to synthesize findings across studies to understand the overall contribution of electronic textiles to computing education. In this article, we report our findings from a meta-synthesis of 64 educational electronic textiles studies to answer the following questions in computing: (1) Did electronic textiles broaden access and participation? (2) How did electronic textiles support learners’ interests and sustain participation? (3) What and how did students learn from electronic textile projects? Our meta-synthesis revealed that although electronic textiles successfully broadened access, supported learners’ interests, and introduced basic computational concepts to novice learners, questions around equitable participation and deeper disciplinary engagement persist. We discuss directions for future design and research efforts to explore the full potential of e-textiles in computer science education.",

    "abstract": "The Computer Science for All movement is bringing CS to K-12 classrooms across the nation. At the same time, new technologies created by computer scientists have been reproducing existing inequities that directly impact today's youth, while being “promoted and perceived as more objective or progressive than the discriminatory systems of a previous era” [1, p. 5–6]. Current efforts are being made to expose students to the social impact and ethics of computing at both the K-12 and university-level—which we refer to as “socially responsible computing” (SRC) in this paper. Yet there is a lack of research describing what such SRC teaching and learning actively involve and look like, particularly in K-12 classrooms. This paper fills this gap with findings from a research-practice partnership, through a qualitative study in an Advanced Placement Computer Science Principles classroom enrolling low-income Latino/a/x students from a large urban community. The findings illustrate 1) details of teaching practice and student learning during discussions about SRC; 2) the impact these SRC experiences have on student engagement with CS; 3) a teacher's reflections on key considerations for effective SRC pedagogy; and 4) why students’ perspectives and agency must be centered through SRC in computing education.",

    "abstract": "Despite increasing demands for skilled workers within the technological domain, there is still a deficit in the number of graduates in computing fields (computer science, information technology, and computer engineering). Understanding the factors that contribute to students’ motivation and persistence is critical to helping educators, administrators, and industry professionals better focus efforts to improve academic outcomes and job placement. This article examines how experiences contribute to a student’s computing identity, which we define by their interest, recognition, sense of belonging, and competence/performance beliefs. In particular, we consider groups underrepresented in these disciplines, women and minoritized racial/ethnic groups (Black/African American and Hispanic/Latinx). To delve into these relationships, a survey of more than 1,600 students in computing fields was conducted at three metropolitan public universities in Florida. Regression was used to elucidate which experiences predict computing identity and how social identification (i.e., as female, Black/African American, and/or Hispanic/Latinx) may interact with these experiences. Our results suggest that several types of experiences positively predict a student’s computing identity, such as mentoring others, having a job, or having friends in computing. Moreover, certain experiences have a different effect on computing identity for female and Hispanic/Latinx students. More specifically, receiving academic advice from teaching assistants was more positive for female students, receiving advice from industry professionals was more negative for Hispanic/Latinx students, and receiving help on classwork from students in their class was more positive for Hispanic/Latinx students. Other experiences, while having the same effect on computing identity across students, were experienced at significantly different rates by females, Black/African American students, and Hispanic/Latinx students. The findings highlight experiential ways in which computing programs can foster computing identity development, particularly for underrepresented and marginalized groups in computing.",

To systematically advance knowledge, publications must be clear enough to support replications, meta-analyses, and theory-building. The goal of this study is to characterize the reporting of empiricism in CER literature by identifying whether publications include information to support replications, meta-analyses, and theory building. The research questions are: RQ1) What percentage of papers in CER venues have empirical evaluation? RQ2) What are the characteristics of the empirical evaluation? RQ3) Do the papers with empirical evaluation follow reporting norms (both for inclusion and for labeling of key information)? We conducted an SLR of 427 papers published during 2014 and 2015 in five CER venues: SIGCSE TS, ICER, ITiCSE, TOCE, and CSE. We developed and applied the CER Empiricism Assessment Rubric. Over 80% of papers had some form of empirical evaluation. Quantitative evaluation methods were the most frequent. Papers most frequently reported results on interventions around pedagogical techniques, curriculum, community, or tools. There was a split in papers that had some type of comparison between an intervention and some other data set or baseline. Many papers lacked properly reported research objectives, goals, research questions, or hypotheses, description of participants, study design, data collection, and threats to validity. CER authors are contributing empirical results to the literature; however, not all norms for reporting are met. We encourage authors to provide clear, labeled details about their work so readers can use the methodologies and results for replications and meta-analyses. As our community grows, our reporting of CER should mature to help establish computing education theory to support the next generation of computing learners.",

    "abstract": "Computational Thinking (CT ), entailing both domain-general and domain-specific skills, is a competency fundamental to computing education and beyond. However, as a cross-domain competency, appropriate assessment design and method remain equivocal. Indeed, the majority of the existing assessments have a predominant focus on measuring programming proficiency and neglecting other contexts in which CT can also be manifested. To broaden the promotion and practice of CT, it is necessary to integrate diverse problem types and item formats using a competency-based assessment method to measure CT. Taking a psychometric approach, this article evaluates a novel computer-based assessment of CT competency, Computational Thinking Challenge. The assessment was administered to 119 British upper secondary school students ( M = 16.11; SD = 1.19) with a range of prior programming experiences. Results from several reliability analyses, a convergent validity analysis, and a Rasch analysis, provided evidence to support the quality of the assessment. Taken together, the study demonstrated the feasibility to expand from traditional assessment methods to integrating multiple contexts, problem types, and item formats in measuring CT competency in a comprehensive manner.",

Research indicates that student interest is a key predictor of persistence and achievement. While there is a growing body of work on developing computing identities for diverse students, little research focuses on early exposure to develop multilingual students’ interest in computing. These students represent one of the fastest growing populations in the US, yet they are dramatically underrepresented in computer science education. This study examines identity development of upper elementary multilingual students as they engage in a year-long computational thinking curriculum, and follows their engagement across multiple settings (i.e., school, club, home, community). Findings from pre- and post-surveys of identity showed significant differences favoring students’ experiences with computer science, their perceptions of computer science, their perceptions of themselves as computer scientists, and their family support for computer science. Findings from follow-up interviews and prior research suggest that tailored instruction provides opportunities for connections to out-of-school learning environments with friends and family that may shift students’ perceptions of their abilities to pursue computer science and persist when encountering challenges.",

    "abstract": "Objectives. Java is a popular programming language for use in computing education, but it is difficult to get a wide picture of the issues that it presents for novices; most studies look only at the types or frequency of errors. In this observational study, we aim to learn how novices use different features of the Java language. Participants. Users of the BlueJ development environment have been invited to opt in to anonymously record their activity data for the past 8 years. This dataset is called Blackbox, which was used as the basis for this study. BlueJ users are mostly novice programmers, predominantly male, with a median age of 16 years. Our data subset featured approximately 225,000 participants from around the world. Study Methods. We performed a secondary data analysis that used data from the Blackbox dataset. We examined over 320,000 Java projects collected over the course of 8 years and used source code analysis to investigate the prevalence of various specifically selected Java programming usage patterns. As this was an observational study without specific hypotheses, we did not use significance tests. Instead, we present the results themselves with commentary, having applied seasonal trend decomposition to the data. Findings. We found many long-term trends in the data over the course of the 8 years, most of which were monotonic. There was a notable reduction in the use of the main method (common in Java but unnecessary in BlueJ) and a general reduction in the complexity of the projects. We find that there is only a small number of frequently used types: int, String, double, and Boolean, but also a wide range of other infrequently used types. Conclusions. We find that programming usage patterns gradually change over a long period of time (a period in which the Java language was not seeing major changes) once seasonal patterns are accounted for. Any changes are likely driven by instructors and the changing demographics of programming novices. The novices use a relatively restricted subset of Java, which implies that designers of languages specifically targeted at novices can satisfy their needs with a smaller set of language constructs and features. We provide detailed recommendations for the designers of educational programming languages and supporting development tools.",

However, the characteristics of competency models related to the information security and cybersecurity domains are not well understood. To bridge this gap, this study investigates the current state of competency models related to the security domain through qualitative content analysis. Additionally, based on the competency model analysis, an evidence-based competency model is proposed. Examining the content of 27 models, we found that the models can benefit target groups in many different ways, ranging from policymaking to performance management. Owing to their many uses, competency models can arguably help to narrow the skills gap from which the profession is suffering. Nonetheless, the models have their shortcomings. First, the models do not cover all of the topics specified by the Cybersecurity Body of Knowledge (i.e., no model is complete). Second, by omitting social, personal, and methodological competencies, many models reduce the competency profile of a security expert to professional competencies. Addressing the limitations of previous work, the proposed competency model provides a holistic view of the competencies required by security professionals for job achievement and can potentially benefit both the education system and the labor market. To conclude, the implications of the competency model analysis and use cases of the proposed model are discussed.",

Findings from a Wilcoxon signed-rank test and a general linear regression of the teacher surveys revealed that teachers’ confidence in teaching CS and in meeting the needs of students with disabilities increased over the 5 month coaching study, but their understanding of UDL remained low throughout the study. A qualitative thematic analysis of open-response survey questions revealed that the teachers could identify instructional strategies that support the inclusion of students with disabilities in CS instruction. These strategies aligned with high leverage practices (HLPs) and included modeling, the use of explicit instruction, and opportunities for repeated instruction. When asked to identify UDL approaches, however, they had more difficulty. The focus group with coaches revealed that the coaches’ primary aim related broadly to equity and specifically to access to and the quality of CS instruction. However, although they introduced UDL-based strategies, they struggled to systematically incorporate UDL into coaching activities and did not explicitly label these strategies as part of the UDL framework on a consistent basis. This finding explains, to a large extent, the teachers’ limited understanding of UDL in the context of CS education.",

Our study participants were 42 HCI graduate students who completed UX internships. They came from computing and related disciplines, including computer science, information technology, psychology, and design. Some of the participants’ internship titles were Interaction Designer, Design Researcher, UX Programmer, and Business Intelligence Analyst. Study Method. We conducted a thematic analysis on 42 graduate students’ UX internship reports that were collected over 6 years to uncover themes in relation to our two research questions. Findings. As for UX internship benefits, we found that students learned about the workplace culture (e.g., academia vs. industry/government on research design processes) and core UX technical (e.g., research, design, programming) and people skills (e.g., teamwork, empathy toward end-users); they also realized what they wanted in future careers after completing their internships. We also found internship challenges that were related to the internship program (e.g., the availability of internship opportunities), the host organizations (e.g., the quality of mentorship received), and remote working (e.g., difficulty over conducting remote usability testing). Conclusions. We make practical recommendations for HCI educators, UX practitioners, and HCI graduate students on how they can work collaboratively to create a meaningful UX internship experience.

    "abstract": "A rich body of empirically grounded results and a solid theory base have often been viewed as signs of a mature discipline. Many disciplines have frequently debated what they should accept as legitimate kinds of theories, the proper roles of theory, and appropriate reference disciplines. Computing education research (CER) in particular has seen a growing number of calls for the development of domain-specific theories for CER, an adaptation of theories from other fields, and engagement with theory-based experimental and predictive research in CER. Many of those calls share the same concerns and aims, yet they use very different vocabulary and lack a consensus over an essential concept: theory. This article presents sticking points and trouble spots in CER’s theory debates and presents a number of suggestions and ways forward. Firstly, by slightly shifting towards a model-based view of science, CER can avoid centuries of conceptual baggage related to the concept of theory. Secondly, insofar as fields like design, engineering, and social science are considered to be legitimate parts of CER, the role of theory in many CER studies needs to be judged by the criteria of the philosophy of engineering, technology, and social science, not the philosophy of (natural) science. Thirdly, instead of force-fitting elements of ill-suited research paradigms from other disciplines, the philosophy of CER should focus on building a consensus on CER’s own paradigm and describing the field’s relationship with theory in CER’s own terms.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this conceptual article is to provide a framework and a lens for educators in diversifying and making CS education more inclusive. In this article, we conceptualize the notion of computer science capital (CSC), which extends Bourdieu’s sociological theory of capital and Archer et al.’s work on “science capital.” The CSC concept was developed by contrasting the concept of science capital with a literature review on key factors affecting students’ aspirations in CS. We argue that there is a need to distinguish between science capital and CSC, because the types of capital that are considered legitimate vary between the field of natural science and computer science. The CSC concept uses a sociocultural perspective on learning and can be understood as a form of symbolic capital that is influential in facilitating students’ possibility to fully participate in, engage with, and form aspirations in CS. The CSC concept consists of three main components, each with associated subcomponents. We believe our CSC framework, along with the self-reflection prompts included in this article, will offer support for reflections for educators in their daily pedagogical work. By taking students’ various levels of social and cultural capital into consideration, educators can plan didactic activities with a focus to strengthen students’ various types of capital. This includes reflection on how implicit and explicit norms, beliefs, thoughts, expectations, values, and ideas can affect the pedagogical practices and ultimately the students. Only when we are reflective about our teaching practices can we be better positioned to construct a more inclusive teaching and learning environment.",

This, together with the emergence of domain-specific theory, is often taken as an indicator of the maturity of any research area. This article explores the development and subsequent usage of domain-specific theories and theoretical constructs (TCs) in computing education research (CER). All TCs found in 878 papers published in three major CER publication venues over the period 2005–2020 were identified and assessed to determine the nature and purpose of the constructs found. We focused more closely on areas related to learning, studying, and progression, where our analysis found 80 new TCs that had been developed, based on multiple epistemological perspectives. Several existing frameworks were used to categorize the areas of CER focus in which TCs were found, the methodology by which they were developed, and the nature and purpose of the TCs. A citation analysis was undertaken, with 1,727 citing papers accessed to determine to what extent and in what ways TCs had been used and developed to inform subsequent work, also considering whether these aspects vary according to different focus areas within computing education. We noted which TCs were used most often and least often, and we present several brief case studies that demonstrate progressive development of domain-specific theory. The exploration provides insights into trends in theory development and suggests areas in which further work might be called for. Our findings indicate a general interest in the development of TCs during the period studied, and we show examples of how different approaches to theory development have been used. We present a framework suggesting how strategies for developing new TCs in CER might be structured and discuss the nature of theory development in relation to the field of CER.",

In this work, we explore an out-of-school dance and computing educational program run by the organization, STEM From Dance. The organizational mission is to create an equitable learning experience for young women of color to engage with computing while exposing them to STEM careers. Through an analysis of eleven interviews with youth participants, instructors, and the executive director, we examine how the social, cultural, and political dimensions of the learning environment facilitate identity work in computing and dance. Our findings point to three primary activities used by the organization to promote equity: (1) providing psychological safety through a supportive community environment, (2) meaningfully engaging with learners’ social and cultural context through creative work with constructionist artifacts, and (3) actively promoting identity work as women of color in computing and STEM through both artifact work and community events. Applying the constructs of identity and psychological safety we explore the tensions and synergies of designing for equity in this performing arts and computing learning environment. We demonstrate how the seemingly contradictory elements of a high-stakes performance within a novice learning environment provides unique opportunities for supporting young women of color in computing, making them non-negotiable in the organization’s efforts to promote equity and inclusion. Our work illustrates how attending closely to the sociocultural dimensions in a constructionist learning environment provides lenses for navigating equity, identity work, and support for inclusive computing.",

    "abstract": "Computational thinking (CT) is playing an increasingly relevant role within disciplinary teaching in elementary school, particularly in science. However, many teachers are unfamiliar with CT, either because their education occurred before the popularization of CT or because CT instruction was not included in their pre-service coursework. For these teachers, CT professional development (PD) becomes a primary mechanism to close their CT knowledge gap. While CT PD has demonstrated success at increasing teacher's CT understanding, researchers have reported varied outcomes in supporting teachers to write CT-integrated lesson plans. To explore how we might support teachers to integrate CT into elementary science, we employed design-based research (DBR) in a dual-track design of in-class CT instruction for pre-service undergraduates within an elementary science methods class paired with a collaborative, multi-month PD opportunity for pre- and in-service teachers. In this article, we reflect on our 5-year period of DBR and present our design insights and implications for CT instruction and curriculum design from each iteration. Our findings on best practices will inform both teacher educators and PD providers within CT education. Our work will also be of interest to researchers considering DBR for technology-based educational projects.",

    "abstract": "Teaching computer science (CS) in high schools, rather than just programming or even computer literacy, is important as a means of introducing students to the true nature of CS, and enhancing their problem-solving skills. Since teachers are the key to the success of any high school educational initiative, any discussion of high school programs must consider the teachers, and specifically the teacher preparation needed to make the implementation of such programs possible. However, there is scant research on CS teacher education, probably because CS is a relatively young discipline. Very few of the publications in the area of CS teacher preparation are research-based. Most are descriptive papers, including recommendations for specific programs or courses. The purpose of this survey is to import from what is already known in other disciplines in this context. We therefore examine the body of research on teacher education in other disciplines, especially in mathematics and science, to shed light on important challenges for CS teacher education and draw some initial conclusions regarding CS teacher preparation programs.",

    "abstract": "This article describes an extensive evaluation of introducing a game project to a software architecture course. In this project, university students have to construct and design a type of software architecture, evaluate the architecture, implement an application based on the architecture, and test this implementation. In previous years, the domain of the software architecture project has been a robot controller for navigating a maze. In 2008, the students on the software architecture course chose between the two domains: Khepera robot simulation in Java and XNA game development in C#. Independent of the domain chosen, the students had to go through the same phases, produce the same documents based on the same templates, and follow exactly the same process. This article describes an evaluation where we wanted to investigate if a game development project could successfully be used to teach software architecture. Specifically in the evaluation, the effect of the choice of COTS (Commercial Off-The-Shelf) and domain is compared in relation to popularity of the project type, how the students perceive the project, the complexity of the software architectures produced, the effort put into the project, and the grades achieved for the project and the written examination. The main conclusion is that game development projects can successfully be used to teach software architecture. Further, the results of the evaluation show among other things that students who chose the Game project produced software architecture with higher complexity, and put more effort into the project than the Robot project students. No significant statistical differences were found in final grades awarded to the Game project students vs. Robot project students. However, the Game project students obtained a higher grade in their project than in the written examination, whereas the Robot project students scored higher in the written examination than in their project. Finally compared to the Robot project students, those that chose the Game project had fewer problems with COTS hindering the architecture design and introducing technical challenges.",

The students attend a charter high school designed to encourage low-income Latino students to attend college and attain proficiency in English, Spanish, and computers. Using data from surveys and by analyzing test scores, the authors quantify the characteristics of students who are likely to choose CS as a major. A survey of 139 tenth- through twelfth-grade Latino students is used to determine factors that influence CS major selection. The survey includes questions from a previous study (836 high school math students from 9 public and private schools) as a control. Additional questions measure student interest in 20 STEM, business, and humanities subjects. Standardized test scores are correlated with factors affecting choice of CS as a major. Environment and intervention programs in, after, and outside of school are examined to consider their impact on student development. The article provides a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the relationship among academic environment and performance, subject interests, gender, and teaching methods that influence the interest of Latino high school students in choosing CS as a major.",

Students as well as teachers rank examples as the most important resources for learning to program. Example programs work as role models and must therefore always be consistent with the principles and rules we are teaching. However, it is difficult to find or develop examples that are fully faithful to all principles and guidelines of the object-oriented paradigm and also follow general pedagogical principles and practices. Unless students are able to engage with good examples, they will not be able to tell desirable from undesirable properties in their own and others’ programs. In this article we report on a study in which experienced educators evaluated the quality of object-oriented example programs for novices from popular Java textbooks. The evaluation was accomplished using an online checklist that elicited responses on the technical, object-oriented, and didactic quality of examples. In total 25 reviewers contributed 215 reviews to our dataset, based on 38 example programs from 13 common introductory programming textbooks. Results show that the evaluation instrument is reliable in terms of inter-rater agreement. Overall, example quality was not as good as one might expect from common textbooks, in particular regarding certain object-oriented properties. We conclude that educators should be careful when taking examples straight out of a textbook.",

    "abstract": "Computer science (CS) and its enabling technologies are at the heart of this information age, yet its adoption as a core subject by senior secondary students in Indian schools is low and has not reached critical mass. Though there have been efforts to create core curriculum standards for subjects like Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Math, CS seems to have been kept outside the purview of such efforts leading to its marginalization. As a first step, using the Darmstadt model from the ITiCSE working group that provides a systematic categorization approach to CS education in schools, we coded and analyzed the CS situation for the Indian schools. Next, we focused on the motivation category of the Darmstadt model and investigated behavioral intentions of secondary school students and teachers from 332 schools in India. Considering the CS subject as an educational innovation, using Rogers’ Theory of Diffusion of Innovations, we propose a pedagogical framework for innovation attributes that can significantly predict-adoption of the CS subject among potential-adopter students and teachers. Data was analyzed to answer research questions about student and teacher intentions, influence of gender, school management, and school location in adopting CS. Interestingly, girls, urban students, teachers, and private schools were seen favoring the adoption of CS. An important issue that needed to be addressed, however, was the interchangeable use of terms like CS, Informatics, ICT, and digital literacy. Through our article, we offer a promising picture of the educational policy directives and the academic environment in India that is rapidly growing and embracing CS as a core subject of study in schools. We also analyze the factors that influence the adoption of CS by school students and teachers and conclude that there is a very positive response for CS among educators and students in India.",

    "abstract": "In the United States, the number of students entering into and completing degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) areas has declined significantly over the past decade. Although modest increases have been shown in enrollments in computer-related majors in the past 4 years, the prediction is that even in 3 to 4 years when these students graduate, there will be shortages of computer-related professionals for industry. The challenge on which this article focuses is attracting students to select an information technology (IT) field such as computer science, computer engineering, software engineering, or information systems as a major when many high schools do not offer a single computer course, and high school counselors, families, and friends do not provide students with accurate information about the field. The social cognitive career theory (SCCT) has been used extensively within counseling and career psychology as a method for understanding how individuals develop vocational interests, make occupational choices, and achieve success within their chosen field. In this article, the SCCT model identifies factors that specifically influence high school students to select a major in an IT-related discipline. These factors can then be used to develop new or enhance existing IT-related activities for high school students. Our work demonstrates that both interest and outcome expectations have a significant positive impact on choice to major. Interest also is found to mediate the effects of self-efficacy and outcome expectations on choice of major. Overall, the model predicts a good portion of variance in the ultimate outcome of whether or not an individual chooses to major in IT.",

Results suggest that female faculty, associate professors, and those teaching courses with enrollment above 80 students are more likely to use these student-centered practices. Across all responses, 20% of faculty use student--student interaction on a regular basis during class. In contrast, 38% of faculty rely on lectures for content delivery. Results were also compared with published data for other academic disciplines. CS faculty are less likely to use these practices compared to their non-STEM colleagues but more likely to use these practices compared to other STEM discipline faculty. Overall, CS faculty have adopted student-centered practices to some degree, but our community should strive for higher adoption rates to help as many students as possible learn and remain in computer science.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary research has explored educational robotics, but it has not examined the development of computational thinking in the context of programming embodied interactions. Apart from the goal of the robot and how the robot will interact with its environment, another important aspect that should be taken into consideration is whether and how the user will physically interact with the robot. We recruited 36 middle school students to participate in a six-session robotics curriculum in an attempt to expand their learning in computational thinking. Participants were asked to develop interfaces for the remote control of a robot using diverse interaction styles from low-level to high-level embodiment, such as touch, speech, and hand and full-body gestures. We measured students’ perception of computing, examined their computational practices, and assessed the development of their computational thinking skills by analyzing the sophistication of the projects they created during a problem-solving task. We found that students who programmed combinations of low embodiment interfaces or interfaces with no embodiment produced more sophisticated projects and adopted more sophisticated computational practices compared to those who programmed full-body interfaces. These findings suggest that there might be a tradeoff between the appeal and the cognitive benefit of rich embodied interaction with a remotely controlled robot. In further work, educational robotics research and competitions might be complemented with a hybrid approach that blends the traditional autonomous robot movement with student enactment.",

    "abstract": "In this article, the development of the Swedish informatics curriculum during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s is studied and described. The study’s design is inspired by the curriculum theory presented by Lindensjö and Lundgren [2000], who suggest using the concept of arenas (the arenas of enactment, transformation and realisation) when discussing curriculum development. Data collection in this study comprises activities and actors in the arenas of enactment and transformation. Collected data include contemporary articles, journals, reports, booklets, government documents and archived documents. Findings show that informatics education in Sweden evolved from primarily focusing on programming knowledge related to automatic data processing and offered exclusively in vocational education (the 1960s and 1970s) to later (early 1980s) being introduced in the upper secondary school curriculum under the heading Datakunskap . The enactment of the informatics curriculum in 1983 encompassed programming, system development and computing in relation to applied sciences and civics. Mathematics teachers did much of the experimental work. It is shown that the competencies of upper secondary school teachers at the time rarely corresponded to the demands of the subject (content knowledge, resources and pedagogical skills). Stereotypical examples were therefore developed to support teachers in instructing about the subject content. When implemented in the theoretical natural science-programme, system development/systemisation was transformed into a twofold issue, comprising vocational attributes and societal aspects of computer programming. The implementation of today’s informatics education, including programming in the curriculum, should draw from lessons learned from history. For a successful outcome, this study emphasises the necessity to understand 1) the common incentives for introducing computer programming in the curriculum, 2) the requirement for teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge and 3) the stakeholders’ role in the curriculum development process.",

    "abstract": "Employers require software engineers to work in teams when developing software systems. It is therefore important for graduates to have experienced teamwork before they enter the job market. We describe an experiential learning exercise that we designed to teach the software engineering process in conjunction with teamwork skills. The underlying teaching strategy applied in the exercise maximises risks in order to provide maximal experiential learning opportunities. The students are expected to work in fairly large, yet short-lived, instructor-assigned teams to complete software engineering tasks. After undergoing the exercise our students form self-selected teams for their capstone projects. In this article, we determine and report on the influence the teaching exercise had on the formation of teams for the capstone project. By analysing data provided by the students through regular peer reviews we gain insight into the team dynamics as well as to what extent the members contributed to the team effort. We develop and present a graphical model of a capstone project team which highlights participation of individuals during the teaching exercise. The participatory history of the members is visualised using segmented concentric rings. We consider how this visualisation can aid the identification of capstone project teams that are at risk. In our experience the composition of the team and the behaviour of other members in the team may have a marked impact on the behaviour of each individual in the team. We established a team classification in order to model information about teams. We use a statistical clustering method to classify teams. For this we use team profiles that are based on the participatory levels of its members. The team types that emerge from the clustering are used to derive migration models. When we consider migration, we build spring models to visualise the teams through which individuals migrate. We colour code the teams to characterise them according to the team types that were identified during the cluster classification of the teams. Owing to the complexity of the resulting model, only migrations for capstone team members who have worked together during the exercise or for solitary capstone team members are modelled. These models support the identification of areas of interest that warrant further investigation. To conclude, we present our observations from the analysis of team compositions, team types, and team migrations and provide directions for future work and collaborations.",

    "abstract": "Programming skills are an increasingly desirable asset across disciplines; however, learning to program continues to be difficult for many students. To improve pedagogy, we need to better understand the concepts that students find difficult and which have the biggest impact on their learning. Threshold-concept theory provides a potential lens on student learning, focusing on concepts that are troublesome and transformative. However, there is still a lack of consensus as to what the most relevant threshold concepts in programming are. The challenges involved are related to concept granularity and to evidencing some of the properties expected of threshold concepts. In this article, we report on a qualitative study aiming to address some of these concerns. The study involved focus groups with undergraduate students of different-year groups as well as professional software developers so as to gain insights into how perspectives on concepts change over time. Four concepts emerged from the data, where the majority of participants agreed on their troublesome nature—including abstract classes and data structures. Some of these concepts are considered transformative, too, but the evidence base is weaker. However, even though these concepts may not be considered transformative in the “big” sense of threshold concept theory, we argue the “soft” transformative effect of such concepts means they can provide important guidance for pedagogy and the design of programming courses. Further analysis of the data identified additional concepts that may hinder rather than help the learning of these threshold concepts, which we have called “accidental complexities.” We conclude the article with a critique of the use of threshold concepts as a lens for studying students’ learning of programming.",

    "abstract": "Problem: The involvement of external stakeholders in capstone projects and project courses is desirable due to its potential positive effects on the students. Capstone projects particularly profit from the inclusion of an industrial partner to make the project relevant and help students acquire professional skills. In addition, an increasing push towards education that is aligned with industry and incorporates industrial partners can be observed. However, the involvement of external stakeholders in teaching moments can create friction and could, in the worst case, lead to frustration of all involved parties. Contribution: We developed a model that allows analysing the involvement of external stakeholders in university courses both in a retrospective fashion, to gain insights from past course instances, and in a constructive fashion, to plan the involvement of external stakeholders. Key Concepts: The conceptual model and the accompanying guideline guide the teachers in their analysis of stakeholder involvement. The model is comprised of several activities (define, execute, and evaluate the collaboration). The guideline provides questions that the teachers should answer for each of these activities. In the constructive use, the model allows teachers to define an action plan based on an analysis of potential stakeholders and the pedagogical objectives. In the retrospective use, the model allows teachers to identify issues that appeared during the project and their underlying causes. Drawing from ideas of the reflective practitioner, the model contains an emphasis on reflection and interpretation of the observations made by the teacher and other groups involved in the courses. Key Lessons: Applying the model retrospectively to a total of eight courses shows that it is possible to reveal hitherto implicit risks and assumptions and to gain a better insight into the interaction between external stakeholders and students. Our empirical data reveals seven recurring risk themes that categorise the different risks appearing in the analysed courses. These themes can also be used to categorise mitigation strategies to address these risks proactively. Additionally, aspects not related to external stakeholders, e.g., about the interaction of the project with other courses in the study programme, have been revealed. The constructive use of the model for one course has proved helpful in identifying action alternatives and finally deciding to not include external stakeholders in the project due to the perceived cost-benefit-ratio. Implications to Practice: Our evaluation shows that the model is a viable and useful tool that allows teachers to reason about and plan the involvement of external stakeholders in a variety of course settings, and in particular in capstone projects.",

    "abstract": "Global Software Development (GSD) is currently a strong industry trend. This means that if computer science engineers are to be trained to deal with this model, it is very important to include the topic in software engineering courses, attempting to ensure that students learn about GSD and become familiar with its advantages and challenges. However, software engineering courses do not always consider including it in their curricula. It must also be recognized that it is difficult to find a suitable method to teach/develop the different skills needed for GSD. There is often a lot of content and not a great deal of time available to teach it. In this article, we propose the use of a serious game called GSD-Aware, with which students can “suffer” some of the typical challenges of GSD by interacting with avatars and by using several means of communication to solve a number of problems posed. The article focuses on the description of the game and on the empirical study conducted to analyze whether GSD-Aware helps students to be conscious of GSD challenges. It was discovered that after 50 minutes playing the game, the students were aware of the greater influence that the following factors can have: lack of coordination, lack of trust, cultural differences, lack of face-to-face and informal communication, time difference, and lack of team spirit. In their final analysis, students agreed that the serious game scenarios helped them to understand what GSD is and to grasp the importance of some GSD challenges.",

    "abstract": "This research aimed at evaluating the development and use of low-cost affective domain assessment instruments, culminating with personal and group characterization of representative global information technology (IT) professional values. Values and valuing are a compelling component of Bloom's affective domain of learning for engineering education. In helping students develop professional engineering competencies, it is essential that they develop not just cognitive knowledge of something but also values related to that knowledge and the ability to express these values in professional action. However, even if some professional values are identified, understood, and expressed, assessing students’ values and valuing are difficult, and assessment instruments are often difficult to develop, particularly for assessing student learning in the context of a particular course. This exploratory study aimed at examining assessment of dispositional knowledge in the context of global software engineering (GSE). It focused on the development and use of a set of instruments for assessing affective domain student learning of global IT/software engineering (SE) professional values. The project included making explicit the IT professional values of interest among the participating faculty in the form of actionable value statements. Following a process derived from Thurstone scale development, the project included validation of these statements with an expert panel as question roots, followed by the use of these questions to investigate student and alumni receiving, responding, and valuing of these professional values. The effort needed to generate questionnaires suitable for course use was relatively low; these questionnaires were deployed to students and alumni from an open-ended global software engineering project course. Students responding reported significant agreement when receiving these global values, but sent more mixed responses in responding to and valuing them. The effort helped identify several actionable IT professional values worth reinforcing in future course offerings.",

This viewpoint encouraged the creation of QueryCompetition, a web system that allows students to practice SQL in a competitive environment. Our goal was to obtain empirical evidence on how gamifying elements, such as challenges, points, and leaderboards, integrated into QueryCompetition, affect student performance, motivation, and user experience. We carried out a quasi-experimental study with two groups in a Database course. One group used a gamified version of QueryCompetition having access to points and leaderboards, while the other used a non-gamified version with no access to the above mentioned elements. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected through tests and a survey. The results showed that there was a statistically significant improvement in student performance in the gamified group as compared to the non-gamified group. In addition, a higher motivation was observed in the gamified group. The empirical evidence presented in this article supports the claim that inclusion of challenges, points, and leaderboards, together with the competitive nature of QueryCompetition, impacts positively on student performance and motivation to practice SQL.",

    "abstract": "Capstone projects usually represent the most significant academic endeavor with which students have been involved. Time management tends to be one of the hurdles. On top, University students are prone to procrastinatory behavior. Inexperience and procrastination team up for students failing to meet deadlines. Supervisors strive to help. Yet heavy workloads frequently prevent tutors from continuous involvement. This article looks into the extent to which conversational agents (a.k.a. chatbots) can tackle procrastination in single-student capstone projects. Specifically, chatbot enablers put in play include (1) alerts, (2) advice, (3) automatic rescheduling, (4) motivational messages, and (5) reference to previous capstone projects. Informed by Cognitive Behavioural Theory, these enablers are framed within the three phases involved in self-regulation misalignment: pre-actional, actional, and post-actional. To motivate this research, we first analyzed 77 capstone-project reports. We found that students’ Gantt charts (1) fail to acknowledge review meetings (70%) and milestones (100%) and (2) suffer deviations from the initial planned effort (16.28%). On these grounds, we develop GanttBot, a Telegram chatbot that is configured from the student’s Gantt diagram. GanttBot reminds students about close landmarks, it informs tutors when intervention might be required, and it learns from previous projects about common pitfalls, advising students accordingly. For evaluation purposes, course 17/18 acts as the control group ( N=28 ) while course 18/19 acts as the treatment group ( N=25 students). Using “overdue days” as the proxy for procrastination, results indicate that course 17/18 accounted for an average of 19 days of delay (SD = 5), whereas these days go down to 10 for the intervention group in course 18/19 (SD = 4). GanttBot is available for public usage as a Telegram chatbot.",

    "abstract": "Computer science is a fast-growing field in today’s digitized age, and working in this industry often requires creativity and innovative thought. An issue within computer science education, however, is that large introductory programming courses often involve little opportunity for creative thinking within coursework. The undergraduate introductory programming course (CS1) is notorious for its poor student performance and retention rates across multiple institutions. Integrating opportunities for creative thinking may help combat this issue by adding a personal touch to course content, which could allow beginner CS students to better relate to the abstract world of programming. Research on the role of creativity in computer science education (CSE) is an interesting area with a lot of room for exploration due to the complexity of the phenomenon of creativity as well as the CSE research field being fairly new compared to some other education fields where this topic has been more closely explored. To contribute to this area of research, this article provides a literature review exploring the concept of creativity as relevant to computer science education and CS1 in particular. Based on the review of the literature, we conclude creativity is an essential component to computer science, and the type of creativity that computer science requires is in fact, a teachable skill through the use of various tools and strategies. These strategies include the integration of open-ended assignments, large collaborative projects, learning by teaching, multimedia projects, small creative computational exercises, game development projects, digitally produced art, robotics, digital story-telling, music manipulation, and project-based learning. Research on each of these strategies and their effects on student experiences within CS1 is discussed in this review. Last, six main components of creativity-enhancing activities are identified based on the studies about incorporating creativity into CS1. These components are as follows: Collaboration, Relevance, Autonomy, Ownership, Hands-On Learning, and Visual Feedback. The purpose of this article is to contribute to computer science educators’ understanding of how creativity is best understood in the context of computer science education and explore practical applications of creativity theory in CS1 classrooms. This is an important collection of information for restructuring aspects of future introductory programming courses in creative, innovative ways that benefit student learning.",

    "abstract": "Research has repeatedly shown self-efficacy to be associated with course outcomes in CS and across other fields. CS education research has documented this and has developed CS-specific self-efficacy measurement instruments, but to date there have been only a few studies examining interventions intended to improve students’ self-efficacy in CS, and several types of self-efficacy interventions suggested by previous research remain to be tested in CS. This study attempts to address this lack of research by reporting on the results of a trial intervention intended to improve students’ self-efficacy in an introductory programming course. Students were recruited to complete a self-evaluation task, which previous research has suggested could have a beneficial impact on self-efficacy, which should in turn have a beneficial impact on course performance. Participating students’ course outcomes and self-efficacy were compared with those of the students who did not complete the self-evaluation task, using propensity score weighting adjustments to control for differences between the groups on entering characteristics and prior values of self-efficacy and course outcomes. We found that, whereas there was only marginal evidence for the self-evaluation intervention having a direct effect on self-efficacy, students who completed the self-evaluation task had significantly higher project scores during the weeks they were asked to complete it, compared to the students who did not participate. These findings suggest that there are potential benefits to incorporating self-evaluation tasks into introductory CS courses, although perhaps not by virtue of directly influencing self-efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Creating modern software inevitably requires using application programming interfaces (APIs). While software developers can sometimes use APIs by simply copying and pasting code examples, a lack of robust knowledge of how an API works can lead to defects, complicate software maintenance, and limit what someone can express with an API. Prior work has uncovered the many ways that API documentation fails to be helpful, though rarely describes precisely why. We present a theory of robust API knowledge that attempts to explain why, arguing that effective understanding and use of APIs depends on three components of knowledge: (1) the domain concepts the API models along with terminology, (2) the usage patterns of APIs along with rationale, and (3) facts about an API’s execution to support reasoning about its runtime behavior. We derive five hypotheses from this theory and present a study to test them. Our study investigated the effect of having access to these components of knowledge, finding that while learners requested these three components of knowledge when they were not available, whether the knowledge helped the learner use or understand the API depended on the tasks and likely the relevance and quality of the specific information provided. The theory and our evidence in support of its claims have implications for what content API documentation, tutorials, and instruction should contain and the importance of giving the right information at the right time, as well as what information API tools should compute, and even how APIs should be designed. Future work is necessary to both further test and refine the theory, as well as exploit its ideas for better instructional design.",

    "abstract": "Online learning systems should support students preparedness for professional practice by equipping them with the necessary skills while keeping them engaged and active. In that regard, the development of online learning systems that support students’ development and engagement with programming is a challenging process. Early career computer science professionals are required not only to understand and master numerous programming concepts but also to efficiently learn how to apply them in different contexts. A prerequisite for an effective and engaging learning process is the existence of adaptive and flexible learning environments that are beneficial for both students and teachers. Students can benefit from personalized content adapted to their individual goals, knowledge, and needs; while teachers can be relieved from the pressure to uniformly and promptly evaluate hundreds of student assignments. This study proposes and puts into practice a method for evaluating learning content difficulty and students’ knowledge proficiency utilizing a modified Elo-rating method. The proposed method effectively pairs learning content difficulty with students’ proficiency, and creates personalized recommendations based on the generated ratings. The method was implemented in a programming tutoring system and tested with interactive learning content for object oriented-programming. By collecting quantitative and qualitative data from students who used the system for one semester, the findings reveal that the proposed method can generate recommendations that are relevant to students and has the potential to assist teachers in grading students by providing a more holistic understanding of their progress over time.",

    "abstract": "The use of established and discipline-specific theories within research and practice is an indication of the maturity of a discipline. With computing education research as a relatively young discipline, there has been recent interest in investigating theories that may prove foundational to work in this area, with discipline-specific theories and many theories from other disciplines emerging as relevant. A challenge for the researcher is to identify and select the theories that provide the best foundation for their work. Learning is a complex and multi-faceted process and, as such, a plethora of theories are potentially applicable to a research problem. Knowing the possible candidate theories and understanding their relationships and potential applicability, both individually or as a community of theories, is important to provide a comprehensive grounding for researchers and practitioners alike. In this work, we investigate the fundamental connections between learning theories foundational to research and practice in computing education. We build a comprehensive list of 84 learning theories and their source and influential papers, which are the papers that introduce or propagate specific theories within the research community. Using Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and Google Scholar, we identify the papers that cite these learning theories. We subsequently consider all possible pairs of these theories and build the set of papers that cite each pair. On this weighted graph of learning theory connections, we perform a community analysis to identify groups of closely linked learning theories. We find that most of the computing education learning theories are closely linked with a number of broader learning theories, forming a separate cluster of 17 learning theories. We build a taxonomy of theory relationships to identify the depth of connections between learning theories. Of the 294 analysed links, we find deep connections in 32 links. This indicates that while the computing education research community is aware of a large number of learning theories, there is still a need to better understand how learning theories are connected and how they can be used together to benefit computing education research and practice.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, computing education researchers have investigated the impact of problem context on students’ learning and programming performance. This work continues the investigation motivated, in part, by cognitive load theory and educational research in computer science and other disciplines. The results of this study could help inform computing assessment design. If the context and authenticity of a programming problem aid student performance then, instructors’ time in creating appropriately contextualized programming problem descriptions is time well-spent. On the other hand, if the context of a programming problem hinders performance, then instructors should leave it out of programming problems. Recent studies investigating the impact of programming problem context on student success have arrived at different conclusions. Presented here is a series of experiments, conducted over 3 years, investigating the impact of context on novice programmers’ success in algorithmic programming assignments using three contextualized tasks and their generic counterparts. This experiment series also looked into the possibility of “authenticity” as a factor affecting performance. Common sense would suggest that a student would perform better on a problem if they understood or cared about it. Contextualization could provide authenticity and authenticity could provide interest. Research suggests that perceiving a problem as authentic has a positive effect on engagement and learning. Alternatively, if a problem is “just an abstract set of numbers”, it may be harder to make sense of the details and the lack of context could consequently contribute additional cognitive load to an already challenging assignment. The results of this study show that assignment context and problem context authenticity have no effect on the performance of novice programmers. We think, however, that contextualization could be worth investing in to support students’ interest in computing. Additional implications of the results suggest that instructors can assign equivalent versions of the same problem in varied contexts to suit their students’ interests without worrying if the context will hinder performance.",

    "abstract": "Integrated computing curricula combine learning objectives in computing with those in another discipline, like literacy, math, or science, to give all students experience with computing, typically before they must decide whether to take standalone CS courses. One goal of integrated computing curricula is to provide an accessible path to an introductory computing course by introducing computing concepts and practices in required courses. This study analyzed integrated computing curricula to determine which CS practices and concepts are taught, how extensively the curricula are taught, and, by extension, how they might prepare students for later computing courses. The authors conducted a content analysis to examine primary and lower secondary (i.e., K-8) curricula that are taught in non-CS classrooms, have explicit CS learning objectives (i.e., CS+X), and that took 5+ hours to complete. Lesson plans, descriptions, and resources were scored based on frameworks developed from the K-12 CS Framework, including programming concepts, non-programming CS concepts, and CS practices. The results found that curricula most extensively taught introductory concepts and practices, such as sequences, and rarely taught more advanced content, such as conditionals. Students who engage with most of these curricula would have no experience working with fundamental concepts, like variables, operators, data collection or storage, or abstraction in the context of a program. While this focus might be appropriate for integrated curricula, it has implications for the prior knowledge that students should be expected to have when starting standalone computing courses.",

    "abstract": "Hispanics have the highest growth rates among all groups in the U.S., yet they remain considerably underrepresented in computing careers and in the numbers who obtain advanced degrees. Hispanics constituted about 7% of undergraduate computer science and computer engineering graduates and 1% of doctoral graduates in 2007--2008. The small number of Hispanic faculty, combined with the lack of Hispanic role models and mentors, perpetuates a troublesome cycle of underrepresentation in STEM fields. In 2004, seven Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) formed the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI) to consolidate their strengths, resources, and concerns with the aim of increasing the number of Hispanics who pursue and complete baccalaureate and advanced degrees in computing areas. To address barriers that hinder students from advancing, CAHSI defined a number of initiatives, based on programs that produced promising results at one or more institutions. These included the following: a CS-0 course that focuses on adoption of a three-unit pre-CS course that uses graphics and animation to engage and prepare students who have no prior experience in computing; a peer mentoring strategy that provides an active, collaborative learning experience for students while creating leadership roles for undergraduates; an undergraduate and graduate student research model that emphasizes the deliberate and intentional development of technical, team, and professional skills and knowledge required for research and cooperative work; and a mentoring framework for engaging undergraduates in experiences and activities that prepare them for graduate studies and onto the professoriate. CAHSI plays a critical role in evaluating, documenting, and disseminating effective practices that achieve its mission. This paper provides an overview of CAHSI initiatives and describes how each addresses causes of underrepresentation of Hispanics in computing. In addition, it describes the evaluation and assessment of the initiatives and presents the results that support CAHSI’s claim of their effectiveness.",

    "abstract": "Lecturing is known to be a controversial form of teaching. With massed classrooms, in particular, it tends to constrain the active participation of students. One of the remedies applied to programming education is to use technology that can vitalize interaction in the classroom, while another is to base teaching increasingly on programming activities. In this article, we present the first results of an exploratory study, in which we teach programming without lectures, exams, or grades, by heavily emphasizing programming activity, and, in a pedagogical sense, student self-direction. This article investigates how students reacted to the active role required of them and what issues emerged in this setting where self-direction was required. The results indicate three issues that should be taken into account when designing a student-driven course: the challenge of supporting students' theoretical synthesis of the topics to be learned, the individual's opportunities for self-direction in a group work setting, and mismatch between individual learning processes and academic course scheduling.",

    "abstract": "This article describes how smartphones, studio-based learning, and extensive scaffolding were used in combination in the teaching of a freshman Introduction to Programming course. To reduce cognitive overload, a phased approach was followed in introducing programming concepts and development environments, beginning with the visual programming environment Scratch and culminating with Java development for Android smartphones. Studio-based learning, a pedagogical approach long established in the fields of architecture and design education, was used as the basis for a collaborative social constructivist—and constructionist—approach to learning. Smartphones offered students the potential to develop applications for a context that is both immediate and clearly relevant to the ways in which they utilize and interact with technology. The research was carried out over three full academic years and included 53 student participants. An exploratory case study methodology was used to investigate the efficacy of the approach in helping to overcome the barriers faced by novice programmers. The findings indicate that the approach has merit. The students were motivated and engaged by the learning experience and were able to develop sophisticated applications that incorporated images, sound, arrays, and event handling. There is evidence that aspects of the studio-based learning approach, such as the scope that it gave students to innovate and the open feedback during student presentations, provided a learning environment that was motivating. Overall, the combination of smartphones, studio-based learning, and appropriate scaffolding offers an effective way to teach introductory programming courses.",

    "abstract": "We present an undergraduate course on concurrent programming where formal models are used in different stages of the learning process. The main practical difference with other approaches lies in the fact that the ability to develop correct concurrent software relies on a systematic transformation of formal models of inter-process interaction (so called shared resources ), rather than on the specific constructs of some programming language. Using a resource-centric rather than a language-centric approach has some benefits for both teachers and students. Besides the obvious advantage of being independent of the programming language, the models help in the early validation of concurrent software design, provide students and teachers with a lingua franca that greatly simplifies communication at the classroom and during supervision, and help in the automatic generation of tests for the practical assignments. This method has been in use, with slight variations, for some 15 years, surviving changes in the programming language and course length. In this article, we describe the components and structure of the current incarnation of the course—which uses Java as target language—and some tools used to support our method. We provide a detailed description of the different outcomes that the model-driven approach delivers (validation of the initial design, automatic generation of tests, and mechanical generation of code) from a teaching perspective. A critical discussion on the perceived advantages and risks of our approach follows, including some proposals on how these risks can be minimized. We include a statistical analysis to show that our method has a positive impact in the student ability to understand concurrency and to generate correct code.",

    "abstract": "Software Product Line (SPL) engineering has emerged to provide the means to efficiently model, produce, and maintain multiple similar software variants, exploiting their common properties, and managing their variabilities (differences). With over two decades of existence, the community of SPL researchers and practitioners is thriving, as can be attested by the extensive research output and the numerous successful industrial projects. Education has a key role to support the next generation of practitioners to build highly complex, variability-intensive systems. Yet, it is unclear how the concepts of variability and SPLs are taught, what are the possible missing gaps and difficulties faced, what are the benefits, and what is the material available. Also, it remains unclear whether scholars teach what is actually needed by industry. In this article, we report on three initiatives we have conducted with scholars, educators, industry practitioners, and students to further understand the connection between SPLs and education, that is, an online survey on teaching SPLs we performed with 35 scholars, another survey on learning SPLs we conducted with 25 students, as well as two workshops held at the International Software Product Line Conference in 2014 and 2015 with both researchers and industry practitioners participating. We build upon the two surveys and the workshops to derive recommendations for educators to continue improving the state of practice of teaching SPLs, aimed at both individual educators as well as the wider community.",

Varying forms of “projects,” co-located and distributed, have populated computing curricula for decades and are generally deemed an answer to this call. We performed a qualitative study to describe how project course students are able to capitalize on the promise of enabling learning environments. This critical perspective was motivated by the circumstance of the present-day education systems being heavily regulated for the precipitated production of human capital. The students involved in our study described education system-imposed and group-imposed narratives of narrowed opportunities, as well as many self-related challenges. However, students welcomed autonomy as an enjoyable condition and linked it with motivation. Whole-group commitment and self-related attributes such as taking care of one’s own learning appeared as important conditions. The results highlight targets for interventions that can counteract constraining study conditions and continue the march of projects as a means to foster complex learning for the benefit of students and professionalism in global software engineering.",

Still, to facilitate the technology properly, integration into a course must be carefully designed. In this article, we present a redesign of an object-oriented university-level programming course. In the redesign, a collaborative education tool was utilized to enhance active learning, facilitate communication between students and teachers, and remodel the evaluation procedure by utilizing automatically assessed tasks. The redesign was based on the best practices found in our own earlier research and that of the research community, with a focus on facilitating active learning methods and student collaboration. The redesign was evaluated by comparing two instances of the redesigned course against two instances using the old methodology. The drop-out rate decreased statistically significantly in the redesigned course instances. Moreover, there was a trend toward higher grade averages in the redesigned instances. Based on the results, we can conclude that the utilization of educational technology has a highly positive effect on student performance. Still, making major changes to course methodology does not come without certain difficulties. Hence, we also present our experiences and suggestions for the course redesign to help other educators and researchers perform similar design changes.",

    "abstract": "Context: Knowledge level and productivity of the software engineering (SE) workforce are the subject of regular discussions among practitioners, educators, and researchers. There have been many efforts to measure and improve the knowledge gap between SE education and industrial needs. Objective: Although the existing efforts for aligning SE education and industrial needs have provided valuable insights, there is a need for analyzing the SE topics in a more “fine-grained” manner; i.e., knowing that SE university graduates should know more about requirements engineering is important, but it is more valuable to know the exact topics of requirements engineering that are most important in the industry. Method: We achieve the above objective by assessing the knowledge gaps of software engineers by designing and executing an opinion survey on levels of knowledge learned in universities versus skills needed in industry. We designed the survey by using the SE knowledge areas (KAs) from the latest version of the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK v3), which classifies the SE knowledge into 12 KAs, which are themselves broken down into 67 subareas (sub-KAs) in total. Our analysis is based on (opinion) data gathered from 129 practitioners, who are mostly based in Turkey. Results: Based on our findings, we recommend that educators should include more materials on software maintenance, software configuration management, and testing in their SE curriculum. Based on the literature as well as the current trends in industry, we provide actionable suggestions to improve SE curriculum to decrease the knowledge gap.",

In the fall of 2009, we started exploring how software development teams form and interact in a computer science college capstone course setting. Our initial findings were presented at ICER 2010 in Aarhus, Denmark. The focus of our research was on the experiences of computer science college course teams as compared and contrasted to the theory of Bruce Tuckman's stages of small group development model, which he characterized as forming , storming , norming , performing , and adjourning . We continued data collection with the computer science capstone course in the fall of 2010 and added an information systems capstone course as well. At the conclusion of the spring 2014 semester, we have collected and analyzed data for a total of 5 academic years from nine cohorts of students taught by five instructors involving 215 students on 51 teams. Each year, participants repeatedly self-assessed their enthusiasm and skill levels over time using a questionnaire by agreeing or disagreeing to statements. The data shows patterns similar to that of Tuckman's model. Since most people find Tuckman's model easy to understand, it may provide an effective tool to teach teamwork and monitor team development. In addition to briefly presenting our empirical findings in this article, we provide a simple conceptualization of Tuckman's model that can be captured in two data points: enthusiasm and skill level. By comparing changes in these two dimensions over time, team development can be tracked through the various Tuckman stages of small group development. We also provide a minicurriculum which can be used to introduce students to Tuckman's model and provide them insight into what leadership style works best in each of the development stages.",

These courses, known for their closeness to “real-world” work experience, emphasize the importance of involving industry partners as customers and focus on soft skills essential for employment, an aspect often neglected in engineering education. However, not many such courses are long-lived or consistent in form throughout the years, making their impact and relevance hard to assess. The Distributed Software Development course (DSD), currently run among three universities in Croatia, Italy, and Sweden, has now been carried out for 15 years consecutively, providing a rich source of in-course and post-graduation data. To evaluate the students’ experiences of the course after they graduate and start working, a study has been carried out among former DSD students from the University of Zagreb, Croatia. Its goal is to understand how useful this course was in students’ early careers, both in first and current employment, as well as related factors at the workplace (magnitude of distributed collaboration, company size). The study results show the relevance of such distributed course experiences for future employment, as well as the importance of building upon soft skills as part of the software engineering curricula. Higher education institutions are invited to consider including such courses in the software engineering curriculum, for the benefit of their students and, indirectly, students’ future employers.",

Prior work has found that cultural and ethical norms become ingrained early in STEM professionals’ careers; so, we focus on students approaching graduation and after an internship experience, who are just getting started in their career. In semi-structured interviews, a majority of these final-year computing students (14 of 16) indicated that they were not motivated to improve their skills in accessibility, attributing this to not being required to consider accessibility in subsequent work or classes, not seeing accessibility as an essential skill in their profession , and challenges due to a learn-it-on-your-own approach in computing. Participants suggested instructional methods and topics that they believed would have better prepared them for considering accessibility. A survey of 114 additional final-year students revealed similar themes, including that students did not personally view accessibility training as essential career preparation. Prior research has largely focused on evaluating short-term changes in students’ knowledge after an educational intervention. Therefore, by focusing on students several years after an intervention, this work highlights lingering barriers for university programs in promoting accessibility among rising computing professionals.",

Conversations about language, technology, and power were close at hand in focal classrooms, and surfaced in moments when students acted as users and critics of, and tinkerers with, digital tools. Students exercised agency in relation to both technology and language—using their budding understandings of language to question digital tools, and their engagements with tools to challenge traditional language ideologies. I build on past scholarship and the findings of this analysis to argue for the development of critical translingual computing education —an approach that would engage especially language-minoritized students in critical computing to build on and affirm their language practices and promote linguistic justice in computer science education, fields, and tools.",

Published data are available on traditional non-computer science-specific hiring processes. However, the hiring process for CS majors may be different. It is critical to have up-to-date information on questions such as “what positions are in high demand for CS majors?,” “what is a typical hiring process?,” and “what do employers say they look for when hiring CS graduates?” This article discusses the analysis of a survey of 218 recruiters hiring CS graduates in the United States. We used Atlas.ti to analyze qualitative survey data and report the results on what positions are in the highest demand, the hiring process, and the resume review process. Our study revealed that a software developer was the most common job the recruiters were looking to fill. We found that the hiring process steps for CS graduates are generally aligned with traditional hiring steps, with an additional emphasis on technical and coding tests. Recruiters reported that their hiring choices were based on reviewing resume’s experience, GPA, and projects sections. The results provide insights into the hiring process, decision making, resume analysis, and some discrepancies between current undergraduate CS program outcomes and employers’ expectations.",

In exploring and deepening the conversation around this project, the seven articles included in the first volume of this special issue employ diverse theoretical perspectives, methodologies, and frameworks, including but not limited to intersectionality, transformational justice, intercultural computing, ethnocomputing, translanguaging, socially responsible computing, and institutional theory. Across them, rather than consensus on a narrow set of issues, we see the possibilities of a pluralistic and wide-ranging conversation about how we might constitute the meanings of “justice-centered” within computing education, the tools that might be used to produce such meanings, and the actions that might address them.",

While basic content was consistent for all, one group was involved throughout the course in peer discussions designed to foster greater engagement, with the anticipation that this would enable students to reach new levels of sensitivity through peer-to-peer interaction. This article reports on our observation of this design, interview, and project data collected throughout the course as well interviews conducted eight months later to learn about how students were retaining and applying what they learned. We found that students are sensitive to the technology-related risks and vulnerabilities encountered by individuals based on race, gender, and, to some extent, age, but they struggle to assess who is responsible for these risks, what to do about bias in technology design, and how to mitigate harms for individuals whom they perceive to be vulnerable, furthering the argument for an integrated ethics curriculum. We explore the value of formal peer-led discussion to evolve social justice thinking with a focus on identity, though note that opportunities for any group discussion are meaningful to students’ thinking about social justice. Over the longer term, students tend to recall and apply ethics that is closely related to their identity, suggesting that empathy has limits.",

    "abstract": "The disciplinary identity as a computer science student has recently received increasing attention as a well-developed subject identity can help with increasing retention, interest, and motivation. Besides, identity theory can serve as an analytical lens for issues around diversity. However, identity is also often perceived as a vague, overused concept with a variety of theories to build upon. In addition, connections to other topics, such as computer science conceptions, remain unclear and there seems to be little intra-disciplinary exchange about the concept. This article, therefore, attempts to provide a starting point by presenting a so far missing systematic literature review of identity in Computing Education Research (CER). We analyzed a corpus of 41 articles published since 2005 with a focus on the variety of identity theories that are used, the reasons for using them, and the overall theoretical framing of the concept in the CER literature up to this point. We use content analysis with both inductive and deductive coding to derive categories from the corpus to answer our research questions. The results show that there is less variety in the theories than originally expected, most publications refer to the theory of “Communities of Practice”. The reasons for employing identity theory are also rather canonical, in particular, there is only little theoretical development of the theories within CER and also only little empirical work. Finally, we also present an extended version of a computing identity that can be theoretically derived from the work in our corpus.",

This framing underemphasizes the wide range of ways that students and teachers could notice discrepancies from their intention, propose causes of those discrepancies, and implement interventions. Weaving together a synthesis of the existing research literature with new multimodal interaction analyses of teacher–student conversations during coding, we propose a framework for debugging that foregrounds this open-endedness. We use the framework to structure an analysis of three naturalistic debugging situations (with US 5th–10th graders) that range from solo debugging to collaborative discourse. We argue that a broken computer program is a polysemous object through which teachers and students actively and publicly notice, reason about, and negotiate different debugging pathways. We document students and teachers improvisationally altering a debugging pathway, justifying a particular pathway, and outwardly discussing competing pathways. This paper provides a framework for structuring debugging pedagogy to be less about scaffolding a student toward a specific pathway to a fix and more about exploring multiple possible pathways and judging the (learning) value of various routes.",

While prior work has surfaced how hegemonic racial and gendered expectations manifest in computing, it has only indirectly attended to expectations surrounding neurodivergence. As computing stereotypes largely align with stereotypes of some neurodivergent individuals, we investigated whether computing legitimized neurodivergent traits over neuronormative ones. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 students, faculty, and industry professionals, sampling both neurodivergent-identifying and non-neurodivergent-identifying participants. We found that computing legitimized hyper-focus, deep “special” interests, and high organization, and that fitting these expectations was frequently required for persistence. Some neurodivergent-identifying participants felt that computing provided refuge from societal neuronormative expectations, though one’s sense of refuge depended on sufficiently fitting computing’s neurodivergent expectations. We offer reflections on inclusion and belonging efforts within computing, as well as directions for future work that attends to individuals’ neurodivergent identities.",

    "abstract": "Students learning computer science frequently struggle with debugging errors in their code. These struggles can have significant downstream effects—negatively influencing how students assess their programming ability and contributing to their decision to drop out of CS courses. However, debugging instruction is often an overlooked topic, and instructors report feeling unaware of effective approaches to teach debugging. Within the literature, research on the topic is sporadic, and though there are rigorous and insightful studies to be found, there is a need to synthesize instructional approaches for debugging. In this paper, we review research from 2010 to 2022 on debugging interventions. We summarize the common pedagogical approaches for learning and categorize how these target specific cognitive and non-cognitive debugging skills, such as self-efficacy and emotion regulation. We also present a summary of assessment methods and their outcomes in order to discuss intervention efficacy and directions for further research. Our sample displays a diverse variety of debugging interventions and pedagogical approaches, ranging from games to unplugged activities. An evaluation of paper results also presents encouraging findings, revealing several interventions that improved debugging accuracy and learning. Still, we notice gaps in interventions addressing non-cognitive debugging skills, and observe limited success in guiding students toward adopting systematic debugging strategies. The review concludes with a discussion of future directions and implications for researchers and instructors in the field.",

We present a didactic method aimed at promoting active learning of greedy algorithms. The method is focused on the concept of selection function, and is based on explicit learning goals. It mainly consists of an experimental method and the interactive system, GreedEx, that supports it. We also present our experience of five years using the didactic method and the evaluations we conducted to refine it, which are of two kinds: usability evaluations of GreedEx and analysis of students’ reports. Usability evaluations revealed a number of opportunities of improvement for GreedEx, and the analysis of students’ reports showed a number of misconceptions. We made use of these findings in several ways, mainly: improving GreedEx, elaborating lecture notes that address students’ misconceptions, and adapting the class and lab sessions and materials. As a consequence of these actions, our didactic method currently satisfies its initial goals. The article has two main contributions. First, the didactic method itself can be valuable for computer science educators in their teaching of algorithms. Secondly, the refinement process we have carried out, which was a multifaceted, medium-term action research, can be of interest to researchers of technology-supported computing education, since it illustrates how the didactic method was integrated into our educational practice.",

We measured the dropout rate, the failure rate, the grades on the two exams, the proportion of completed lab assignments, and the number of submissions per completed assignment. There was no difference in the dropout rate. The failure rate for Python was 16.9% against 23.1% for C. The effect size (Cohen’s D) on the comparison of Python against C on the midterm exam was 0.27, and 0.38 for the final exam. The effect size for the proportion of completed assignments was 0.39 and the effect size for the number of submissions per assignment was -0.61 (Python had less submissions per completed assignments). Thus, for all measures, with the exception of dropout rate, the version of the course in Python yielded better student outcomes than the version in C and all differences are significant (with 95% confidence) with the exception of the failure rate ( p -value=0.12).",

To assess the long-term impact of this campaign, the participants were contacted and interviewed two to five years after they had attended an outreach event. We studied how participating in the outreach program affected the students’ perceptions of CS as a field and, more importantly, how it affected their educational choices. We found that the outreach program generally had a positive effect on the students’ educational choices. The most prominent finding was that students who already possessed a “maintained situational interest” in CS found that the event strengthened their confidence in studying CS. However, many students were not affected by attending the program, but their perceptions of CS did change. Our results emphasize the need to provide continuing possibilities for interested students to experiment with computing-related activities and hence maintain their emerging individual interests.",

To facilitate both teaching practice and research in programming education, this mapping review seeks to give an overview of the related knowledge that is already available in conference papers and journal articles. Starting from early works of the 1990s, we identified 105 papers that address teaching practices, present learning resources, software tools or libraries to support learning, and empirical studies related to EDP. We summarize the publications, their main content, and findings. While most studies focus on bachelor’s level education in universities, there has been substantial work in K-12 level, as well. Few courses address EDP as their main content—rather it is most often integrated with CS1, CS2, or computer graphics courses. The most common programming languages and environments addressed are Java, App Inventor, and Scratch. Moreover, very little of deliberate experimental scientific research has been carried out to explicitly address teaching and learning EDP. Consequently, while so-called experience reports, tool papers, and anecdotal evidence have been published, this theme offers a wide arena for empirical research in the future. At the end of the article, we suggest a number of directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "As society increasingly relies on digital technologies in many different aspects, those who lack relevant access and skills are lagging increasingly behind. Among the underserved groups disproportionately affected by the digital divide are women who are transitioning from incarceration and seeking to reenter the workforce outside the carceral system (women-in-transition). Women-in-transition rarely have been exposed to sound technology education, as they have generally been isolated from the digital environment while in incarceration. Furthermore, while women have become the fastest-growing segment of the incarcerated population in the United States in recent decades, prison education and reentry programs are still not well adjusted for them. Most programs are mainly designed for the dominant male population. Consequently, women-in-transition face significant post-incarceration challenges in accessing and using relevant digital technologies and thus have added difficulties in entering or reentering the workforce. Against this backdrop, our multi-disciplinary research team has conducted empirical research as part of technology education offered to women-in-transition in the Midwest. In this article, we report results from our interviews with 75 women-in-transition in the Midwest that were conducted to develop a tailored technology education program for the women. More than half of the participants in our study are women of color and face precarious housing and financial situations. Then, we discuss principles that we adopted in developing our education program for the marginalized women and participants’ feedback on the program. Our team launched in-person sessions with women-in-reentry at public libraries in February 2020 and had to move the sessions online in March due to COVID-19. Our research-informed educational program is designed primarily to support the women in enhancing their knowledge and comfort with technology and nurturing computational thinking. Our study shows that low self-efficacy and mental health challenges, as well as lack of resources for technology access and use, are some of the major issues that need to be addressed in supporting technology learning among women-in-transition. This research offers scholarly and practical implications for computing education for women-in-transition and other marginalized populations.",

    "abstract": "Autograding systems are being increasingly deployed to meet the challenges of teaching programming at scale. Studies show that formative feedback can greatly help novices learn programming. This work extends an autograder, enabling it to provide formative feedback on programming assignment submissions. Our methodology starts with the design of a knowledge map, which is the set of concepts and skills that are necessary to complete an assignment, followed by the design of the assignment and that of a comprehensive test suite for identifying logical errors in the submitted code. Test cases are used to test the student submissions and learn classes of common errors. For each assignment, we train a classifier that automatically categorizes errors in a submission based on the outcome of the test suite. The instructor maps the errors to corresponding concepts and skills and writes hints to help students find their misconceptions and mistakes. We apply this methodology to two assignments in our Introduction to Computer Science course and find that the automatic error categorization has a 90% average accuracy. We report and compare data from two semesters, one semester when hints are given for the two assignments and one when hints are not given. Results show that the percentage of students who successfully complete the assignments after an initial erroneous submission is three times greater when hints are given compared to when hints are not given. However, on average, even when hints are provided, almost half of the students fail to correct their code so that it passes all the test cases. The initial implementation of the framework focuses on the functional correctness of the programs as reflected by the outcome of the test cases. In our future work, we will explore other kinds of feedback and approaches to automatically generate feedback to better serve the educational needs of the students.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies on writing and understanding programs presented evidence that programmers beyond a novice stage utilize plans or plan-like structures. Other studies on code composition showed that learners have difficulties with writing, reading, and debugging code where interacting plans are merged into a short piece of code. In this article, we focus on the question of how different code-composition strategies and the familiarity with code affect program comprehension on a more abstract, i.e., algorithmic level. Using an eye-tracking setup, we explored how advanced students comprehend programs and their underlying algorithms written in either a merged or abutted (sequenced) composition of code blocks of varying familiarity. The effects of familiarity and code composition were studied both isolated and in combination. Our analysis of the quantitative data adds to our understanding of the behavior reported in previous studies and the effects of plans and their composition on the programs’ difficulty. Using this data along with retrospective interviews, we analyze students’ reading patterns and provide support that subjects were able to form mental models of program execution during task performance. Furthermore, our results suggest that subjects are able to retrieve and create schemata when the program is composed of familiar templates, which may improve their performance; we found indicators for a higher element-interactivity for programs with a merged code composition compared to abutted code composition.",

    "abstract": "As Information and Communication Technology (ICT) literacy education has recently shifted to fostering computing thinking ability as well as ICT use, many countries are conducting research on national curriculum and evaluation. In this study, we measured Korean students’ ICT literacy levels by using the national measurement tool that assesses abilities of the IT (Information Technology) area and the CT (Computational Thinking) area. A research team revised an existing ICT literacy assessment tool for the IT test and developed a new CT test environment in which students could perform actual coding through a web-based programming tool such as Scratch. Additionally, after assessing ICT literacy levels, differences in ICT literacy levels by gender and grade were analyzed to provide evidence for national education policies. Approximately 23,000 elementary and middle school students participated in the 2018 national assessment of ICT literacy, accounting for 1% of the national population of students. The findings demonstrated that female students had higher literacy levels in most sub-factors of IT and CT areas. Additionally, in the areas of strengths and weaknesses, the ratio of below-basic achievement among male students was at least two times greater than that of female students. Nonetheless, male students scored higher on CT automation, a coding item that involved problem solving using Scratch. Looking at the difference according to grade level, the level improved as the school year increased in elementary school, but there was no difference in middle school. When analyzing the detailed elements of middle school students, the automation factor of seventh grade students was found to be higher than eighth and ninth grade students. Based on these results, this study discussed some implications for ICT and computing education in elementary and middle schools.",

    "abstract": "College-educated women in the workforce are discovering a latent interest in and aptitude for computing motivated by the prevalence of computing as an integral part of jobs in many fields as well as continued headlines about the number of unfilled, highly paid computing jobs. One of these women's choices for retraining are the so-called coding boot camps that teach programming skills through intensive multi-week courses. This article reports on a qualitative research study focused on the Silicon Valley area of California. We used social cognitive career theory (SCCT) to investigate the larger context surrounding women entering computing professions through boot camp learning sites, including: the environment of a booming technology workforce, boot camps as learning settings , the characteristics of women who attend boot camps, how retraining at a coding boot camp influence women's computing self-efficacy and outcome expectations , and the performance attainments of women at boot camps. Interview data was collected from 14 women who had attended boot camps—first before graduating from the boot camp and again after six months in the workforce. To contextualize the computing ecosystem, we conducted single interviews with 6 boot camp organizers/curriculum developers, 7 industry hiring managers, and 14 university computer science faculty. To provide a contrast with women at boot camps, we interviewed 5 women who majored in computer science at the university and with 17 men who had attended boot camps. Structural data coding and analysis was done focused on the SCCT mechanisms of environment, person inputs, learning experiences, self-efficacy, outcome expectations, and performance attainments. Findings here demonstrate that training at a boot camp can be the catalyst for college-educated women to attain computing jobs and careers, although these entry-level jobs may be a compromise to the goal of a software development job and are unlikely to lead to a job at large, well-known, established technology companies.",

In this article, we establish an intercultural approach to computing education, informed by intercultural and peace education, prejudice reduction, and the sociology of racism and ethnicity. We outline three major concerns of intercultural computing: shifting from content toward relationships, from cultural responsiveness to cultural reflexivity, and from identity to identification. For the last, we complicate discourses of race and identity widespread in U.S. education. Drawing from studies of youth programming classes in East Africa and U.S. contexts, we then reflect on our attempts to address the first shift of fostering relationships across difference. We highlight three promising design tactics: intergroup pairing, interdependent programming, and making relational goals explicit. Overall, we find that computing can indeed be a site of intergroup bonding across difference, but that bonding can carry complications and tensions with other equity goals and tactics. Rather than framing justice-oriented CS primarily as changes to the aims of computational learning, we argue that future work should explore making relational goals explicit and teach students how to attend to friction.",

    "abstract": "We propose a framework for identifying, organizing, and communicating learning objectives that involve program semantics. In this framework, detailed learning objectives are written down as rules of program behavior (RPBs). RPBs are teacher-facing statements that describe what needs to be learned about the behavior of a specific sort of programs. Different programming languages, student cohorts, and contexts call for different RPBs. Instructional designers may define progressions of RPB rulesets for different stages of a programming course or curriculum; we identify evaluation criteria for RPBs and discuss tradeoffs in RPB design. As a proof-of-concept example, we present a progression of rulesets designed for teaching beginners how expressions, variables, and functions work in Python. We submit that the RPB framework is valuable to practitioners and researchers as a tool for design and communication. Within computing education research, the framework can inform, among other things, the ongoing exploration of “notional machines” and the design of assessments and visualizations. The theoretical work that we report here lays a foundation for future empirical research that compares the effectiveness of RPB rulesets as well as different methods for teaching a particular ruleset.",

    "abstract": "Assessing team software development projects is notoriously difficult and typically based on subjective metrics. To help make assessments more rigorous, we conducted an empirical study to explore relationships between subjective metrics based on peer and instructor assessments, and objective metrics based on GitHub and chat data. We studied 23 undergraduate software teams ( n = 117 students) from two undergraduate computing courses at two North American research universities. We collected data on teams’ (a) commits and issues from their GitHub code repositories, (b) chat messages from their Slack and Microsoft Teams channels, (c) peer evaluation ratings from the CATME peer evaluation system, and (d) individual assignment grades from the courses. We derived metrics from (a) and (b) to measure both individual team members’ contributions to the team, and the equality of team members’ contributions. We then performed Pearson analyses to identify correlations among the metrics, peer evaluation ratings, and individual grades. We found significant positive correlations between team members’ GitHub contributions, chat contributions, and peer evaluation ratings. In addition, the equality of teams’ GitHub contributions was positively correlated with teams’ average peer evaluation ratings and negatively correlated with the variance in those ratings. However, no such positive correlations were detected between the equality of teams’ chat contributions and their peer evaluation ratings. Our study extends previous research results by providing evidence that (a) team members’ chat contributions, like their GitHub contributions, are positively correlated with their peer evaluation ratings; (b) team members’ chat contributions are positively correlated with their GitHub contributions; and (c) the equality of team’ GitHub contributions is positively correlated with their peer evaluation ratings. These results lend further support to the idea that combining objective and subjective metrics can make the assessment of team software projects more comprehensive and rigorous.",

    "abstract": "Self-regulation of learning (SRL) is an essential ability for academic success in multiple educational contexts, including programming education. However, understanding how students regulate themselves during programming learning is still limited. This exploratory research aimed to investigate the regulatory strategies externalized by 51 students enrolled in an introductory programming course. The objective was to identify the SRL strategies used by these students during multiple phases of the learning process and compare the SRL behavior of high and low-performers. The following research questions guided this investigation: (RQ1) What regulation of learning strategies are used by programming students?; and (RQ2) How do the SRL strategies used by high and low-performing students differ?. The findings demonstrate that learning to program involves complex psychological resources (e.g., cognition, metacognition, behavior, motivation, and emotion) and that students present heterogeneity in their SRL repertoire. In addition, high and low-performing students showed significant differences in how they regulate, which can contribute to understanding the factors that may contribute to learning programming. Lastly, we argue that for analyzing SRL strategies, it is necessary to consider the specificities of programming education, which motivated the development of a conceptual framework to describe the identified strategies and regulatory phases in this learning domain.",

    "abstract": "With ever-greater reliance of the developed world on information and communication technologies, constructing secure software has become a top priority. To produce secure software, security activities need to be integrated throughout the software development lifecycle. One such activity is security design analysis (SDA), which identifies security requirements as early as the software design phase. While considered an important step in software development, the general opinion of information security subject matter experts and researchers is that SDA is challenging to learn and teach. Experimental evidence provided in literature confirms this claim. To help solve this, we have developed a framework for teaching SDA by utilizing case study analysis and the hybrid flipped classroom approach. We evaluate our framework by performing a comparative analysis between a group of students who attended labs generated using our framework and a group that participated in traditional labs. Our results show that labs created using our framework achieve better learning outcomes for SDA, as opposed to the traditional labs. Secondary contributions of our article include teaching materials, such as lab descriptions and a case study of a hospital information system to be used for SDA. We outline instructions for using our framework in different contexts, including university courses and corporate training programs. By using our proposed teaching framework, with our or any other case study, we believe that both students and employees can learn the craft of SDA more effectively.",

Heterogeneity in grading between courses systematically biases observed GPAs for individual students: the GPA observed depends on course selection. We show how a logistic model can account for course selection by simulating how every student in a sample would perform if they took all available courses, giving a new “modeled GPA.” We then use 10 years of grade data from a large university to demonstrate that this modeled GPA is a more accurate predictor of student performance in individual courses than the observed GPA. Using Computer Science (CS) as an example learning analytics application, it is found that required CS courses give significantly lower grades than average courses. This depresses the recorded GPAs of CS majors: modeled GPAs are 0.25 points higher than those that are observed. The modeled GPA also correlates much more closely with standardized test scores than the observed GPA: the correlation with Math ACT is 0.37 for the modeled GPA and is 0.20 for the observed GPA. This implies that standardized test scores are much better predictors of student performance than might otherwise be assumed.",

    "abstract": "Community colleges play a large role in educating students who are historically underrepresented in computer science (CS), including women, Latino men, and Black men, as well as post-traditional (older or working) students. In spite of this, there is a dearth of research on the institutional factors that influence whether or not community college students who are enrolled in CS classes and who express an interest in transferring and completing a bachelor’s degree in the field persist. The overused “pipeline” metaphor, which indicates a supply-side lack, has been replaced by many with that of a “pathway.” However, the “pathway” image suggests a general forward-moving trend that can be misleading. In this work, we draw from qualitative interviews with 14 CS students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the field who have studied introductory computer programming at a community college to investigate the following question: “What are the institutional barriers along a CS bachelor’s degree track that includes community college?” Our findings indicate that there are three categories of institutional barriers along the transfer pathway: setbacks that hinder student progression forward, discontinuities in which students leave and re-enter the pathway, and departures in which students leave computer science and/or leave college altogether. We describe specific examples of each and introduce the idea of student movement as a game of “chutes and ladders,” a convoluted trail where students can slide backwards or off the path (chutes), necessitating the implementation of targeted institutional supports that can boost student progress forward (ladders). We suggest institutional interventions that can help students facing each type of barrier to continue on course through community college and transfer to a four-year university.",

    "abstract": "In a modern computing curriculum, large-project courses are essential to give students hands-on experience of working in a realistic software engineering project. Assessing such projects is, however, extremely challenging. There are various aspects and trade-offs of assessments that can affect course quality. Individual assessments may fairly grade individuals, but may lose focus of the project as a group activity. Extensive teacher involvement is necessary for objective assessment, but may affect the way that students work. Continuous feedback to students can enhance learning, but may be hard to combine with fair assessment. Most previous work focuses on some specific assessment aspect; in this article, we present an assessment model that consists of a collection of assessment activities, each covering different aspects. We have applied, developed, and improved these activities during a 7yr period. To evaluate the usefulness of the model, we perform questionnaire-based surveys over a 2yr period. Furthermore, we design and execute an experiment that studies to what extent students can perform fair peer assessment and to what degree the assessments of students and teachers agree. We analyze the results, discuss findings, and summarize lessons learned.",

A growing body of research exists that attempts to identify this skill gap. However, only few so far explicitly compare opinions of the industry with what is currently being taught in academia. By aggregating data from three previous works, we identify the three biggest non-technical skill gaps between industry and academia for the field of software engineering: devoting oneself to continuous learning , being creative by approaching a problem from different angles , and thinking in a solution-oriented way by favoring outcome over ego . Eight follow-up interviews were conducted to further explore how the industry perceives these skill gaps, yielding 26 sub-themes grouped into six bigger themes: stimulating continuous learning , stimulating creativity , creative techniques , addressing the gap in education , skill requirements in industry , and the industry selection process . With this work, we hope to inspire educators to give the necessary attention to the uncovered skills, further mitigating the gap between the industry and the academic world.",

    "abstract": "Background and Context: Understanding how a student programmer solves different task types in different programming languages is essential to understanding how we can further improve teaching tools to support students to be industry-ready when they graduate. It also provides insight into students’ thought processes in different task types and languages. Few (if any) studies investigate whether any differences exist between the reading and navigation behavior while completing different types of tasks in different programming languages. Objectives: We investigate whether the use of a certain programming language (C++ versus Python) and type of task (new feature versus bug fixing) has an impact on performance and eye movement behavior in students exposed to both languages and task types. Participants: Fourteen students were recruited from a Python course that taught Python as an introductory programming language. Study Method: An eye tracker was used to track how student programmers navigate and view source code in different programming languages for different types of tasks. The students worked in the Geany Integrated Development Environment (IDE, used also in their course) while eye-tracking data was collected behind the scenes making their working environment realistic compared to prior studies. Each task type had a Python and C++ version, albeit on different problems to avoid learning effects. Standard eye-tracking metrics of fixation count and fixation durations were calculated on various areas of the screen and on source code lines. Normalized versions of these metrics were used to compare across languages and tasks. Findings: We found that the participants had significantly longer average fixation duration and total fixation duration adjusted for source code length during bug fixing tasks than the feature addition tasks, indicating bug fixing is harder. Furthermore, participants looked at lines adjacent to the line containing the bug more often before looking at the buggy line itself. Participants who added a new feature correctly made their first edit earlier compared to those who failed to add the feature. Tasks in Python and C++ have similar overall fixation duration and counts when adjusted for character count. The participants spent more time fixating on the console output while doing Python tasks. Overall, task type has a bigger effect on the overall fixation duration and count compared to the programming language. Conclusions: CS educators can better support students in debugging their code if they know what they typically look at while bug fixing. For new feature tasks, training students not to fear edits to learn about the code could also be actively taught and encouraged in the classroom. CS education researchers can benefit by building better IDE plugins and tools based on eye movements that guide novices in recognizing bugs and aid in adding features. These results will lead to updating prior theories on mental models in program comprehension of how developers read and understand source code. They will eventually help in designing better programming languages and better methods of teaching programming based on evidence on how developers use them.",

The pervasiveness of software has led to a growing demand for software developers over the next decade. To ensure the high quality of software developed in industry, students being trained in software engineering also need to be trained on how to use testing techniques and supporting tools effectively at all levels of development. In this article, we investigate how testing tools are used in the software project of an undergraduate testing course. We also investigate how a cyberlearning environment—the Web-Based Repository of Software Testing Tutorials (WReSTT)—is used to supplement the learning materials presented in class, particularly the tutorials on different software testing tools. The results of a study spanning three semesters of the undergraduate course suggest that (1) the use of code coverage tools motivates students to improve their test suites; (2) the number of bugs found when using coverage tools slightly increased, which is similar to the results found in the research literature; and (3) students find WReSTT to be a useful resource for learning about software testing techniques and the use of code coverage tools.",

Four different methodologies, ranging from a traditional “just assign some intermediate milestones” to other more Agile methodologies, were first compared via a controlled experiment. The results of this initial experiment showed that the project methodology used made a significant difference in student outcomes. Surprisingly, the Agile Kanban approach was found to be much more effective than the Agile Scrum methodology. Based on these initial results, in the second semester, we focused on use of the Kanban methodology. The findings in the second, more qualitative phase, confirmed the methodology's usefulness and scalability. A key issue when using the scrum methodology was that the students had a very difficult time estimating what could be completed in each of their two-week sprints. The Kanban board, which visually shows and limits work-in-progress, was found to be an effective way for students to communicate with each other as well as with their instructor. In addition, Agile Kanban also streamlined the work required for instructors to efficiently provide guidance to student teams and to understand each team's status. In summary, a scalable Kanban methodology, which can be applied to a wide variety of student computing projects, was found to an effective methodology to guide and manage student projects, improving student outcomes and minimizing instructor workload.",

This article examines the role of high school course taking (AP, regular, or none) in mathematics and in CS as predictors of later success in college introductory computer science courses, measured by students’ final grades. Using a sample of 9,418 students from a stratified random sample of 118 U.S. colleges and universities, we found that the observed advantage of taking AP calculus over taking AP CS, seen in an uncontrolled model, was largely confounded by students’ background characteristics. After applying multinomial propensity score weighting, we estimated that the effects of taking AP calculus and AP CS on college CS grades were similar. Interestingly, enrollment in both AP calculus and AP CS did not have any additional positive effect, suggesting that both AP calculus and AP CS strengthened similar skills that are important for long-term CS achievement. Taking regular CS did not have a significant effect; taking regular calculus had a positive effect, about half the size of taking AP calculus or AP CS. Thus, the study showed that simply exposing students to any kind of CS course before college does not appear to be sufficient for improving college CS performance; and that advanced CS and advanced calculus in high school may substitute for each other in the preparation of college CS.",

    "abstract": "Design is a distinct discipline with its own practices, tools, professions, and areas of scholarship. However, practitioners from other fields often leverage aspects of design in their own work, leading to subfields like engineering design and architecture design that are neither wholly design nor wholly the intersecting discipline. Similarly, design and computing are known to intersect in educational contexts. Unfortunately, we do not yet have a clear understanding of how to characterize the kinds of design that may accompany computing topics, resulting in challenges to teaching and learning. This gap is particularly prevalent in K-12 computing education, where design is often used to promote student engagement but rarely studied as its own disciplinary phenomenon. Toward the goal of better understanding the nature and role of design in computing education, this article motivates and describes two qualitative, exploratory analyses of how design skills manifest in popular K-12 computing education curricula and activities. We find evidence to suggest two types of design within existing computing education curricula and standards: nondisciplinary problem-space design , which deals with defining software requirements, and disciplinary program-space design , which deals with choosing how best to meet those requirements. We find that these two types of computing design may exist independently, but they often overlap, creating an intriguing intersection of discipline-specific computing design educational activity. Finally, we discuss the practical implications of proceeding with research and educational practice in light of these results, highlighting the need for further exploration into the unique overlap of design and computing education.",

    "abstract": "As the field of computing education grows and matures, it has become essential to unite computing education and higher education research. Educational research has highlighted that how students study is crucial to their learning progress, and study behaviors have been found to play an important role in students’ academic success. This article presents the main results of a systematic literature review intended to determine what we know about the study behaviors of computing students and the role of educational design in shaping them. A taxonomy of study behaviors was developed and used to clarify and classify the definitions of study behavior, process, strategies, habits, and tactics as well as to identify their relationship to the educational context. The literature search resulted in 107 included papers, which were analyzed according to defined criteria and variables. The review of study behavior terminology found that the same terms are used to describe substantially different study behaviors, and the lack of standard terminology makes it difficult to compare findings from different papers. Furthermore, it was more common for papers to use study behaviors to explain other aspects of students rather than exploring and understanding them. Additionally, the results revealed a tendency to focus on specific educational contexts, predominantly introductory programming courses. Although computing education as a field is well equipped to expand the knowledge about both study behaviors and their connection to the educational context, the lack of common terminology and theories limits the impact. The taxonomy of study behaviors in computing education proposed in this article can contribute to contextualizing the research in such a way that researchers and educators across institutional borders can compare and utilize results. Last, the article outlines some areas for future research and recommendations for practice.",

Therefore, we need to understand the mindset of graduates to determine best practices for promoting professional skills development. In this study, we explore the perspective of computing graduates within an Engineering educational program. This study aims to answer the following research questions: Which skills do computing graduates perceive they need in the workplace, and how do they position themselves regarding these skills? What learning beliefs do computing graduates hold regarding the skills required in the workplace? The research team conducted semistructured interviews with computing graduates within an Engineering program to analyze their experiences. The interviews were analyzed using grounded theory. As a result, the participants viewed professional and technical skills as independent, with professional skills perceived as more relevant to work success. The participants considered themselves to possess these skills. Our findings identify four learning beliefs within a fixed and growth mindset: (1) An essential personal characteristic that context may influence; (2) a learning outcome determined by early experiences; (3) a learning process associated with informal learning experiences; and (4) a learning process associated with formal learning experiences. We acknowledge the differences in perception between alums and the industry regarding possessing essential professional skills. We also highlight the need to position these skills as learnable during lectures contributing to Computing and Engineering Education.",

    "abstract": "Emotions are a complex multi-faceted phenomenon. To assess the complexity of emotions from different facets, multi-modal approaches are necessary. However, multi-modal approaches are rarely used for assessing emotions, especially in the context of computer programming. This study adopts a multi-modal approach to understand the changes in students’ perception of emotions before and after working on programming problems. Understanding these changes in students’ perceptions may enable educators to devise interventions that help students adjust their perceptions and regulate their emotions as per their skills. We conducted a one-on-one programming session and retrospective think-aloud interview with 17 students from an introductory programming course. During the programming session, students filled surveys and performed four programming tasks. While working on these tasks, students’ eye gaze, video of face and screen, and electrodermal activity data were also collected using a non-invasive device. The data collection for this study was multi-modal, with a mix of both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods. Data analysis was primarily qualitative, with additional triangulation of qualitative and biometric data for select exemplars. The findings of this study suggest that students experience changes in emotions because of many reasons, for instance, they encountered repeated errors, they set high standards for their performance, or they could not manage time. For some students, negative emotions changed to positive emotions when they solved errors without any external help or achieved more than what they expected going into the task.

We present guidelines for the depiction of AI in narratives for four- to six-year-old children and deploy the guidelines to support the creation of two picture books. We assess both the guidelines and the resulting stories with children as experts and domain experts in the fields of education, technology, and storytelling. Our findings suggest there are advantages to using stories to communicate AI concepts due to their engaging and stimulating nature and that the guidelines were useful and could be easily applied. The feedback from subject matter experts highlighted the value of the guidelines but also reflected the ongoing challenges in defining a conceptually sound and meaningful depiction of AI for children.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent high interest among researchers and practitioners in learning programming, even the most dedicated learners can struggle to find motivation for studying and practicing programming. Therefore, in recent years, several strategies (e.g., educational games, flipped classrooms, and visual programming languages) have been employed to increase students’ engagement in programming studies. However, despite these efforts, no approach has proven efficient enough to sufficiently motivate these learners, and the community continues to search for novel strategies to enhance programming learners’ motivation. Building upon this, our study explores the use of unplugged gamification (i.e., gamification implemented without digital technology) combined with challenge-based learning during a programming workshop. Using Grounded Theory methods and data collected from focus groups, we analyzed and interpreted the perceptions of 24 programming learners regarding the gamified workshop. Learners reported experiencing collaboration while learning, with some indicating increased effort to obtain rewards, while others seemed to forget about the rewards altogether. Our findings provide valuable insights for computing teachers and researchers into how unplugged gamification combined with challenge-based learning is perceived by programming learners.",

    "abstract": "Sense of belonging, or belongingness in academia, is an individual’s personal conviction as to their acceptance as a valued member of an academic community. The importance of belongingness lies in correlations with motivation, persistence, mental health and well-being. Prior work has shown that belongingness can be lower in students who are minoritised due to their gender, race, nationality, socio-economic status, religion and/or disability. However, there is limited research on how a student’s university entry route impacts their sense of belonging in Computer Science and Other Science disciplines. In Ireland’s higher education system, university entry is primarily managed through the Central Applications Office (CAO) process, which predominantly serves students transitioning directly from secondary school to university. Additionally, alternative access routes are available for students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, those with disabilities, and mature students. At University College Dublin (UCD), entry is facilitated through both the traditional direct-entry school leaving route and combined access routes, each serving distinct student demographics. To investigate how these varying entry routes influence students’ sense of belonging, we utilised a survey adapted from the validated ‘Math Sense of Belonging Scale’ to examine the belongingness of undergraduate Science students, including Computer Science students. We examined how the belongingness of students varies by university entry route, and how the belongingness of students in Computer Science varies by university entry route compared to Other Science students. Our results reveal a significant difference in belongingness between students entering university through the direct-entry school leaving route, compared to those who entered via combined access routes (e.g. university admissions schemes for school leavers from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds, with disabilities, and mature students). Specifically, within Computer Science, students entering university through the direct-entry school leaving route had significantly higher belongingness than combined access route students. These results provide insight that may help others improve the belongingness of undergraduate Computer Science students.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a rise in recognition of the need for computing education to bridge the gap between academia and industry. In addition, educational researchers are also interested in increasing student engagement by grounding learning experiences in real-life concerns, community issues, or personal interests. Unfortunately, traditional lecture-based teaching techniques often fail to prepare students for the challenges they will face in real-world software development scenarios. Project-based learning (PjBL) takes a different approach by immersing students in real-world software engineering projects, allowing them to apply theoretical knowledge in practical contexts, building practical skills, fostering critical thinking, and improving problem-solving abilities. Prior literature reviews have explored aspects of PjBL in computing education, such as communication support, educational effectiveness, sprint organization, and capstone course design. However, no literature review extensively and comprehensively examines the following questions as a whole: where PjBL is used, how it is taught, why it should be used, and what challenges to expect in software-related computing courses. The review takes a systematic approach, incorporating a thorough search strategy across four academic databases and targeting keywords associated with PjBL and software computing in higher education. A total of 34 PjBL course attributes were extracted from 184 selected primary studies, which contributed to answering six research questions: (1) What computing courses use PjBL? (2) What is the nature of software projects used? (3) How are these projects organized? (4) How are students assessed and evaluated? (5) What are the reported impacts of PjBL? and (6) How are students supported throughout the projects? The literature review makes 4 key contributions: a description of the nature of software projects used and how these projects are organized, a highlight of the impacts of PjBL and the methods used to measure those impacts, a summary of the various forms of support provided to students throughout their projects, and the list of challenges encountered in implementing PjBL and recommendations to alleviate those challenges. This comprehensive review offers new insights and serves as a catalog of best practices for computing educators.",

The difference in academic integration was smaller among the profiles than the difference in professional integration.

    "abstract": "One of the challenges of global software engineering courses is to bring the practices and experience of large geographically distributed teams into the local and time-limited environment of a classroom. Over the last 6 years, an on-campus studio course for software engineering has been developed at the University of Queensland (UQ) that places small teams of students on different features of a common product. This creates two layers of collaboration, as students work within their teams on individual features, and the teams must interoperate with many other teams on the common product. The class uses continuous integration practices and predominantly asynchronous communication channels (Slack and GitHub) to facilitate this collaboration. The original goal of this design was to ensure that students would authentically experience issues associated with realistically sized software projects, and learn to apply appropriate software engineering and collaboration practices to overcome them, in a course without significant extra staffing. Data from the development logs showed that most commits take place outside synchronous class hours, and the project operates as a temporally distributed team even though the students are geographically co-located. Since 2015, a course adapted from this format has also been taught at the University of New England (UNE), an Australian regional university that is also a longstanding provider of distance education. In this course, most students study online, and the class has to be able to work globally, because as well as students taking part from around Australia, there are also typically a small number of students taking part from overseas. Transferring the course to a smaller but predominantly online institution has allowed us to evaluate the distributed nature of the course, by considering what aspects of the course needed to change to support students who are geographically distributed, and comparing how the two cohorts behave. This has produced an overall course design, to teach professional distributed software engineering practices, that is adaptable from large classes to small, and from local to global.",

    "abstract": "When compared to earlier programming and data structure experiences that our students might have, the perspective changes on computers and programming when introducing theoretical computer science into the picture. Underlying computational models need to be addressed, and mathematical tools employed, to understand the quality criteria of theoretical computer science. Focus shifts from doing to proving. Over several years, we have tried to make this perspective transition smoother for the students of a third-year mandatory algorithms, data structures, and computational complexity course. The concepts receiving extra attention in this work are NP-completeness, one of the most central concepts in computer science, and dynamic programming, an algorithm construction method that is powerful but somewhat unintuitive for some students. The major difficulties that we attribute to NP-completeness are that the tasks look similar but have a different purpose than in algorithm construction exercises. Students do not immediately see the usefulness of the concept, and hence motivation could be one issue. One line of attacking NP-completeness has been to emphasize its algorithmic aspects using typical tools for teaching algorithms. Some potential difficulties associated with dynamic programming are that the method is based on a known difficult concept—recursion—and that there are many ingredients in a dynamic programming solution to a problem. For both dynamic programming and NP-completeness, we have invented several new activities and structured the teaching differently, forcing students to think and adopt a standpoint, and practice the concepts in programming assignments. Student surveys show that these activities are appreciated by the students, and our evaluations indicate that they have positive effects on learning. We believe that these activities could be useful in any similar course. The approach to improving the course is action research, and the evaluation has been done using course surveys, self-efficacy surveys, rubrics-like grading protocols, and grades. We have also interviewed teaching assistants about their experiences.",

Moreover, many faculty members often struggle with knowing “how much” of a particular subject they should teach to their students and at what level. This small-scale, exploratory study seeks to uncover the existence of “threshold concepts” within Web development. Threshold concepts are the fundamental concepts which, once mastered, allow a learner to progress to a deeper understanding of a subject. An online questionnaire was sent out to 24 instructors within UK higher education institutions who teach Web development subjects. Nine participants responded to the questionnaire and interviews were conducted with five to discuss and expand on the responses provided, resulting in the identification of four areas that were perceived as difficult for students to grasp when learning Web development. Analysis of these areas suggests that threshold concepts do exist within the subject and we offer up two candidates for the field of Web development: basic programming principles and decomposition and abstraction . Designing a curriculum based on threshold concepts and less on the latest methods, tools, and techniques can go a long way in helping students to become experts in their chosen discipline.",

Even if modern development environments (IDEs) provide high-level support for navigating through code elements and for identifying the right conditions leading to the bug, debugging still requires considerable human effort. Programmers usually have to make hypotheses that are based on both program state evolution and their past debugging experiences. To mitigate this effort and allow novice programmers to gain debugging experience quickly, we propose an approach based on the reuse of existing bugs of open source systems to provide informed guidance from the failure site to the fault position. The goal is to help novices in reasoning on the most promising paths to follow and conditions to define. We implemented this approach as a tool that exploits the knowledge about fault and bug position in the system, as long as any bug of the system is known. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through a quasi-experiment that qualitatively and quantitatively evaluates how the debugging performances of the students change when they are trained using the tool.",

While numerous frameworks exist in this domain, they often lack consideration of student preferences, which are integral for fostering learner autonomy. Our proposed framework, with components developed from the constructivist learning theory, emphasises creating knowledge through interaction with the environment, focusing on autonomy, mastery, and purpose as drivers of intrinsic outcomes. Through a survey administered to hundred and fifty-seven participants, we sought to identify student-preferred strategies for learning computational thinking skills via VR interventions. Results highlighted key challenges students face when working on computational tasks are related to algorithmic and abstraction thinking. To ease the aforementioned challenges, our findings suggest a preference among students for situated-based learning approaches within VR environments. Additionally, participants recognized the importance of motivational outcomes in improving autonomy and mastery within VR-based learning tasks. Students also preferred tasks that enhanced self-efficacy, contributing to a greater sense of purpose in their learning endeavours. Overall, this investigation sets a foundation for more student-centric, constructivist, and intrinsically-based VR frameworks in education.",

This paper explores our experience teaching the use of Programming Mistake Detector (PMD) to foster a culture of bug fixing and leverage LLM to improve software quality in the classroom. This paper discusses the results of an experiment involving 155 submissions that carried out a code review activity of 1,658 rules. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis reveals that a set of PMD quality issues influences the acceptance or rejection of the issues, and design-related categories that take longer to resolve. Although students acknowledge the potential of using ChatGPT during code review, some skepticism persists. Further, constructing prompts for ChatGPT that possess clarity, complexity, and context nurtures vital learning outcomes, such as enhanced critical thinking, and among the 1,658 issues analyzed, 93% of students indicated that ChatGPT did not identify any additional issues beyond those detected by PMD. Conversations between students and ChatGPT encompass five categories, including ChatGPT’s use of affirmation phrases like ‘certainly’ regarding bug fixing decisions, and apology phrases such as ‘apologize’ when resolving challenges. Through this experiment, we demonstrate that code review can become an integral part of the educational computing curriculum. We envision our findings to enable educators to support students with effective code review strategies, increasing awareness of LLMs, and promoting software quality in education.",

    "abstract": "Objectives. Athletics and sports represent a focal part of adolescence for millions of youth around the world. However, opportunities to engage in computer science learning experiences are less prevalent, particularly among Hispanic and low-income communities. Recently, researchers have explored ways to bridge these, seemingly, disparate disciplines. Much of this prior research centers on the proliferation of sports technologies that support individualistic learning experiences. Additionally, many of these experiences are developed by researchers with limited design contributions from sports practitioners. To extend prior work, this project centers youth athletic identities and the associated cultural contexts of sports to explore ways that computing technologies can enhance and develop youth athletic identities and sports performance. Moreover, this work surfaces ways that athletics can be a generative and fulfilling space to learn about computer science. Participants. In summer 2021, we collaborated with basketball coaches to design and implement a computing-enhanced learning experience with a basketball team of Hispanic participants in Puerto Rico. Eleven basketball athletes from a high school in southern Puerto Rico participated in the study. The participants have strong sports identities, as demonstrated by their lifelong engagement with team sports. Conversely, only one out of the eleven participants had experienced sports technologies, and none of them had previously participated in computing learning experiences. Study Method. In collaboration with local basketball coaches, we co-designed a learning experience that centers sports identities and practices and adds computing as a way to extend existing sports identities and local sports activities. We present and evaluate this learning experience using a design-based research approach. Participants’ feedback was collected in the form of surveys, designs, and journal entries, and additional data on their experiences were collected via videos and researchers’ field notes. Using a mixed-methods approach, we highlight existing participants’ identities and perceptions as well as their experiences with our design. We complement quantitative analysis of survey responses with case studies. Findings. We find that our design can provide shifts in youth student-athletes’ perceptions of computing. Additionally, hands-on experiences with computing tools enable participants to start practicing computer science sensemaking via learning how different computing tools can support their sports performance individually and as a team. Furthermore, we find that the material, ideational and relational resources made available through camp:bit supported each participant differently, while collectively providing a space for all of them to have meaningful and fulfilling experiences. Finally, we find that this design can foster and support sports team cohesion. Conclusions. We provide in-depth descriptions of our design, the youth’s engagement with it, and how these learning experiences can be further applied in sports spaces. These examples highlight a unique conception of practice-linked computational identities—where learners’ computational identities are grounded in a specific culturally relevant practice, enabling a more culturally sustaining computing learning experience. Finally, our analysis suggests five design principles for designing and conducting computing-supported learning experiences in sports environments. The principles are as follows: 1. Sports Experience: Authentically Support Existing Identities. 2. Team Dynamics: Team Athletes are Part of a Whole. 3. Individual Pursuits: Supporting Individual Paths. 4. Direct Interactions: Conversations with Materials and Ideas. 5. Interdisciplinary Facilitation Team: Complementary Skills. These design principles can be used by researchers, practitioners, and local stakeholders to implement sport-centric CS learning experiences to extend and enhance the way student-athletes from marginalized communities practice sports, as well as to activate interest and engagement in CS.",

    "abstract": "Objectives. Game development students have a daunting career ahead of them, complicated by competitive industry hiring, the passion behind digital media and entertainment work, and inequitable work cultures. By understanding the work-life experiences of graduated game development students in digital media careers, higher education curriculum can be designed to model ill-structured problems and engage students in practicing how to balance work and life while developing relevant skills. Participants. Eleven participants who graduated from one game development program at Purdue University span a diverse range of ethnicities, gender identities, and disciplines in digital media, including art, production, animation, and design; no programmers were available in opportunistic sampling. Study Method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with each participant to explore their preconceptions of the digital media industry in education, current experiences in their work and workplaces, and preferences for the future of the industry. Through lenses of critical pedagogy, signature pedagogy, and hidden curriculum, interview data were analyzed using thematic analysis through a constant comparative method. Findings. Themes related to shared and contradicting experiences were reported. Most participants had heard horror stories about working in the digital media industry, but they did not turn away from it. Some positions follow strict pipelines, while others in the same field flexibly shift software programs and tasks throughout the day. Crunch time can be, but is not always, inevitable in the industry, depending on the workplace and circumstances. Participants divulged love-hate relationships with their career fields and their work; conditions are better than expected in some ways, and worse in others. These understandings characterize how difficult it is to form lasting curricular priorities and structures that can prepare students for the extreme variety of industrial environments they may apply to. Conclusions. The authors conclude that designing coursework toward a flexible, critical, dialogic curriculum would invite students to engage with faculty more deeply and personally in career development. Instead of repeatedly restructuring predetermined curricular paths to ever-advancing specialized industry positions, time and energy can be spent guiding students to study existing career paths and purposefully tapping into the technical knowledge and insights of faculty. When problematic elements of work culture—such as coercion to overwork—may currently be part of a hidden curriculum, we recommend that they be integrated into the formal curriculum, to be interrogated together by students and faculty alike. By continuing to network with graduated students entering the industry as novices, and keeping up with industry veterans, instructors can model existing problems for students to anticipate and respond to.",

    "abstract": "Background and Context. Computing is considered a fundamental skill for civic engagement, self-expression, and employment opportunity. Despite this, there exist significant equity gaps in post-secondary computing enrollment and retention. Specifically, in the California State University system (CSU), which serves close to half a million undergraduate students, students identifying as Hispanic/Latino make up a smaller percentage of CS majors than expected from the state’s overall population; and, once enrolled, tend to leave the CS major at higher rates than other students. Purpose. We report on the impacts of a curricular intervention aimed at strengthening the sense of belonging of Hispanic/Latino students in computing, with the eventual goal of improving retention in computing majors for those students. Methods. Working in an alliance of six universities within the CSU (five of which are designated as Hispanic-Serving Institutions), we have incorporated socially responsible computing across early CS courses. We aim for alignment between our curriculum and students’ communal goal orientations, and for coursework that attends to students’ interests, values, and cultural assets. Over a two-year-long study, we collected survey data to learn about the impact of our curricular intervention on students’ sense of belonging and perceived learning and agency. Findings. We found that students generally reported high communal goal orientations and, at the campuses without competitive enrollment policies, our intervention had a significant positive impact on students’ senses of belonging. This effect was observed between control and treatment terms as well as within treatment terms. We also note that Hispanic/Latino students were more likely than other students to report that non-curricular factors like work and family obligations interfered with their learning, and appeared to experience slightly stronger benefits from the intervention. Implications. Our data suggest positive outcomes for integrating socially responsible computing into early CS courses, especially for Hispanic/Latino students at certain primarily-undergraduate institutions (PUIs). Unlike much prior research, we found that conducting studies outside of primarily white institutions (PWIs) can provide new insights into the impact of curricular interventions on student experience and retention. Our varying results by campus suggest that factors such as campus population, acceptance rate, and departmental enrollment policies ought to also be taken into account in studies that aim to broaden participation in computing. Would results from prior research on recruitment and retention of Hispanic/Latino students or other underrepresented students look different if such studies were replicated at institutions with different demographics and enrollment policies?",

These include technical capabilities of algorithms, such as the use of artificial intelligence, that enable novel interactions between humans and their environment and give rise to societal and ethical concerns. In this article, we investigate how to engage students through diverse learning paths in computing education. We emphasise students who are generally less motivated to learn about technology and their ethical and societal implications, focusing on primary students (13-14 years) in a culturally diverse Danish public school. Based on design ethnographic studies and nexus analysis the study explored learning activities and social interactions in relation to students’ individual learning paths. The work extends Smith’s and Iversen’s (2018) framework on student archetypes in learning about digital technology to include aspects of diversity and inclusive education. The findings highlight, first, the impact of students’ cultural backgrounds in their learning paths even within the same archetype; second, opportunities for embodied learning strategies to engage “not (yet) motivated” students; third, benefits for the interplay between different student archetypes in classroom dynamics and fourth, how students may shift between archetypes depending on the learning context and theme.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Computer Science Education does not have a universally defined set of concepts consistently covered in all introductory courses (CS1). One approach to understanding the concepts covered in CS1 is to ask educators. In 2004, Nell Dale did just this. She also collected their perceptions on challenging topics to teach. Dale mused how the findings of a similar survey conducted in later years would compare with her results. Objectives: We answered Dale’s call to consider changes in teaching CS1 concepts by performing a replication study 20 years later. Our goals were to determine how the teaching of CS1 concepts has changed and to identify concepts educators perceive as challenging to teach. Methods: We created a survey based on Dale’s original study and added concepts from the CS2023 recommended curricula to include CS1 concepts for today’s teaching practice. We used a mixed-methods approach to analyse the 178 responses from CS1 educators. Results: Our survey results show Python is predominately used to teach today’s CS1 courses, with educators continuing to teach basic programming concepts similar to 20 years ago. However, our survey shows recursion continues to be challenging to teach, with most secondary school educators perceiving it does not belong in CS1. Today’s educators also teach less of the CS1 concepts from 20 years ago, such as inheritance and polymorphism, and have a limited focus on ethics and professionalism in their courses. Participants also found good learning behaviours like thinking and planning strategies challenging to teach. Conclusion: We conclude our paper by discussing the challenges of conducting a replication study, which includes reproducing studies with limited or no access to the original instruments. We present future research opportunities raised by the study’s findings, including how to support educators in teaching the challenging concept of good learning behaviours and further refine curricular guidelines to remove ambiguity on concepts covered in CS1 and CS2 courses.",

Given the study’s emphasis on both instructional approaches and learner motivation, the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning served as the theoretical framework, as it integrates instructional design with motivational perspectives. The participants consisted of 75 university students who were non-computer majors and enrolled in their first programming course. A 2 × 2 between-subjects ANOVA design was employed, with two factors: explanation type (worked examples with instructional explanations vs. worked examples with guided questions to prompt self-explanations) and learner motivation level (high-motivated vs. less-motivated). The dependent variables included cognitive load components experienced by learners during learning and learning outcomes measured by retention and transfer performance. The results showed that (a) the worked example effect could reduce extraneous load and manage intrinsic load, thereby enhancing retention performance; (b) the combined effects of worked examples and guided self-explanations could benefit transfer learning, regardless of learners’ motivation; and (c) the role of motivation was evident, as high-motivated learners exhibited better retention and transfer performance by exerting more cognitive effort, regardless of instructional approach. The findings suggest that combining worked examples with guided questions to prompt self-explanations through in-code commenting is an effective and constructive activity, enabling novices to focus on actual learning without expending excessive cognitive effort.",

Instructors wishing to develop teamwork skills are faced with many teamwork models and a lack of empirical studies that examine their utility in higher education. We conducted an exploratory study to examine teamwork components of attitudinal, behavioral, and cognitive psychological facets (collectively called ABCs) in eight undergraduate software engineering teams composed of 14 to 17 members. We answered two research questions: Which teamwork components were the least developed at the beginning of the project, and Which teamwork components remained underdeveloped by the end of the project. For each team, we conducted two focus group discussions, and analyzed four sprint retrospective reports during the semester. We synthesize the gathered data to define each team by the presence of teamwork components, development of teamwork components, experienced challenges, average course grades, and project results. Teamwork components that were initially underdeveloped were Mutual performance monitoring, Shared cognitions, Leadership, Communication, Psychological safety and Trust. Two teamwork components that remained underdeveloped were Shared cognitions and Mutual performance monitoring. The answer to our first question highlights teamwork components that instructors should pay attention to in their teamwork-oriented courses. For the second question, we explain the mechanisms that we applied to develop teamwork components and highlight which components were the most challenging to develop, as well as in which period instructors should provide the most support to students. Engineering education researchers might benefit from our methodological design, measurement instruments, and raw data to conduct studies in their contexts.",

    "abstract": "The human aspects of cyber security are fundamental as these are interlinked with processes and technology in building resilience against an evolving and complex threat landscape. It is vital to teach future cyber security specialists sufficient knowledge about human aspects in order to strengthen the defences and defend against malicious actors. The challenges in the cyber security course and curriculum design in higher education arise from ambiguity of what is meant by “human aspects” in cyber security, and differing demands of a multitude of cyber security job profiles. As a result, choosing what human aspects knowledge and skills to teach and balancing this with technical content is a multiplex problem. We review the existing cyber security curricular guidance on the human aspects and perform a systematic literature review of academic research. The review covers what human aspects content is included in existing cyber security courses and curricula, what are the design philosophies and pedagogical approaches to teaching human aspects, and how the effectiveness of the content coverage and pedagogical approaches is evaluated in higher education with cyber security specialisation. The main findings are that although high-level guidance is available, there is no academic agreement and common vocabulary on the human aspects of cyber security. The research covering teaching human aspects is often very high level or focuses on a narrow topic (e.g., social engineering). The published research and sharing knowledge on the pedagogical approaches and evaluation varies in quality and is often published based on the USA’s universities’ experience. The interdisciplinary approach in cyber security, where human behaviour is a crucial component (i.e., human-centric cyber security), has been discussed for years. However, only when giving enough human aspects focus in the curricula and choosing appropriate pedagogical approaches will academia shape the future of cyber security education to achieve this goal.",

We meet this challenge by developing an automarker for HCI “MarCHIr” to assess key aspects of web prototypes: visual design, interactivity, and accessibility. MarCHIr automatically compiles web prototypes and analyses them at the pixel level to assess designs using foundational Gestalt visual principles. While computer science student assessments are often personalised with permutations of numbers, we use random assignment of colours to personalise creative prototype assignments at the scale of hundreds of students. Finally, MarCHIr integrates industry accessibility checks to HCI student assessment. We share two years of case study data across two cohorts of university students and reflect on implications for the use of automated assessment within HCI tertiary education.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: Students learning to program often reach states where they are stuck and can make no forward progress – but this may be outside the classroom where no instructor is available to help. In this situation, an automatically generated next-step hint can help them make forward progress and support their learning. It is important to know what makes a good hint or a bad hint, and how to generate good hints automatically in novice programming tools, for example using Large Language Models (LLMs). Method and participants: We recruited 44 Java educators from around the world to participate in an online study. We used a set of real student code states as hint-generation scenarios. Participants used a technique known as comparative judgement to rank a set of candidate next-step Java hints, which were generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) and by five human experienced educators. Participants ranked the hints without being told how they were generated. The hints were generated with no explicit detail given to the LLMs/humans on what the target task was. Participants then filled in a survey with follow-up questions. The ranks of the hints were analysed against a set of extracted hint characteristics using a random forest approach. Findings: We found that LLMs had considerable variation in generating high quality next-step hints for programming novices, with GPT-4 outperforming other models tested. When used with a well-designed prompt, GPT-4 outperformed human experts in generating pedagogically valuable hints. A multi-stage prompt was the most effective LLM prompt. According to a fitted random forest model, the two most important factors of a good hint were length (80–160 words being best), and reading level (US grade nine or below being best). Offering alternative approaches to solving the problem was considered bad, and we found no effect of sentiment. Conclusions: Automatic generation of these hints is immediately viable, given that LLMs outperformed humans – even when the students’ task is unknown. Hint length and reading level were more important than several pedagogical features of hints. The fact that it took a group of experts several rounds of experimentation and refinement to design a prompt that achieves this outcome suggests that students on their own are unlikely to be able to produce the same benefit. The prompting task, therefore, should be embedded in an expert-designed tool.",

The research focuses on perceptions and experiences about learning activities and teaching computer science and how students and teachers view these aspects as valuable for these activities. To better understand research problems and complex phenomena, a mixed-methods concurrent approach was developed for this research, with the qualitative part being the major component (QUAL + quant). The data collected was based on interviews with students and academic staff, surveys, and class observations. Quantitative data from surveys were converted into narratives that were analysed qualitatively (meaning we qualitized the data). The results show that students who identify as women relied more on formal teaching, while students who identify as men found informal teaching and smaller class sizes more important in their learning approaches. The interaction with the teaching assistants (TAs) was found to be more important for the students who identify as women than for the students who identify as men. As for learning preferences, women preferred more direct instruction, while male students were interested in more complex settings flexibly commuting between competitive, cooperative and individual learning approaches. Neither women nor men preferred single-gender classes. It was noticed that a small class size is not automatically a solution, as in our case male students benefited from small classes, while some women felt without adequate support.",

    "abstract": "Objectives The traditional, instructor-led form of live coding has been extensively studied, with findings showing that this form of live coding imparts similar learning to static-code examples. However, a concern with Traditional Live Coding is that it can turn into a passive learning activity for students as they simply observe the instructor program. Therefore, this study compares Active Live Coding—a form of live coding that leverages in-class coding activities and peer discussion—to Traditional Live Coding on three outcomes: 1) students’ adherence to effective programming processes, 2) students’ performance on exams and in-lecture questions, and 3) students’ lecture experience. Participants Roughly 530 students were enrolled in an advanced, CS1 course taught in Java at a large, public university in North America. The students were primarily first- and second-year undergraduate students with some prior programming experience. The student population was spread across two lecture sections—348 students in the Active Live Coding (ALC) lecture and 185 students in the Traditional Live Coding (TLC) lecture. Study Methods We used a mixed-methods approach to answer our‘ research questions. To compare students’ programming processes, we applied process-oriented metrics related to incremental development and error frequencies. To measure students’ learning outcomes, we compared students’ performance on major course components and used pre- and post-lecture questionnaires to compare students’ learning gain during lectures. Finally, to understand students’ lecture experience, we used a classroom observation protocol to measure and compare students’ behavioral engagement during the two lectures. We also inductively coded open-ended survey questions to understand students’ perceptions of live coding. Findings We did not find a statistically significant effect of ALC on students’ programming processes or learning outcomes. It seems that both ALC and TLC impart similar programming processes and result in similar student learning. However, our findings related to students’ lecture experience shows a persistent engagement effect of ALC, where students’ behavioral engagement peaks and remains elevated after the in-class coding activity and peer discussion. Finally, we discuss the unique affordances and drawbacks of the lecture technique as well as students’ perceptions of ALC. Conclusions Despite being motivated by well-established learning theories, Active Live Coding did not result in improved student learning or programming processes. This study is preceded by several prior works that showed that Traditional Live Coding imparts similar student learning and programming skills as static-code examples. Though potential reasons for the lack of observed learning benefits are discussed in this work, multiple future analyses to further investigate Active Live Coding may help the community understand the impacts (or lack thereof) of the instructional technique.",

    "abstract": "Identity has received ample attention in computing education research from the viewpoint of “computing identity” and broadening participation, while more attention has been called for to clarify its role. We looked into identity development in the context of Computer Science 1 (CS1) based on Marcia's identity statuses and subsequent developments of identity development scale. We attempted to understand identity by integrating other acknowledged variables into our analyses, including student background information, intrinsic motivation, and self-efficacy. This exploratory investigation is comprised of two studies, the first of which was a preliminary inspection of the distributions and correlations, and the latter more focused on the pre and post-measurements. All data were collected through questionnaires during CS1 courses. The results include that maintaining commitment in terms of identity development is linked with and supported by increased experiences of competence. Another finding was that ruminative identity exploration negatively correlates with self-efficacy. These suggest that supporting student learning is an important effort and that students’ self-efficacy challenges should be addressed by also paying attention to students’ worries in the context of identity development. Other indications included that exploration in breadth (cf. getting a picture of the field) was linked with experienced value and usefulness, and hence should be supported by faculties. The factor analysis suggested several hypotheses that warrant further research. Overall, we believe that this exploratory study paves the way for follow-up studies.",

    "abstract": "Code quality is a critical aspect of programming, as high-quality code is easier to maintain, and code maintenance constitutes the majority of software costs. Consequently, code quality should be emphasized in programming education. While previous research has identified numerous code quality defects commonly made by students, the current state lacks a clear organization and prioritization of these defects. In this work, we systematically address code quality defects in introductory programming from multiple perspectives. We present a comprehensive catalog of over 100 specific defects, organized through a structured classification of defect types and their associated programming constructs, along with an importance ranking. We conducted a survey among computer science educators regarding the severity of various defects. Our findings indicate that while individual opinions vary, there is general consensus on many code quality issues. We also review automated methods for detecting code quality defects and introduce a novel tool with extensive defect coverage. Finally, we analyze the prevalence of these defects using multiple datasets and prevalence metrics, demonstrating the importance of contextual interpretation when evaluating defect prevalence.",

    "abstract": "Computing education has historically sought to align the education students receive in their formal programs with the proficiency required to succeed in the workplace. In recent years, research in this area has focused on dispositions which are affective qualities that are integral to completing work tasks and a component of competency, in addition to skills and knowledge. Lifelong learning has been recognized as an essential disposition for success in the workplace given the frequently changing expertise required in the profession. Although the relevance of dispositions for computing competency has been established, there is a distinct lack of research on ’dispositions in context’. In particular, we are missing empirical work that connects a lifelong learning orientation to professional work practices. This paper presents findings from a practice-based field study that examined the lifelong learning disposition of computing professionals. At the time of the study, participants were in the process of learning new data science skills to transition from a traditional software development profile to data analytics projects. In-depth interviews were conducted with ten members of a technology company and data was analyzed using an interpretive approach. The analysis revealed three essential elements of a lifelong learning orientation in the workplace: metacognition, self-regulation, and adaptability. To be successful in lifelong learning, participants had to be aware of the need to continue learning and developing skills (metacognition); they had to implement a variety of practices to develop those skills (self-regulation); and, given the changing nature of their work and profession, they had to continually adapt (adaptability) their skills to the needs of their industry and organization. Our analysis further shows that these elements are not independent of each other, but highly intertwined, one triggering the other. This study contributes to the growing literature on dispositions within computing education using a real-world workplace study of disposition in context and draws implications for computing education and computing education research.",

We survey the key findings of this body of work, exploring the extent to which they generalize across diverse populations and educational contexts. We situate these findings within the broader aims of the field of computer science education, critiquing the use of music as a motivational tool in computing education rather than as a topic worthy of exploration in its own right. Methodological limitations are identified, with recommendations for future research to address these gaps.

Accompanying this trend arises the need to assess the students’ learning of ML, yet so far only a few assessment models have been proposed, most of them rather simple, based on quizzes or self-assessments. In this context, we previously developed and evaluated a model for the performance-based assessment of the student’s learning of ML for image classification based on the ML artifacts created by the students as a learning outcome as part of the “ML for All” course, indicating good reliability (coefficient Omega = 0.834) and validity. Evolving this assessment model, we present in this article a scale associated with the level of student learning and a descriptive interpretation of student performance using Item Response Theory (IRT) based on data collected from 240 students. The results of this research can support the learning of ML by providing feedback to students and supporting teachers.",

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for a diverse pool of computing talent combined with a persistent shortage of skilled workers has engendered a need to support students pursuing computer science (CS) careers. Students often cite social isolation and lack of support as reasons for withdrawing from computing programs. This is especially true for those from underrepresented groups. One approach to combat these issues and to increase retention is to help students build communities of practice. This paper introduces the HELP Lab Emotional Learning Process Data (HELPd) Empathy Tool which was developed to generate emotional learning process (ELP) data-based interventions to help students build community. We intended to investigate the effectiveness of HELPd in supporting community building, but study participants did not proceed beyond self-reporting their emotions, which generated empathy nudges, only the first step in our scaffold for building community. As a result, our original study transformed into an empirical study of the design and usage of HELPd itself. Literature on affective learning and learning analytics provided guidance on the construction of HELPd. The underlying concept is that ELP data can be used to help students understand how both they and their peers feel during the programming process, allowing them to become more empathetic toward each other. Empathy, in turn, will lead to help-seeking and helpgiving, and these interactions will lead to community building. HELPd integrates a customized IDE to gather programming behavior data and a web application to collect ELP data. HELPd uses both sets of data to generate ELP data-based interventions. From this study, we learned that tools such as HELPd must be integrated into classroom coursework or students will not fully benefit from them. We recommend design changes to HELPd, including customizing interventions to engage populations from underrepresented groups and from groups with other demographics. With our recommended design changes and coursework integration, tools such as HELPd should help students to build community through help-seeking and help-giving actions.",

    "abstract": "To cultivate more computing talent (including more diverse talent), it is important to understand how college students experience their computing courses and if such experiences vary based on students’ gender and racial/ethnic identities. In this paper, we focus on course modality to understand whether taking courses in-person, online, or a hybrid of both shapes undergraduates’ computing orientation (i.e., interest and confidence in computing) and whether such dynamics vary by students’ gender and/or racial/ethnic background. Participants included 5,904 undergraduate students attending college during the COVID-19 era and who took a computer programming course at one of 16 research universities across the United States. Using secondary student survey data, we quantitatively analyze the effect of several background and college-related variables on students’ computing orientation (interest and confidence in computing). In particular, we investigate variables related to students’ computing contexts, pedagogy of the first course, student-faculty interactions, and course instructional modes. Post-hoc analyses reveal the extent to which these variables predict students’ sense of belonging. ANOVA results indicate that students who took courses completely in person, compared to all other course modes, reported greater gains in their computing orientation. Regression results suggest that, net of other predictors, online courses (in particular those offered synchronously) contribute less to students’ computing orientation than computing courses offered in person. Furthermore, tests for interaction effects suggest that the effect of online learning does not appear to vary by students’ gender and/or race/ethnicity; however, the role played by online courses can be enhanced when such courses foster a greater sense of belonging among students. The study suggests that online courses can be improved when such courses foster more inclusive and supportive learning environments.",

    "abstract": "Design problems are often ill-structured as the requirements are broadly defined and have multiple correct solutions. Experts solve such problems by applying various cognitive and metacognitive skills before the formal specifications and solution designs are documented. Novices often need help solving ill-structured design problems as they lack the skills and experience and thus tend to focus on one aspect of the system, leading to incomplete design. We aim to address this issue by designing and developing a technology-enhanced learning environment, Fathom, to train novices in practicing the skills necessary to solve ill-structured design problems. Fathom is scaffolded with cognitive and metacognitive support to enable learners to practice and reflect upon the targeted skills. We conducted a between-subjects experimental study with 82 second-year undergraduate students in a computer science engineering program. The control group received traditional, classroom-based intervention with prompts and worked examples. The experimental group used Fathom, which integrated external representations, question prompts, worked examples, and immediate feedback. Quantitative and qualitative analyses revealed that the experimental group performed significantly better in problem-solving skills and approaches than in the control group. The results suggest that a scaffolded, technology-enhanced learning environment like Fathom can effectively support the development of problem-solving skills for ill-structured design problems in undergraduate computer engineering education.",

In this study, we explored how one particular post-secondary education program at one historically black institution known as the Google in Residence (GIR) program impacted students’ interests and their pursuit of computing-related careers. Data on employment outcomes at this institution showed that the GIR participants who obtained internships and full-time employment at Google were predominantly international students, not African American students who make up the majority of the undergraduate student population. To understand this phenomenon better, we interviewed 27 students who spanned all four years of study and included African American and international students. The interviews were structured to elicit a wide range of factors influencing career decisions. Our analysis describes the impact of a particular GIR introductory-level programming course and other GIR program impacts beyond the introductory-level course. We found that the GIR introductory course was engaging, inspired students to change their degree in a more computing-oriented direction and supported internship applications. The informational workshops, networking events, mock-interviews, and advising of the computer science club, which were supported by the GIR program, built students’ confidence in interviewing and obtaining full-time employment within the tech industry. While the GIR course and program had a positive influence on students of all backgrounds, the reputation of Google was especially motivating for international students. However, the African American students in this study generally had career aspirations and goals that were less tied to specific companies or industries. Based on our findings, potential improvements could include broadening awareness and access of the GIR course to non-computer science majors, offering summer programs to increase students’ computational confidence, and increasing the diversity of GIR and computer science instructors.",

    "abstract": "Programming demands a variety of cognitive skills, and mastering these competencies is essential for success in computer science education. The importance of formative feedback is well acknowledged in programming education, and thus a diverse range of techniques has been proposed to generate and enhance formative feedback for programming exercises. This paper reviews state-of-the-art automated feedback generation techniques and categorizes the various approaches based on the underlying computational techniques, programming languages, the kind of programming errors they deal with, and the type of feedback they provide. It covers data-driven techniques, those which use program repair methods, machine learning-based techniques, and techniques based around the use of large language models, particularly noting the rapid uptake of the latter. The paper provides a summary of key findings and challenges, alongside recommendations for future work. The findings reveal that although there exist numerous tools for automated programming feedback, many studies depend on non-public benchmarks, which limits reproducibility and independent evaluation of the tools and their datasets. Additionally, tools are not always language-agnostic, and in some cases involve complex configuration steps. Large language models have demonstrated transformative potential in generating feedback. However, most research has focused on introductory courses (CS1 and CS2) indicating the need to apply them in advanced fields like machine learning and image processing. Although large language models have outperformed traditional approaches, challenges related to hallucinations and incorrect responses still need to be addressed as precision is critical in a pedagogical setting. Most of the studies use proprietary models that lack transparency and customization options, emphasizing the need for further research into open LLM alternatives.",

    "abstract": "Gender imbalance in the technology sector is a long-standing issue. For several decades computer science (CS) outreach activities have become an established strategy for encouraging girls to pursue courses and careers in the field of computing. However, it is not clear how impactful these initiatives are, or what elements make them valuable. A systematic review of general CS outreach initiatives (including both male and female) reported that such programmes tend to be underdeveloped in terms of measuring their impact. In light of this observation, and the ongoing need to address gender imbalance in CS, this paper provides a systematic review of girls CS outreach literature from 1996-2023. The research question addressed is: “What are the characteristics of all-female adolescent and pre-adolescent computing outreach activities and how is their impact measured?” The review concludes that these initiatives tend to share much in common in terms of their aims and the approaches followed, including the use of female mentors, the activities engaged in, and the settings in which they are carried out. The majority of papers reported some level of programme evaluation. There is some evidence, at least in the short-term, that perceptions of CS, self-efficacy, and plans to pursue CS as course of study show modest positive improvement. The evidence for lasting or long-term impact of interventions is more limited.",

The study presented in this article is part of a longitudinal research project on programming education in two primary schools in Sweden. This article focuses on data collected through classroom observations conducted from 2019 to 2021, specifically on teacher introductions of programming activities in grades 1-8. A total of 383 minutes of introductions have been observed and analyzed through 1) a designs for learning-perspective, combined with 2) the Scratch computational thinking framework. The analysis has shed light on how teachers introduce programming in practice and identified three strategies used: explorative, structured and systematic. Furthermore, our findings suggest that teachers primarily introduce programming using existing online resources, which are utilised in various ways depending on the strategy employed. While a teacher using an explorative strategy tends to outsource the teaching to resources, a teacher with a systematic strategy integrates and facilitates a discussion with students using resources as support. The same teacher can, however, employ different strategies depending on, for instance, the grade level or the topic to be covered.

    "abstract": "This study investigates how young learners employ symbolic representations through embodied strategies to program educational robots. Drawing on video data from interviews with 22 students (ages 7–8), the analysis identifies three distinct representational practices: Tool-oriented, Agent-oriented, and Path-oriented. In Tool-oriented and Agent-oriented approaches, students consistently translated arrow tiles into correct movement sequences, aligning with the robot’s discrete rotation and forward commands. Conversely, Path-oriented strategies, in which tiles were placed to trace the robot’s physical path on a grid, sometimes led to misunderstandings of rotation commands, giving rise to disagreements and incorrect solutions. By comparing these practices, the study illuminates the role of bodily gestures, spatial reasoning, and symbolic artifacts in shaping how children conceptualize the robot’s “logic.” Although Path-oriented strategies may appear intuitive, they can inadvertently promote a continuous-turn notion that conflicts with the robot’s step-by-step command syntax. The findings underscore the importance of explicit scaffolding in early computing education, suggesting that opportunities to test, refine, and compare different representational approaches can foster deeper insights into both spatial problem-solving and computational thinking.",

    "abstract": "Programming is taught globally in universities and in a large number of countries, also in schools, often associated with learning computational thinking. It is therefore natural that programming education research is the widest research area within Computing Education Research. Much of this research has taken place and published in conferences and journals associated with the ACM SIGCSE community. However, research related to teaching and learning programming is also published in numerous other venues, which are associated, for example, with the IEEE Computer or IEEE Education societies and other organizations within the fields of engineering education, science education and educational sciences. Previous general reviews in programming education research have largely focused on the introductory programming level. However, there is much work published addressing more advanced topical areas, too. In this paper, the goal is to look at the global situation covering programming education research at different levels. Based on the analysis of over 30,000 papers from the Scopus database addressing computing education and computing education research, we identified 9,865 papers focusing on programming education, published between 1967 and 2023. We describe this filtered dataset and report the results of topic modelling based on titles, abstracts and keywords in this dataset. We identified 27 topical areas, which form seven broader themes of research: CS1 &amp; CS2, computing in schools, advanced topics, pedagogy &amp; objectives, evaluation, digital and physical facilities, as well as investigation. We describe work in each of these areas, how research activity has developed in the areas over the decades, how the topics are related to each other, and how work in different areas is more likely to be published in specific conferences and journals/magazines in the field.",

    "abstract": "In one of the significant results from early computing education research, Pea identifies a computer-as-mind metaphor that novices use in ascribing mental properties of personhood to the computer, which causes students considerable conceptual confusion. In characterizing this as students’ superbug, Pea uses a mind-as-computer metaphor, the converse metaphor to the one that students use. In doing so, he makes visible a metaphor that has become one of the predominant metaphors of mind in mid- to late-20th century theorizing in psychology and the cognitive sciences. I take both of these metaphors (computer-as-mind and mind-as-computer) to be the superbug that plagues not only student attempts to program but also computing education more broadly. The purpose of this paper is to argue that these computer-mind metaphors are a steady undercurrent that runs from the cognitive sciences through computing education and the research on it, what is problematic about these metaphors, what causes this metaphorical affliction, why we might want to cure ourselves from it, and how we can do so. Key to this cure is to counter disembodied views of human reasoning and action, epitomized in first generation cognitive science, with embodied and enactive theoretical perspectives, epitomized in second generation cognitive science and in multimodal and embodied approaches to the social sciences.",

The framework is designed to enable researchers to analyse learners’ developing senses of programming concepts through an anti-ableist lens. It draws upon Vygotsky’s cultural-historical theory, contemporary research from the embodied cognition field and perspectives from critical theory. We illustrate the application of the framework using a study which investigated the developing senses of visually impaired learners working with a tangible programming language. Through the application of the framework to this study we demonstrate the integral role that tools, emotions and affect play in shaping learners’ senses of programming concepts. We finish by discussing potential wider applications of the framework which include researching the development of a sense of self as a programmer in under-represented groups and guiding the design of inclusive computing learning environments.",

Objective: Examine the effects of a wide variety of OST activities on students’ career interest in CS. Method: We carried out a retrospective cohort study, collecting data from a nationally representative sample of 6,044 U.S. first year university students. From 27 survey items about OST CS-related activities during high school, we first selected a list of top-ranking influential variables through machine learning. Then, a multinomial logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between these top-ranking variables and students’ career interests at the end of high school. Findings: The analysis showed that high school aged students’ participation in unstructured CS-related activities (e.g., talking about CS with family or friends); structured CS-related activities (e.g., CS-related summer camps or programs); along with the opportunities that students experienced during OST CS programs/activities (e.g., designing their own CS projects) boosted interest in a CS career vis-à-vis careers in other-STEM or non-STEM fields. It also showed that engaging in some activities (e.g., using social media) was associated with a decreased likelihood of intending a CS career, compared to a career in other-STEM or non-STEM fields. An interaction effect between having a prior career interest in CS and creating blogs/podcasts/video was also observed. Implications: First large-scale analysis of CS OST related activities on CS career interest.",

    "abstract": "Databases are a key topic in many technical university degrees. As databases have a strong practical nature, students are expected to solve many exercises before mastering the different aspects involved: querying and modifying the database, writing procedural code (functions and procedures), and defining triggers, among others. In this scenario it is very important to have a substantial number of exercises available but also a timely feedback to detect and fix mistakes. Therefore, automatic judges that execute students’ solutions and generate immediate feedback are valuable tools to include in the teaching practice. In this paper, we assess the real impact of using an online automatic judge for free practice in a database course over four academic years. For this purpose, we have contrasted the marks obtained in one academic year, without the automatic judge, against the 3 following years in which the automatic judge was used. The results show that final marks are statistically higher during the years when students make use of the automatic judge, thus showing an overall positive impact on database learning. Similarly, the results show that the more students use the automatic judge, the higher their final marks are. Besides these two insights, we have also studied if the impact of the automatic judge is the same in groups of high-profile students, concluding that this tool is less effective when improving learning in top-performing, highly self-motivated students in a database course.",

    "abstract": "Studies for more than two decades have uncovered a variety of difficulties and misconceptions that novice programmers have with object-oriented programming (OOP). Particularly challenging are the threshold concepts of program dynamics. Studies show that engaging learning approaches may be helpful. One such approach is that of capitalizing on errors, which has been successfully applied in mathematics and physics education. The learning-from-errors approach embedded in an OOP course may improve novices’ comprehension of OOP program dynamics notions and promote the embedment of such an approach in teaching. An instructional approach capitalizing on cognitive conflicts and conflict resolution was designed, applied, and evaluated. The approach involved declarative specifications of the fundamental, challenging notions of object creation and object access. The specifications embodied the mental models at which the instruction was aimed. Focused learning-from-errors activities based on minimalism principles were developed and applied. A comparative evaluation of an experimental group and a control group showed that the experimental-group students were more successful, particularly with the assimilation of the notions of object creation, object identifiers, static elements, and encapsulation. The learning-from-errors approach may be applied in additional domains, including other programming paradigms.",

Based on their occurrence, we performed a two-step cluster analysis with automatic cluster detection, identifying three participant groups based on their knowledge level: experts, intermediates, and beginners. Experts comprehended the most abstract concepts, such as the interaction between RAM and the processor and the existence of different types of memory. Intermediates understood some abstract concepts, while beginner participants lacked understanding of most abstract concepts and viewed the computer as a magical black box. Our research significantly expands the number of identified preconceptions about computer principles.

    "abstract": "Background : The embodied cognition perspective is a collection of theories that all explicate a fundamental relationship between the perceptions, actions, and movement of the body and how humans think and reason. The application of the embodied cognition perspective to instructional interventions—often referred to as embodied learning design—has the potential to aid computing education researchers and practitioners who want to meaningfully integrate more sensory and “hands on” activities in their instruction. Purpose : The objective of this paper is to describe a process for, and to model, how computing designers and instructors can interrogate the embodied affordances of pedagogical activities in computing. Analytic Approach : We describe 12 embodied affordances present across six pedagogical activities. Our goal is to model the analysis of pedagogical activities for their embodied affordances. For coherence, we selected six pedagogical activities related to arrays in Java. Implications : Embodied learning offers theoretical ideas and a process for interrogating the characteristics of visual and physical resources in computing education. As with any design process, iteration and assessment are necessary to ensure that an embodied learning intervention is effective, but previous research suggests that learning is increased when students’ perceptual and physical interactions align with learning goals.",

    "abstract": "Objectives There is currently no single accepted definition of computational thinking (CT) but abstraction, algorithmic thinking, problem solving and pattern recognition are often identified as four top skills with decomposition and spatial ability also being considered important. Physical activity has been linked to development of algorithmic thinking, visual processing and pattern recognition, while dance has been associated with ability in problem solving, visual-spatial manipulation, abstraction and pattern recognition. Dance notation has been linked to the development of skills in decomposition. This paper investigates whether taking part in structured dance activities affects performance on CT tests. Participants 50 participants (33 girls, 17 boys) aged between 6 and 9 were recruited from schools in Scotland and out-of-school groups in Germany. Study Methods The methods were influenced by Educational Design theory and adopted a mixed methods approach. It employed an explanatory sequential design with the aim of explaining quantitative results using qualitative methods and comprises three studies. Groups 1 and 2 used a pre-experimental design while Group 3 used a quasi-experimental non-equivalent group design, which arbitrarily split the group in an intervention group and a control group to establish whether there was an observable change in performance on CT tasks after taking part in structured Scottish Country Dance (SCD) activities. Participants undertook the BCTt test [72] as pre- and post-test; motivation was measured using versions of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) [44]. Direct observation and teacher interviews provided qualitative information and were used to explore the findings. The intervention consisted of workshops that mapped physical dance and transcription activities to cognitive attributes identified as important for CT. Findings A Related Samples Wilcoxon Signed Rank test found a significant difference between the median marks for pre-test ( M =18.70, SD =4.21) and post-test ( M =20.45, SD =3.137) (n=20, p=0.007) in Group 1. In Group 2, a Paired Samples T Test indicated that the post-test score ( M = 21.50, SD = 1.789) was significantly higher than the pre-test score ( M = 16.69, SD = 3.945), (t(15) = 5.189, p &lt;. 001). However, no differences were found between scores on the pre-test ( M = 20, SD = 2.00) and post-test ( M = 19.67, SD = 2.160), t(5) = 0.237, p =.822 in Group 3A or between the pre-test scores ( M = 13.75, SD = 5.898) and post-test ( M = 15.13, SD = 2.997), t(7) =. 903, p =. 397 in Group 3B. Participants in all studies were observed to engage well with the activities. Conclusions Participants in Groups 1 and 2, who were taught by experienced SCD teachers in a classroom situation and had some prior familiarity with the dance genre, showed a significant improvement in their scores. The addition of related coding activities appears to strengthen this effect. The absence of significant results in Group 3 allows for some hypotheses about which aspects of the dance workshops may be affecting CT.",

A pair of 4th grade elementary-aged children who participated in an after-school coding club over a four-week period. Participants had no prior experience with coding. Study Method . Using a multimodal lens to frame the study, data collection and analysis focused on three hours of video paired with the children’s coding documents in which we observed how the pair constructed meaning through both verbal and non-verbal (e.g., gestures, body movements) communication and interaction with the environment. Findings . The findings revealed unit thinking as a central concept in which the physical properties of objects in the environment were associated with units of movement. Units were then used to support the children’s thinking as they planned sequences of moves with greater accuracy. This transitioned from a bodily understanding of units in unplugged towards more abstract representations in plugged. Conclusions . Findings suggest that unit thinking may be an important but somewhat overlooked mathematical concept that children embody when using physical objects to complete coding activities. Additionally, the findings support a grounded perspective of cognition in which engaging the sensorimotor system during unplugged activities can play a role in completing tasks later in a plugged environment. Implications include encouraging teachers to introduce unit thinking to children during unplugged coding activities, particularly when sequencing and measurement are required.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: Interest plays a central role in learning by shaping what, how, when, where, and why learning occurs. In data science education, where complex concepts, lived experiences, and practical skills intersect, capturing and cultivating student interest can be especially generative. This work explores approaches for designing and evaluating interest-driven data science instructional materials. Methods: This paper presents a participatory design study that informs the development of a data science curriculum for high school students. To assess how well learner interests and values are reflected in the resulting curriculum, we used the Integrated Interest Development for Computing Education Framework [56], which provides a concrete operationalization of interest that captures its multifaceted nature. Findings: The paper demonstrates and discusses how participatory design can be used to identify students’ interests and how those interests can be used to inform the creation of an interest-driven curriculum. Further, it highlights how different types of participatory design activities yield insight into different facets of students’ interests and identities, which can then be used to design learning experiences. This work shows how the resulting PD reflects and harnesses the multifaceted nature of student interest and how it can be leveraged to design learning experiences that connect with learners’ lived digital experiences. Conclusions: Participatory design is an effective student-centered approach for tailoring computational learning experiences aligned to students’ voices, values, and interests. The use of various participatory design activities revealed different facets of students’ interests that informed the creation of an interest-driven curriculum that could not have been created without the input of the students themselves.",

    "abstract": "In academic courses, students frequently take advantage of someone else’s work to improve their own evaluations or grades. This unethical behavior seriously threatens the integrity of the academic system, and teachers invest substantial effort in preventing and recognizing plagiarism. When students take examinations requiring the production of computer programs, plagiarism detection can be semiautomated using analysis techniques such as JPlag and Moss. These techniques are useful but lose effectiveness when the text of the exam suggests some of the elements that should be structurally part of the solution. A loss of effectiveness is caused by the many common parts that are shared between programs due to the suggestions in the text of the exam rather than plagiarism. In this article, we present the AuDeNTES anti-plagiarism technique. AuDeNTES detects plagiarism via the code fragments that better represent the individual students’ contributions by filtering from students’ submissions the parts that might be common to many students due to the suggestions in the text of the exam. The filtered parts are identified by comparing students’ submissions against a reference solution, which is a solution of the exam developed by the teachers. Specifically, AuDeNTES first produces tokenized versions of both the reference solution and the programs that must be analyzed. Then, AuDeNTES removes from the tokenized programs the tokens that are included in the tokenized reference solution. Finally, AuDeNTES computes the similarity among the filtered tokenized programs and produces a ranked list of program pairs suspected of plagiarism. An empirical comparison against multiple state-of-the-art plagiarism detection techniques using several sets of real students’ programs collected in early programming courses demonstrated that AuDeNTES identifies more plagiarism cases than the other techniques at the cost of a small additional inspection effort.",

    "abstract": "Learning to program requires perseverance, practice, and the mindset that programming skills are improved through these activities (i.e., that everyone has the potential to become good at programming). In contrast to an entity mindset, individuals with an incremental mindset believe that ability is malleable and can be improved with effort. Prior research shows that an incremental mindset can be promoted through interventions and that, as a result, individuals report increased belief in the value of effort. Although this is encouraging, the majority of research targets a general mindset, and so little work exists exploring the effect of this construct in the programming domain. The present study ( N = 47) used a programming activity to test the effect of an incremental mindset intervention on participants’ beliefs, effort, programming behaviors, and performance in an experimental study. The intervention was successful. Compared to the control group, the experimental group shifted significantly more toward an incremental mindset, which resulted in beneficial behaviors related to effort, namely higher time on task and more program creation and modification actions. These positive behaviors, however, did not translate to improvements in programming performance. We speculate the reason for this latter finding may be related to the need for additional domain-based support.",

    "abstract": "The subgoal learning framework has improved performance for novice programmers in higher education, but it has only started to be applied and studied in K-12 (primary/secondary). Programming education in K-12 is growing, and many international initiatives are attempting to increase participation, including curricular initiatives like Computer Science Principles and non-profit organizations like Code.org. Given that subgoal learning is designed to help students with no prior knowledge, we designed and implemented subgoals in the introduction to programming unit in Code.org's Computer Science Principles course. The redesigned unit includes subgoal-oriented instruction and subgoal-themed pre-written comments that students could add to their programming activities. To evaluate efficacy, we compared behaviors and performance of students who received the redesigned subgoal unit to those receiving the original unit. We found that students who learned with subgoals performed better on problem-solving questions but not knowledge-based questions and wrote more in open-ended response questions, including a practice Performance Task for the AP exam. Moreover, at least one-third of subgoal students continued to use the subgoal comments after the subgoal-oriented instruction had been faded, suggesting that they found them useful. Survey data from the teachers suggested that students who struggled with the concepts found the subgoals most useful. Implications for future designs are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale disparities in computing exist for many youth of color. Learning in informal settings can increase the participation of youth in computing; however, computing education programs have typically been developed by adults for youth. We argue computing education can contribute toward decolonization by directly involving youth from nondominant communities as design partners. When we directly involve youth voices, we can move away from focusing solely on the structural barriers faced by youth of color toward an assets-based approach. We examine a 10-week case study within KidsTeam Libraries, an intergenerational digital design program where local youth conceptualize what digital learning could look like in libraries. Our qualitative dataset includes over 15 hours of video recordings from participatory design sessions, six interviews with participants, 10 researcher jottings, and a corpus of 25 researcher memos written by researchers, librarians, and teens. Throughout our investigation, our knowledge claims are co-constructed with the two teenagers who led the design and implementation of a three-dimensional printing curriculum in their local library with 10 children. Our findings emphasize (1) the ways in which the involvement of teen leaders can foster and sustain community-level relationships for computing education; (2) how we noticed, enforced, and disrupted power within our computing education program; and (3) the systemic challenges we confronted in our process toward disrupting computing education. We provide empirical evidence of teen-led participatory design approaches for computing education in their community through detailed vignettes from sessions and through quotes from key participants. We contribute to the computing education community a novel approach in which youth are positioned as design partners for reimagining a computing education experience in libraries that centers and serves community members.",

    "abstract": "Context. With the introduction of Computer Science (CS) into curricula worldwide, teachers’ adoption of CS pedagogical content is essential to ensure the long-term success of reform initiatives. Continuing Professional Development (CPD) programs play a key role in this process. Unfortunately, adoption is seldom evaluated in CS-CPDs or CPDs in general. The result is a dearth of studies (i) modelling teachers’ adoption of CS pedagogical content or (ii) investigating factors influencing the uptake of this new discipline. Both aspects are crucial to design and characterize successful CPD programs. Objectives . We thus propose the Teachers’ Adoption of CS (TACS) model to investigate factors influencing the adoption of CS pedagogical content by teachers who are following a mandatory CS-CPD program. More specifically, the model proposes that contextual factors (e.g., age, gender, and general teaching experience), prior factors (e.g., experience, and CS perception), and acceptance factors (e.g., interest, and self-efficacy) may impact teachers’ adoption of CS pedagogical content. Methods. The study included 180 grades 5 and 6 teachers (students aged 9–11) that were following a mandatory CS-CPD program. The CS-CPD program involved participation in three-day-long sessions distributed over the 2019–2020 academic year. In between sessions, with the support of instructional coaches in the schools, teachers were encouraged, but not required, to adopt the CS pedagogical content. Therefore, during the CPD, and employing surveys based on the TACS model, we evaluated teachers’ adoption of the proposed content and investigated how the different factors influenced it. Results. At the PD-level, the results indicate that self-efficacy and interest queried during the CS-CPD are indicative of CS pedagogical content adoption. To shed more light on the relationship between these metrics, a more in-depth analysis was conducted with n = 92 teachers whose responses could be matched between sessions. While interest relates to how teachers adopt CS pedagogical content overall, both interest and self-efficacy are necessary to ensure the likelihood of a specific activity being adopted. Finally, individual teacher characteristics appear to impact adoption, with teachers with low experience with Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) requiring onboarding, while middle-aged teachers require convincing to adopt CS pedagogical content. Conclusion. Three takeaways emerge from the study. First, the analyses confirm the foundation of the TACS model. Second, the findings establish the key role that interest plays in said model. Finally, the results support the relationship between the contextual, prior and acceptance factors on the adoption of primary school CS pedagogical content.",

    "abstract": "Project managers tend to confront multiple challenges in Global Software Development (GSD), including misunderstandings about the project requirements, complex estimations of costs, risks, and efforts, along with increases in task allocation and a lack of coordination. “Soft skills” play a fundamental role in solving these challenges, as they are the human or social abilities that facilitate the resolution of conflicts and involve dealing with people and managing projects in their most social and creative dimension. However, developing the soft skills that allow project managers to lead in an effective manner is not an easy task, especially in global or distributed environments, where coordination and control problems are commonplace. One suitable mechanism with which to develop these soft skills is that of serious games, which focus on learning by doing and allow users to simulate real scenarios. The authors of this article are aware of the usefulness of this type of teaching method and have, therefore, developed the serious game described herein. This serious game is denominated as Global Manager and is focused on helping both students and novice project managers to become aware of the factors that may affect GSD projects. Global Manager was evaluated by means of a quasi-experiment based on a pretest-posttest design, which was used to assess whether the game can increase the players’ awareness and knowledge of the factors that a project manager should consider in GSD projects. The results obtained after evaluating the game were quite satisfactory, as the game taught the players to differentiate between global and distributed software projects and to experience situations that may and do occur in these settings. Furthermore, Global Manager helped improve players' perceptions of the importance of different influencing factors in GSD.",

    "abstract": "Background and Context. Students’ programming projects are often assessed on the basis of their tests as well as their implementations, most commonly using test adequacy criteria like branch coverage, or, in some cases, mutation analysis. As a result, students are implicitly encouraged to use these tools during their development process (i.e., so they have awareness of the strength of their own test suites). Objectives. Little is known about how students choose test cases for their software while being guided by these feedback mechanisms. We aim to explore the interaction between students and commonly used testing feedback mechanisms (in this case, branch coverage and mutation-based feedback). Method. We use grounded theory to explore this interaction. We conducted 12 think-aloud interviews with students as they were asked to complete a series of software testing tasks, each of which involved a different feedback mechanism. Interviews were recorded and transcripts were analyzed, and we present the overarching themes that emerged from our analysis. Findings. Our findings are organized into a process model describing how students completed software testing tasks while being guided by a test adequacy criterion. Program comprehension strategies were commonly employed to reason about feedback and devise test cases. Mutation-based feedback tended to be cognitively overwhelming for students, and they resorted to weaker heuristics in order to address this feedback. Implications. In the presence of testing feedback, students did not appear to consider problem coverage as a testing goal so much as program coverage . While test adequacy criteria can be useful for assessment of software tests, we must consider whether they represent good goals for testing, and if our current methods of practice and assessment are encouraging poor testing habits.",

    "abstract": "Although there is a great demand for graduates in computing fields, companies frequently struggle to find enough workers. They may also grapple with obtaining racial, ethnic, and gender diversity in representation. It has been suggested that the hiring process further contributes to these inequities. This study examined undergraduate computing students’ experiences with technical interviews and their pathways to job attainment, focusing on men and women who identify as Black or African American, Hispanic or Latinx, Asian, and mixed-race. We applied the community cultural wealth framework and employed the methodology of phenomenography to investigate the different assets that students leveraged to succeed in obtaining a position. Our investigation centered around the conceptions of sixteen computing students, all of whom completed at least one technical interview and received at least one job offer. We conducted semi-structured interviews to explore their interpretations of the hiring process, the resources they utilized, and their perceptions of inclusivity in the field. The findings illustrated that students’ support mechanisms included the following categories of description: intrinsic characteristics, capitalizing on experience, community, preparation, and organizational. They relied heavily on distinct forms of capital, particularly social and navigational, to attain a job in computing. Peers and clubs or groups were essential for students to learn about what to expect during the hiring process, to help them prepare, and to make connections with employers. They also helped the students cope with the discrimination they faced throughout their professional trajectories. By investigating the various experiences students have, we contribute to the understanding of how hiring practices may be viewed as well as possible ways to provide support. While students must study for technical interviews and refine their skills and pertinacity in the face of obstacles, industry and academia should consider their role in hiring and its impact. Transparency in what to expect and enhanced preparation opportunities could serve to make the process more equitable for all job candidates.",

The goals of the research presented here were to determine: how the mental models of programmers change and develop as they learn parallel programming, the quality of their mental models after learning parallel programming, and what type of information is part of their mental models when examining code for the presence of data races. Participants were experienced C programmers and included both university students and professionals. The mental models of participants were analyzed by having them perform a code tracing task where they externalized their mental models by drawing diagrams while tracing the execution of parallel code. We also analyzed their mental models by having participants determine the presence of data races in parallel code and then answer multiple choice and open-ended questions related to the code. The results presented in this paper indicate that programmers’ mental models progress from a weaker execution model and a stronger situation model before learning parallel programming, to a stronger execution model and a weaker situation model after learning parallel programming. The thematic analysis of the open-ended responses that indicate what components of code programmers used to determine whether or not a data race was present provides insight into the topics that should be emphasized when teaching parallel programming.",

However teaching code style is complicated by the existence of many style guides and standards that contain inconsistent, low-level advice. The objective of the study is to support educators in helping students understand the nature of these inconsistencies by highlighting the rationale behind rules and their contextual nature. Participants Seventy members of local and national computing science education (CSE) groups contributed in the exploratory phase. Fifty-two members of the ACM SIGCSE members mailing list and the Australasian Chapter contributed in the evaluation and refinement phases. These mailing lists represent a large, global population of CSE educators. Study Methods We created, evaluated and refined an abstract code style model ( CSM ) comprising a Definition and eight Principles for code style. For CSM creation, we took an exploratory approach based on an examination of the existing literature on code quality and style. To evaluate the level of community endorsement for the model, we analysed quantitative and qualitative data from an international survey questionnaire. We refined the CSM based on an analysis of the qualitative survey data. Findings Analysis of the data from the survey indicated a strong level of support for the CSM . Quantitative data revealed a general agreement with the Principles , with responses for five Principles achieving a minimum of 84 percent agreement and all Principles achieving a minimum of 66 percent agreement. Qualitative data contained very few comments that voiced dissatisfaction with a basic aspect of the model. We found that barriers to developing a community-wide CSM were the strongly-held beliefs about style held by some and the abstract nature of the CSM . Conclusions The creation of an abstract set of Principles for code style is generally perceived by the community to be worthwhile and important and our approach has high levels of endorsement. A validated version of the CSM has been created.",

    "abstract": "While there have been many calls for teaching ethics and responsible computing, it is unclear how responsible computing instruction and technical learning interact. Some instructors even hesitate to include ethics in their courses, fearing it might distract students from learning technical computing content. An approach called micro-insertion offers a path to teaching responsible computing while teaching technical content. Micro-insertion situates technical problems in real-world contexts, with frequent, minimally-invasive discussions of potential harms of a computing professional’s technical choices. We conducted a between-subjects laboratory study where 82 post-secondary student participants were randomly assigned to one of two instructional conditions to learn a computing topic. The technical-only condition received traditional instruction, while the micro-insertion condition learned the same technical material contextualized within a real-world scenario with potential broader ethical or social impacts. Our study design included a pre-test, instruction intervention, immediate post-test, and a two-week delayed post-test. Each test included both technical and contextualized questions, and the instructional time was the same across both conditions. The study revealed no statistically significant differences in learning outcomes between the two conditions. Participants in both conditions improved in solving problems presented both abstractly and contextualized with a real-world narrative. Thus, we did not find evidence that our responsible computing intervention distracted participants from learning the technical topics. Further, participants in the technical-only condition could correctly respond to contextualized questions, suggesting that students might be able to engage with responsible computing micro-insertions without targeted instruction. To more deeply understand students’ reasoning, we conducted follow-up interviews with 13 of the participants. The interviews revealed that participants in both conditions perceived to have learned about responsible computing from the study. However, the depth and quality of participants’ engagement with real-world issues varied significantly, with many only superficially addressing the context and many relying on their own personal experiences as their source of knowledge. We, therefore, encourage future studies to investigate other approaches to responsible computing education to determine which approach results in more meaningful consideration of social and ethical issues and whether that detracts from or supports technical learning.",

    "abstract": "Explain-in-Plain-English (EiPE) questions are used by some researchers and educators to assess code reading skills. EiPE questions require students to briefly explain (in plain English) the purpose of a given piece of code, without restating what the code does line-by-line. The premise is that novices who can explain the purpose of a piece of code have higher code-reading skills than those who can trace the code but cannot see its high-level purpose. However, using natural language in EiPE questions poses challenges. Students (especially those whose first language is not English) may struggle to convey their understanding of the code unambiguously. Also, grading responses written in natural language is time-consuming, requires the design of a rubric, and is difficult to automate. We propose a new code reading question type that addresses these issues with EiPE questions. Given a piece of code involving repetition (in the form of iteration or recursion), the student is asked to provide the output for a set of inputs, where the output for some of these inputs cannot be determined using code tracing alone and requires higher-level code comprehension. In empirical evaluations, using CS1 exams, think-aloud interviews with students, and interviews with instructors, we found that assessments of code reading skills using the new question type are highly consistent with the assessments using EiPE questions, yet are more reliable. These results put forward the proposed question type as another way to assess high-level code-reading skills without the issues associated with expressing in natural language or grading responses expressed in natural language.",

    "abstract": "Although ample research has focused on computing skill development over a single course or specific programming language, relatively little attention is paid to how computing skills evolve across a program. Our work aims to understand how specific skills develop throughout a progression of CS courses. We use qualitative content analysis to catalog common errors in assignment submissions from four computing courses forming a prerequisite chain: CS1, CS2, Systems Programming (SP), and Operating Systems (OS). We focus on three fine-grained skills encountered in some form in all four courses: (S1) opening and reading data from a file, (S2) storing or organizing data in data structures, and (S3) using the data to implement a solution for a well-defined task. We study how the commonly observed errors or issues evolve across the prerequisite chain, thus analyzing how these skills develop. We notice successful development in most skills, evidenced by a reduction of common errors over the course progression. However, we also notice variability in skill development corresponding to the expected challenges, in working with new techniques (OOP), new languages (C), or concepts (binary files). We also observe an overall lower prevalence of common errors in CS1 and CS2 among students who progress to SP and OS in close succession. We believe that analyzing the evolution of common errors across course progressions would enable educators to gain insight into skills development and if certain outcomes are met more seamlessly than others.",

    "abstract": "Objectives . This study addresses the challenges faced by students repeating an introductory programming course (CS1) at an online university, where dropout and failure rates remain high. While programming education has been widely studied, targeted interventions for repeating students remain scarce. Our research aims to analyze the experiences of these students and develop a tailored intervention to improve support mechanisms. Participants. The study focuses on students retaking CS1, which were categorized into two groups: those who previously attempted but failed the course, and those who dropped out early with almost no follow-up of the course. Method. An observational approach was used to analyze students’ performance, behavior, and perceptions, combining data from institutional databases and questionnaires. Based on these insights, an intervention was designed, incorporating individualized feedback, structured engagement activities, and encouragement for students to reflect on their past experiences in order to foster a more supportive learning environment. Findings. Initial results indicate that the intervention increased student engagement, particularly in the early weeks of the semester. However, some students continued to struggle with course content, suggesting the need for additional instructional support. While the intervention was effective in fostering engagement, its impact on overall success rates was limited, highlighting the necessity of more personalized approaches. Conclusions. The study provides valuable insights for educators seeking to improve support for repeating students in programming courses. Key lessons include the importance of proactive engagement, tailored feedback, and structured interventions. Future research should focus on developing personalized interventions, validating a tailored questionnaire for deeper insights, and exploring adaptive learning technologies and longitudinal studies to enhance academic outcomes while reducing instructor workload.",

    "abstract": "Regular expressions (REs) are often taught to undergraduate computer science majors in the Formal Languages and Automata (FLA) course; they are widely used to implement different software functionalities such as search mechanisms and data validation in diverse fields. Despite their importance, the difficulty of REs has been asserted many times in the literature. Due to their abstract and theoretical nature, students sometimes find REs boring and hard to learn. In addition, a review of existing tools that assist students when learning REs shows that the feedback provided is limited. Therefore, this research set out to automatically generate feedback that contains the type and location of the error and hints on how to fix the error for students learning REs. Principles from compiler construction and the theory of computation were used to develop algorithms for error detection. The algorithms detected the presence, type and location of errors in students’ RE solutions. The error details identified by the algorithms were then formatted as feedback usable to students. The performance of the algorithms was evaluated using a test dataset consisting of 249 incorrect REs and the accuracy of predicting the error positions in the incorrect REs was 82%. In comparison with other tools that generate feedback for students learning REs, the generated feedback in this research is more robust because it contains a summary of the type of error present and the location of the errors in both the incorrectly represented strings (counterexamples) and REs. The developed prototype can be enhanced into a full-fledged academic tool to support teachers and students learning REs in live classrooms, be it a physical or virtual class.",

    "abstract": "Background: In agile software engineering team projects, effective collaboration and communication between members are essential for promoting agility and lean software development. Agile methodologies, which emphasize iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability, are well-suited to dynamic educational environments. However, agile teams in educational contexts often face non-technical challenges known as ”social debts” that can impede productivity and limit agility. These challenges, including miscommunication, cultural barriers, and team conflicts, are particularly significant in team-based learning setups where diverse teams must work together under tight deadlines. Objectives: This research aims to identify the root causes of ”community smells” that can lead to social debts within agile teaming environments and to introduce the concept of the ”Agile Social Software Engineer” role. Specifically, we define the ”Agile Social Guardian” remit as one of the main responsibilities of this role, dedicated to managing and mitigating social debts within educational and professional agile environments. The broader goal is to customize welfare services for large and compulsory courses to improve the student experience and enhance learning effectiveness. Study Methods: We present empirical evidence on the positive impact of the Agile Social Guardian, based on a comprehensive study involving 88 agile teams and over 700 team members, as part of an extensive investigation within an educational context. Our research methodology encompasses two key phases: empirical evaluation and practical implementation of the proposed Agile Social Guardian approach within educational setup. Findings: The study introduces a novel approach to improving team collaboration and project performance in agile education, filling a gap in the existing research and offering recommendations that extend beyond classroom and training setups. We propose a taxonomy of common causes that could lead to community smells within agile teams, which may result in social debts. Furthermore, we identify the key characteristics of the Agile Social Guardian role, which are critical in both educational and professional agile environments, and provide implementation guidelines and best practices. Conclusions: This work demonstrates the significant benefits of addressing human-centric challenges, including social debts, in credit-bearing agile training. It also underscores the need for customized welfare support in educational setups, especially for large and diverse classrooms. Our findings suggest that the Agile Social Guardian has the potential to enhance both student learning experiences and team productivity in various agile contexts. Furthermore, this framework can be adapted to other team-based learning environments, offering a path toward more effective and inclusive educational practices.",

    "abstract": "Higher education institutions are under pressure to educate employable computing graduates who can meet society’s needs. Education, as a process of becoming, shapes students’ identities, and identity is an important topic to study because it influences students’ motivation, retention, and satisfaction. Identity serves as the link connecting an individual student with the social world around them. In the context of computing, this social world includes communities, practices, and values embedded in the computing discipline, as well as institutions that affect the identity development process. This article presents the envisioned identity of computing students as portrayed by Norwegian educational institutions. Through critical document analysis, 29 documents were examined to determine which attributes are portrayed as desirable for computing graduates. The analysis shows that the envisioned computing graduates are portrayed as industry-relevant and employable, continuously competent, socially responsible, and diverse. This study contributes to the literature with a cross-level analysis and a discussion of the phenomenon of envisioned computing identity.",

    "abstract": "Computational thinking (CT) is a critical set of 21st century skills that young learners must develop to be successful in contemporary work and life. As more K-12 schools begin to integrate CT into the curriculum, elementary preservice teachers (EPSTs) must be prepared to teach CT to their future students. Therefore, elementary teacher preparation programs should explore ways to incorporate CT into their coursework, ensuring that EPSTs graduate with the necessary knowledge and skills to teach CT. This study investigates the impacts of a three-week CT module implemented in a technology integration course in an elementary teacher preparation program on EPSTs’ CT value beliefs, self-efficacy, and teaching efficacy. The purpose of the module was to introduce EPSTs to basic concepts and big ideas in CT, support their application of CT in block-based coding environments, and promote connection building between CT and authentic real-world scenarios that balance different types of CT activities. Guided by the Interconnected Model of Professional Growth (IMPG), this study examined EPSTs’ learning as a dynamic process of change across the personal and external domains. The module was located in the external domain as a stimulus for learning, while the Teacher Beliefs about Coding and Computational Thinking (TBaCCT) instrument was used to assess changes in value beliefs, self-efficacy, and teaching efficacy within the personal domain. A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was used to analyze pre- and post-surveys administered to 50 EPSTs and semi-structured interviews with four of the EPSTs. The results showed that the beliefs of the CT value of EPSTs evolved and their self-efficacy and teaching efficacy of CT significantly improved after participating in the module, suggesting that the interaction between external learning experiences and internal belief systems - facilitated by reflection and action - contributed to early professional growth. Notably, EPSTs also developed a more accurate understanding of CT, recognized the benefits of both plugged and unplugged CT activities, and expressed a desire for continued CT learning and professional development. Although EPSTs expressed concerns with the scarcity of physical computing toys in schools, they demonstrated a commitment to incorporating CT activities into their teaching and exploring alternative funding avenues to acquire such resources. Practical implications include potential approaches for elementary teacher preparation programs to embed CT into existing curricula.",

    "abstract": "Context : Introductory programming courses often face high dropout and failure rates, a challenge widely addressed in computing education research. Collaborative methods, such as group work and pair programming, have been proposed as potential solutions, as they are believed to enhance students’ study motivation. Objective : This article provides a comprehensive overview of current research on the use of collaborative methods in introductory programming courses and their influence on students’ study motivation. The focus lies at the intersection of collaborative learning approaches and study motivation. In addition, the article identifies gaps in the existing literature, highlighting areas in need of further investigation. Method : This study combines a systematic mapping study with a systematic literature review. A search for relevant articles was conducted across eight digital libraries in October 2020 using search strings that incorporated the concepts of CS1, collaborative methods, and motivation. Of the 991 initially retrieved articles, 86 were selected for in-depth analysis. Extracted data included publication details, research type, collaborative methods used, supporting tools/environments, the role of motivation, theoretical frameworks, motivational scales, reflections on collaborative methods, and aspects of collaborative methods that influenced motivation. Results : The findings reveal several noteworthy trends. First, 84% of the studies did not reference a theoretical framework for motivation, and 83% did not use established tools to measure it. Reflections on collaborative methods were predominantly positive (81%), while only 6% expressed negative views. Increased motivation was the most frequently reported benefit of collaborative learning approaches in our corpus, in which each paper had to at least include the term motivation . Among the aspects of the collaborative setting reported to influence motivation, competition, collaboration, use of technology, and project work were mentioned in multiple studies. Conclusions : These results highlight the need for further research in several key areas. First, greater attention is required regarding the definition and measurement of motivation in this context, as indicated by the lack of theoretical frameworks and established measurement tools in most articles. Additionally, there is a need to develop a standardized taxonomy and clearer definitions for collaborative methods to facilitate more precise discussions and comparisons across studies. While the positive reflections on collaborative methods are encouraging, the limited number of negative reflections suggests a lack of attention to potential drawbacks or limitations. Finally, a research gap exists in understanding which specific aspects of the collaborative setting most significantly affect students’ study motivation, underscoring the importance of continued exploration in this domain.",

Many accreditation and industry bodies explicitly require or recommend them. Over the past two decades, capstone courses specifically focused on game development have become increasingly popular. Game development offers students the opportunity to express themselves creatively and learn to work with people from a variety of disciplines such as programming, design, music, and art. In this paper we present the results of 10 years of iteration on a game development capstone course. This course is structured as a year-long collaboration between software engineering and game design students, but maintains separation between the disciplines in terms of supervision and assessment. Based on our experiments and observations, we provide recommendations for teaching practices, team structure, project timeline, and assessment. In these, we focus on emulating and incorporating industry practices, maximising opportunities for formative feedback, and maintaining authentic individual assessment. We have found that our most recent implementation has resulted in improved student satisfaction and learning outcomes compared to previous iterations.",

    "abstract": "Background. Automated assessments, often implemented as test-based autograders, are widely used in the form of hidden oracles, providing automated formative feedback to students on their code solutions. While autograders provide some educational benefits—particularly around efficient scaling of grading—they have been shown to encourage adverse student behaviors that hinder learning. For example, students try to debug their solutions into existence through trial-and-error debugging in pursuit of maximum points, without the valuable, careful introspection on their work. Objectives. This study investigates how a grade scale affects students’ software development behaviors in response to automated feedback. In contrast to an autograder with an oracle suite of test cases, industrial developers do not have access to an oracle test suite that can tell them what cases their code handles or mishandles. Developers must instead rely on careful reasoning to co-evolve their test code with their product code to produce and maintain high quality software. We hypothesize that alternative grading can be an effective tool to influence students to practice more reflection during development while maintaining the infrastructural and pedagogical benefits of automated assessments. Methods. We deployed a coarse-grained, alternative grading approach—bucket grading—which assessed solutions to be in one of only four bucket grades, representing a high-level assessment of the student’s project quality, to a third-year post-secondary, project-based software engineering class with 300+ students. This study uses a mixed qualitative and quantitative methodology to compare a previous offering of the course that used a traditional, points-based grading scheme against the bucket grading offering. Findings. We find that coarse-grained formative feedback via bucket grading improves student-autograder interaction: students wrote stronger, more focused test suites because they reflected more deeply before making changes. Students were appreciative of bucket grading since it provided them leniency in their grade and greater clarity on the overall quality of their solutions. Ultimately, we will continue to use this approach going forward since incorporating bucket grading meaningfully improved both the staff and student autograder experiences.",

    "abstract": "Context: Software testing is a critical aspect of the software development lifecycle, yet it remains underrepresented in academic curricula. Despite advances in pedagogical practices and increased attention from the academic community, challenges persist in effectively teaching software testing. Understanding these challenges from the teachers’ perspective is crucial to aligning education with industry needs. Objective: To analyze the characteristics, practices, tools, and challenges of software testing courses in higher education, from the perspective of educators, and to assess the integration of recent pedagogical approaches in software testing education. Method: A structured survey consisting of 52 questions was distributed to 143 software testing educators across Western European universities, resulting in 49 valid responses. The survey explored topics taught, course organization, teaching practices, tools and materials used, gamification approaches, and teacher satisfaction. Results: The survey revealed significant variability in course content, structure, and teaching methods. Most dedicated software testing courses are offered at the master’s level and are elective, whereas testing is introduced earlier in less specialized (NST) courses. There is low adoption of formal guidelines (e.g., ACM, SWEBOK), limited integration of non-functional testing types, and a high diversity in textbooks and tools used. While modern practices like Test-Driven Development and automated assessment are increasingly adopted, gamification and active learning approaches remain underutilized. Teachers expressed a need for improved and more consistent teaching materials. Conclusion: The study highlights a mismatch between academic practices and industry expectations in software testing education. Greater integration of standardized curricula, broader adoption of modern teaching tools, and increased support for teachers through high-quality, adaptable teaching materials are needed to enhance the effectiveness of software testing education.",

Participants included post-secondary computer science student mentors and secondary student mentees from computer science classes at two different secondary schools. Study Method . This research employed a qualitative case study approach. Data were collected through two focus group interviews with nine post-secondary computer science mentors and four focus group interviews with 15 secondary student mentees. The analysis involved open coding followed by thematic analysis. Findings . Using Self-Determination Theory as a framework, the findings revealed how mentors and the mentorship program supported mentees in mastering robotics concepts and skills, building rapport with mentors and peers, and experiencing autonomy and choice in their projects. Challenges stemming from cultural differences between mentors and mentees led to reciprocal learning, with mentors enhancing their cultural awareness. Conclusions . This study offers a holistic understanding of mentoring in K-12 classrooms by evaluating both mentors’ and mentees’ experiences alongside program-specific features. As mentoring programs are often situated in post-secondary education or informal learning environments, this research highlights how computer science mentoring can be effectively adapted to K-12 classrooms, addressing these settings’ unique opportunities and challenges.

Peer review is one method to allow students to experience authentic uses of the concepts in an activity that is not itself programming.

We are exploring the peer review process, the effects of the type of review on the reviewers , and the results this has on the students’ learning. To study these ideas, we used peer review activities in CS2 classes at two universities over the course of a semester. Using three groups (one reviewing their peers, one reviewing the instructor, and one completing small design or coding assignments), we measured the students’ conceptual understanding throughout the semester with concept maps and the reviews they completed. We found that reviewing helped students learn Decomposition, especially those reviewing the instructor's programs, but we did not find that it improved the students’ level of thinking. Overall, reviews (peer or otherwise) are beneficial for teaching Decomposition to CS2 students and can be used as an alternative method for teaching other object-oriented programming concepts.",

As it is an advanced programming skill, the best way to learn it is through targeted practice exercises. But the best practice problems are time consuming to manually grade by an instructor. As a consequence, students historically have completed only a small number of recursion programming exercises as part of their coursework. We present a new way for teaching such programming skills. Students view examples and visualizations, then practice a wide variety of automatically assessed, small-scale programming exercises that address the sub-skills required to learn recursion. The basic recursion tutorial (RecurTutor) teaches material typically encountered in CS2 courses. Students who used RecurTutor had significantly better grades on recursion exam questions than did students who used typical instruction. Students who experienced RecurTutor spent significantly more time on solving recursive programming exercises than students who experienced typical instruction, and came out with a significantly higher confidence level.",

    "abstract": "Low performance of nontechnical engineering students in programming courses is a problem that remains unsolved. Over the years, many authors have tried to identify the multiple causes for that failure, but there is unanimity on the fact that motivation is a key factor for the acquisition of knowledge by students. To better understand motivation, a new evaluation strategy has been adopted in a second programming course of a nontechnical degree, consisting of 91 students. The goals of the study were to identify if those students felt more motivated to answer multiple-choice questions in comparison to development questions, and what type of question better allows for testing student knowledge acquisition. Possibilities around the motivational qualities of multiple-choice questions in programming courses will be discussed in light of the results. In conclusion, it seems clear that student performance varies according to the type of question. Our study points out that multiple-choice questions can be seen as a motivational factor for engineering students and it might also be a good way to test acquired programming concepts. Therefore, this type of question could be further explored in the evaluation points.",

    "abstract": "If we are to attract more women and minorities to computing we must engage students at an early age. As part of its mission to increase participation of women and underrepresented minorities in computing, the Increasing Student Participation in Research Development Program (INSPIRED) conducts computing academies for high school students. The academies are designed to increase students’ knowledge of and interest in computing and to encourage females and minorities to participate in computing. INSPIRED academies differ from others in several ways. They are relatively easy to organize and require relatively few resources; they focus on computing concepts and object-oriented programming; they expose students to successful female and minority computer scientists; and they actively engage university students from underrepresented groups to organize, coordinate, teach, and help assess the academies. This not only provides role models for the high school students but also helps engage the university students and promote their professional development. Our assessment results show that high school student participants have gained significant knowledge and interest in computing through participation in the academies. This article describes the organization, coordination, content, and assessment of the academies, along with suggestions for those who would like to design academies like these. It also discusses how to prepare university students for their roles in the academies and how their participation has helped in their professional development. It includes pointers to sites from which the instructional and assessment materials can be downloaded for those who wish to replicate or adapt these materials.",

For example, multicore programming and parallel systems are highly desired courses in the computer science major. However, the high cost of HPC equipment and maintenance makes it hard to be adapted into a conventional computer science curriculum. Specifically, teaching-oriented institutions cannot afford an HPC system due to the high cost, lack of experience, and smaller research infrastructure. The main objective of this article is to present an affordable and easy-to-use high-performance cluster system for teaching-oriented computer science curriculums. In order to address this, we have designed and implemented an affordable high-performance cluster system based on the PlayStation 3 (PS3). For the performance evaluation of the PS3 cluster, we conducted a benchmarking test, that is, matrix multiplication, with different numbers of synergistic processing elements (SPEs) and nodes. As a result, it was concluded that the PS3Cluster provides enough computing power as an HPC for computer science courses, while the total cost is less than 10% of an existing cluster system on the market that has similar performance. In addition, the implemented PS3Cluster system has been used for computer science courses, such as Parallel and Distributed Databases and Parallel Programming.",

    "abstract": "There continues to be an increase in enrollments in various computing programs at academic institutions due to many job opportunities available in the information, communication, and technology sectors. This enrollment surge has presented several challenges in many Computer Science (CS), Information Technology (IT), and Software Engineering (SE) programs at universities and colleges. One such challenge is that many instructors in CS/IT/SE programs continue to use learning approaches that are not learner centered and therefore are not adequately preparing students to be proficient in the ever-changing computing industry. To mitigate this challenge, instructors need to use evidence-based pedagogical approaches, e.g., active learning, to improve student learning and engagement in the classroom and equip students with the skills necessary to be lifelong learners. This article presents an approach that combines learning and engagement strategies (LESs) in learning environments using different teaching modalities to improve student learning and engagement. We describe how LESs are integrated into face-to-face (F2F) and online class activities. The LESs currently used are collaborative learning , gamification , problem-based learning , and social interaction . We describe an approach used to quantify each LES used during class activities based on a set of characteristics for LESs and the traditional lecture-style pedagogical approaches. To demonstrate the impact of using LESs in F2F class activities, we report on a study conducted over seven semesters in a software testing class at a large urban minority serving institution. The study uses a posttest-only study design, the scores of two midterm exams, and approximate class times dedicated to each LES and traditional lecture style to quantify their usage in a face-to-face software testing class. The study results showed that increasing the time dedicated to collaborative learning, gamification, and social interaction and decreasing the traditional lecture-style approach resulted in a statistically significant improvement in student learning, as reflected in the exam scores.",

This article briefly reviews the principles of cooperative learning, and describes how these principles were incorporated into a comprehensive set of cooperative learning activities for a CS1 course. In each activity, specific roles are assigned to group members in order to highlight important concepts and to enhance the overall functioning of the group. The group processing is followed by a whole-class debriefing led by the instructor, which works in tandem with the group activity to help students improve their understanding of the material. The effectiveness of these cooperative learning activities was assessed in a series of educational research studies which spanned three academic years and included two different instructors. The results of these studies show statistically significant benefits from the cooperative learning approach, both overall and for a broad range of subgroups of students. The article concludes with suggestions for faculty members who may want to use these cooperative learning activities in the classroom, or to develop their own activities along similar lines.",

    "abstract": "This article presents the use of a model-centric approach to facilitate software development projects conforming to the three-tier architecture in undergraduate software engineering courses. Many instructors intend that such projects create software applications for use by real-world customers. While it is important that the first version of these applications satisfy the customer by providing the functionality the customer expects and perform reliably and efficiently, it is equally important to be able to accommodate the customer's change requests over the period of the product's lifetime. The challenges in achieving these goals include the lack of real-world software development experience among the student developers and the fact that postdeployment change requests will almost certainly have to be handled by students who are not among the original developers. In this article, we describe how a model-centric approach using UML has been effective in enabling students to develop and maintain eight software applications for small businesses over a 9-year period. We discuss the characteristics of our modeling technique, which include the application of modeling patterns and quality check rules that enable students to create a model that can be clearly and consistently mapped to code. We also describe the nature of these mapping-to-code techniques, emphasizing how they reduce coupling among the implementation's classes. We then discuss our experiences in the classroom with these techniques, focusing on how we have improved our teaching over the years based on the analysis of student performance and feedback. Finally, we compare our approach to related work teaching modeling and the development and maintenance of code in software engineering courses with both extensive and minimal modeling.",

We describe three recent case studies designed to evaluate the effectiveness of assigning graduate-level computer vision students with publicly available research benchmarks as competitive assignments. This was done rather than assigning more traditional exercises that require students to implement specific algorithms or applications. We allowed our students the freedom of designing or choosing their own methods, with the goal of obtaining the best performance on the benchmark chosen for each assignment. Students, therefore, competed against each other, as well as published state of the art. We detail the design, application, and results of these benchmark exercises. We show that not only are these benchmarks easily adapted for the classroom, but also that in some cases, student assignments matched published state-of-the-art performance. This observation provides strong evidence to support the effectiveness of the proposed exercise design. We conclude by discussing the benefits and drawbacks of these exercises compared to those traditionally employed in computer vision classrooms.",

In this article, I argue that the questions that we ask are shaped by internalized theoretical presuppositions about how the social and behavioral worlds operate. And although such presuppositions are essential in making the world sensible, at the same time they preclude carrying out many research studies that may further our collective research enterprise. I build this argument by first considering a few proposed research questions typical of much of the existing research in CS education, making visible the cognitivist assumptions that these questions presuppose. I then provide a different set of assumptions based on sociocultural theories of cognition and enumerate some of the (different) research questions to which these presuppositions give rise. My point is not to debate the merits of the contrasting theories but to demonstrate how theories about how minds and sociality operate are imminent in the very questions that researchers ask. Finally, I argue that by appropriating existing theory from the social, behavioral, and learning sciences, and making such theories explicit in carrying out and reporting their research, CS education researchers will advance the field.",

This study analyzes a large-scale OJS’s evaluation dataset and identifies more than 110,000 (1.94%) false-positive queries. It also validates existing SQL error categorization and reveals a new type of logical error called deceptive error, which occurs when students construct queries that pass specific test cases but fail to solve the actual problem. This type of error has been overlooked in previous research and can provide new insights into how to improve OJSs by enhancing test cases and feedback. This study contributes to the understanding of assessment and evaluation practices and processes in programming education, particularly the contribution that OJSs make to student learning and to course, staff, and institutional development.

The curriculum is based on students creating mobile apps that serve community and social good. We collected two sets of data from 294 students in three urban districts: (1) pre- and post-survey responses on their learning experiences and attitudes toward learning CS and creating community-serving apps; (2) the apps created by those students. The analysis of student apps indicated that students were able to create basic apps that connected with their personal interests, life experiences, school community, and the larger society. Students were significantly more confident in coding and creating community-focused apps after completing the course, regardless of gender, race/ethnicity, and grade. However, their interest in solving coding problems and continuing to learn CS decreased afterward. Analyses of students’ attitudes by gender, grade, and race/ethnicity showed significant differences among students in some groups. Seventh-grade students rated more positive on their attitudes than eighth graders. Students identifying with different race/ethnicity groups indicated significantly different attitudes, especially students identifying as Southeast Asian, Black/African American, and Hispanic/Latino. Self-identified male students also reported stronger interest and more positive attitudes overall than self-identified female students. Students also reported positive experiences in learning how to create real apps serving their community, while there were disparities in their experiences with coding in general and some of the instructional tools used in the class.",

Yet, despite emerging initiatives for ML instruction in K-12, there is limited information available on the learning of students from a low SES background. To address this gap, our study conducted an analysis of comparing the students’ performance assessment scores of ML concepts as a result of the ML4ALL! course among 266 middle and high school students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. The results demonstrated an understanding of ML concepts among students from all SES backgrounds. Although some differences were observed regarding specific parts of the ML development process, these were not substantial enough to identify SES as a determining factor affecting the performance assessment score. Also, when considering the background together with other demographic factors such as sex assigned at birth or educational stage, no significant difference of the students’ performance assessment scores was observed. These findings provide a first indication that a low SES background must not be a barrier to ML competencies and that effective and inclusive ML teaching strategies can ensure equitable access to ML education across diverse socioeconomic backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "Objectives . Computer Science (CS) education has become increasingly prevalent in elementary schools because of multiple rationales, such as the importance of computational literacy and the growing demand for CS-related workforce preparation. As elementary CS standards continue to be adopted by many states, more examples and voices from the field may help educators understand what effective computational thinking (CT)/CS integration looks like in practice. Method . We employed a descriptive qualitative approach to study eight award-winning K-8 CS teachers and aimed to answer three research questions: (1) What were elementary CS teachers’ rationales for CT/CS integration? (2) How do elementary CS teachers integrate CT/CS into their classroom practices? (3) What are the needs of CS teachers for meaningful CT/CS integration in elementary schools? Data were collected through interviews, a questionnaire, and artifacts and analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings . Our findings of elementary CS teachers’ rationales for CT/CS integration encompassed its essential nature as a literacy skill, its potential to promote equity in education, and its alignment with standards across various disciplines. To support CT/CS integration at the elementary level, CS teachers described important aspects with examples from their instructional practices: (a) Real-world applications; (b) hands-on activities; (c) strategies to scaffold and guide student learning; (d) collaboration with classroom teachers; and (e) support from professional development (PD). Conclusion . The study results shared CS teachers’ voices from practice and shed light on the urgent need for more support and PD opportunities for both homeroom teachers and CS teachers in elementary schools, as well as the crucial need for multiple levels of support within K-12 school systems. Continuous efforts in creating systematic and sustainable PD plans and supporting collaborative professional communities for teachers within the instructional context are a must to help prepare our elementary students with the essential CS knowledge and skills they need to thrive in this technology-rich society.",

    "abstract": "Objectives . Physical computing systems are increasingly being integrated into secondary school science and STEM instruction, yet little is known about how teachers, especially those with little background and experience in computing, help students during the inevitable debugging moments that arise. In this paper, we describe a framework, comprising two dimensions, for characterizing how teachers support students as they debug a physical computing system called the Data Sensor Hub (DaSH). The DaSH enables students to program sensors to measure, analyze, and visualize data as they engage in science inquiry activities. Participants . Five secondary school teachers implemented an inquiry-oriented instructional unit designed to introduce students to working with the DaSH as a tool for scientific inquiry. Study Method . Findings drew on video analysis of the teachers’ classroom implementations of the unit. A review of the data corpus led to the selection of 23 moments where the teachers supported an individual or small groups of students engaged in debugging. These moments were analyzed using a grounded perspective based on Interaction Analysis to characterize the teachers' varied interactional approaches. Findings . Our analysis revealed how teachers’ moves during debugging moments fell along two dimensions. The first dimension characterizes teachers’ positioning during the debugging interactions, ranging from a positioning for teacher understanding to a positioning for student understanding of the bug. The second dimension characterizes the inquiry orientation of the teachers’ questions and guidance, ranging from focusing on the debugging process to focusing on the product – or fixing the bug. Further, teachers’ moves often fell along different points on these dimensions in any given interaction given nuances in the instructional context. Conclusions . The framework offers a first step towards characterizing teachers’ debugging pedagogy as they support students during debugging moments. It also calls attention to how teachers do not necessarily need to be programming experts to effectively help students learn independent and generalizable debugging strategies. Further, it illustrates the variety of expertise that teachers can bring to debugging moments to support students learning to debug. Finally, the framework provides implications for the design of professional learning and supports for teachers as they increasingly are asked to support students in computing – and debugging – activities across a range of disciplines.",

    "abstract": "The belief that AI technology is on the cusp of causing a generalized social crisis became a popular one in 2023. While there was no doubt an element of hype and exaggeration to some of these accounts, they do reflect the fact that there are troubling ramifications to this technology stack. This conjunction of shared concerns about social, political, and personal futures presaged by current developments in artificial intelligence presents the academic discipline of computing with a renewed opportunity for self-examination and reconfiguration. This position paper endeavors to do so in four sections. The first explores what is at stake for computing in the narrative of an AI crisis. The second articulates possible educational responses to this crisis and advocates for a broader analytic focus on power relations. The third section presents a novel characterization of academic computing’s field of practice, one which includes not only the discipline’s usual instrumental forms of practice but reflexive practice as well. This reflexive dimension integrates both the critical and public functions of the discipline as equal intellectual partners and a necessary component of any contemporary academic field. The final section will advocate for a conceptual archetype–the Public Computer Intellectual and its less conspicuous but still essential cousin, the Almost-Public Computer Intellectual–as a way of practically imagining the expanded possibilities of academic practice in our discipline, one that provides both self-critique and an outward-facing orientation towards the public good. It will argue that the computer education research community can play a vital role in this regard. Recommendations for pedagogical change within computing to develop more reflexive capabilities are also provided.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on the challenges encountered in online cybersecurity education. It adopts an exploratory research design using a mixed-methods approach to investigate the perceptions and experiences of postgraduate students enrolled in an online cybersecurity program. The collection of data is structured into two distinct phases. In the initial phase, qualitative insights are gathered through workshops with students and industry experts, followed by administering a questionnaire to delve deeper into students’ perceptions and challenges. Thematic analysis of the responses reveals significant interest in online cybersecurity programs but also highlights issues such as ineffective communication and poor engagement. The findings highlight the necessity for a standardized framework to improve communication, engagement, and overall effectiveness in virtual learning environments. By empowering instructors to design more interactive courses and leveraging technology efficiently, the framework aims to improve student motivation, satisfaction, and learning outcomes. Moreover, it serves as a valuable resource for institutions, fostering collaboration and innovation in cybersecurity education. Implementing this framework will create a more conducive learning environment, directly enhancing student preparation for success in the dynamic field of cybersecurity.",

    "abstract": "Modern capstone courses use agile methods to deliver and demonstrate software early in the project. However, a simple demonstration of functional and static aspects does not provide real-world software usage context, although this is integral to understand software requirements. Software engineering involves capabilities such as creativity, imagination, and interaction, which are typically not emphasized in software engineering courses. A more engaging, dynamic way of presenting software prototypes is needed to demonstrate the context in which the software is used. We combine agile methods, scenario-based design, and theatrical aspects into software theater, an approach to present visionary scenarios using techniques borrowed from theater and film, including props and humor. We describe the software theater workflow, provide examples, and explain patterns to demonstrate its potential. We illustrate two large case studies in which we teach students with varying levels of experience to apply software theater: a capstone course involving industrial customers with 100 students and an interactive lecture-based course with 400 students. We empirically evaluated the use of software theater in both courses. Our evaluations show that students can understand and apply software theater within one semester and that this technique increases their motivation to prepare demonstrations even early in the project. Software theater is more creative, memorable, dynamic, and engaging than normal demonstration techniques and brings fun into education.",

    "abstract": "Computing science students amass years of programming experience and a wealth of factual knowledge in their undergraduate courses. Based on our combined years of experience, however, one of our students' abiding shortcomings is that they think there is only one correct answer to issues in most courses: an idealistic stance. Human-centered security, as well as other areas, requires students to understand that they have to weigh up a number of different possible solutions, and satisfice, rather than choose the one that is undeniably the best. In other words, they need to adopt a more realistic stance. Lecture-based teaching cannot develop this facility, due to its inability to engage students deeply with the issues and possible solutions. We argue that depth (in terms of understanding the complexity and issues involved) as well as breadth (in terms of appreciating the different positions taken by users on these issues) are essential for developing the realistic stance. This article reports on an instructional design that was used to help students become more realistic in their decision making. The design is based on seven educational strategies that, in tandem, help students to see the depth and breadth of topics in the course. We detail the instructional design and its application to three topic areas in the course, and report on the outcomes. We found evidence that students did indeed develop the depth and breadth we were hoping for. In concluding, we reflect on the design and the positive result, and propose changes to further improve the course.",

    "abstract": "The introduction of Computing to the national curriculum in England has led to a situation where in-service teachers need to develop subject knowledge and pedagogical expertise in computer science, which presents a significant challenge. Professional learning opportunities can support this; these may be most effective when situated in the teachers’ own working practices. This article describes a project to support Computing teachers in developing pedagogical skills by carrying out classroom-based research in their schools. A group of 22 primary (Grades K--5) and secondary (Grades 6--10) teachers from schools across England planned, designed, and implemented research projects either individually or in small groups, supported by a team of university colleagues. Inter and intra group progress was shared online and face-to-face within a distributed community of inquiry. Data collection included surveys, video data, and the projects completed by the teachers. The findings from the project are analysed using Clarke and Hollingsworth’s Interconnected Model of Teacher Professional Growth (IMTPG), which enables an identification and exploration of teacher change. Results of the analysis demonstrate that the approach can foster “growth networks”—the construct used within IMTPG to indicate teacher change which is likely to be sustained and fundamental to teachers’ understanding. The individual nature of this change indicates that the approach supports personal change related to each teacher’s specific situation. Although there is a huge literature on action research as part of teacher professional learning, we believe this to be the first time this has been carried out in the context of computer science education. We conclude by critically reflecting on the lessons that we have learned in leading this project.",

This task becomes increasingly difficult, however, as computing systems become more and more ubiquitous and invisible. Based on the analysis of semi-structured focus interviews with 28 German pre-college students, we present a grounded theory of their conceptions and reasoning related to the identification of computing within technical devices. At its core is the finding that many students seemed to differentiate technical artifacts with respect to three conceived levels of capability. Many household appliances, for instance, were very well seen as electronic and programmed, but still as too limited in their capability to warrant the presence of a “real” computer or to be related to informatics. Given the increasing versatility, power, and associated risks of modern embedded systems as well as the advent of the internet of things, this issue should clearly be addressed. Based on our grounded theory, we propose some first ideas for how this might be done.",

It is especially interesting to determine whether the aspects deemed important to evaluate by a computer science expert are the same as those established by academics and students. Such potential discrepancies are indicative of the unexpected challenges students may encounter once they graduate and begin working. In this article, we propose a learning activity in which computer science students made a video about their future profession after hearing an expert in the field who discussed about the characteristics and difficulties of his or her work. Academics, professional experts, and students assessed the videos by means of a questionnaire. This article reports a quantitative study of the results of this experience, which was conducted for three academic years. The study involved 63 students, 6 academics, and 4 computing professionals with extensive experience, and 14 videos were evaluated. Professional experts proved to be the most demanding in the assessment, followed by academics. The least demanding group was the students. These differences are more salient if more substantial issues are examined. The experts focused more on aspects of content, whereas the student preferred to concentrate on format. The academics’ focus falls between these two extremes. Understanding how experts value knowledge can guide educators in their search for effective learning environments in computing education.",

    "abstract": "A capstone project is an extensive learning experience traditionally developed during a student's final academic year. Assessing such a complex assignment involves several challenges and is usually based upon the evaluations of at least two different people: the capstone project advisor, and one or more other assessors. Quantitative studies comparing only different assessors' grades and qualitative studies investigating the origin of possible discrepancies have been conducted. In both cases, contradictory conclusions were reached. The objective of this study is to analyze the factors that are given consideration by assessors of engineering capstone projects and the influence of these factors on the discrepancies between different assessors’ opinions of the same project. This study quantitatively examined 162 computer science engineering capstone projects developed by one student and supervised by one advisor. Each project was assessed by the project advisor and a committee. For each project, the advisor and the committee were asked to complete an additional questionnaire on product characteristics, student competences, and project supervision. Competences demonstrated by the student were found to be the most relevant element when a capstone project was evaluated by the advisor and the committee; product characteristics were found to be second in influence. Furthermore, advisors grant minor significance to the advisor-involvement component. Discrepancies between grades seem to be associated with those aspects to which one assessor has access, while the other does not, such as student skills demonstrated during project development or their performance in the oral defense. Both the advisor's and the committee's perspectives are important in the assessment of this complex task and they complement one another.",

For the past four summers, we have observed significant gains in youth's interest and self-efficacy in computer science, after attending our camps. The majority of these youth, however, were youth from our local community. To provide equal access across the state and secure more diversity, we were interested in examining the effect of the camp on a broader population of youth. Thus, we partnered with an outreach program to reach and test our camps on youth from low-income high-poverty areas in the Intermountain West. During the summer of 2019, we conducted two sets of camps: locally advertised app camps that attracted youth from our local community and a second set of camps as part of a larger outreach program for youth from low-income high-poverty areas. The camps for both populations followed the same design of personnel, camp activities, structure, and curriculum. However, the background of the participants was slightly different. Using survey data, we found that the local sample experienced significant gains in both self-efficacy and interest, while the outreach group only reported significant gains in self-efficacy after attending the camp. However, the qualitative data collected from the outreach participants indicated that they had a positive experience both with the camp and their mentors. In this article, we discuss the camp design and findings in relation to strategies for broadening participation in Computer Science education.",

This mixed-methods study consisted of two parts. First, an online post-baccalaureate bridge program was evaluated, with a focus on students’ performance. Factors for analysis included gender, prior major, and the length of the program, any or all of which might play a role in students’ unsuccessful attempts to complete the program. The results indicated that female students have a higher tendency to not complete the program. However, female students who completed the program and enrolled in a graduate school have as much potential to do well in the MS program as their male cohorts do. The second part of the study comprised a survey of students who completed or did not complete the program and interviews with women students. Grounded in self-determination theory (SDT), the results showed that strategies are needed to enhance women students’ perceived competence and relatedness in the program.",

    "abstract": "A common belief among students is that computing is a boring subject that lacks a connection to the real world. The first class (one 80-minute session) in an introductory computer science course may be an appropriate instance to combat such a belief. Previous studies have used coursewide interventions, e.g., games and physical/tangible devices to improve students’ motivation. However, although other approaches help motivate students, they may lack real-world context or have a high cost of deployment. This article proposes a novel real-world based approach to introduce programming concepts in the first class of the introductory computer science course. This approach, called Protobject based, is applicable to courses with over 100 students, has a low deployment entry barrier, requires low investment, and may be used creatively to implement different experiences. Furthermore, the Protobject-based approach has an equivalent motivational effect—at least in the short-term—to a Game-based approach even if it is entirely focused on the real world. The low requirements of the approach make it especially suitable for an 80-minute first class in an introductory computer science course. The Protobject-based approach has been preliminarily validated and compared to a pure game-based approach with a study with 376 participants, and we present the analysis of motivation questionnaires, a pre-test and post-test, and a homework assignment given to the students. We posit that more research into initiatives such as this one—that can show students how computer science can impact the real world around them—is warranted.",

Specifically, computing and mathematics credit-hour and course graduation requirements were determined for ABET-accredited and non-accredited BSCS programs within public and private universities. As (i) curricular guidelines are recommendations that do not have to be followed, (ii) curricular accreditation criteria are minimal constraints that may be exceeded, and (iii) non-accredited programs may choose to meet or exceed curricular accreditation criterion, it is possible that graduating computer science students are exposed to similar, or a wide variety, of coursework and associated topics. The survey results presented in this article provide broad answers to these three curricular possibilities. In turn, these results can contribute to future discussions concerning the perceived value of accreditation to students and industry stakeholders, allow educators in computer science departments to compare their curriculum to a large sample of other universities, and provide curricular committees additional insight into how various curricular guidelines are realistically being used.",

    "abstract": "Background: People who are racialized, gendered, or otherwise minoritized are underrepresented in computing professions in North America. This is reflected in undergraduate computer science (CS) programs, in which students from marginalized backgrounds continue to experience inequities that do not typically affect White cis-men. This is especially true for Black students in general, and Black women in particular, whose experience of systemic, anti-Black racism compromises their ability to persist and thrive in CS education contexts. Objectives: This systematic mapping study endeavours to (1) determine the quantity of existing non-deficit-based studies concerned with the persistence of Black students in undergraduate CS; (2) summarize the findings and recommendations in those studies; and (3) identify areas in which additional studies may be required. We aim to accomplish these objectives by way of two research questions: (RQ1) What factors are associated with Black students’ persistence in undergraduate CS programs?; and (RQ2) What recommendations have been made to further bolster Black students’ persistence in undergraduate CS education programs? Methods: This systematic mapping study was conducted in accordance with PRISMA 2020 and SEGRESS guidelines. Studies were identified by conducting keyword searches in seven databases. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to capture studies illuminating persistence factors for Black students in undergraduate CS programs. To ensure the completeness of our search results, we engaged in snowballing and an expert-based search to identify additional studies of interest. Finally, data were collected from each study to address the research questions outlined above. Results: Using the methods outlined above, we identified 16 empirical studies, including qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-methods studies informed by a range of theoretical frameworks. Based on data collected from the primary studies in our sample, we identified 13 persistence factors across four categories: (I) social capital, networking, &amp; support; (II) career &amp; professional development; (III) pedagogical &amp; programmatic interventions; and (IV) exposure &amp; access. This data-collection process also yielded 26 recommendations across six stakeholder groups: (i) researchers; (ii) colleges and universities; (iii) the computing industry; (iv) K-12 systems and schools; (v) governments; and (vi) parents. Conclusion: This systematic mapping study resulted in the identification of numerous persistence factors for Black students in CS. Crucially, however, these persistence factors allow Black students to persist, but not thrive, in CS. Accordingly, we contend that more needs to be done to address the systemic inequities faced by Black people in general, and Black women in particular, in computing programs and professions. As evidenced by the relatively small number of primary studies captured by this systematic mapping study, there exists an urgent need for additional, asset-based empirical studies involving Black students in CS. In addition to foregrounding the intersectional experiences of Black women in CS, future studies should attend to the currently understudied experiences of Black men.",

    "abstract": "In learning to program and understanding how a programming language controls a computer, learners develop both insights and misconceptions whilst their mental models are gradually refined. It is important that the learner is able to distinguish the different elements and roles of a computer (compiler, interpreter, memory, etc.), which novice programmers may find difficult to comprehend. Forming accurate mental models is one of the potential sources of difficulty inextricably linked to mastering computing concepts and processes, and for learning computer programming. It is common to use some form of representation (e.g., an abstract machine or a Computational Agent (CA)) to support technical or pedagogic explanations. The Notional Machine (NM) is a pedagogical device that entails one or more computational concepts, originally described as an idealised computer operating with the constructs of a particular programming language. It can be used to support specific or general learning goals and will typically have some concrete representation that can be referred to. Computational Thinking (CT), which is defined as a way of thinking that is used for [computational] problem solving, is often presented as using a CA to carry out information processing presented by a solution. In CT, where the typical goal is to produce an algorithm or a computer program, the CA seemingly serves a purpose very similar to an NM. Although it changes through the different stages of development (of the learner and of the curriculum), the roles of CAs and NMs can be seen as versatile tools that connect a learner’s mental model with the conceptual model of a program. In this article, we look at this relationship between CAs and NMs, and indicate how they would look at different stages of learning. We traverse the range of definitions and usages of these concepts, and articulate models that clarify how these are viewed in the literature. This includes exploring the nature of machines and agents, and how historical views of these relate to modern pedagogy for computation. We argue that the CA can be seen as an abstract, simplified variant of an NM that provides a useful perspective to the learner to support them to form robust mental models of NMs more efficiently and effectively. We propose that teaching programming should make use of the idea of a CA at different stages of learning, as a link that connects a learner’s mental model to a full NM.",

    "abstract": "Background and Objective. Teacher assessment research suggests that teachers have good conceptual understanding of CT. However, to model CT-based problem-solving in their classrooms, teachers need to develop the ability to recognize when and how to apply CT skills. Does existing professional development (PD) equip teachers to know when and how to apply CT skills? What factors should PD providers consider while developing trainings for CT application skills? Method. This retrospective observational study used a binomial regression model to determine what factors predict teachers’ probability of performing well on a CT application skills test. Participants. Participants of this study were 129 in-service K-12 teachers from a community of practice in India. Findings. Results show that teachers who have received at least one CT training, who have a higher teaching experience, and are currently teaching CT will have a higher probability of applying CT skills correctly to problems irrespective of the subject they teach and their educational backgrounds. However, receiving a higher number of CT PD trainings was a negative predictor of teachers’ performance. Implications. Implications for school administrators, professional development providers, and researchers are discussed. Teachers need ample opportunity to teach CT in their teaching schedules. Continuous professional development does not necessarily result in improved CT application skills unless careful consideration is given to the pedagogies used and to the resolution of misconceptions that teachers may have developed in prior training. Mixing plugged and unplugged pedagogical approaches may be beneficial to encourage transfer of CT application skills across different types of problems. Last, there is a need to develop valid and reliable instruments that measure CT application skills of teachers.",

    "abstract": "Black women remain severely underrepresented in computing despite ongoing efforts to diversify the field. Given that Black women exist at the intersection of both racial and gendered identities, tailored approaches are necessary to address the unique barriers Black women face in computing. However, it is difficult to quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of interventions designed to retain Black women in computing, since samples of computing students typically contain too few Black women for robust statistical analysis. Using about a decade of student survey responses from an National Science Foundation–funded Broadening Participation in Computing alliance, we use regression analyses to quantitatively examine the connection between different types of interventions and Black women’s intentions to persist in computing and how this compares to other students (specifically, Black men, white women, and white men). This comparison allows us to quantitatively explore how Black women’s needs are both distinct from—and similar to—other students. We find that career awareness and faculty mentorship are the two interventions that have a statistically significant, positive correlation with Black women’s computing persistence intentions. No evidence was found that increasing confidence or developing skills/knowledge was correlated with Black women’s computing persistence intentions, which we posit is because Black women must be highly committed and confident to pursue computing in college. Last, our results suggest that many efforts to increase the number of women in computing are focused on meeting the needs of white women. While further analyses are needed to fully understand the impact of complex intersectional identities in computing, this large-scale quantitative analysis contributes to our understanding of the nuances of Black women’s needs in computing.",

    "abstract": "Collaboration is an important aspect of computing. In a classroom setting, working with others can increase a student’s motivation to attempt more challenges, reduce the difficulty of complicated concepts, and bring about greater overall success. Despite extensive research in other domains, there has been minimal exploration within computing on what impacts a student’s decision to seek social assistance in highly competitive university environments. To understand what affects introductory programming students’ social help-seeking behavior in this context, we conducted 32 semi-structured interviews with students and performed thematic analysis and qualitative coding on the ensuing transcripts. Our qualitative analysis revealed 18 significant factors. We noticed that the decision to seek social help involved a two-fold process: first, the decision to engage in social help-seeking, and subsequently, the decision of who to ask for help. Furthermore, we found that help-seeking in computing is not fundamentally different from other disciplines, although some of the factors were unique to the topic of computing and the specific environment of this study. Factors related to communication style, the type of question being asked, and the school’s cheating policy were central when discussing code, an integral part of computing. Regarding the environment, students repeatedly reported that the competitive major, the explicit and implicit class standards, and feelings of intimidation, among others, influenced them. These findings suggest that understanding both steps and the sociocultural context is important in order to effectively lower the barriers to asking for help.",

    "abstract": "High school computing education reform efforts have been ongoing across the United States, particularly in the past decade. Although national Computer Science (CS) for All initiatives are promising, states retain control over education policies. Recent computing education reform efforts in the state of Maryland (U.S.A.) focused on providing every public high school student with access to high-quality high school computing courses. Such access provides exposure to computing careers and better prepares a diverse pool of students for computing majors in college and the workforce. This comprehensive embedded multi-level case study examines the state’s computing education reform efforts from 2010 through 2016. The expansion of computing education indicates that while there was positive growth, the growth was not the same for all categories of public high school students. Top-down policies assist in providing leverage to elevate the need for CS; however, bottom-up efforts to support students and to enable teachers to retain autonomy and professionalism is also needed for CS expansion. Despite successes, barriers at the state, Local Education Agencies (LEA), school, and classroom levels persist and are discussed. The findings in this study can be applied to other states with similar governance structures and policies, and we provide specific recommendations.",

In comparison with well-established courses in mathematics and science, little is known about how the decisions made by HS CS teachers regarding how and what to teach impact student performance later in introductory college CS courses. Drawing on a large sample of 2,871 introductory college CS students at 115 U.S. institutions who had taken a CS course in HS, we examined the topic coverage and prevailing instructional methods in the HS course and investigated how these experiences influenced student performance in college CS. Controlling for differences in student background, we find two predictors of higher grades in college CS: greater frequency of coding-related activities in HS (programming, debugging, studying algorithms) and lower frequency of “non-coding” computer use (e.g., data analysis, computer security). Interaction models revealed a more complex story. Coding-related activity more heavily benefited students who did not have coding help available at home. In the 28% of college CS courses in which instructors employed innovative pedagogies, students with higher ACT or SAT mathematics scores had a greater advantage than in traditionally taught courses. Finally, in the innovative college courses, students whose HS CS exams had typically included testing on vocabulary did worse than students whose exams had not included such tests.",

    "abstract": "Female-focused, grassroots communities purporting to help women learn to code are popping up in a variety of settings, indicating the motivation on the part of the participants to evade male-dominated settings while learning. However, little is known about how these groups function as an activity system. With current technology enabling the forming of virtual communities and the meteoric rise in use of the Salesforce CRM (customer relationship management) platform, a group of women have formed a coaching and learning community designed to help women move from Salesforce administrators to software developers through learning to code. We used activity systems analysis (ASA) to investigate this real-world instance of the larger phenomenon using an ethnographic approach. We used ASA to organize and make sense of the data by first creating a table listing the points on the activity system triangle (subject, rules, object, etc.) and filling in the points of the triangle based on the design of the coaching and learning group as described by participants; this gave us a high-level view of the activity system. To understand the subjects’ point of view of the system, we then created a new column in the table to fill in themes that emerged from our qualitative data analysis organized by dimension of the activity system. This process enabled us to capture the activity and the voices of participants as well as tensions that had emerged in the system. Findings show a range of outcomes, from participants crediting the group as a kickstart to the journey to successfully landing a job as a developer to members stalling in their progress after involvement. Results also show that purposeful tensions of welcoming novice questions and offering unsolicited verbal encouragement built into the activity system create a welcoming, safe environment for women learning to code.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we discuss the possible connection between the programming language and the paradigm behind it, and programmers’ tendency to adopt an external or internal perspective of the system they develop. Based on a qualitative analysis, we found that when working with the visual, interobject language of live sequence charts (LSC), programmers tend to adopt an external and usability-oriented view of the system, whereas when working with an intraobject language, they tend to adopt an internal and implementation-oriented viewpoint. This is explained by first discussing the possible effect of the programming paradigm on programmers’ perception and then offering a more comprehensive explanation. The latter is based on a cognitive model of programming with LSC, which is an interpretation and a projection of the model suggested by Adelson and Soloway [1985] onto LSC and scenario-based programming, the new paradigm on which LSC is based. Our model suggests that LSC fosters a kind of programming that enables iterative refinement of the artifact with fewer entries into the solution domain. Thus, the programmer can make less context switching between the solution domain and the problem domain, and consequently spend more time in the latter. We believe that these findings are interesting mainly in two ways. First, they characterize an aspect of problem-solving behavior that to the best of our knowledge has not been studied before—the programmer’s perspective. The perspective can potentially affect the outcome of the problem-solving process, such as by leading the programmer to focus on different parts of the problem. Second, relating the structure of the language to the change in perspective sheds light on one of the ways in which the programming language can affect the programmer’s behavior.",

However, students attending OOAD courses typically encounter difficulties in the transition. Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) provides a model transformation framework for transitioning between OOAD phases. Considering the advantages of MDA in phase transitions, this study proposes that integrating conventional OOAD instruction with the MDA framework and describing transition relations in diagrammatic representations might improve students’ understanding of the transitions. This study used an empirical design that involved using two treatments (MDA-based and conventional instruction) to examine the relevance of MDA-based instruction in the effective understanding of the transitions on the basis of cognitive load theory, the split-attention principle, and theories of representation format. The results indicate that, compared with conventional instruction, MDA-based instruction is more efficient because it improves mental efficiency by reducing extraneous cognitive load. This study can assist educators in understanding the difficulties in learning phase transitions and motivate researchers to develop more effective learning instructions for transitioning between OOAD phases.",

    "abstract": "This article discusses the evolution of a single undergraduate computer graphics course over five semesters, driven by a primary question: if one could offer only one undergraduate course in graphics, what would it include? This constraint is relevant to many small and medium-sized colleges that lack resources, adequate expertise, and enrollment to sustain multiple courses in graphics that spread out its vast and evolving content. We strive to include material that would provide (1) a basic but solid theoretical foundation, (2) topics, data structures, and algorithms that are most practically used, (3) ample experience in actual graphics programming and (4) a basic awareness of advanced topics. We have a secondary objective of relating and complementing computer graphics knowledge and programming with topics in other computer science courses to provide a more cohesive understanding to our students. We achieve both objectives by using an “early-scenegraphs” approach to progressively create graphics applications that use XML-based modeling and both pipeline-based and ray traced rendering. We report and analyze results that show how students were able to achieve more complex results within similar time periods while largely retaining prior average student performance in the course. Students also report higher rates of satisfaction with the course when it follows our proposed approach. Pedagogically our main contribution is an evolving blueprint for a single undergraduate CG course that offers flexibility to emphasize different aspects like modeling, rendering, etc. according to the instructor’s and students’ interests, while aligning the course better within the computer science curriculum especially when resources are limited.",

    "abstract": "The underrepresentation of women in technical fields is a widely acknowledged national problem, limiting both the raw size of the talent pool and the diversity of experiences and perspectives of those who will design solutions to key problems facing society. Empowering women to succeed in these fields is clearly one important component of any solution. Because the population in those fields will likely continue to be overwhelmingly male for some time to come, men must also be a key component of the solution. Specifically, since the attitudes of the majority group are a strong determinant of climate, it is almost equally important to foster a population of men supportive of increasing the representation of women. As at most universities and technical companies, women are a minority in all majors in the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) College of Engineering and Information Technology (COEIT). In most majors, they are a small minority. The UMBC Center for Women and Information Technology (CWIT) is dedicated to increasing the representation of women in engineering and information technology fields. At the heart of these efforts is the CWIT Scholar Program, a selective merit scholarship program for undergraduates majoring in engineering and IT who are committed to increasing the representation of women in those fields. In addition to financial support, the CWIT Scholar Program provides a supportive community, academic and professional development programming, networking opportunities, and a residential Living Learning Community. Almost from the beginning, some CWIT scholars have been men. 28 percent of current CWIT scholars are men. Perhaps not surprisingly, female CWIT scholars have dramatically higher retention and completion rates than other women majoring in these fields. In this article, we look at a second effect of the CWIT Scholar Program, that of changing awareness and attitudes of the men who participate. We discuss programs and present results of a survey of attitudes regarding technical, academic, and gender issues in engineering and IT education. We disaggregate survey participants to show differences between the attitudes of women, scholar men, and men not participating in a diversity program.",

To address the new challenges, many universities have launched specially tailored courses to train young professionals to work in globally distributed projects. However, a mere acknowledgment of the geographic, temporal, and cultural differences does not necessarily lead to a deep understanding of the underlying practical implications. Therefore, many universities developed alternative teaching and learning activities, such as multi-university collaborative projects and small-scale simulations or games. In this article, we present a small-scale exercise that uses LEGO bricks to teach skills necessary for global work. We describe the many different interventions that could be implemented in the execution of the exercise. We had seven runs of the exercises and report our findings from executing seven runs of the exercise with the total of 104 students from five different courses in two different universities.

    "abstract": "Effective and equitable CS teaching is contingent on teachers’ robust understanding of equity issues in CS classrooms. To this end, this study examined high school teachers’ perceptions of equity during their participation in a CS teacher certificate program over two years. The participants are from various disciplines and from schools that serve under-represented students. Using a qualitative approach, we conducted content analysis of the teachers’ written reflections and responses to semi-structured interviews. Based on the justice-centered framework, we analyzed the major themes that emerged from the content analysis. The findings provide insights into high school CS teachers’ understanding of equity, the strategies that teachers use to address equity issues, and how teachers interpret the causes of inequities in CS classrooms. This research presents frameworks for examining teachers’ conceptualizations of equity and can inform the implementation of future professional development programs for CS teachers.",

    "abstract": "The provision of all-female computer science outreach programmes is a common strategy used to foster greater interest in the subject for high school aged girls. Based on key factors that affect girls’ interest in computer science (CS), outreach programmes often share much in their approach. Nonetheless, there is criticism from a research perspective concerning how programmes evaluate their efficacy, and how the role of pedagogy is under-explored. This article describes the design of CodePlus, a non-formal CS outreach programme based in an Irish University, Trinity College Dublin, and the methods by which the programme is evaluated. This article aims to contribute to this area by reporting on a social constructivist pedagogical model for all-female CS outreach activities, evaluated with a structured research approach. The results from the large sample size ( n =856) are positive, with participants showing statistically significant changes in key attitudinal and intentional variables concerning girls’ interest in studying computer science.",

The max-min composition may be suitable for multiple choice questions (MCQs), but it is not adequate for questions with a more complex structure, as in the OOP assessment. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to present the incorporation of a concept-effect propagation approach and the Handy Instrument for Course Level Assessment (HI-Class) approach to promote a modified valid analysis approach, the Achievement Degree Analysis (ADA).

    "abstract": "This work is situated in research on Parental Involvement (PI) in Computer Science (CS) Education. While the importance of PI in children's education is well established, most parents have little experience in CS and struggle to facilitate the learning of a child in the area. If PI in CS Education is to happen, then we argue that parents need support and that understanding the current behaviours and attitudes toward CS in the family context is important to discerning the form that support should take. This article therefore describes the development of an instrument to identify factors relating to parental attitudes toward and motivation for PI in CS education. Relevant variables situated in the context of parental computing behaviours and attitudes in the home were identified using a literature review and expert focus group. These include computing usage, availability, confidence, and experience. To measure these variables, a survey instrument was developed and administered to a large sample of parents ( n = 1228). Results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis confirm that the instrument measures five constructs, namely “Confidence,” measuring parental confidence levels with computing; “Attitude to PI”; “Motivation for PI”; and two types of “Usage”: Creation and Consumption. Results of Pearson correlation revealed significant positive relationships between confidence and both positive attitudes toward, and motivation for, PI, with linear regressions confirming that confidence was a significant predictor of both. Regression analysis also identified that creative usage was a predictor of positive attitudes to PI, and that programming experience was a predictor of attitude to, and motivation for, PI. These findings were further validated through triangulation with qualitative data from focus groups with the target population. We conclude that this understanding of the predictors of PI attitudes and motivation should inform the design of initiatives to address parental engagement in CS Education.",

But do youth have opportunities to design, create, and have voice around the shape of their CSed learning experiences? In this study, we explore ways that school districts engage youth to contribute to the shaping and enactment of their CS instructional systems, efforts districts make to have these leadership roles create impact within these systems, and the tensions associated with these processes. Through in depth analysis of five district case studies, our findings highlight variance around the nature of leadership roles , how access to leadership roles is structured, student autonomy within and ownership over leadership roles, how roles reach into and index differential power over instructional systems , and how district processes of scaffolding and infrastructuring mediate the ultimate impact that students in these roles are able to have on CS instructional systems. Findings also surfaced ways that district actors dealt with a number of tensions associated with student leadership within CS instructional systems. This study provides educators, administrators, and researchers with an expansive view of the potential for students to play legitimate roles within the context of system-wide instructional efforts around CS, and aims to expand conceptions of ‘equitable computer science’—up to this point largely conceived of through the lenses of access to, participation in, and experiences of CS learning—to focus on equity as also being about who has ‘a seat at the table’ when it comes to CS.",

At the same time, most CS departments across the country are only seeing 25–30% of women students in their classes, meaning that we are failing to draw interest from a large portion of the population. In this work, we explore the gender gap in CS at Rutgers University–New Brunswick, a large public R1 research university, using three data sets that span thousands of students across six academic years. Specifically, we combine these data sets to study the gender gaps in four core CS courses and explore the correlation of several factors with retention and the impact of these factors on changes to the gender gap as students proceed through the CS courses toward completing the CS major. For example, we find that a significant percentage of women students taking the introductory CS1 course for majors do not intend to major in CS, which may be a contributing factor to a large increase in the gender gap immediately after CS1. This finding implies that part of the retention task is attracting these women students to further explore the major. Results from our study include both novel findings and findings that are consistent with known challenges for increasing gender diversity in CS. In both cases, we provide extensive quantitative data in support of the findings.",

    "abstract": "Computing science students amass years of programming experience and a wealth of factual knowledge in their undergraduate courses. Based on our combined years of experience, however, one of our students' abiding shortcomings is that they think there is only one correct answer to issues in most courses: an idealistic stance. Human-centered security, as well as other areas, requires students to understand that they have to weigh up a number of different possible solutions, and satisfice, rather than choose the one that is undeniably the best. In other words, they need to adopt a more realistic stance. Lecture-based teaching cannot develop this facility, due to its inability to engage students deeply with the issues and possible solutions. We argue that depth (in terms of understanding the complexity and issues involved) as well as breadth (in terms of appreciating the different positions taken by users on these issues) are essential for developing the realistic stance. This article reports on an instructional design that was used to help students become more realistic in their decision making. The design is based on seven educational strategies that, in tandem, help students to see the depth and breadth of topics in the course. We detail the instructional design and its application to three topic areas in the course, and report on the outcomes. We found evidence that students did indeed develop the depth and breadth we were hoping for. In concluding, we reflect on the design and the positive result, and propose changes to further improve the course.",

To show the contextual influences on learning CS, we present empirical data from a qualitative investigation of the experiences of Chinese students studying for a master degree at Sweden's Uppsala University. Data were collected of the students’ understanding and learning of CS, their experience of the teaching and their own studies, and of their personal development in Sweden. Using an analysis framework grounded in phenomenography, we analytically separated the what and how aspects of learning. In this article, we describe the what , or the content of the students’ learning, and identify dimensions of variation in the experiences of students. These dimensions relate to the foci of the CS programs, the learning outcomes, and the impact of the studies. The findings from the analyses indicate pedagogical and pragmatic implications for teaching and learning CS in higher education institutions. The study extends the traditional use of phenomenography through the discussion of the dimensions of variation in the experiences and the values within the dimensions. It opens the way for understanding the relational nature of learning in computing education.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores a major theoretical framework from psychology, Dual Process Theory (DPT) , which has received surprisingly little attention in the computing education literature. DPT postulates the existence of two qualitatively different kinds of cognitive systems, a fast, intuitive “System 1” and a slow, reflective “System 2”. System 1 is associated with cognitive factors such as crystallized intelligence, long-term memory and associative learning; System 2 with fluid intelligence, working memory, and rule learning. This paper summarizes DPT and the way it has been expressed and explored in literatures relating to intelligence, memory, learning, attention, cognitive load, and more. It proposes a summary model, the Dual Process Cycle (DPC) . It then considers example concepts from computing education within the context of this model. Examples include programming expertise, mental models of programs, the notional machine, code reading and code writing, and the theory of Learning Edge Momentum (LEM) . In conclusion, it is argued that the DPC (and the framework of DPTs in general) provides a useful context for defining such concepts more richly and exactly, and for generating interesting questions about them.",

Diversity and inclusion are important topics, however, insights on suited programming materials for younger learners with visual impairments are lacking. A wide range of programming materials for children exists, diverse in both what is being programmed (output) and how this is done (input), yet often relying on visual features. An understanding of the usability and accessibility aspects of these different materials is important to inform educational practice and to increase understanding of what makes programming materials suited for low vision and blind children. The aim of this study is to explore the usability and accessibility of programming materials currently used in education to low vision and blind children in the Netherlands. A focus group was conducted with six teachers or IT experts, all working with the target group in special education. The thematic analysis of the discussion of 25 materials (including unplugged lessons, robots and robotic kits, block-based and text-based languages) showed the potential of several materials, especially unplugged lessons, and the continuing search for suited materials and workforms specifically for the blind children. Furthermore, prioritizing “fun” and close connections to children’s daily life as well as careful explorations of usability at the cognitive level came forward as important factors for future research and development in programming materials for low vision and blind children. These insights can contribute to obtaining an inclusive approach to programming for young learners.",

The pattern that emerged from these themes is framed by structuration theory, wherein the structures (school policies, resources, and courses) influence the agents (teachers, students, the community), and in turn, the agents influence the structures.

Likewise, researchers are also often removed from the challenges of classroom practices that teachers face when teaching CS. Research Questions. To create a collaborative process for teachers and researchers outside of a research practice partnership, we piloted a facilitated process in which CS middle school teachers and CS education researchers collaboratively created CS teacher practice briefs. Our research question for this study was: In what ways are teachers impacted by the process of creating teacher practice briefs in collaboration with researchers? Methodology. We conducted a qualitative study, using a semi-structured interview protocol to interview five teachers and three researchers to gain an understanding of how this process impacted the participants. We used thematic content analysis to identify several subthemes across our pre-established themes: motivation for teachers to participate, impacts on teachers, perceived impacts on students, and impacts on researchers. Findings. We found that the impact on teachers mirrored impacts found on teachers who engage in Research Practice Partnerships, including increased self-efficacy, expanded professional networks, and changed classroom practices. Implications. By bringing researchers and educators together with a clear focus on equity-based problems of practice in CS education, the results display a multitude of positive impacts. Teachers indicate that they are are positively impacted, researchers develop a clear understanding of realistic practices, and students are peripherally impacted through changed practices in the classroom. Therefore, the most significant contribution to advance the disciplinary understanding is the potential for this new process to decrease the gap between research and practice.",

    "abstract": "Context Introducing Computer Science (CS) into formal education can be challenging, notably when considering the numerous stakeholders involved which include the students, teachers, schools, and policy makers. We believe these perspectives should be considered conjointly, which is possible within Research Practice Partnerships (RPPs) . RPPs look to bridge research-practice gaps and have seen an increase in the field of education and CS-education. Unfortunately, RPPs are considered to be under-researched, in addition to presenting their own challenges. Objectives To the purpose of assessing how RPPs may support the successful introduction of CS into formal education, we investigate three perspectives (students, teachers, and RPP stakeholders) and their interplay within the context of a multi-institution RPP conducting a pilot program to introduce CS to secondary school students. Methods A mixed methods analysis was employed to triangulate data in a concurrent triangulation design. The data included (i) three surveys distributed over the semester to 106 grade 9 students (ages 12-14), (ii) four teacher-journals, (iii) two interviews and four focus groups with the teachers and representatives of the partner institutions. Findings From the students’ perspective , while their self-efficacy increased, their motivation decreased throughout the semester due to a miss-match between their expectations and the course. The findings also indicate that gender biases and heterogeneity are already present in grade 9. From the teachers’ perspective , co-constructing the study plan, having access to regular support and collaborating within a community of practice when starting to teach CS all facilitated the teachers’ experience. Finally, from the RPP’s perspective the collaboration between stakeholders and having researchers evaluate the program were considered to be key elements in the pilot program. However, there appears to be a research-practice gap, in large part due to limited interactions between researchers and curriculum designers, and researchers and the teachers in the field. Conclusions From the students’ perspective it appears relevant to introduce CS (i) prior to secondary school to address motivation and bias-related issues early on, and (ii) to all students to avoid participation being motivation-, stereotype-, or belief-driven, and risk broadening the gap between students, (iii) all the while being attentive to course format and content to ensure that the course meets students’ expectations and fosters autonomous motivation. From the teachers’ perspective , while the support provided met the teachers’ needs, it is essential to find means of scaling such approaches when looking to deploy CS-curricular reforms to entire administrative regions. Finally, from the RPP’s perspective (i) teachers’ should be given a voice in the RPP to better align with the field, and (ii) researchers’ roles should be reconsidered to move beyond being only evaluators, and towards having a more co-constructive role in setting up the curricular reform. Recommendations are provided for researchers and practitioners involved in CS curricular reforms.",

Participants . Participants for Studies 1 (n = 536) and 2 (n = 222) were undergraduate students enrolled in introductory- and upper-level CS courses at a large, public, Midwestern university. Race-ethnicity information was not collected due to IRB concerns about possible secondary identification of participants from underrepresented groups. Study Method . Participants completed a condensed version of the Implicit Theories of Intelligence Scale [ 16 , 54 ] and the Lack of Regulation Scale from the Student Perceptions of Classroom Knowledge Building scale [ 51 , 53 ] at the beginning (Studies 1 and 2), middle (Study 2), and end (Studies 1 and 2) of semester-long undergraduate CS courses. Survey responses were analyzed using path analyses to investigate how students’ lack of regulation experiences throughout the semester predicted their implicit intelligence beliefs at the beginning (Study 2) and end (Studies 1 and 2) of the semester. Findings . Results from Study 1 indicate that undergraduate CS students come to more strongly believe that their intelligence is a fixed, unchanging entity from the beginning until the end of the semester. Moreover, participants’ responses to the lack of regulation scale were predictive of their implicit intelligence beliefs at the end of the semester. Results from Study 2 indicate that ineffective self-regulation experiences early in the semester enhance CS students’ belief in the unchanging nature of intelligence (i.e., during the first half of the semester). Taken altogether, these findings provide evidence that self-regulation experiences influence students’ beliefs about the malleability of intelligence. Conclusions . Findings align with Bandura's [ 4 ] contention that students’ behaviors and experiences influence their values and beliefs. Students who experienced poor self-regulated learning came to view intelligence as more of a fixed, unalterable entity than their more successfully self-regulated peers. Findings suggest that CS instructors can positively affect student motivation and engagement by embedding self-regulated learning strategy instruction into their courses and helping CS students adopt an incremental-oriented (e.g., growth-oriented) belief system about their intellectual abilities.",

    "abstract": "While computing programs in the U.S. are experiencing growth in enrollment trends, they are still grappling with matters related to retention and persistence of computing undergraduates. One construct identified by scholars as having an impact on persistence in computing is computing identity, which is shaped by constructs such as recognition, performance/competence beliefs, sense of belonging, and interest. Likewise, participation in what scholars call communities of practice (CoPs) can aid in the development of their computing identity. To help foster computing identity development, an initiative was designed at three large public universities named Flit-Path (Florida IT Pathways to Success). Flit-Path was established using the principles inherent to communities of practice with the goal of recruiting and retaining computing students. The Flit-Path program leveraged curricular and co-curricular support to engage academically talented students with financial need in computing disciplines (e.g., computer engineering, computer science, and information technology) and provided financial assistance via scholarships. The guiding research question for this study was, What is the impact of a computing community of practice (the Flit-Path program) on students’ computing identity, specifically the constructs of recognition, performance/competence, sense of belonging, and interest? In order to address this question, a validated survey instrument was used to compare 64 computing students who enrolled in the Flit-Path program with students from the same universities with matched years in college, computing GPA, race/ethnicity, gender, home/environment support, and work hours outside the home. For comparing the two groups, the research team used multivariate matching methods in R. The results of the study revealed that students in the Flit-Path program demonstrated substantially higher computing identities. Students who participated in the Flit-Path program experienced higher recognition, performance/competence, and sense of belonging in the computing field than their non-Flit-Path counterparts. There was also a borderline positive effect for interest. Together, the results indicate that well-designed CoP interventions in computing programs can have a significant effect on students’ identification with computing and ultimately their persistence.",

    "abstract": "Improving equity and inclusion for underrepresented groups in the field of Computer Science (CS) has garnered much attention. In particular, there is a long-standing need for diversity efforts that center on the experiences of Black women, and specific actions to increase their representation—especially given the biases that they often encounter in the field. There is limited research concerning Black women in CS, specifically their conceptions of the field and their overarching CS identity development. More research in this area is especially important given the marginalization that Black women often experience at the intersections of their race and gender. Guided by a combination of critical theoretical lenses, this qualitative study examines Black women's conceptions of what it means to be a computer scientist and the degree to which those conceptions map onto how they see themselves in the field. Moreover, we explore experiences that help to bolster Black women's CS identity. The findings highlight key aspects of what it means to be a computer scientist for the Black women in this study—notably the ability to use computing to make societal contributions. Also, the results accentuate key nuances in the participants’ personal CS identification, particularly as it relates to the resilience required to overcome unique barriers that many Black women encounter when engaging within the field. Moreover, the findings highlight the importance of social support systems to facilitate Black women's CS identity development. Implications for policy and practice within education and industry are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Global software engineering (GSE) courses traditionally require cooperation between at least two universities so as to provide a distributed development environment to the students. In this study, we explore an alternative way to organize a global software engineering course where students work on open source software development (OSSD) projects rather than in a multi-university collaboration setting. The results show that the new setup may provide core GSE challenges as well as challenges associated with software development outsourcing and challenges related to working on large open source software. The present article compares the experiences gained from running a combined GSE and OSSD course against the experiences gained from running a traditional GSE course. The two alternatives are compared in terms of students’ learning outcomes and course organization. The authors found that a combined GSE and OSSD course provides learning opportunities that are partly overlapping with, and partly complementary to, a traditional GSE course. The authors also found that the combined OSSD and GSE course was somewhat easier to organize because most of the activities took place in a single university setting. The authors used the extended GSE taxonomy for the comparison and found it to be a useful tool for this, although it had some limitations in expressive power. Therefore, two additional relationship dimensions are proposed that will further enrich the extended taxonomy in classifying GSE (and OSSD) projects.",

The objective of the module is to promote students’ self-learning effort to improve their performance. We also intend to determine if this new feature has any effect on the amount of code copies detected in lab sessions when using the same online tool. Two groups of students were compared quantitatively: the first group used the tool exclusively during lab sessions, whereas the second group had the option of employing the tool's new module to enhance their study. The tool allows us to collect interesting data related to the focus of this research: supplementary work completed voluntarily by students and the percentage of students copying others’ code during compulsory lab sessions. The results show that the students in the second group achieved better academic results and copied less in lab sessions. In the second group, the students who invested more effort in doing revision exercises and copied less in lab sessions obtained better results; and, interestingly, the effort invested in completing review exercises did not seem to compensate for the learning effort avoided by copying others’ exercises during lab sessions. The results show the advantages of a tool used with a dual orientation: compulsory and voluntary. Mandatory usage in lab sessions establishes some milestones that, eventually, act as an incentive fostering learning, while voluntary use reinforces students’ perception of the tool's usefulness in terms of learning.",

Various alternative paradigms for parallel and offload computation exist, but little is known about the human factors impacts of using the different paradigms. With computer science student participants from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas with no previous exposure to Graphics Processing Unit programming, our study compared NVIDIA CUDA C/C++ as a control group and the Thrust library. The designers of Thrust claim their higher level of abstraction enhances programmer productivity. The trial was conducted on 91 participants and was administered through our computerized testing platform. Although the study was narrowly focused on the basic steps of an offloaded computation problem and was not intended to be a comprehensive evaluation of the superiority of one approach or the other, we found evidence that although Thrust was designed for ease of use, the abstractions tended to be confusing to students and in several cases diminished productivity. Specifically, abstractions in Thrust for (i) memory allocation through a C++ Standard Template Library-style vector library call, (ii) memory transfers between the host and Graphics Processing Unit coprocessor through an overloaded assignment operator, and (iii) execution of an offloaded routine through a generic transform library call instead of a CUDA kernel routine all performed either equal to or worse than CUDA.",

    "abstract": "As in other STEM disciplines, early computing courses tend to stress individual assignments and discourage collaboration. This can lead to negative learning experiences that compel some students to give up. According to social learning theory, one way to improve students’ learning experiences is to help them form and participate actively in vibrant social learning communities. Building on social learning theory, we have designed a set of software interventions (scaffolds and prompts) that leverage automatically collected learning process data to promote increased social interactions and better learning outcomes in individual programming assignments, which are a key component of early undergraduate computing courses. In an empirical study, we found that students’ interaction with the interventions was correlated with increased social activity, improved attitudes toward peer learning, more closely coupled social networks, and higher performance on programming assignments. Our work contributes a theoretically motivated technological design for social programming interventions; an understanding of computing students’ willingness to interact with the interventions; and insights into how students’ interactions with the interventions are associated with their social behaviors, attitudes, connectedness with others in the class, and their course outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The computer input/output (I/O) subsystem and its functioning are very abstract concepts that are difficult for undergraduate freshmen to understand. However, it is important that freshmen assimilate these low-level concepts if they are going to be taught about the operating systems (OS) working over that architecture layer, or working directly with them in embedded systems, real-time systems, or in the area of human--computer interaction (HCI). This article describes the use of a game console (Nintendo® DS, NDS) in a project-based learning (PBL or PjBL) environment in which the design of a game is the basis of the project in order to encourage the students to get more involved with the computer I/O subsystem abstraction. A 4yr experience is reported in which the action research model (planning, acting, observing, and reflecting) has been followed. The general procedure for the 4yr and the specific characteristics and achieved results for each year are reported. The aim of the study was twofold: to assess the learning effectiveness of the active PjBL educational approach and some related factors, and to analyze the motivation toward the subject fostered by the game console. The first aim is analyzed using the scores achieved by the students; the second aim is analyzed via satisfaction questionnaires.",

    "abstract": "In this NSF CSforALL funded research study, the authors sought to understand the extent to which an urban district's teacher instructional support network enabled or constrained capacity to implement and diffuse Digital Literacy and Computer Science (DLCS) instructional practices throughout the K-12 curriculum. Social network analysis was used to investigate informal teacher advice-seeking and advice-giving patterns of DLCS support. Network measures of cohesion and centrality were computed. Findings revealed that DLCS-focused teacher support networks tend to exhibit very low density, have relatively few ties, include a high number of isolates (teachers with no connections), and centralize around a particular actor. In addition, a low level of overlap was found between DLCS networks and primary instructional networks. Overall, study findings suggest that teacher networks are not well-structured to support the flow of DLCS advice and support. The authors conclude that examining and strengthening teacher networks of instructional support may be a crucial step for educational leaders concerned with school improvement and the diffusion of DLCS curricula in US schools.",

In particular, the article presents the detailed design and implementation of one digital hardware design laboratory, called Gateway, which introduces students to synchronous digital circuit development from high level functional specifications, uses Verilog for hardware description and FPGAs as an implementation platform. Biggs’ theory of constructive alignment was applied in the design of this lab’s learning outcomes, lab content, teaching and learning methods, and assessment methods. The lab makes extensive use of multimedia in both lab content delivery and demonstration applications developed by students.

    "abstract": "Students in all areas of computing require knowledge of the computing device including software implementation at the machine level. Several courses in computer science curricula address these low-level details such as computer architecture and assembly languages. For such courses, there are advantages to studying real architectures instead of simplified examples. However, real architectures and instruction sets introduce complexity that makes them difficult to grasp in a single semester course. Visualization techniques can help ease this burden, unfortunately existing tools are often difficult to use and consequently difficult to adopt in a course where time is already limited. To solve this problem, we present Frances. Frances graphically illustrates key differences between familiar high-level languages and unfamiliar low-level languages and also illustrates how familiar high-level programs behave on real architectures. Key to this tool is that we use a simple Web interface that requires no setup, easing course adoption hurdles. We also include several features that further enhance its usefulness in a classroom setting. These features include graphical relationships between high-level code and machine code, clearly illustrated step-by-step machine state transitions, color coding to make instruction behavior clear, and illustration of pointers. We have used Frances in courses and performed experimental evaluation. Our experiences with Frances in the classroom demonstrate its usability. Most notably, in our experimental setting, students with no computer architecture course experience were able to complete lessons using Frances with no guidance.",

    "abstract": "Assessment plays an important role in education and can both guide and motivate learning. Assessment can, however, be carried out with different aims: providing the students with feedback that supports the learning (formative assessment) and judging to which degree the students have fulfilled the intended learning outcomes (summative assessment). In this study, we explore the instructors’ perspective on assessment within the context of introductory programming courses offered to non-computer-science majors at a public tuition-free state-funded university in a Nordic country. These courses are given to a large number of students and also employ several teaching assistants (TAs). We used constructivism as a basis for our study and investigated how instructors implement formative and summative assessments, how they view their role, and what expectations they have of their TAs in these assessments. We interviewed seven course coordinators (main instructors for introductory programming courses with additional administrative duties but without formal responsibility of the grading) and analyzed 205 course artifacts, such as syllabi, lab assignment instructions, and course material from the cross-department TA training course. The results showed that course coordinators use formative and summative assessments both separately and within the same activity. They view themselves as responsible for the assessments, as the planners and material developers, as the organizers and administrators, and as monitors of the assessments. However, the results also showed that these course coordinators delegate much of the responsibility for the assessments to their TAs and expect TAs to both grade the students and provide them with feedback and guidance. In addition, the TAs are also expected to act as informants about their students’ performance. The course coordinators’ role entails many different aspects, where communicating through instructions to both students and TAs is essential. We see that this implementation of assessment, with lots of responsibility distributed to the TAs, could be difficult to manage for a single faculty member who is not necessarily responsible for the grading. Based on the results, we outline some recommendations, such as offering TA training.",

This study was conducted in the context of an ongoing research practice partnership aimed at integrating computer science concepts in elementary grades. Our work took place in a public school district that enrolls primarily students of color, while largely employing White teachers and administrators. Using a racial literacy framework [Guinier 2004 ], we conceptualized a continuum and developed codes to analyze teachers’ responses from racially liberal to racially literate. Our results describe a range of positions across the continuum, including those consistent with the racial liberalism viewpoint that expresses individualistic views of meritocracy and colorblindness that sometimes supports a deficit view of students, those that reside in the middle who validate equity work through minimal acknowledgment yet find ways to resist further engagement with race or equity, and those who express views consistent with racial literacy practices including student-centered perspectives, asset-orientations, and the willingness to engage race directly. Further, our results indicate that teachers may express contradictory views or views across the continuum. These findings point to the developmental nature of racial literacy and the difficulty of unlearning racist mindsets. We discuss the efficacy of our case study design: anonymized, locally derived vignettes, and our case study learning activity design: written reflections, small group dialogues, and whole group share-outs in supporting teacher reflection and learning. Finally, we demonstrate the special leadership role of teachers who are moving toward racial literacy.",

    "abstract": "Instrument development is an important step towards unlocking the analytical power of teacher attitudes and beliefs towards Computer Science (CS). Teacher dispositions have strong empirical and theoretical ties to teacher motivation, professional choices, and classroom practices. To determine consensus desirable attitudes and beliefs, we analyzed 17 key documents produced by 12 national and international organizations associated with CS and the CS education reform movement. An analysis of 98 relevant coded segments yielded four dispositional targets: an equity orientation, a teacher growth mindset, and key beliefs regarding (career) outcomes and epistemology of CS. Statements crafted for these targets as well as self-efficacy were reviewed through an expert panel (N = 5) and a pilot study (N = 22) before the T-ABC was administered to elementary teachers in a large grant-funded outreach project (N = 772). Psychometric analysis demonstrates high reliability (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.89) and satisfactory extraction and loading onto a three factor model, with CS beliefs, growth mindset, and self-efficacy as major factors. Identification and measurements of teacher dispositions enables further analysis of how teacher beliefs may support or hinder effective practice in CS instruction, how teacher populations may differ, and how identified dispositions may change with exposure to various CS learning experiences.",

In this explanatory sequential mixed-methods study, we investigated demographic characteristics among a sample of undergraduate students pursuing interdisciplinary computing major and minor combinations at 15 institutions in the United States who completed a survey at the end of their introductory course. Descriptive analyses of responses to this survey of introductory computing students revealed that enrollment in interdisciplinary major and minor combinations was limited and did not appear to disproportionately attract women or Black/African American, Latine, Indigenous, and/or Multiracial students. We then conducted a directed content analysis of departmental websites to examine the language and policies that may have precluded or encouraged students to pursue interdisciplinary computing major and minor combinations. Findings revealed that departmental offerings of such programs were limited, and, among those that did offer such programs, communication about their goals and requirements was often lacking. Implications for research and practice, especially as they pertain to efforts to broaden participation in computing, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Currently, there is little evidence about how non-English-speaking students learn computer programming. For example, there are few validated assessment instruments to measure the development of programming skills, especially for the Spanish-speaking population. Having valid assessment instruments is essential to identify the difficulties of the students, make formative decisions, and evaluate the impact of pedagogical interventions. This article presents the outcomes of the early steps toward a validation in Spanish of the SCS1 assessment, derived from the first conceptual inventory to measure programming knowledge decoupled from a particular language. The goal of this initial step is twofold: (1) identifying the questions that are too difficult in this version and might need to be adapted based on empirical evidence of how students answer them and (2) identifying students’ common difficulties with the most challenging questions. This study started with a “think-aloud” protocol to validate whether the Spanish version was similar to the original instrument and if the students understood the translation as intended. Then, the instrument was applied to a sample of 71 university students who had previously taken an introductory programming course using Python. We computed the difficulty index for each question and identified students’ difficulties in answering them. We also propose potential improvements for these items. The main contributions of this study include (1) progress toward the validation of an instrument for evaluating programming skills in Spanish, (2) noting the advantage that experienced students in Python have to complete the instrument, (3) identifying the tendency of students to translate the pseudo-code from Spanish into English, and (4) the identification of common mistakes, like misunderstanding the scope of local variables or the confusion between returning and printing.",

    "abstract": "Programming skills are increasingly important to the current digital economy, yet these skills have long been regarded as challenging to acquire. A central challenge in learning programming skills involves the simultaneous use of multiple component skills. This article investigates why students struggle with integrating component skills—a challenge called the composition effect. This effect was first studied in learning mathematics, and findings in that area have led to more effective instruction in mathematics. In the current work, we systematically investigate the nature of the composition effect in novice code tracing through a classroom study in a university-level introductory programming course. We designed a set of problems that require integrating component skills, along with matched problems that use the same component skills separately. The composition effect was defined as the performance difference between these two types of problems. We further singled out errors that were committed in integration problems but not in the matched problems and conducted qualitative coding to categorize these errors. Statistical analyses produced three main findings. First, we found a robust composition effect across problems and students, mostly with small or medium effect sizes. Second, we identified two potential sources of errors for this composition effect: conceptual misunderstandings of how to integrate component skills and process errors resulting from slips related to cognitive load challenges. In particular, additional conceptual knowledge often appears to be needed when component skills are integrated in specific ways. Moreover, the primary source appears to be misunderstandings of how skills integrate. Composition effects may not generalize across topics, which suggests that domain topics may serve as the conceptual basis for the composition effect. Third, we found stable individual differences in susceptibility to the composition effect in both overall and finer-grained levels. Our findings provide implications for building theories that may generally explain challenges in learning complex skills and may result in practical designs for skill integration enhanced curricula and instruction to foster student mastery in computing education.",

    "abstract": "Objectives . The increasing demand for computing skills has led to a rapid rise in the development of new computer science (CS) curricula, many with the goal of equitably broadening the participation of underrepresented students in CS. While such initiatives are vital, factors outside of the school environment also play a role in influencing students’ interests. In this article, we examined the effects of students’ perceived parental support on their interest in computer programming and explored the mechanisms through which this effect may have been established as students participated in an introductory CS instructional unit. Participants . This instructional unit was implemented with upper primary (grade 5) school students and was designed to broaden trajectories for participation in CS. The participants in the current study ( N \\(=\\) 170) came from six classrooms in two rural schools in the western United States. Study Method . The seven-week instructional unit began with students playing a commercial CS tabletop board game that highlighted fundamental programming concepts and transitioned to having students create their own board game levels in the block-based programming language, Scratch. Further, because the board game could be taken home, the instructional unit offered opportunities to involve the family in school-based CS activities. To investigate the effect of students’ perception of parental (specifically father and mother) support on their interest in and self-efficacy to pursue CS, we surveyed students before and after the unit’s implementations and explored the structural relationship of the data using structural equation modeling. Results . We present three findings. First, the combined effect of students’ perceived mother’s and father’s support measured prior to the implementation (pre-survey) predicted students’ self-efficacy (Standardized Estimate ( \\({\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\) ) \\(=\\) 0.37, standard error \\(=\\) 0.010, p \\( \\lt \\) .001) and interest in computer programming (Standardized Estimate ( \\({\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\) ) \\(=\\) 0.328, standard error \\(=\\) 0.134, p \\( \\lt \\) .003) measured after the implementation (post-survey). Secondly, the combined effect of perceived mother and father support (Standardized Estimate ( \\({\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}\\) ) \\(=\\) 0.132, 95% CI [0.039, 0.399], 99% CI [0.017, 0.542]) on students’ interest was mediated by whether or not they took the CS board game home. Conclusions . Our findings indicate that perceived parental support has the potential to play an important role in students’ self-efficacy and interest in computer programming and that providing opportunities for students to bring CS artifacts home has the potential to further affect students’ interest in computer programming.",

    "abstract": "Notional machines have figured historically in many discussions in computing education. Under a common view in the computing education literature based in classical cognitive science, notional machines play a critical pedagogical role when they are brought into a student’s mind as mental models. A mental model simplifies the phenomenon that it models, and is correct to the extent that it corresponds to the modeled phenomenon. Such mental models of the notional machine are viewed as necessary for the student to program computers. In this paper, I argue that this classical cognitive science view overlooks two key aspects of human cognition that are brought to the forefront in “second generation” cognitive science and recent philosophy of knowledge and language. The first is the importance of embodied perception and action to ground the meaning of language and thought. In particular, models are representational not only due to their simplification and correspondence to what they model, but also require embodied representational practices by which these correspondences are constituted. The second concerns the way that these embodied practices can be sufficiently educated so that they withdraw into an unnoticed background so that reflective reasoning is not always required for skilled action. This paper thus advocates a shift in pedagogical attention from the inner aspect of student mentality to the external aspect of embodied interaction between student and notional machine. This leads to a focus on the background practices by which notional machines are intelligible as models of computation, and explicitly teaching these practices so that students can better leverage the benefits of notional machines to learn how to program a computer.",

    "abstract": "Objectives : Faculty new to teaching operating systems or those looking to refresh their course need to understand the state of the art in operating system education. Toward this goal, we conducted a survey of operating system instructors to understand how they approach teaching the course and what textbook and software platforms they use in their classrooms. We also conducted a literature review examining two decades of papers focused on teaching operating systems to undergraduates. Survey : We surveyed people who teach operating systems at the undergraduate level to determine which textbook they use, on which software they base projects, and how they approach teaching the course. Literature Review : We searched the ACM Digital Library for publications focused on undergraduate education about operating systems. We selected a total of 51 papers. For each selected paper, we identified which approach (i.e., concrete vs. abstract) and perspective (i.e., internal or external) on teaching operating systems the authors used, which Curriculum 2023 topics they covered, and on what type of system (e.g., educational, production, research) their projects were based. We also looked at the evaluation of the methods and the impact these papers have had on the field. Findings: Instructors teaching operating systems tend to balance both their approach and their perspective, with a slight leaning toward an internal perspective, whereas authors supporting operating system education overwhelmingly support an internal, concrete approach to the course. In addition, authors also tend to focus on a few key topics, including System Calls and Processes, Concurrency, Scheduling, Virtual Memory, File Systems API and Implementation, and Performance Evaluation. Conclusions : This work will help faculty teaching operating systems to consider which approach and perspective they wish to take in their course and to find the resources most relevant to their preferred approach and perspective. It can also help focus future research in the area of operating system education, to align it better with current practices.",

It is an active learning approach combining physical interaction with visual representation. This research paper investigates the impact of CS Unplugged on students’ understanding of the bubble sort algorithm. Algorithm visualization, traditionally employed for active knowledge construction, serves as the foundation for this approach. The research was conducted as a quasi-experiment in middle and high schools in Split, Croatia, among 204 students. We divided the participants into two groups: experimental (CS Unplugged) and control (traditional teaching). The study included pre-test, mid-test, and post-test assessments. While CS Unplugged did not significantly affect students’ understanding of bubble sort, it positively influenced long-term retention of the algorithm. These results highlight the potential of CS Unplugged activities as an effective teaching approach for computer science concepts, specifically in promoting long-term retention of the bubble sort algorithm. The study also revealed misconceptions that included restarting comparisons after each swap, assuming the largest element reaches the end after one swap, and repeatedly swapping the largest element with its neighbor. Addressing these misconceptions through active learning activities like CS Unplugged can contribute to deeper understanding beyond memorization.",

    "abstract": "Objectives : Limited research exists on how new computer science (CS) teachers understand fundamental Internet principles. This knowledge gap hinders the development of effective upskilling courses, especially as new CS curricula are being introduced worldwide. This study investigates new CS teachers’ conceptions of fundamental Internet principles, compares them with children’s understanding, and examines the relationship between teachers’ Internet knowledge and their knowledge of basic digital trace topics. Study Methods : A convergent mixed-methods approach was used, involving semi-structured interviews and drawing tasks with 50 new CS teachers. Data from a separate sample of 165 children (Grades 4, 6, 8) were included for comparison. A thematic analysis and frequency analysis of interview transcripts were conducted. Findings : Most new CS teachers recognized the Internet as a global network but had varied and often unstable conceptions about data storage and transfer. Compared to children, teachers demonstrated a more advanced understanding but still exhibited substantial knowledge gaps. There was no significant correlation between understanding Internet principles and basic digital trace topics, though a moderate relationship was found regarding news feed personalization. Conclusions : The study highlights the need for targeted interventions to improve new CS teachers’ understanding of Internet principles, especially the invisible aspects, such as data storage and transfer mechanisms. By providing new data on a rarely studied group, this study contributes to both CS education and broader fields like developmental psychology and conceptual change, offering insights into the developmental trajectories of Internet comprehension and the integration of everyday and scientific knowledge.",

Unified Modeling Language (UML) is the industry standard for software modeling. however, it is often used incorrectly and misunderstood by novice software designers.

The participants of this study (n = 97) belonged to a systems analysis and design course that is primarily taken by second-year university students. The exam solutions to a case study from the course were evaluated for modeling proficiency. As evidence of proficiency in abstract thinking and systems thinking, we evaluated UML activity diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams and the alignment between these representations in terms of functions, structures, and behaviors. The results suggest students being proficient in modeling the functional aspects of an information system while facing some difficulty in capturing the structural and behavioral aspects of an information system. Clustering analysis revealed two groups within the sample, with one group displaying a significantly higher abstraction and systems thinking ability.

    "abstract": "Nearly all software built today impinges upon end-user privacy and needs to comply with relevant regulations. Therefore, there have been increasing calls for integrating considerations of compliance with privacy regulations throughout the software engineering lifecycle. However, software engineers are typically trained in the technical fields and lack sufficient knowledge and support for sociotechnical considerations of privacy. Privacy ideation cards attempt to address this issue by making privacy compliance understandable and actionable for software developers. However, the application of privacy ideation cards in real-world software projects has not yet been systemically investigated. The effectiveness of ideation cards as a pedagogical tool has not yet been examined either. We address these gaps by studying how teams of undergraduate students applied privacy ideation cards in capstone projects that involved building real-world software for industry sponsors. We found that privacy ideation cards fostered greater consideration and understanding of the extent to which the projects aligned with privacy regulations. We identified three main themes from student discussions of privacy compliance: (i) defining personal data; (ii) assigning responsibility for privacy compliance; and (iii) determining and exercising autonomy. The results suggest that application of the cards for real-world projects requires careful consideration of intersecting factors such as the stage at which the cards are used and the autonomy available to the developers. Pedagogically, ideation cards can facilitate low-level cognitive engagement (especially the cognitive processes of meaning construction and interpretation) for specific components within a project. Higher-level cognitive processes were comparatively rare in ideation sessions. These findings provide important insight to help enhance capstone instruction and to improve privacy ideation cards to increase their impact on the privacy properties of the developed software.",

    "abstract": "As technology and curricula continue to evolve and develop, the prevalence and effectiveness of continuing professional development (CPD) opportunities for computer science teachers is becoming increasingly more important. However, key questions remain about what the characteristics are for effective CPD in this context. Through the presentation of existing literature and the qualitative analysis of interviews with 32 employees from 13 English colleges (n = 14 computer science lecturers, 10 course leaders, and 8 members of senior leadership) this article answers the following question: ‘What are the characteristics of effective continuing professional development for computer science teachers in the 16-18 sector?’ Existing literature indicates how CPD benefits from: (1) knowledge development and application to classroom teaching, (2) self-efficacy development and measurement, (3) observation, feedback and reflection, (4) collaboration and communities of practice, (5) sufficient time, and (6) institution support. Meanwhile, the thematic analysis of interview data led to the creation of five overarching themes: (1) computer science CPD should address various knowledge domains, (2) CPD requires institutional support, (3) CPD should be engaging, (4) computer science CPD should involve a combination of activities, and (5) CPD should be measurable. This qualitative article also presents interview excerpts and contributes to computing education research and practice by presenting a set of thirty guidelines which outlines the characteristics of effective CPD in the context of computer science teachers in the 16-18 sector. These guidelines could be beneficial for both CPD providers and educators in ensuring CPD opportunities are designed more effectively, and with an understanding of both parties’ needs.",

Research results from the implementation of this curriculum will be presented to demonstrate the nature of teachers’ experiences with the curriculum. Participants. Participants are teachers implementing the new curriculum at two schools in the metro Atlanta area. Study Method. This paper is partly descriptive, presenting the theory underlying the newly developed curriculum as well as its various features. An organizing framework, the Teacher Accessibility, Equity, and Content (TEC) rubric from Weintrop et al. (2019) [ 1 ], is used to structure the curriculum description. Teacher perceptions were gathered via both structured interviews and short online enactment surveys. These perceptions are summarized and presented thematically, corresponding to the features of the curriculum. Findings. A newly developed introductory computer science (CS) curriculum, Student-Centered Computing (SCC), utilizes project-based learning (PBL) and culturally authentic practices (CAPs) to help promote a sense of belonging and intent to persist within computer science among all students. Teachers successfully implemented the curriculum and generally found it to be beneficial for their students, though they struggled with some of the pedagogical demands of project-based learning as well as some of the most advanced technical content associated with the music coding and app development platforms. Conclusions. This paper provides a detailed overview of a year-long introductory computer science curriculum focused on the creation of culturally relevant digital artifacts. The curriculum represents a strong effort to make CS content relevant and appealing to the full range of students by relating it to their lives and experiences. Teacher surveys and interviews revealed that both teachers and students had positive views of the course. However, teaching using inclusive PBL pedagogy and culturally authentic practices takes skill and practice by teachers, supporting the need for CS teachers to have good pedagogical training as well as a strong knowledge of computer science to create a classroom environment that promotes success for all students.",

    "abstract": "Objectives. Communication skills are crucial for effective software development teams, but those skills are difficult to teach. The goal of our project is to evaluate the effectiveness of teaching face-to-face communication skills using AVW-Space, a platform for video-based learning that provides personalized nudges to support student's engagement during video watching. Participants. The participants in our study are second-year software engineering students. The study was conducted over three years, with students enrolled in a semester-long project course. Study Method. We performed a quasi-experimental study over three years to teach face-to-face communication using AVW-Space, a video-based learning platform. We present the instance of AVW-Space we developed to teach face-to-face communication. Participants watched and commented on 10 videos and later commented on the recording of their own team meeting. In 2020, the participants ( n = 50) did not receive nudges, and we use the data collected that year as control. In 2021 ( n = 49) and 2022 ( n = 48), nudges were provided adaptively to encourage students to write more and higher-quality comments. Findings. The findings from the study show the effectiveness of nudges. We found significant differences in engagement when nudges were provided. Furthermore, there is a causal effect of nudges on the interaction time, the total number of comments written, and the number of high-quality comments, as well as on learning. Finally, participants exposed to nudges reported higher perceived learning. Conclusions. Our research shows the effect of nudges on student engagement and learning while using the instance of AVW-Space for teaching face-to-face communication skills. Future work will explore other soft skills, as well as providing explanations for the decisions made by AVW-Space.",

This online serious game aims at introducing Python programming to K–12 students while easing the transition from block-based to text-based languages. After we present the various aspects underlying the block-to-text transition as well as the related existing applications, we describe the design of Pyrates . First, we built the levels of the game to deal with the different fundamental concepts of programming in a constructivist approach. Next, we were inspired by advantageous characteristics of block-based programming editors to create the editing environment of Pyrates . To assess this conception, we tested the application in eight classrooms with 240 French 14–15 years old students. Students’ activity traces have been collected and were augmented by a qualitative online survey. By analyzing this dataset, we showed that the levels’ design generally allows to apprehend the targeted concepts consistently with the constructivist principles. Regarding the editing environment, we established that it supports the block-to-text transition in several aspects: concept transposition (general models and illustrative examples), reduction of errors (beginners aware syntax analyzer), command catalog (programming memo for discovery and syntax reference), and program composition (copy button that limits keyboarding). Finally, Pyrates , which has already been played over 140,000 times, offers practitioners an environment that facilitates the transition from blocks to text, as well as a serious game to master the fundamental concepts of Python programming, and novel avenues to follow for tool designers.",

We introduce the idea of informatively easy or hard concepts. Our approach is different from more traditional analyses of problem difficulty such as item analysis in the sense that we consider Pareto dominance relationships within the multidimensional structure of student–problem performance data rather than average performance measures. This method allows us to uncover not just the problems on which students are struggling but also the variety of difficulties different students face. Our approach is to apply methods from the Dimension Extraction Coevolutionary Algorithm to analyze problem-solving logs of students generated when they use an online software tutoring suite for introductory computer programming called problets . The results of our analysis not only have implications for how to scale up and improve adaptive tutoring software but also have the promise of contributing to the identification of common misconceptions held by students and thus, eventually, to the construction of a concept inventory for introductory programming.",

    "abstract": "Research Problem. Computer science (CS) education researchers conducting studies that target high school students have likely seen their studies impacted by COVID-19. Interpreting research findings impacted by COVID-19 presents unique challenges that will require a deeper understanding as to how the pandemic has affected underserved and underrepresented students studying or unable to study computing. Research Question. Our research question for this study was: In what ways has the high school computer science educational ecosystem for students been impacted by COVID-19, particularly when comparing schools based on relative socioeconomic status of a majority of students? Methodology. We used an exploratory sequential mixed methods study to understand the types of impacts high school CS educators have seen in their practice over the past year using the CAPE theoretical dissaggregation framework to measure schools’ Capacity to offer CS, student Access to CS education, student Participation in CS, and Experiences of students taking CS. Data Collection Procedure. We developed an instrument to collect qualitative data from open-ended questions, then collected data from CS high school educators ( n = 21) and coded them across CAPE. We used the codes to create a quantitative instrument. We collected data from a wider set of CS high school educators ( n = 185), analyzed the data, and considered how these findings shape research conducted over the last year. Findings. Overall, practitioner perspectives revealed that capacity for CS Funding, Policy &amp; Curriculum in both types of schools grew during the pandemic, while the capacity to offer physical and human resources decreased. While access to extracurricular activities decreased, there was still a significant increase in the number of CS courses offered. Fewer girls took CS courses and attendance decreased. Student learning and engagement in CS courses were significantly impacted, while other noncognitive factors like interest in CS and relevance of technology saw increases. Practitioner perspectives also indicated that schools serving students from lower-income families had (1) a greater decrease in the number of students who received information about CS/CTE pathways; (2) a greater decrease in the number of girls enrolled in CS classes; (3) a greater decrease in the number of students receiving college credit for dual-credit CS courses; (4) a greater decrease in student attendance; and (5) a greater decrease in the number of students interested in taking additional CS courses. On the flip-side, schools serving students from higher income families had significantly higher increases in the number of students interested in taking additional CS courses.",

We asked students from introductory programming courses to perform a simple code-writing task that required constructing references to objects and their attributes. By experimentally manipulating the nature of the attributes in the tasks, from identifying attributes (e.g., title or label ) to descriptive attributes (e.g., calories or texture ), the study revealed the relative frequencies with which students mistakenly omit the name of an identifying attribute while attempting to reference its value. We explain how these reference-point shifts are consistent with the use of metonymy, a form of figurative expression in human communication. Our analysis also reveals how the presentation of examples can affect the construction of the reference in the student’s solution. We discuss plausible accounts of the reference-point errors and how they may inform a model of reference construction. We suggest that reference-point errors may be the result of well-practiced habits of communication rather than misconceptions of the task or what the computer can do.",

    "abstract": "It is common to think of learning as the acquisition of knowledge by an individual learner. Starting a century ago, Lev Vygotsky developed a different perspective on learning, initiating a tradition of educational research whose momentum and influence continue to grow. One of Vygotsky's key principles is the general genetic law of cultural development that states that whatever skilled cognition that individuals carry out within their own minds is preceded by homologous activity carried out by a social group of which this individual was a part. In linking the individual and society through this law, learning is not simply a matter of the acquisition of domain knowledge. Rather, it is a cyclic process by which a social group, in its functioning through joint activity, leads to individuals taking into themselves (i.e., internalizing ) the social forms of activity. In this article, our goal is to explicate Vygotsky's genetic law and demonstrate its utility for yielding novel insight into computing education. We provide an extended illustration of the use of Vygotsky's law in examining a teacher and students in a university setting write code together during a class session. What our analysis reveals is that the teacher and students together enact a sequential, rule-based, and dialogical process of problem decomposition and code writing far different from the plan and schema-based models for programming that have emerged from prior research focused on the individual student and their cognitive strategies and structures. We provide commentary on implications of the genetic law for both research and practice in computing education.",

    "abstract": "Enabling students to recognize and evaluate the ubiquitous impact of computing technology on society is an internationally proclaimed goal of a K-12 computing education. To that end, students need to actually engage with their computing knowledge in concrete everyday situations. From the perspectives of learning transfer and variation theory, we conducted three iterations of a classroom intervention and qualitatively analyzed students’ learning processes. As a result, we propose a model of four so-called critical aspects of everyday computing technology in that context. We present various classroom situations and learning experiences in relation to those aspects, and discuss what seems to have enabled or prevented meaningful learning. In particular, we found that several students had difficulties in conceiving of computing technology as simultaneously economical and powerful, thus limiting its potential ubiquity. We discuss our findings in the context of contemporary theories of learning transfer and argue that they suggest specific issues that may seriously inhibit students to appropriately engage with their computing knowledge in the context of everyday technologies.",

These complexities have implications for computer science education as ubiquitous multi-core computers drive the need for programmers to understand parallelism. One major obstacle to student learning of parallel programming is that there is very little human factors evidence comparing the different techniques to one another, so there is no clear direction on which techniques should be taught and how. We performed a randomized controlled trial using 88 university-level computer science student participants performing three identical tasks to examine the question of whether or not there are measurable differences in programming performance between two paradigms for concurrent programming: threads compared to process-oriented programming based on Communicating Sequential Processes. We measured both time on task and programming accuracy using an automated token accuracy map (TAM) technique. Our results showed trade-offs between the paradigms using both metrics and the TAMs provided further insight about specific areas of difficulty in comprehension.",

In this article, we explore a central (and perhaps counterintuitive) design principle identified by a group of K–12 computer science teachers who support student-directed projects in their classrooms: in order for students to develop their own ideas and determine how to pursue them, students must have opportunities to engage with other students’ work. In this qualitative study, we investigated the instructional practices of 25 K–12 teachers using a series of in-depth, semi-structured interviews to develop understandings of how they used peer work to support student-directed projects in their classrooms. Teachers described supporting their students in navigating three stages of project development: generating ideas, pursuing ideas, and presenting ideas. For each of these three stages, teachers considered multiple factors to encourage engagement with peer work in their classrooms, including the quality and completeness of shared work and the modes of interaction with the work. We discuss how this pedagogical approach offers students new relationships to their own learning, to their peers, and to their teachers and communicates important messages to students about their own competence and agency, potentially contributing to aims within computer science for broadening participation.",

To improve their knowledge about programming, many different types of professional development programs have been proposed. Nevertheless, these programs mostly focus on technical skills and less on pedagogical skills. One aspect that is often overlooked in these programs is how teachers can assess code. To get insight into what teachers currently value when assessing code, we designed an experiment that analyzes the different aspects teachers consider during the assessment of code. During the experiment, the teachers (N=13) assess a set of programs from five different fictional learners. After the assessment, they participated in a semi-structured interview, giving us insight into the assessment process. We evaluated the transcripts of the interviews using deductive thematic analysis using a coding schema defining the different aspects of code that can be assessed. Additionally, we linked the assessment strategies of teachers to their teaching experience. Our results indicate that many teachers are unaware of the different concepts that can be part of the assessment of code, which might lead to inaccurate or invalid feedback. Moreover, although our experimental group was too small to draw hard conclusions about the inter-case results, our results indicate that the number of concepts considered by teachers seems to increase with experience. These results provide an initial insight into the code assessment practices of teachers and reveals interesting pathways for future research into the assessment of code.",

    "abstract": "Modeling is an integral part of many computing-related disciplines and thus also represents a curricular core component in computing education in tertiary education. Competence models in which modeling is integrated at least to some extent already exist in some of these disciplines. However, for the core component of graphical modeling, a competence model that illuminates the relevant competences in detail is still lacking. Therefore, we develop a competence model for graphical modeling with the aim to make teaching and especially assessments in the field more competence-oriented. This article reports on the first two studies conducted to develop and validate the competence model for graphical modeling. In the first study, the structure of the competence model was developed based on theories and approaches of educational science. Competences relevant for graphical modeling were deductively derived from literature and existing university course descriptions using techniques of qualitative content analysis. The result of the first study is a preliminary competence model. In the second study, the preliminary competence model was reviewed by means of an expert rating in the modeling community. The competence model was revised and refined based on these findings and subsequent expert discussions. The main result of the investigation represents the competence model for graphical modeling, which includes a total of 74 competence facets at different cognitive process levels in the five content areas of “model understanding and interpreting,” “model building and modifying,” “values, attitudes, and beliefs,” “metacognitive knowledge and skills,” and “social-communicative skills.”",

    "abstract": "There is increasing interest in computer science and computing bachelor programs due to the growing importance of technology in the globalized world. Thus, as higher education institutions strive to serve a diverse student demographic, it is salient to gauge their programming abilities to improve guidance on learning processes regarding their initial knowledge state. Despite the availability of certain instruments to measure student programming skills, these are traditionally aimed at younger populations and do not accurately discriminate the different levels of ability among university students. This article introduces a translation into Spanish and validation of an existing English-language aptitude test for computing jobs that can be used to measure the programming abilities of students with no prior experience in the field. Following a cyclic research methodology, two iterations were carried out in this article. First, the aforementioned test was translated and validated via expert judgment and focus groups, in which certain items were removed subsequent to a quantitative analysis. The resultant instrument underwent a second validation using a larger population of students. Analysis conducted after the second iteration showed this instrument to deliver good internal consistency, good difficulty and discrimination indices, and a moderate correlation with the grades of the midterm exam of a programming course undertaken by first year engineering students. This work contributes to both increasing the number of tests available in the Spanish language with which to assess programming abilities, as well as to the broader literature regarding test adaptation, translation and validation.",

    "abstract": "Objectives . Automatic assessment systems are widely used to provide rapid feedback for students and reduce grading time. Despite the benefits of increased efficiency and improved pedagogical outcomes, an ongoing challenge is mitigating poor student behaviors when interacting with automatic assessment systems including numerous submissions, trial-and-error, and relying on marking feedback for problem solving. These behaviors negatively affect student learning as well as have significant impact on system resources. This research quantitatively examines how utilizing submission policies such as limiting the number of submissions and applying regression penalties can reduce negative student behaviors. The hypothesis is that both submission policies will have a significant impact on student behavior and reduce both the number of submissions and regressions in student performance. The research questions evaluate the impact on student behavior, determine which submission policy is the most effective, and what submission policy is preferred by students. Participants . The study involved two course sections in two different semesters consisting of a total of 224 students at the University of British Columbia, a research-intensive university. The students were evaluated using an automated assessment system in a large third year database course. Study Methods . The two course sections used an automated assessment system for constructing database design diagrams for assignments and exams. The first section had no limits on the number of submissions for both assignments and exams. The second section had limits for the exams but no limits on assignments. On the midterm, participants were randomly assigned to have either a restriction on the total number of submissions or unlimited submissions but with regression penalties if a graded answer was lower than a previous submission. On the final exam, students were given the option of selecting their submission policy. Student academic performance and submission profiles were compared between the course sections and the different submission policies. Findings. Unrestricted use of automatic grading systems results in high occurrence of undesirable student behavior including trial-and-error guessing and reduced time between submissions without sufficient independent thought. Both submission policies of limiting maximum submissions and utilizing regression penalties significantly reduce these behaviors by up to 85%. Overall, students prefer maximum submission limits, and demonstrate improved behavior and educational outcomes. Conclusions . Automated assessment systems when used for larger problems related to design and programming have benefits when deployed with submission restrictions (maximum attempts or regression penalty) for both improved student learning behaviors and to reduce the computational costs for the system. This is especially important for summative assessment but reasonable limits for formative assessments are also valuable.",

We ran a unidimensional IRT, differential item functioning (DIF), a two-way ANOVA, and the Kruskal-Wallis H test. Despite the valid instrument, we found it inappropriate as is for international comparison studies because students from different countries interpreted some items differently. We then compared gender-based differences in CS attitudes across countries. The results revealed no significant differences between males and females in the Indonesian middle school data, whereas male students had significantly higher CS attitudes than female students in both American and Korean student data. Furthermore, we found the same pattern in gender differences in Korean and Indonesian high school students’ CS attitudes scores as in the middle school study.

    "abstract": "Digital competence (DC) is a broad set of skills, attitudes, and knowledge for confident, critical, and responsible use of digital technologies in every aspect of life. DC proves essential in the contemporary digital landscape, yet its diffusion is hindered by biases, misunderstandings, and limited awareness. Teaching Informatics in the educational curriculum is increasingly supported by the institutions but faces serious challenges, such as teacher upskilling and support. In response, grassroots movements promoting computing literacy in an informal setting have grown, including EU Code Week, whose vision is to develop computing skills while promoting diversity and raising awareness of the importance of digital skills. This study extensively analyses EU Code Week editions spanning 2014 to 2021 across European Union member states, pursuing three primary objectives: firstly, to evaluate teacher engagement in the campaign in terms of penetration, retention, and spatial distribution; secondly, to characterise the multifaceted audience and themes embraced by these initiatives; and, lastly, to investigate the influence of socio-economic factors on engagement. The investigation uncovers the underlying mechanisms fostering Code Week’s engagement, providing insights to campaign organisers for strategic planning and resource allocation in future editions. Moreover, the analysis reveals that the most engaged areas are characterised by lower income as well as lower digital literacy, restricted access to technology, and a less established computer education, suggesting that Code Week thrives precisely where its impact is most needed.",

    "abstract": "Objectives. At the K–12 level, “CS for All” initiatives across the country strive to increase equitable access to and participation in computer science (CS). However, there are many open questions about the implementation and effectiveness of these initiatives, including the extent to which exposing young people to CS early on can shape their longer-term CS interest and engagement. In this article, we examine CS participation among 6th–8th-grade Black girls and assess whether CS participation during middle school shapes CS interest and engagement during their first year of high school. We focus on Black girls in the hopes of developing a more nuanced and rigorous understanding of computing experiences at the intersection of racism and sexism in this field. Participants. The focal group of students in this study are 6th–8th-grade Black girls from New York City. We employ a comparative lens in this article, contextualizing the CS experiences and outcomes of Black girls to Latinas, Asian, and White girls, as well as Black boys. Study Method. We primarily rely on quantitative data for this article, applying a critical lens to our analyses and interpretation. More specifically, we conduct descriptive analyses of course-taking patterns as well as survey data that focus on student attitudes and beliefs about CS. We then carry out inferential analyses of students’ administrative records examining how, if at all, middle school CS participation is related to high school outcomes for Black girls. We employ a comparative lens and rely on qualitative data to make sense of our results. Findings. We find that, troublingly, Black girls in the district are disproportionately less likely to receive CS instruction in middle school. Black girls are also less likely than Black boys, Latinas, and White girls to feel that they belong in CS. However, Black girls in CS courses report similar levels of engagement, family, and peer support, as well as value for CS relative to other students in the district. Finally, we find that participation in CS courses in middle school does not increase the likelihood that Black girls will select high schools that offer CS courses or take a CS course during their first year of high school. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that to increase equitable access and participation in CS, it is not enough to simply expose students to CS coursework. We call for sustained attention to the experiences that Black girls have in their CS classes as well as broader structural barriers that might shape CS course-taking.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Computer science (CS) lacks representation from people who identify as one or more of the following identities: woman, Black, Indigenous, Hispanic, Latina/Latino/Latinx, or disabled. We refer to these groups as historically underrepresented groups (HUGs). Informal learning, like CS summer camps and hackathons, can increase interest in K-12 students but still struggles to broaden participation. Objectives: In this study, we examine one source of struggle for informal learning programs: recruiting practices. Methods: Toward the goal of understanding this struggle, we interviewed 14 informal K-12 CS learning programs across a diverse region in the Northwestern United States to understand what recruiting practices are being used. We used a cultural competency lens to examine the variation within recruiting practices and how some practices could lead to broader participation in computing. Results: We identified 18 different recruiting practices used by informal CS learning program organizers. Some programs had similar practices, but subtle differences in implementation that led them to fall at different points on the cultural competence continuum. More culturally competent implementations generally involve reflection on the needs of specific populations that programs were trying to recruit, on why previous recruiting implementations did not work, and on feedback from stakeholders to change their implementations. This is the first article to investigate how the implementation of the recruiting practice determines its cultural competency. Conclusion: Results from this study illuminate some of the problems informal CS programs face in broadening participation in computing and provide insights on how program organizers’ can overcome them. Our work highlights how students or parents access resources, the challenges program organizers encounter, and whether current recruiting practices effectively engage students from HUGs.",

Within pair programming, three potential gender combinations may arise: Boy-Boy (BB), Girl-Girl (GG), and Boy-Girl (BG). This study explores the impact of different gender pairings on the programming self-efficacy and collaborative attitudes of sixth-grade students in rural elementary schools. A total of 82 novices (34 girls and 48 boys) voluntarily formed three types of pairs–BB, GG, and BG–to engage in pair programming using Scratch. The course spanned two months, comprising a total of nine sessions. Surveys on programming self-efficacy and collaborative attitudes were administered to all students after the fifth and ninth sessions. Our research brought to light significant improvements in programming self-efficacy for Boy-Boy pairs, suggesting that boy students learning programming with same-gender partners experienced noteworthy enhancements in their perceived programming abilities. Conversely, students in Girl-Girl and Boy-Girl pairs did not display significant changes in their programming self-efficacy. Additionally, all students demonstrated optimal collaborative attitudes when engaged in pair programming with same-gender partners. This study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of programming self-efficacy and collaborative attitudes within the framework of pair learning. The findings hold the potential to offer valuable insights for educators and curriculum designers aiming to establish inclusive and effective learning environments in rural elementary programming education.",

    "abstract": "Digital literacy is considered to be crucial for social and professional participation. Hence, several projects have been launched in school, as well as extracurricular activities to promote digital literacy in middle school. They aim, among other things, to increase interest in the so-called STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math), which include computer science. Interest in a topic is described in the literature as a crucial factor for learning success and career choice. Still, there is a potential for current research on the expression and distribution of interest in computer science. Therefore, this study aims to address this research gap by examining interest in computer science. The exploration of interest is expanded to include gender aspects and pupils’ dispositions. Given the significantly lower number of women studying in STEM fields, there is a particular focus on an improved understanding of the interests of female pupils as early as middle school. Moreover, the literature suggests that pupils’ dispositions should also be considered in instructional design to achieve stable interest. In this context, the following two dispositions shine out in literature and are therefore focused on in this paper: first, interest in contextual, people-related topics (mainly found among women), and second, interest in factual, object-related topics (mainly found among men). In summary, this study investigates how pupils’ interest in computer science is expressed before and after a programming intervention and how it is distributed across gender and dispositions. Therefore, the study surveyed 8th-grade pupils (N=114) about their preferences and assessed their interest in computer science before and after an intervention with unplugged materials and playful robots. Results show that all groups of pupils find computer science interesting, and the intervention slightly increased interest. Girls show a marginally lower interest in computer science. Furthermore, the results indicate that interest in computer science did not correlate with interest in contextual or factual dispositions.",

    "abstract": "Background &amp; Context: With the growing movement to adopt critical framings of computing, scholars have worked to reframe computing education from the narrow development of programming skills to skills in identifying and resisting oppressive structures in computing. However, we have little guidance on how these framings may manifest in classroom practice. Objectives: To better understand the processes and practice of critical pedagogy in a computing classrooms, we taught a critically conscious computing elective within a summer academic program at a northwest United States university targeted at secondary students (ages 14-18) from low-income backgrounds and would be the first in their families to pursue a postsecondary education (i.e. first-generation). We investigated: (1) our participants’ initial perceptions of and attitudes toward the benefits and perils of computing, and (2) potential tensions that might emerge when secondary students negotiate the integration of critical pedagogy in a computing classroom. Methods: We qualitatively coded participant work from a critically conscious computing course within a summer academic program in the United States focused on students from low-income backgrounds or would be the first in their family to pursue a post-secondary education. Findings: Our participants’ initial attitudes towards technology were mostly positive, but exhibited an awareness of its negative impacts on their lives and society. Throughout the course, while participants demonstrated a rich social consciousness around technology, they faced challenges in addressing hegemonic values embedded in their programs, designs, and other classwork. Implications: Our findings revealed tensions between our participants’ computing attitudes, knowledge, self-efficacy, and social consciousness, suggesting pathways for scaffolding the critical examination of technology in secondary education. This study provides insights into the pedagogical content knowledge necessary for critical computing education.",

    "abstract": "Understanding software modelers’ difficulties and evaluating their performance is crucial to Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) education. The software modeling process contains fine-grained information about the modelers’ analysis and thought processes. However, existing research primarily focuses on identifying obvious issues in the software modeling process, such as incorrect connections or misunderstandings, but neglects the behavioral patterns that can reveal underlying, unaddressed modeling problems. This oversight fails to identify deeper problems that do not manifest as obvious issues but still represent significant potential problems in the software modeling process. Our research concentrates on detecting and classifying problematic modeling behaviors from software modeling process data, revealing the potential problems hidden in the process for MDE education. Specifically, we first construct problematic modeling behavior patterns from three dimensions, including anomalous time intervals, repetitions, and frequencies, to further identify characteristics and priorities relevant to problematic modeling behaviors. Then, we design rules with characteristics and priorities to detect and classify problematic modeling behaviors from problematic patterns. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal, we apply it to a data-flow diagram modeling platform. This platform can record modelers’ processes and has been practically used in software engineering courses for five years. We have conducted a case study with 12 participants. The macro F1 of detection and classification problematic modeling behaviors is 82.3%, which shows the effectiveness of our approach. Then, to evaluate the usefulness of our proposal for assisting modeling instructors in MDE education, we conducted another case study with 5 modeling instructors. The results show that our approach can help instructors uncover problems hidden in the software modeling process. The results of two case studies demonstrate that our approach effectively detects and classifies problematic modeling behaviors, enabling instructors to better adjust their instructional plans and improve MDE education.",

    "abstract": "Helping students learn to identify and respond to situations involving discrimination is important, especially in fields like Computer Science where there is evidence of an unwelcoming climate that disproportionately drives underrepresented students out of the field. While students should not be considered responsible for fixing issues around discrimination in their institutions, they do have a role to play. In this paper, we present the results of a study in which 318 undergraduate computer science majors were presented with scenarios of discrimination and asked to identify the issues, rate the severity of the issues, and ideate 3–5 responses to address the described situations. They were also asked to identify which of their responses would likely be most effective in addressing discrimination and which of their responses they would be most likely to use if they were in the situation described in real life. Our results show that while students generally are able to identify various forms of discrimination (sexism, racism, religious discrimination, ethnic discrimination, etc.), any ambiguity in a scenario led to students describing the scenario as less severe and/or as an example of oversensitivity. We also show that students come up with many passive responses to scenarios of discrimination (such as ignoring the situation or wishing it had not happened in the first place). Students in our study were more likely to say they would deploy passive responses in real life, shying away from responses that involve direct confrontation. We observed some differences between student demographic subgroups. Women and BIPOC students in CS tend to think these issues are more severe than men and White and Asian students in CS. Women are more likely to ideate direct confrontation responses and report willingness to use direct confrontation responses in real situations. Our work contributes a methodology for examining student awareness and understanding of diversity issues as well as a demonstration that undergraduate computer science students need help in learning how to address common situations that involve either intentional or unintentional discrimination in an academic environment.",

    "abstract": "In this article, I interrogate the relation between a researcher and the theories that the researcher gets involved with. I use my own trajectory as a computing education researcher as a way to make visible how different conceptions of this relation are shaped through prior encounters with different theories in the human sciences, particularly theories of mind, language, and knowledge. While modernist theories stemming from the Enlightenment that presuppose a disengaged researcher have predominated in CS and CER, theories of mind, language, and knowledge associated with pragmatist and phenomenological philosophical perspectives from the 20th Century challenge these modernist views. Under these newer theoretical perspectives, the researcher is always already involved with theory, even if such theory has withdrawn into the unnoticed background, a background that gives every research study its intelligibility. Recognizing that all researchers are caught in the grip of theory may help in both abandoning theories that no longer serve and staying open to adopt new and emergent theories.",

The labour market is a field with diverse data structures and multiple applications, for example connecting jobseekers and trainings or jobs. The labour market heavily relies on vocational education and training and advanced vocational qualification to meet challenges, e.g., digitalization. Study Methods. Since continuing vocational education and training (CVET) is a structurally important lever for the digital transformation of work, this article presents a methodological procedure for content analysis that provides information about the significance of computer science in unregulated continuing education offerings and in formal continuing education regulations. Findings. The question of the extent to which continuing education programs include informaticss topics is investigated, assuming that they can be found in continuing education as cross-cutting topics in a wide variety of thematic contexts. Our results indicating the need for training in computing education. At the same time, computing education offers the highest share of unregulated CVET programs. This could reflect the fact that training and further education regulations in Germany are designed open to technology. Conclusions. We present a novel and unique approach to analyze the importance of informatics and digitalization in CVET advertisements and official regulations for the same.",

    "abstract": "Norms and values in computing education are constantly changing as dominant narratives about the role of computing in society evolve over time. Within the current evolving landscape of computing education, researchers and practitioners have advocated for ensuring people from all backgrounds, and particularly women, non-binary, and Black, Indigenous, and Latinx people, are able to participate equitably within the field of computing. Yet, the values of computing educational experiences are narrowly framed within career outcomes, such as securing a career in computing, leaving many important experiences and ways of participating in the field out of the picture. To address this, we conducted reflective interviews with women who participated in broadening participation in computing (BPC) programs to understand their perceptions of computing and how it aligns (or not) with what they value about their experiences in computing learning environments. We investigate the following research questions: (1) How do women who participated in BPC programs describe their perceptions of computing? (2) How do those perceptions align or misalign with the program outcomes they valued? The findings from our study call attention to tensions arising from centering “computing careers” in BPC work and highlight the outcomes of participation valued by the women in our study, such as developing communities and relationships, gaining communication skills, and expanding perspectives on skills computer scientists should possess.",

Currently, about half of secondary schools in the United States have computer science education available to students in some form. Unfortunately, many of these schools choose a curriculum bogged down in the nuances of programming language syntax, leaving students bored, confused, unable to apply their learning to useful problems outside the classroom, and therefore disheartened about further pursuing a more conceptual computer science education in college. As a current undergraduate who has helped teach secondary school computer science, I witnessed firsthand the problems with current approaches. I, therefore, propose a shift in the focus of computing education research away from teaching “coding” effectively to elucidating a more abstract but nevertheless more pragmatic characterization of computer science as an academic field, rather than programming as a trade.",

    "abstract": "Black women represent the greatest underrepresentation in STEM fields, particularly the technology sector. According to a 2015 article in The Verge , Black women make up between 0% and 7% of the staff at the eight largest technology firms in the United States. This points to a glaring problem in terms of equity and inclusivity in the technology sector. Similar to their underrepresentation in the STEM sector, Black women's underrepresentation in the tech sector is related to pervasive and persistent prejudice and biased policies that endure in the United States, which have limited—and continue to limit—their access to quality education and spaces where Black women's cultural capital (i.e., ways of being) is acknowledged and appreciated. For most people, including Black women, social networks often make available opportunities and pathways toward realizing the roles they can play in the world or a particular industry. These webs of relationships and the embedded quality in them can be defined as an individual's social capital and be applied to any industry, including STEM and technology fields. In a practical sense, social capital allows an individual to leverage relationships for resources (e.g., information about internships and jobs or encouragement to persist through a difficult college course). In turn, these resources can contribute to economic opportunities (i.e., jobs) or social opportunities, such as relationships with gatekeepers who work in STEM fields that may lead to opportunities like jobs, projects, or financial backing. Research suggests that the social networks of Black young women rarely overlap with the networks of predominantly White and Asian males, who are overrepresented in the technology field. This weakens Black women's awareness of opportunities and training, and undermines their motivation to persist in the STEM sector. As a result of this increasing understanding of the role of social capital in career development, K–12 and higher education programs that are focused on equity in STEM fields have increasingly turned to the concept of social capital to address the traditional underrepresentation of certain groups, particularly Blacks, Latinos, and women in STEM fields. The following research investigates the experiences of Black girls who attended a program, Google's Code Next, designed to engage Black and Latinx youth in computer science. We argue that it is crucial for computer science programs not just to teach hard coding skills but also to build on young Black women's social capital to accommodate the young women in creating and expanding their tech social capital, enabling them to successfully navigate STEM and technology education and career pathways. Specifically, this article explores a subprogram of Code Next and how it has contributed to young Black women's persistence in STEM, and particularly in technology. The findings suggest that the young women employed an expanded sense of social capital in addition to an expanded cultural capital (i.e., language, skills, ways of being) and worldview (i.e., sense of belonging and self-efficacy) to make sense of their possible selves in the world of technology.",

Here we report the intersectional experiences of 11 Black women who served as instructors and mentors for the virtual INTech Summer Camp. The women in this study confirm that it is imperative to consider the intersectional experiences of Black women in CS as a whole, without explicating their identities. We found that Black women in CS feel that it is their responsibility to give back to Black girls to pay it forward from their own mentorship experiences. The Black women in our study describe seeking to fill a gap in mentorship that they experienced themselves, to share their knowledge and experiences to support the development of others who can relate to that intersection of identifying as Black and a girl or woman. Providing positive representation to encourage young Black girls to pursue tech careers is imperative to diversifying the tech workforce.",

    "abstract": "Objectives. We aim to understand, from a motivational perspective, how Black undergraduate women in computing make sense of their intersectional computing experiences. We examine their motivation to major in computing, their experiences as Black women in computing, and how these vary across institutional contexts. Participants. A sample of 77 Black undergraduate women in computing programs (computer science, computer engineering, information systems, information technology, and software engineering) from diverse college settings was recruited to participate in the study. Study Method. Participants responded to an online survey that included several Likert-scale measures for identity, motivation and retention variables, demographic questions, and two open-ended questions: Why did you choose to study computing? and What is it like for you to be a Black female student in computing? Findings. Key themes that emerged from our quantitative and qualitative analyses revealed the range of motivational factors driving Black undergraduate women to study computing and the nuances across their intersectional experiences in the computing education context. Additionally, Black undergraduate women located in HBCU computing education contexts demonstrated both similar and unique perspectives and experiences compared to their counterparts in non-HBCU settings. Conclusions. In addition to the isolation, pressure, power dynamics and epistemic violence experienced by Black women in the intersectional computing education context, the findings of this study display the unique cultural-social-psychological strengths of Black women in their positive valence and resilience, as well as their joy, empowerment, and achievement in computing. Increasing and complicating our knowledge of the motivations and intersectional experiences of Black women in undergraduate computing education, as well as understanding when and how their beliefs and perspectives vary across institutional context, will better inform efforts to retain them and promote their success both in college and into their careers.",

    "abstract": "Domain models in software engineering—often represented as class diagrams—depict relevant classes in a given problem domain along with necessary relationships among those classes. These models are important because they establish links between the requirements of a given system under development and the subsequent phases of the systems development life cycle. Although the teaching of basic concepts related to domain modeling takes only about 1 or 2 hours, proper application of these concepts to a given problem situation is difficult for students studying software engineering. Due to their insufficient domain knowledge of the problem situation and modeling experience, they often produce domain models that may not adequately represent necessary elements as part of the domain models. Analysis patterns can help them by encoding expert knowledge and offering guidance in the modeling process. This article reports the findings from a controlled experiment conducted to study the effects of collaboration patterns on the domain modeling process by students. Specifically, the study investigated the differences in students’ perceptions of the ease of the domain modeling process and quality of models produced, perceived difficulties, and how collaboration patterns help address domain modeling difficulties and the quality of domain models produced. Findings from this experimental study involving students from a software engineering course indicate that although there is no significant difference in subjects’ perceptions between the control and treatment groups, the subjects from the treatment group produced better-quality domain models. Additionally, the qualitative analysis of the feedback collected from the subjects from the control and treatment groups reveals that that having knowledge of patterns is beneficial, as it addresses the difficulties in domain modeling.",
