    "abstract": "Accurately predicting precipitation trends is vital in the economic development of a country. This research investigated precipitation variability across 15 stations in the Swat River basin, Pakistan, over a 51-year study period (1961–2011). Nonparametric Mann-Kendall (MK) and Spearman’s rho (SR) statistical tests were used to detect trends in monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation, and the trend-free prewhitening approach was applied to eliminate serial correlation in the precipitation time series. The results highlighted a mix of positive (increasing) and negative (decreasing) trends in monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation. One station in particular, the Saidu Sharif station, showed the maximum number of significant monthly precipitation events, followed by Abazai, Khairabad, and Malakand. On the seasonal time scale, precipitation trends changed from the summer to the autumn season. The Saidu Sharif station revealed the highest positive trend (7.48 mm/year) in annual precipitation. In the entire Swat River basin, statistically insignificant trends were found in the subbasins for the annual precipitation series; however, the Lower Swat subbasin showed the maximum quantitative increase in the precipitation at a rate of 2.18 mm/year. The performance of the MK and SR tests was consistent at the verified significance level.",

    "abstract": "Substantial variations in temperature and precipitation have been observed since the first permanent weather station was established in the Svalbard region in 1911. Temperature and precipitation development are analysed for the longest observational series, and periods with positive and negative trends are identified. For all temperature series, positive linear trends are found for annual values as well as spring, summer, and autumn series. A very strong winter warming is identified for the latest decades. Evaluation of temperature trends downscaled from global climate models forced with observed greenhouse gas emissions suggests that the downscaled results do span the observation-based trends at Svalbard Airport 1912–2010. Novel projections focussing on the Svalbard region indicate a future warming rate up to year 2100 three times stronger than observed during the latest 100 years. The average winter temperature in the Longyearbyen area at the end of this century is projected to be around 10°C higher than in present climate. Also for precipitation, the long-term observational series indicate an increase and the projections indicate a further increase up to year 2100.",

The resulting emissions can impact the atmosphere through oxidative chemistry and formation of secondary organic aerosol. Large uncertainty exists as to the magnitude of the marine sources of these compounds, their controlling factors, and contribution to marine aerosol. In recent years, the number of relevant studies has increased substantially, necessitating the review of this topic. Isoprene emissions vary with plankton species, chlorophyll concentration, light, and other factors. Remote marine boundary layer isoprene mixing ratios can reach &gt;300 pptv, and extrapolated global ocean fluxes range from &lt;1 to &gt;10 Tg C year −1 . Modeling studies using surface chlorophyll concentration as an isoprene emissions proxy suggest variable atmospheric impacts. More information is needed, including emission fluxes of isoprene and monoterpenes from various biogeographical areas, the effects of species and nutrient limitation on emissions, and the aerosol yields via condensation and nucleation, in order to better quantify the atmospheric impacts of marine isoprene and monoterpenes.",

Marine aerosol samples collected at the coastal site of Mace Head, Ireland, show a chemical composition trend that is influenced by the oceanic biological activity cycle, in agreement with other observations. Laboratory experiments show that sea‐spray aerosol from biologically active sea water can be highly enriched in organics, and the authors highlight the need for further studies on the atmospheric fate of such primary organics. With regard to the secondary fraction of organic aerosol, the average chemical composition and molecular tracer (methanesulfonic‐acid, amines) distribution could be successfully characterized by adopting a multitechnique analytical approach.",

The methodology utilized composite values of atmospheric conditions for three primary categories defined by population and general land use: rural, suburban, and urban. The results of the analyses demonstrated that a consistent UHI existed during the study period whereby the composite temperature values within the urban core were approximately 0.5 ∘ C warmer during the day than the rural areas and over 2 ∘ C warmer at night. Further, when the warmer temperatures were combined with ambient humidity conditions, the composite values consistently revealed even warmer heat‐related variables within the urban environment as compared with the rural zone.",

For a case study of convective system over the Great Plains, the WDM6 scheme improves the evolutionary features such as the bow‐type echo in the leading edge of the squall line. We also found that the WRF with WDM6 scheme removes spurious oceanic rainfall that is a systematic defect resulting from the use of the WSM6 scheme alone. The simulated summer monsoon rainfall in East Asia is improved by weakening (strengthening) light (heavy) precipitation activity. These changes can be explained by the fact that the WDM6 scheme has a wider range in cloud and rain number concentrations than does the WSM6 scheme.",

Southeastern Pacific samples contained both continental and marine aerosol types; of the 28 analyzed marine particles, 19 were characterized by sharp alkane and inorganic carbonate peaks in NEXAFS spectra and are identified as fragments of calcareous phytoplankton. Submicron spherical particles with spectral similarities to carbohydrate‐like marine sediments were also observed in Pacific samples. In both regions, supermicron amide and alkane‐containing particles resembling marine proteinaceous material were observed.

We have recently coupled the sophisticated NCAR Community Land Model version 3 (CLM3) into WRF to better characterize land surface processes. Among these four land surface schemes, the STD scheme is the simplest in both structure and process physics. The Noah and RUC schemes are at the intermediate level of complexity. CLM3 includes the most sophisticated snow, soil, and vegetation physics among these land surface schemes. WRF simulations with all four land surface schemes over the western United States (WUS) were carried out for the 1 October 1995 through 30 September 1996. The results show that land surface processes strongly affect temperature simulations over the (WUS). As compared to observations, WRF‐CLM3 with the highest complexity level significantly improves temperature simulations, except for the wintertime maximum temperature. Precipitation is dramatically overestimated by WRF with all four land surface schemes over the (WUS) analyzed in this study and does not show a close relationship with land surface processes.",

The results indicate that Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) method is slightly better than the other three methods and it is also easy to implement in a geographic information system (GIS). The IDW method was then used to produce forty-year (1990–2009 and 2040–2059) time series rainfall data at daily, monthly, and annual time scales at a ground resolution of 100 m for the Greater Sydney Region (GSR). The downscaled daily rainfall data have been further utilized to predict rainfall erosivity and soil erosion risk and their future changes in GSR to support assessments and planning of climate change impact and adaptation in local scale.",

PM 2.5 , AOD, and long-term visibility data, along with various climate and meteorological factors and the boundary-layer structure, were used to investigate the cause of the heavy-haze pollution events in January 2013. The result suggests that unfavorable diffusion conditions (weak surface winds and high humidity) and high primary-pollutant emissions have induced heavy-haze pollution in the BTH region over the past two decades. A sudden stratospheric warming (SSW), weak East Asian winter monsoon, a weak Siberian High, weak meridional circulation, southerly wind anomalies in the lower troposphere, and abnormally weak surface winds and high humidity were responsible for the severe haze pollution events, rather than an abrupt increase in emissions. Heavy/severe haze pollution is associated with orographic wind convergence zones along the Taihang and Yanshan Mountains, slight winds (1.7∼2.1 m/s), and high humidity (70%∼90%), which limits the diffusion of pollutants and facilitates the hygroscopic growth of aerosols. Recirculation and regional transport, along with the poorest diffusion conditions and favorable conditions for hygroscopic growth of aerosols and secondary transformation under the high emission, led to explosive growth and the record high hourly average concentration of PM 2.5 in Beijing.",

This study examines change and trends of 21 climate extremes of temperature and precipitation over Ethiopia by using indices from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI). The analysis was based on the records of observed meteorological data and the future projected from the CMIP5 model under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The results of the seasonal standardized rainfall anomaly and EOF analysis show a decreasing rainfall in JJAS season and significant variability in the FMAM season. The first mode of EOF in FMAM shows that 49.6% was mostly negative with a high amount of variability. The observed precipitation extreme of annual total precipitation (PRCPTOT), consecutive wet days (CWD), and the number of heavy precipitation days (R10) show a decreasing trend, and consecutive dry days (CDD) shows an increasing trend. Additionally, temperature extremes like tropical nights (TR20) and daily maximum and minimum temperatures show a significantly increasing trend. The projected precipitation extremes of CWD, PRCPTOT, very wet day annual total (R95p), and the number of heavy precipitation days (R10) show a decreasing trend. CDD shows longer periods of dryness and a substantial increase which is conducive to the increase of drought. The projected temperature extremes of the warm spell duration indicator (WSDI), daily maximum temperature (TXx) and daily minimum temperature (TNx), summer days (SU25), and tropical nights (TR20) show an increasing trend, while the diurnal temperature range shows a decreasing trend. The projected changes in temperature and precipitation extremes are likely to have significant negative impacts on various socioeconomic activities over Ethiopia.

    "abstract": "The atmosphere is a carrier on which some natural and anthropogenic organic and inorganic chemicals are transported, and the wet and dry deposition events are the most important processes that remove those chemicals, depositing it on soil and water. A wide variety of different collectors were tested to evaluate site-specificity, seasonality and daily variability of settleable particle concentrations. Deposition fluxes of POPs showed spatial and seasonal variations, diagnostic ratios of PAHs on deposited particles, allowed the discrimination between pyrolytic or petrogenic sources. Congener pattern analysis and bulk deposition fluxes in rural sites confirmed long-range atmospheric transport of PCDDs/Fs. More and more sophisticated and newly designed deposition samplers have being used for characterization of deposited mercury, demonstrating the importance of rain scavenging and the relatively higher magnitude of Hg deposition from Chinese anthropogenic sources. Recently biological monitors demonstrated that PAH concentrations in lichens were comparable with concentrations measured in a conventional active sampler in an outdoor environment. In this review the authors explore the methodological approaches used for the assessment of atmospheric deposition, from the analysis of the sampling methods, the analytical procedures for chemical characterization of pollutants and the main results from the scientific literature.",

This study aimed at analyzing the impact of urban form on UHI in Beijing using TM/ETM images between 1989 and 2010. Spatial analysis was proposed to explore the relationships between area, compactness ratio, the gravity centers of urban land, and UHI. The UHI in Beijing spatially represented a “NE-SW” spindle. The land surface temperature (LST) was higher in south than in north. Urban Heat Island Ratio Index (URI) was well interrelated with urban land area in different zones. Under the similar urban land area condition, UHI and compactness ratio of urban land were in positive correlation. The moving direction of the UHI gravity center was basically in agreement with urban land sprawl. The encroachment of urban land on suburban land is the leading source of UHI effect. The results suggest that urban design based on urban form would be effective for regulating the thermal environment.",

The results show that precipitation has a certain wet scavenging effect on PM2.5 and PM10, and the scavenging effect on PM10 is greater than that on PM2.5. Precipitation above moderate rainfall is concentrated from May to September, and light rain in winter increases the concentration of pollutants. The changes of PM2.5 before and after precipitation are related to the initial concentration of PM2.5 before precipitation, precipitation intensity, and precipitation duration. The scavenging effect of precipitation on PM10 is closely related to the initial concentration of PM10 before precipitation. The higher the initial concentration of PM10 is, the greater the removal amount of precipitation will be. Moderate or above pollution weather mainly occurs in the northeast, southwest, and west wind meteorological conditions; the more westerly the wind, the more the pollution; north wind and northwest wind have the most obvious scavenging effect on PM2.5 and Pm10; when the wind speed increases to 2 m/s, the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 can be reduced; when the wind speed is more than 4 m/s, the concentration of PM10 increases under the south wind, southeast wind, east wind, and northeast wind.",

In this research, four indices have been used to characterize the intensity, frequency, and amount of rainfall over Nigeria. A type of Artificial Neural Network called the self-organizing map has been used to reduce the multiplicity of dimensions and produce four unique zones characterizing extreme precipitation conditions in Nigeria. This approach allowed for the assessment of spatial and temporal patterns in extreme precipitation in the last three decades. Precipitation properties in each cluster are discussed. The cluster closest to the Atlantic has high values of precipitation intensity, frequency, and duration, whereas the cluster closest to the Sahara Desert has low values. A significant increasing trend has been observed in the frequency of rainy days at the center of the northern region of Nigeria.",

Results show that the mean rainfall (temperature) significantly reduces (increases) over the region when topography elevation is reduced. Based on the model, when topography over the selected region (KTU) is reduced to 25%, the mean rainfall (temperature) over east Africa is reduced (increased) by about 19% (1.4°C). The maximum rainfall (temperature) reduction (increase) is however observed around the region over which topography is reduced. The reduction in topography elevation resulted in an anomalous moisture divergence at low level and descending motion over the region. KTU topography enhances the surface heat flux over KTU region and tends to enhance convection over both KTU and the east African region. The topography also helps in the generation of the high frequency mesoscale and subsynoptic disturbances over the region. These disturbances produce precipitation over the region and may also enhance precipitation systems over remote areas due to propagation of the disturbances. The magnitude of the zonal wind speed at 850 hpa increases with the decrease in topography elevation.",

Historical simulations of climatological temperature and precipitation of the 40 GCMs for the 40-year period of 1960–1999 for both land and sea and those for the century of 1901–1999 for land are evaluated using observation and reanalysis datasets. Nineteen different performance metrics are employed. The results show that the performances of different GCMs vary greatly. CNRM-CM5-2 performs best among the 40 GCMs, where its total error is 3.25 times less than that of GCM performing worst. The performance of CNRM-CM5-2 is compared with those of the ensemble average of all 40 GCMs (40-GCM-Ensemble) and the ensemble average of the 6 best GCMs (6-GCM-Ensemble) for four categories, i.e., temperature only, precipitation only, land only, and sea only. While 40-GCM-Ensemble performs best for temperature, 6-GCM-Ensemble performs best for precipitation. 6-GCM-Ensemble performs best for temperature and precipitation simulations over sea, whereas CNRM-CM5-2 performs best over land. Overall results show that 6-GCM-Ensemble performs best and is followed by CNRM-CM5-2 and 40-GCM-Ensemble, respectively. The total errors of 6-GCM-Ensemble, CNRM-CM5-2, and 40-GCM-Ensemble are 11.84, 13.69, and 14.09, respectively. 6-GCM-Ensemble and CNRM-CM5-2 agree well with observations and can provide useful climate simulations for Southeast Asia. This suggests the use of 6-GCM-Ensemble and CNRM-CM5-2 for climate studies and projections for Southeast Asia.",

This study aims to evaluate drought hazard at current and future climate change conditions in the Boro paddy cultivated areas of western Bangladesh using simulated climate data from the outputs of three global climate models (GCMs) based on the SRES A1B scenario for the period between 2041 and 2070. The threshold level of Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was employed to identify drought events and its probability distribution function (PDF) was applied to create the drought hazard index. The study demonstrates that enhancement of potential evapotranspiration (PET) will surpass that of precipitation, resulting in intensified drought events in future. In addition, the PDFs of drought events will move the upper tail in future period compared to the baseline. The results showed that the southwestern region was more severe to the drought hazard than the northwestern region during the period of 1984 to 2013. From the results of three GCMs, in the mid-century period, drought hazard will slightly increase in the northwestern region and flatten with a decrease in the southwestern region. The outcomes will help to allocate agricultural adaptation plans under climate change condition in Bangladesh.",

Four downscaling models were developed and validated by using the observed temperature series from 61 national stations and large-scale predictor variables derived from the National Center for Environmental Prediction–National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis dataset. The proposed RF downscaling model was compared to multiple linear regression, artificial neural network, and support vector machine models. Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial correlation analysis (PAR) were used in the predictor selection for the other models for a comprehensive study. It was shown that the model efficiency of the RF model was higher than that of the other models according to five selected criteria. By evaluating the predictor importance, the RF could choose the best predictor combination without using PCA and PAR. The results indicate that the RF is a feasible tool for the statistical downscaling of temperature.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is posing severe threats to human health through its impacts on food, water supply, and weather. Saudi Arabia has frequently experienced record-breaking climate extremes over the last decade, which have had adverse socioeconomic effects on many sectors of the country. The present study explores the changes in average temperature and temperature extremes over Saudi Arabia using an updated daily temperature dataset for the period 1978–2019. Also, changes in frequency and percentile trends of extreme events, as well as in absolute threshold-based temperature extremes, are analyzed at seasonal and annual time scales. The results are robust in showing an increase in both temperature trends and temperature extremes averaged over the second period (2000–2019) when compared to the first period (1980–1999). Over the period 1978–2019, the minimum temperature for the country increased (0.64°C per decade) at a higher rate than the maximum temperature (0.60°C per decade). The rate of increase in the minimum and maximum temperatures was reported as 0.48 and 0.71°C per decade, respectively, for the period 1978–2009. The minimum temperature increased by 0.81°C per decade for the second period compared to an increase of 0.47°C per decade for the first period. The significant increase in minimum temperature has resulted in a decreasing linear trend in the diurnal temperature range over recent decades. The maximum (minimum) temperature increased at a higher rate for Jan-Mar (Jun-Nov) with the highest increase of 0.82 (0.89)°C per decade occurring in March (August). The analysis shows a substantial increase (decrease) in the number of warm (cold) days/nights over the second period compared to the first period. The number of warm days (nights) significantly increased by about 13 (21) days per decade, and there is a significant decrease of about 11 (13) days per decade of cold days (nights). The seasonal analysis shows that this increase in warm days/nights is enhanced in boreal summer, with a reduction in the number of cold days/nights in winter. These results indicate that the warming climate of Saudi Arabia is accelerating in recent decades, which may have severe socioeconomic repercussions in many sectors of the country.",

A comprehensive field measurement is undertaken to obtain real data on microclimate parameters for calibration of the microclimate-modeling software ENVI-met 4.0. With the calibrated ENVI-met, seven urban landscape scenarios are simulated and their effects on thermal comfort as measured by physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) are evaluated. It is found that the maximum improvement of PET reduction with suggested landscape designs is about 12 ° C, and high-albedo pavement materials and water bodies are not effective in reducing heat stress in hot and humid climate conditions. The combination of shade trees over grass is the most effective landscape strategy for cooling the microclimate.

The trend analysis reveals that positive trends were observed in the annual maximum temperature, 0.02°C/year (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.01</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math>) in the lowland and 0.04°C/year (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.01</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math>) in the highland AEZs. The positive trend in annual minimum temperature was consistent in all AEZs and significant (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.01</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math>). An upward trend in the annual total rainfall (10 mm/year) (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M4\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math>) was recorded in the midland AEZ. Over 60% of farmers have perceived increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall in all AEZs. However, farmers’ perception about rainfall in the midland AEZ contradicts with meteorological analysis. Results from the binary logit model inform that farmers’ climate change perceptions are significantly influenced by their access to climate and market information, agroecology, education, agricultural input, and village market distance. Based on these results, it is recommended to enhance farm households’ capacity by providing timely weather and climate information along with institutional actions such as agricultural extension services.",

    "abstract": "Hydrological forecasting is one of the key research areas in hydrology. Innovative forecasting tools will reform water resources management systems, flood early warning mechanisms, and agricultural and hydropower management schemes. Hence, in this study, we compared Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (S-LSTM), Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with the classical Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) network for one-step daily streamflow forecasting. The analysis used daily time series data collected from Borkena (in Awash river basin) and Gummera (in Abay river basin) streamflow stations. All data sets passed through rigorous quality control processes, and null values were filled using linear interpolation. A partial autocorrelation was also applied to select the appropriate time lag for input series generation. Then, the data is split into training and testing datasets using a ratio of 80 : 20, respectively. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed models. Finally, the findings are summarized in model variability, lag time variability, and time series characteristic themes. As a result, time series characteristics (climatic variability) had a more significant impact on streamflow forecasting performance than input lagged time steps and deep learning model architecture variations. Thus, Borkena’s river catchment forecasting result is more accurate than Gummera’s catchment forecasting result, with RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and R2 values ranging between (0.81 to 1.53, 0.29 to 0.96, 0.16 to 1.72, 0.96 to 0.99) and (17.43 to 17.99, 7.76 to 10.54, 0.16 to 1.03, 0.89 to 0.90) for both catchments, respectively. Although the performance is dependent on lag time variations, MLP and GRU outperform S-LSTM and Bi-LSTM on a nearly equal basis.",

    "abstract": "This research aims to find the best model for predicting the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and the Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) in the future. The study estimates SPI and SPEI at different time scales, ranging from 1 to 48 months. To predict drought, Random Forest (RF) models are used based on lag times of 1–12 months for the estimated drought indices (SPI and SPEI). Accuracy and error metrics like Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), root‐mean‐square error (RMSE), producer accuracy (PA), user accuracy (UA), and Choen’s kappa are used to assess the models. The NSE values for the SPI at varying time scales (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 48 months) indicate that Bahawalpur, Rawalpindi, Murree, and Sargodha stations have the highest NSE values of 0.1148, 0.5868, 0.8302, 0.9196, 0.9516, 0.9801, and 0.9845, respectively. Similarly, the RMSE values for SPI at these time scales show that Bahawalpur, Rawalpindi, Murree, and Sargodha stations have the lowest RMSE values of 0.6187, 0.6094, 0.4091, 0.2865, 0.2275, 0.1594, and 0.1106, respectively. The NSE and variance explained for SPI and SPEI at a 1‐month time scale were found to be poor, but they improved as the time scale increased. On the other hand, the RMSE values for SPI and SPEI at a 1‐month time scale were found to be high but decreased with longer time scales. The stations that exhibit the highest values of the NSE for the SPEI at various time scales (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 48 months) are Rawalpindi, Jhelum, Murree, Mianwali, Rawalpindi, and Sargodha, respectively. These stations have NSE values of 0.0784, 0.6074, 0.8353, 0.9225, 0.9542, 0.9760, and 0.9896, respectively. Similarly, the stations with the lowest RMSE values for SPEI at these time scales are Sargodha, Murree, Murree, Murree, Murree, and Sargodha, with RMSE values of 1.002, 0.5909, 0.3993, 0.2626, 0.2132, 0.1546, and 0.0941, respectively. The analysis reveals a distinct pattern indicating that stations situated at higher elevations exhibit a more pronounced correlation between the SPI and SPEI indices in comparison to stations at lower elevations. Notably, Murree, Jhelum, Sialkot, and Rawalpindi demonstrate a statistically significant and strong correlation between the SPI and SPEI. Overall, the results show that SPEI is a better drought index for classifying and monitoring meteorological drought in stations with lower elevations. However, in stations with higher elevations, the selected indices provide similar information, but with some differences.",

Urban and rural carbonaceous aerosols experienced a large (although opposite) range in seasonality in the West compared to a much lower seasonal variability in the East.

Accurate climate information is essential for the conditions of solar energy production, maximization, and stable regulation and planning. Climate change impacts on energy output projections are thus of crucial importance. In this study the effect of projected changes in irradiance and temperature on the performance of photovoltaic systems in Greece is examined. Climate projections were obtained from 5 regional climate models (RCMs) under the A1B emissions scenario, for two future periods. The RCM data present systematic errors against observed values, resulting in the need of bias adjustment. The projected change in photovoltaic energy output was then estimated, considering changes in temperature and insolation. The spatiotemporal analysis indicates significant increase in mean annual temperature (up to 3.5°C) and mean total radiation (up to 5 W/m 2 ) by 2100. The performance of photovoltaic systems exhibits a negative linear dependence on the projected temperature increase which is outweighed by the expected increase of total radiation resulting in an up to 4% increase in energy output.",

Climate change projections also indicate increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, which will intensify the UHI effect. As megacity Tehran is affected by severe heatwaves in summer, this study investigates its UHI characteristics and suggests some feasible mitigation strategies in order to reduce the air temperature and save energy. Temperature monitoring in Tehran shows clear evidence of the occurrence of the UHI effect, with a peak in July, where the urban area is circa 6 K warmer than the surrounding areas. The mobile measurements show a park cool island of 6-7 K in 2 central parks, which is also confirmed by satellite images. The effectiveness of three UHI mitigation strategies high albedo material (HAM), greenery on the surface and on the roofs (VEG), and a combination of them (HYBRID) has been studied using simulation with the microscale model ENVI-met. All three strategies show higher cooling effect in the daytime. The average nocturnal cooling effect of VEG and HYBRID (0.92, 1.10 K) is much higher than HAM (0.16 K), although high-density trees show a negative effect on nocturnal cooling.",

Validation of these interpolation methods was evaluated by comparing the modelled/generated rainfall values and the observed daily rainfall data using root mean square errors and mean absolute errors statistics. Results showed 90% chance of below cropping threshold rainfall (500 mm) exceeding 258.1 mm during short rains in Embu for one year return period.

SPI and SPEI significant trends show areas with opposite signals in the period 1901–2012, mainly associated with precipitation trends, which are significant and positive in the northwestern region and significant and negative in the southern areas. Additionally, SPEI identified dryer conditions and an increase in the area affected by droughts, which agrees with the increase in ET 0 .

In addition, a precipitation increase over southeastern SA is projected, mainly during summer and spring. The lifecycle of the South American monsoon (SAM) was also investigated in the present and future climates. In the near-future, the projections show a slight delay (one pentad) of the beginning of the rainy season, resulting in a small reduction of the SAM length.

    "abstract": "There is a critical need to monitor and predict terrestrial primary production, the key indicator of ecosystem functioning, in a changing global environment. Here we provide a brief review of three major approaches to monitoring and predicting terrestrial primary production: (1) ground-based field measurements, (2) satellite-based observations, and (3) process-based ecosystem modelling. Much uncertainty exists in the multi-approach estimations of terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP). To improve the capacity of model simulation and prediction, it is essential to evaluate ecosystem models against ground and satellite-based measurements and observations. As a case, we have shown the performance of the dynamic land ecosystem model (DLEM) at various scales from site to region to global. We also discuss how terrestrial primary production might respond to climate change and increasing atmospheric CO 2 and uncertainties associated with model and data. Further progress in monitoring and predicting terrestrial primary production requires a multiscale synthesis of observations and model simulations. In the Anthropocene era in which human activity has indeed changed the Earth’s biosphere, therefore, it is essential to incorporate the socioeconomic component into terrestrial ecosystem models for accurately estimating and predicting terrestrial primary production in a changing global environment.",

During the last 10 years, simulations with regional climate models (RCMs) have been performed for several purposes over the region. Early efforts were mainly focused on sensitivity studies to both physical mechanisms and technical aspects of RCMs. The last developments were focused mainly on providing high-resolution information on regional climate change. This paper describes the most outstanding contributions from the isolated efforts to the ongoing coordinated RCM activities in the framework of the CORDEX initiative, which represents a major endeavor to produce ensemble climate change projections at regional scales and allows exploring the associated range of uncertainties. The remaining challenges in modeling South American climate features are also discussed.",

We find that seven different indices of extreme precipitation all show an upward trend through the study period. The seven different precipitation indices include annual precipitation total, number of days above a certain threshold, maximum precipitation received over a certain period of time, maximum one-day precipitation, and number of days with precipitation above the 90th percentile. A principal components analysis reveals one eigenvector explaining much of the variance in the seven indices and reveals that this component exhibits a strong upward trend for the whole of Iran. On a regional level, we find that the upward trend in extreme precipitation has a strong southwest-to-northeast gradient across the country for all the indices. We repeated all the analyses for 42 stations across the country to compare with the results from the gridded data; trends in extreme rainfall generated from the station data compare favorably with the results from the APHRODITE daily rainfall time series thereby reinforcing the robustness of our conclusions.",

    "abstract": "The present study comprehensively analyzes error characteristics and performance of the two latest GPM-era satellite precipitation products over eastern China from April 2014 to March 2016. Analysis results indicate that the two products have totally different spatial distributions of total bias. Many of the underestimations for the GSMap-gauged could be traced to significant hit bias, with a secondary contribution from missed precipitation. For IMERG, total bias illustrates significant overestimation over most of the eastern part of China, except upper reaches of Yangtze and Yellow River basins. GSMap-gauged tends to overestimate light precipitation (&lt;16 mm/day) and underestimate precipitation with rain rate larger than 16 mm/day; however, IMERG underestimates precipitation at rain rate between 8 and 64 mm/day and overestimates precipitation at rain rate more than 64 mm/day. IMERG overestimates extreme precipitation indices (RR99P and R20TOT), with relative bias values of 17.9% and 11.5%, respectively. But GSMap-gauged shows significant underestimation of these indices. In addition, both products performed well in the Huaihe, Liaohe, and Yangtze River basins for extreme precipitation detection. At basin scale comparisons, the GSMap-gauged data has a relatively higher accuracy than IMERG, especially at the Haihe, Huaihe, Liaohe, and Yellow River basins.",

This paper presents initial efforts in developing an urban flood inundation model by coupling a one-dimensional (1D) model with a two-dimensional (2D) model to overcome the drawbacks of each individual modelling approach, and an additional module is used to simulate the rainfall-runoff process in study areas. For the 1D model, the finite difference method is used to discretize the Saint-Venant equations. An implicit dual time-stepping method (DTS) is then applied to a 2D finite volume model for an inundation simulation to improve computational efficiency. A total of four test cases are applied to validate the proposed model; its performance is demonstrated by a comparison with an explicit scheme and previously published results (an extensive physical experiment benchmark case, a vertical linking example, and two real drainage cases with actual topography). Results demonstrate that the proposed model is accurate and efficient in simulating urban floods for practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Mountain regions worldwide present a pronounced spatiotemporal precipitation variability, which added to scarce monitoring networks limits our understanding of the generation processes involved. To improve our understanding of clouds and precipitation dynamics and cross-scale generation processes in mountain regions, we analyzed spatiotemporal rainfall patterns using satellite cloud products (SCP) in the Paute basin (900–4200 m a.s.l. and 6481 km 2 ) in the Andes of Ecuador. Precipitation models, using SCP and GIS data, reveal the spatial extension of three regimes: a three-modal (TM) regime present across the basin, a bimodal (BM) regime, along sheltered valleys, and a unimodal (UM) regime at windward slopes of the eastern cordillera. Subsequently, the spatiotemporal analysis using synoptic information shows that the dry season of the BM regime during boreal summer is caused by strong subsidence inhibiting convective clouds formation. Meanwhile, in UM regions, low advective shallow cap clouds mainly cause precipitation, influenced by water vapor from the Amazon and enhanced easterlies during boreal summer. TM regions are transition zones from UM to BM and zones on the windward slopes of the western cordillera. These results highlight the suitability of satellite and GIS data-driven statistical models to study spatiotemporal rainfall seasonality and generation processes in complex terrain, as the Andes.",

However, there is more and more serious water resource shortage and decrease of water productivity in Heihe River Basin under the influence of climate change and human activities. This paper attempts to identify the severe water scarcity under climate change and presents possible solutions for sustainable development in Heihe River Basin. Three problems that intervened land use changes, water resource, the relevant policies and institutions in Heihe River basin were identified, including (1) water scarcity along with serious contradiction between water supply and demand, (2) irrational water consumption structure along with low efficiency, and (3) deficient systems and institutions of water resource management along with unreasonable water allocation scheme. In this sense, we focused on reviewing the state of knowledge, institutions, and successful practices to cope with water scarcity at a regional extent. Possible solutions for dealing with water scarcity are explored and presented from three perspectives: (1) scientific researches needed by scientists, (2) management and institution formulation needed by governments, and (3) water resource optimal allocation by the manager at all administrative levels.",

    "abstract": "In the last few years, satellite-based precipitation datasets are believed to be a potential source for forcing inputs in driving hydrological models, which are important especially in complex terrain areas or ungauged basins where ground gauges are generally sparse or nonexistent. This study aims to comprehensively evaluate the satellite precipitation products, CMORPH-CRT, PERSIANN-CDR, 3B42RT, and 3B42 against gauge-based datasets and to infer their relative potential impacts on hydrological processes simulation using the HEC-HMS model in the Ganzi River Basin (GRB) of the Tibetan Plateau. Results from a quantitative statistical comparison reveal that, at annual and seasonal scales, both CMORPH-CRT and 3B42 perform better than PERSIANN-CDR and 3B42RT. The CMORPH-CRT and 3B42 tend to underestimate values at the medium and high precipitation intensities ranges, whereas the opposite tendency is found for PERSIANN-CDR and 3B42RT. Overall, 3B42 exhibits the best performance for streamflow simulations over GRB and even outperforms simulation driven by gauge data during the validation period. PERSIANN-CDR shows the worst overall performance. After recalibrating with input-specific precipitation data, the performance of all satellite precipitation forced simulations is substantially improved, except for PERSIANN-CDR. Furthermore, 3B42 is more suitable to drive hydrological models and can be a potential alternative source of sparse data in Tibetan Plateau basins.",

The seasonal climatology, annual rainfall cycles, and wind fields of the RCMs output were assessed over three homogenous subregions and validated using precipitation data from eighty-one (81) ground observation stations and TRMM satellite data. Furthermore, the ability of the RCMs to simulate response to El Nino and La Nina events was assessed. Results show that two of the RCMs (RCA and REMO) simulated the main features of the rainfall climatology and associated dynamics over the three subregions (Guinea Coast, Savannah, and Sahel) of West Africa. The RCMs also capture the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) and Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) with little variations in position and intensity. Analysis shows significant biases in individual models depending on subregion and season under consideration which may be attributed to strong cyclonic circulation observed at 850 mb pressure level. In general, the study shows RCA and REMO fairly simulate West Africa rainfall adequately and can therefore be used for the assessment of West African Summer Monsoon and future climate projections.",

At the growing season scale, the NDVI increased weakly in the natural ecosystems, but strongly in cropland. Interannual variations in the growing season NDVI for forest was positively linked with potential evapotranspiration and temperature, but negatively correlated with precipitation. In contrast, it was positively correlated with precipitation, but negatively related to potential evapotranspiration for other natural biomes, particularly for desert steppe. Although monthly NDVI trends were characterized as heterogeneous, corresponding to monthly variations in climate change among biome types, warming-related NDVI at the beginning of the growing season was the main contributor to the NDVI increase during the growing season for forest, meadow steppe, and typical steppe, but it constrained the NDVI increase for desert steppe, desert, and crop. Significant one-month lagged correlations between monthly NDVI and climate variables were found, but the correlation characteristics varied greatly depending on vegetation type.",

The future climate data for the simulation with Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) were prepared using a dynamical downscaling method. The future land uses were simulated with the Dynamic Land Use System (DLS) model by establishing Multinomial Logistic Regression (MNL) model for six land use types. In 2006–2030, land uses in the basin will experience a significant change with a prominent increase in urban areas, a moderate increase in grassland, and a great decrease in unused land. Besides, the simulation results showed that in comparison to those during 1981–2005 the temperature and precipitation during 2006–2030 will change by +0.8°C and +10.8%, respectively. The land use change and climate change will jointly make the water yield change by +8.5%, while they will separately make the water yield change by −1.8% and +9.8%, respectively. The predicted large increase in future precipitation and the corresponding decrease in unused land will have substantial impacts on the watershed hydrology, especially on the surface runoff and streamflow. Therefore, to mitigate negative hydrological impacts and utilize positive impacts, both land use and climate changes should be considered in water resource planning for the Heihe River Basin.",

The EWDs identification and trajectory are analyzed using an automatic tracking technique (TracKH). The EWDs circulation patterns and their main features were obtained using the composite technique. To evaluate the TracKH efficiency, a validation was done by comparing the EWDs number tracked against observed cases obtained from an observational analysis. The mean characteristics of EWDs are 5.5-day period, propagation speed of ~9.5 m·s −1 , and a 4500 km wavelength. A synoptic analysis shows that between days −2 d and 0 d, the low level winds presented cyclonic relative vorticity and convergence anomalies both in 2006 and 2007. The EWDs signals are strongest at low levels. The EWDs propagation is associated with relative humidity and precipitation positive anomalies and OLR and omega negative anomalies. The EWDs tracks are seen over all ENEB and their lysis occurs between the ENEB and marginally inside the continent. The tracking captured 71% of EWDs in all periods, indicating that an objective analysis is a promising method for EWDs detection.",

Here, we evaluated the ability of seven CMIP5 models (selected based on literature review) to represent the seasonal mean precipitation and its interannual variability over northern South America. Our results suggest that it is easier for models to reproduce rainfall distribution during boreal summer and fall over both oceans and land. This is probably due to the fact that during these seasons, incoming radiation and ocean-atmosphere feedbacks over Atlantic and Pacific oceans locate the ITCZ on the Northern Hemisphere, as suggested by previous studies. Models exhibit the worse simulations during boreal winter and spring, when these processes have opposite effects locating the ITCZ. Our results suggest that the models with a better representation of the oceanic ITCZ and the local low-level jets over northern South America, such as the Choco low-level jet, are able to realistically simulate the main features of seasonal precipitation pattern over northern South America.",

    "abstract": "The motivation for this review paper came from the developing countries where the economy is mostly dependent on agriculture and climate conditions. Based on current conditions and historical records, profitability in production farming depends on making a right and timely operational decision. Precision farming is a systematic program designed to maximize the productivity of agriculture by carefully tailoring the soil and crop management to meet the specific requirements in each field while preserving environmental quality. This review paper highlights the development of an automated irrigation system with portable wireless sensor networks and decision support methods to remotely measure the environmental parameters in an agriculture field. Radio satellite, mobile phones, sensors, internet-based communication, and microcontroller capture the ecological parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity. The knowledge gained from the sensors is transferred directly to the cloud server by using IoT technology. Users from anywhere in the world can display them through an internet-enabled device. Development of sensor-based application in modern agriculture makes it cost-effective and potentially productive and increases the efficiency through precision agriculture farming. Different limitations have been reported in the previously reviewed publications like the shortage of power in the field that can be solved by using a solar panel that recharges the battery at the same time using electricity. Bluetooth application in the agriculture sector is mainly improved by design system optimization. Problems related to transmission and radio range frequency can be solved by using a power class upgraded antenna.",

    "abstract": "Among the parameters that must be considered for an offshore wind farm development, the stability conditions of the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) are of significant importance. Atmospheric stability is a vital parameter in wind resource assessment (WRA) due to its direct relation to wind and turbulence profiles. A better understanding of the stability conditions occurring offshore and of the interaction between MABL and wind turbines is needed. Accurate simulations of the offshore wind and stability conditions using mesoscale modelling techniques can lead to a more precise WRA. However, the use of any mesoscale model for wind energy applications requires a proper validation process to understand the accuracy and limitations of the model. For this validation process, the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model has been applied over the North Sea during March 2005. The sensitivity of the WRF model performance to the use of different horizontal resolutions, input datasets, PBL parameterisations, and nesting options was examined. Comparison of the model results with other modelling studies and with high quality observations recorded at the offshore measurement platform FINO1 showed that the ERA-Interim reanalysis data in combination with the 2.5-level MYNN PBL scheme satisfactorily simulate the MABL over the North Sea.",

The results indicated that more people rested on the steps during the cool season than hot season. Compared to neutral temperatures, people demonstrated higher heat tolerance to the hot season. The results indicated that more than 75% of users preferred to remain in shaded areas and stayed longer than in the sunlight. The people tended to engage in static activities in environments that exhibit sufficient shading. The shaded areas were conducive to static activities as the summer grew hotter.

    "abstract": "Vegetation dynamics have been visibly influenced by climate variability. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been the most commonly used index in vegetation dynamics. The study was conducted to examine the effects of climatic variability (rainfall) on NDVI for the periods 1982–2015 in the Gojeb River Catchment (GRC), Omo-Gibe Basin, Ethiopia. The spatiotemporal trend in NDVI and rainfall time series was assessed using a Theil–Sen (Sen) slope and Mann–Kendall (MK) statistical significance test at a 95% confidence interval. Moreover, the residual trend analysis (RESTREND) method was used to investigate the effect of rainfall and human induction on vegetation degradation. The Sen’s slope trend analysis and MK significant test indicated that the magnitude of annual NDVI and rainfall showed significant decrement and/or increment in various portions of the GRC. The concurrent decrement and/or increment of annual NDVI and rainfall distributions both spatially and temporarily could be attributed to the significant positive correlation of the monthly (R NDVI-RF = 0.189, <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:math>) and annual (R NDVI-RF = 0.637, <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>≤</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.001</mml:mn></mml:math>) NDVI with rainfall in almost all portions of the catchment. In the GRC, a strongly negative decrement and strong positive increment of NDVI could be derived by human-induced and rainfall variability, respectively. Accordingly, the significant NDVI decrement in the downstream portion and significant increment in the northern portion of the catchment could be attributed to human-induced vegetation degradation and the variability of rainfall, respectively. The dominance of a decreasing trend in the residuals at the pixel level for the NDVI from 1982, 1984, 2000, 2008 to 2012 indicates vegetation degradation. The strong upward trend in the residuals evident from 1983, 1991, 1998 to 2007 was indicative of vegetation improvements. In the GRC, the residuals may be derived from climatic variations (mainly rainfall) and human activities. The time lag between NDVI and climate factors (rainfall) varied mainly from two to three months. In the study catchment, since vegetation degradations are mainly caused by human induction and rainfall variability, integrated and sustainable landscape management and climate-smart agricultural practices could have paramount importance in reversing the degradation processes.",

Projections for mid- and end-of-century periods (2040–2069 and 2070–2099), using seven global climate models from CMIP5 under intermediate (RCP4.5) and high (RCP8.5) emission scenarios, were performed. The Bristow–Campbell model was the one that best estimated solar radiation, whereas the XAVIER gridded database was the closest to observed weather data. Future climate projections, under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, as expected, showed warmer conditions for all scenarios over Brazil. On the contrary, rainfall projections are more uncertain. Despite that, the rainfall amounts will be reduced in the North-Northeast region and increased in Southern Brazil. No significant differences between projections using the observed and XAVIER gridded database were observed; therefore, such a database showed to be reliable for both to fill gaps and to generate climate change scenarios.",

Downscaled monthly precipitation estimates after bias and variance correction were compared to the median and variance of the 30-year observations of 5 climate stations in the Paute River basin in southern Ecuador, one of Ecuador’s main river basins. A preliminary comparison revealed that both artificial intelligence methods, ANN and LS-SVM, performed equally. Results disclosed that ANN and LS-SVM methods depict, in general, better skills in comparison to SDSM. However, in some months, SDSM estimates matched the median and variance of the observed monthly precipitation depths better. Since synoptic variables do not always present local conditions, particularly in the period going from September to December, it is recommended for future studies to refine estimates of downscaling, for example, by combining dynamic and statistical methods, or to select sets of synoptic predictors for specific months or seasons.",

We adapted a simple linear regression and interpolation to analyze, respectively, the trend and spatial distribution of the mean annual precipitation and temperature. In addition, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was applied to evaluate the drought condition of the HOA. The results revealed that statistically the trend of precipitation decreased insignificantly; the trend of temperature was observed to drop very significantly between 1930 and 1969, but it was dramatically elevated very significantly from 1970 to 2014. The SPEI showed that the HOA experienced from mild to moderate drought throughout the study period with severe to extreme drought in some regions, particularly in 1943, 1984, 1991, and 2009. The drought was a very serious environmental problem in the HOA in the last 85 years. Thus, an immediate action is required to tackle drought and hence poverty and famine in the HOA.",

    "abstract": "Downscaling considerably alleviates the drawbacks of regional climate simulation by general circulation models (GCMs). However, little information is available regarding the downscaling using machine learning methods, specifically at hydrological basin scale. This study developed multiple machine learning (ML) downscaling models, based on a Bayesian model average (BMA), to downscale the precipitation simulation of 8 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models using model output statistics (MOS) for the years 1961–2005 in the upper Han River basin. A series of statistical metrics, including Pearson’s correlation coefficient (PCC), root mean squared error (RMSE), and relative bias (Rbias), were used for evaluation and comparative analyses. Moreover, the BMA and the best ML downscaling model were used to downscale precipitation in the 21st century under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) and RCP8.5 scenarios. The results show the following: (1) The performance of the BMA ensemble simulation is clearly better than that of the individual models and the simple mean model ensemble (MME). The PCC reaches 0.74, and the RMSE is reduced by 28%–60% for all the GCMs and 33% compared to the MME. (2) The downscaled models greatly improved station simulation performance. Support vector machine for regression (SVR) was superior to multilayer perceptron (MLP) and random forest (RF). The downscaling results based on the BMA ensemble simulation and SVR models were regarded as the best performing overall (PCC, RMSE, and Rbias were 0.82, 35.07, mm and −5.45%, respectively). (3) Based on BMA and SVR models, the projected precipitations show a weak increasing trend on the whole under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Specifically, the average rainfall during the mid- (2040–2069) and late (2070–2099) 21st century increased by 3.23% and 1.02%, respectively, compared to the base year (1971–2000) under RCP4.5, while they increased by 4.25% and 8.30% under RCP8.5. Additionally, the magnitude of changes during winter and spring was higher than that during summer and autumn. Furthermore, future work is recommended to study the improvement of downscaling models and the effect of local climate.",

In this study, we explored the temporal changes of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in different seasons based on MOD13Q1 NDVI by the maximum value composite and then analyzed spatial distribution characteristics of vegetation using Sen’s tendency estimation, Mann–Kendall significance test, and coefficient of variation model (CV) combined with terrain factors. Finally, the concurrent and lagged effects of NDVI on climate factors in different seasons and months were discussed using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The results indicate that (1) the temporal variation of the NDVI showed that the NDVI values of different vegetation types increased at different rates, especially in growing season, spring, and autumn; (2) for spatial patterns, the NDVI, CV, and NDVI trends had strong spatial heterogeneity owning to the influence of altitudes, slopes, and aspects; and (3) the concurrent effect of vegetation on climate change indicates that the positive effect of temperature on NDVI was mainly in growing season and autumn, whereas spring NDVI was mainly influenced by precipitation. In addition, the lag effect analysis results revealed that spring precipitation has a definite inhibition effect on summer and autumn vegetation, but spring and summer temperature can promote the growth of vegetation. Meanwhile, the precipitation in the late growing season has a lag effect of 1-2 months on vegetation growth, and air temperature has a lag effect of 1 month in the middle of the growing season. Based on the above results, this study provided valuable information for ecosystem degradation and ecological environment protection in the Yunnan Province.",

    "abstract": "The first episodes of floods caused by heavy rainfall during the major rainy season in 2018 occurred in Accra (5.6°N and 0.17°W), a coastal town, and Kumasi (6.72°N and 1.6°W) in the forest region on the 18th and 28th of June, respectively. We applied the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to investigate and examine the meteorological dynamics, which resulted in the extreme rainfall and floods that caused 14 deaths, 34076 people being displaced with damaged properties, and economic loss estimated at $168,289 for the two cities according to the National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO). The slow-moving thunderstorms lasted for about 8 hours due to the weak African Easterly Wave (AEW) and Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ). Results from the analysis showed that surface pressures were low with significant amount of moisture influx aiding the thunderstorms intensification, which produced 90.1 mm and 114.6 mm of rainfall over Accra and Kumasi, respectively. We compared the rainfall amount from this event to the historical rainfall data to investigate possible changes in rainfall intensities over time. A time series of annual daily maximum rainfall (ADMR) showed an increasing trend with a slope of 0.45 over Accra and a decreasing trend and a slope of –0.07 over Kumasi. The 95th percentile frequencies of extreme rainfall with thresholds of 45.10 mm and 42.16 mm were analyzed for Accra and Kumasi, respectively, based on the normal distribution of rainfall. Accra showed fewer days with more heavy rainfall, while Kumasi showed more days with less heavy rainfalls.",

Status of drought in Sri Lanka was assessed using Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) at 3, 6, and 12 months’ time scales using monthly rainfall (1970 to 2017) data of 54 weather stations. The frequency of drought events was evaluated using SPI, and trend of SPI was also detected using the Mann–Kendall (MK) test and Sen’s slope estimator. The result based on SPI identified hydrological years 1975-76, 1982-83, 1986-87, 1988-89, 2000-01, 2001-02, 2013-14, and 2016-17 as drought years for 52, 32, 35, 33, 33, 31, 31, and 31% of tested stations (54), respectively, at annual time scale. Comparison of the SPI at different time scales revealed that more drought events (SPI ≤ −1) occurred during Yala season than Maha cropping season. Considering the Thiessen polygon average rainfall, more frequent drought events occurred in the dry zone (57%) than the wet (49%) and intermediate zone (47%) at the annual time scale. SPI trend results showed greater increase in drought (59% of stations) during Yala seasons as compared to the Maha cropping season (15% of stations) in Sri Lanka.",

    "abstract": "Air quality in urban areas is deteriorating over time with the increased pollutant distribution levels mainly caused due to anthropogenic activities. In addition, these pollutant distribution levels may relate to changing meteorological conditions. However, the relationships were not researched in-depth in the context of Sri Lanka, a country with a significant impact on climate change. The main objective of this study was to provide a broader perspective on the seasonal variation of tiny particles in air (PM2.5 and PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in two urban cities (Colombo and Kandy) in Sri Lanka over 3 years period (2018–2021) and the possible relationships between air pollution and meteorological variables. Results show that all the aforementioned pollutants except O3 consistently depict two peaks during the day, one in the morning (∼07:00–09:00 local time) and the other in the evening (∼18:00–20:00 local time). These peaks coincided with the traffic jams observed in both cities. The results further revealed that the concentration of all pollutants has significant seasonal variations. Compared to two monsoon seasons, the highest daily average PM2.5 (31.2 μg/m3), PM10 (49.5 μg/m3), NO2 (18.9 ppb), CO (717.5 ppb), O3 (18.5 ppb), and SO2 (9.4 ppb) concentrations in Colombo are recorded during northeast monsoon (NEM) seasons while contrast pattern is observed in Kandy. In addition, it was found that wind speed with its direction is the most influencing factor for the pollutant concentration except for SO2 and O3 in two cities, and this is irrespective of the season. This study’s findings contribute to understanding the seasonality of ambient air quality and the relationship between meteorological factors and air pollutants. These findings ultimately lead to designing and implementing season-specific control strategies to achieve air pollution reduction at a regional scale.",

    "abstract": "Drought is a natural disaster that has impacts on society, the environment, and the ecosystem. Ethiopia faced many horrible severe drought events in the last few decades. Even though there are some drought-related studies in the country, most of the investigations were focused on meteorological drought analysis. This study was focused on hydrological drought analysis in Ethiopia using the streamflow drought index (SDI). The main objective was to identify drought-prone areas and severe drought events years. Streamflow data were collected from 34 stations to analyze SDI in seasonal (3-month) and annual (12-month) timescales. The analysis implies that seasonal time scale (3-month) hydrological drought has a high frequency of occurrence but short duration, whereas annual (12-month) analysis has a low frequency with a large magnitude. The overall result shows that 1984/85, 1986/87, 2002/03, and 2010/11 were the most severe and extreme drought years in all river basins. The 1980s were found severe and extreme drought years in which most hydrological drought events occurred in the country. The spatial analysis shows that Tekeze, Abbay, and Baro river basins have similar characters; Awash and Rift Valley River basins show relatively the same character, and Genale Dawa and Wabishebele river basins have a similar character. But Omo Gibe River basin has a unique character in which the severe drought occurred in a different year of other river basins.",

Results show that, in general, MCS are more frequent during boreal summer and autumn, and particularly, systems observed in summer season present longer life and larger extension. On the continent, MCS genesis is strongly affected by sea breeze and diurnal heating and presents a peak from 15 to 18 LST. For oceanic systems, the main genesis period is later, from 00 to 03 LST. Continental and oceanic systems present a tendency of westward displacement. Analysis using a Lagrangian approach implemented to estimate air parcel trajectories suggests that, during boreal winter, the main moisture sources are from the Caribbean Sea and tropical north Atlantic, possibly resulting from the moisture-laden trade winds and the land-ocean temperature contrast over northern South America. In summer, it is clear the influence of ITCZ positioning with moisture particles traveling from the tropical Atlantic over Amazonian river basin. In Autumn, Chilean-Peruvian Pacific is the main moisture source, confirming the importance of Chocó low level jet to MCS genesis.",

The NN approach is compared with the conservative multi-model ensemble, with multiple linear regression ensemble approaches, and with results obtained by human forecasters. The NN multi-model ensemble improves upon conservative multi-model ensemble and multiple linear regression ensemble, it (1) significantly reduces high bias at low precipitation level, (2) significantly reduces low bias at high precipitation level, and (3) sharpens features making them closer to the observed ones. The NN multi-model ensemble performs at least as well as human forecasters supplied with the same information. The developed approach is a generic approach that can be applied to other multi-model ensemble fields as well as to single model ensembles.",

The Kongsfjorden-Kongsvegen valley is relatively densely covered with meteorological observations, which facilitate joint statistical analysis of the turbulent surface layer structure and the structure of the higher atmospheric layers. Wind direction diagrams reveal strong wind channeled in the surface layer up to 300 m to 500 m. The probability analysis links strong wind channeling and cold temperature anomalies in the surface layer. To explain these links, previous studies suggested the katabatic wind flow mechanism as the leading driver responsible for the observed wind climatology. In this paper, idealized turbulence-resolving simulations are used to distinct between different wind driving mechanisms. The simulations were performed with the real surface topography at resolution of about 60 m. These simulations resolve the obstacle-induced turbulence and the turbulence in the non-stratified boundary layer core. The simulations suggest the leading roles of the thermal land-sea breeze circulation and the mechanical wind channeling in the modulation of the valley winds. The characteristic signatures of the developed down-slope gravity-accelerated flow, that is, the katabatic wind, were found to be of lesser significance under typical meteorological conditions in the valley.",

Different observations for total cloud fraction are in a better agreement in summer than in winter and over the ocean than over land. An interannual variability is higher in winter than in summer according to all observations. The Arctic total cloud fraction has a prominent annual cycle according to most of the observations. The time of its maximum concurs with the time of the sea ice extent minimum (early summer&#x2013;late autumn) and vice versa (late spring). The main reason for the discrepancies among observations is the difference in the cloud-detection algorithms, especially when clouds are detected over the ice/snow surface (during the whole year) or over the regions with the presence of strong low-tropospheric temperature inversions (mostly in winter). Generally, reanalyses are not in a close agreement with satellite and surface observations of cloudiness in the Arctic.",

Quantitative relationships between coarse scale TRMM data and environmental variables are then estimated via regression analysis and used to derive trend components at a fine scale. Next, the residual components, which are the differences between the trend components and the original TRMM data, are then downscaled at a target fine scale via area-to-point kriging. The trend and residual components are finally added to generate fine scale precipitation estimates. Stochastic simulation is also applied to the residual components in order to generate multiple alternative realizations and to compute uncertainty measures. From an experiment using a digital elevation model (DEM) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the geostatistical downscaling scheme generated the downscaling results that reflected detailed characteristics with better predictive performance, when compared with downscaling without the environmental variables. Multiple realizations and uncertainty measures from simulation also provided useful information for interpretations and further environmental modeling.",

Ice conditions substantially affect the temperature regime of the Spitsbergen archipelago, particularly in winter. We test the hypothesis that intensive vertical mixing at the upper AW boundary releases substantial heat upwards that eventually reaches the under-ice water layer, thinning the ice cover. We examine spatial and temporal variation of ice concentration against time series of wind, air temperature, and AW temperature. Analysis of 1979–2011 ice properties revealed a general tendency of decreasing ice concentration that commenced after the mid-1990s. AW temperature time series in Fram Strait feature a monotonic increase after the mid-1990s, consistent with shrinking ice cover. Ice thins due to increased sensible heat flux from AW; ice erosion from below allows wind and local currents to more effectively break ice. The winter spatial pattern of sea ice concentration is collocated with patterns of surface heat flux anomalies. Winter minimum sea ice thickness occurs in the ice pack interior above the AW path, clearly indicating AW influence on ice thickness. Our study indicates that in the AW inflow region heat flux from the ocean reduces the ice thickness.",

Unexpectedly, downward longwave radiation measured at the sounding site did not correlate with the inversion properties. Temperature inversions had lower base and top heights than humidity inversions, the former due to surface cooling and the latter due to adiabatic cooling with height. Most low-level jets were related to katabatic winds. Over the ice-covered Kongsfjorden, jets were lifted above a cold-air pool on the fjord; the jet core was located highest when the snow surface was coldest. At the ice-free Isfjorden, jets were located lower.",

To understand the influence of the city of Lisbon on the urban boundary layer, a mesoscale meteorological network was installed in 2004. The main goals of the present study are to update the results of the research published in 2007 and to bring more precise information about the relationship between the Urban Heat Island (UHI) and the regional and local wind systems. The highest frequencies of the UHI were found in the city centre (Restauradores). In the green park of Monsanto, the highest frequency occurred between −2 and 0°C. During the summer, the effect of the breezes was observed in Belém, lowering the temperature. The “strong” UHI (intensity &gt;4°C) occurred more often during the summer, with median values of 2°C by night and 1.8°C by day. The highest frequencies of UHI occurred for winds between 2 and 6 m/s and were not associated with atmospheric calm, as pointed out in the literature. Winds above 8 m/s inhibit the occurrence of strong UHI in Lisbon. Summer nighttime strong UHI should be further investigated, due to the heat stress consequences on the population and probable increase of energy consumption.",

Evolutionary algorithms were used to select important features. Discriminant functions, such as support vector machine (SVM), k -nearest neighbors algorithm ( k -NN), and variant k -NN ( k -VNN), were adopted in discriminant analysis. We divided our modified AWS data into three parts: the training set, ranging from 2007 to 2008, the validation set, 2009, and the test set, 2010. The validation set was used to select an important subset from input features. The main features selected were precipitation sensing and accumulated precipitation for 24 hours . In comparative SVM tests using evolutionary algorithms, the results showed that genetic algorithm was considerably superior to differential evolution. The equitable treatment score of SVM with polynomial kernel was the highest among our experiments on average. k -VNN outperformed k -NN, but it was dominated by SVM with polynomial kernel.",

These cases, which represent 50% of the total number of strong rainfall episodes and 60% of the rainfall amount over the ENEB, were concomitant with an acceleration of the trade winds over the south-equatorial Atlantic, an excess of moisture transported westward from Africa to America, and a strengthening of the convective activity in the oceanic region close to Brazil. Most of these episodes occurred during positive sea surface temperature anomaly patterns over the entire south-equatorial Atlantic and low-frequency warm conditions within the oceanic mixing layer.

Based on high resolution reanalysis data from ECMWF, comprehensive analyses on the associated atmospheric circulation and the sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) were provided. The stable and strong West Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) was the direct cause for the heat wave. The WPSH had four westward extensions, which brought about four hot spells in southern China. The South Asia High (SAH) at 150 hPa was more eastward and more northward than normal. The strong Hadley circulation in the central and western Pacific and the anomalous easterlies at 500 hPa and 250 hPa in the middle and high latitudes were favorable for more hot days (HDs). The total HDs in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River had close relationships with the zonal wind anomalies in the middle and high latitudes, the SSTA in the Indian Ocean and Pacific, and the dry soil conditions of the Yangtze River Valley in spring and summer. The anomalies of the tropical, subtropical, and polar circulation and the underlying surfaces could be responsible for this extreme heat wave.",

    "abstract": "There is overall agreement that volcanic sulphate aerosols in the stratosphere can reduce solar radiation reaching the earth’s surface for years, thereby reducing surface temperatures, affecting global circulation patterns and generally the global climate system. However, the response of the climate system after large volcanic eruptions is not fully understood and global climate models have difficulties to reproduce the observed variability of the earth system after large volcanic eruptions until now. For geological timescales, it has been suggested that, in addition to the stratospheric climate forcing by volcanic sulphate aerosols, volcanic ash affects climate by modifying the global carbon cycle through iron fertilising the surface ocean and stimulating phytoplankton growth. This process has recently also been observed after the eruption of the volcano Kasatochi on the Aleutian Islands in summer 2008. To trigger future research on the effect of volcanic ash on the climate system via ocean iron fertilisation, this review paper describes the formation processes and atmospheric life cycles of volcanic sulphate and volcanic ash, contrasts their impact on climate, and emphasises current limitations in our understanding.",

Based on radiosonde measurements from Ny-Ålesund, a strong dependence of the tropospheric temperature on the synoptic flow direction is revealed. Using FLEXTRA backward trajectories, an increase of advection from the lower latitude Atlantic region towards Ny-Ålesund is found that is attributed to a change in atmospheric circulation patterns. We find that about one-quarter (0.45 K per decade) of the observed atmospheric winter near surface warming trend in the North Atlantic region of the Arctic (2 K per decade) is due to increased advection of warm and moist air from the lower latitude Atlantic region, affecting the entire troposphere.",

The core rainy seasons of March-April and June-July were identified for Fortaleza (northern NEB; NNEB) and Recife (eastern NEB; ENEB), respectively. Lagged linear regressions between sea surface temperature (SST) and pseudo wind stress (PWS) anomalies over the entire TA and strong rainfall anomalies at Fortaleza and Recife show that the rainfall variability of these regions is differentially influenced by the dynamics of the TA. When the Intertropical Convergence Zone is abnormally displaced southward a few months prior to the NNEB rainy season, the associated meridional mode increases humidity and precipitation during the rainy season. Additionally, this study shows predictive effect of SST, meridional PWS, and barrier layer thickness, in the Northwestern equatorial Atlantic, on the NNEB rainfall. The dynamical influence of the TA on the June-July ENEB rainfall variability shows a northwestward-propagating area of strong, positively correlated SST from the southeastern TA to the southwestern Atlantic warm pool (SAWP) offshore of Brazil. Our results also show predictive effect of SST, zonal PWS, and mixed layer depth, in the SAWP, on the ENEB rainfall.",

The Budyko-based Fu model and the double mass curve method are used to analyze runoff changes during the period 1958~2009. Then two types of hydrological models (the distributed Soil and Water Assessment Tool model and the lumped SIMHYD model) and seven climate elasticity methods (including a nonparametric method and six Budyko-based methods) are applied to estimate the contributions of climate change and human activities to runoff change. The results show that all quantification methods are effective, and the results obtained by the nine methods are generally consistent. During the study period, the effects of climate change on runoff change accounted for 28.3~46.8% while those of human activities contributed with 53.2~71.7%, indicating that both factors have significant effects on the runoff decline in the basin, and that the effects of human activities are relatively stronger than those of climate change.",

To investigate and quantify impacts of the two biggest lakes (Ngoring Lake and Gyaring Lake) of the Yellow River source region in the Tibetan Plateau on local climate, two simulations (with and without the two large lakes) from May 2010 to July 2011 are performed and analyzed using the WRF-CLM model (the weather research and forecasting model coupled with the community land model). Differences between simulated results show that the WRF-CLM model could provide realistic reproduction of surface observations and has better simulation after considering lakes. Lakes mostly reduce the maximum temperature all year round and increase the minimum temperature except in March due to the large heat capacity that makes lakes absorb (release) more energy for the same temperature change compared to land. Lakes increase precipitation over the lake area and in the nearby region, mostly during 02–14 BT (Beijing Time) of July to October when the warm lake surface induces the low level horizontal convergence and updraft over lake and provides energy and vapor to benefit the development of the convection for precipitation.",

Drought needs to be explained spatially to understand its spatiotemporal variations in different areas. In this paper, the meteorological drought has been shown by using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) method and illustrated through the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) method across Bangladesh. We used rainfall data of 30 meteorological stations in Bangladesh during the study period of 1981–2010. The results indicate that drought has been fluctuating and it has become a recurrent phenomenon during the study period. The SPI depicted the drought conditions that plunged dramatically in 1981, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1989, 1992, 1994, and 1996 and then gradually improved in 2004, 2006, and 2009 in the country. The present study demonstrated that drought occurred in Bangladesh on an average of 2.5 years. Drought was more prominent in the northern, south-western, and eastern regions in Bangladesh compared to the rest of the areas of the country. The outcomes of the present study will help in during disaster management strategies, particularly drought, by initiating effective plans and adaptation remedies in different areas of Bangladesh.",

The results show that the western side of the Black Sea has an enhanced wind power potential, especially in the vicinity of the Crimean Peninsula. As regards the Caspian Sea, the northeastern sector can be considered more energetic. A direct comparison of various wind parameters corresponding to the locations with higher potential in the two target areas considered was also carried out, in order to notice the similarities and the key features that could be taken into account in the development of an offshore wind project. Finally, it can be concluded that the coastal environments of the Black and the Caspian Seas can become in the near future promising locations for the wind energy extraction, as well as for the hybrid wind-wave energy farms that could play an important role also in the coastal protection.",

    "abstract": "Land-use/land cover change (LUCC) is one of the fundamental causes of global environmental change. In recent years, understanding the regional climate impact of LUCC has become a hot-discussed topic worldwide. Some studies have explored LUCC impact on regional climate in specific cities, provinces, or farming areas. However, the quick-urbanized areas, which are highly influenced by human activities, have the most severe land-use changes in developing countries, and their climatic impact cannot be ignored. This study aims to identify the impact of land-use change coupled with urbanization on regional temperature and precipitation in the metropolitan areas of middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China by means of spatial analysis and numeric methods. Based on the exploration of land-use change and climate change during 1988–2008, the impact of land-use transition from non-built-up area to built-up area on temperature and precipitation was analyzed. The results indicated that the land-use conversion has affected the regional temperature with an increasing effect in the study area, while the influence on precipitation was not so significant. The results can provide useful information for spatial planning policies in consideration of regional climate change.",

Here, we compare a range of precipitation grids for Australia. These datasets include products derived solely from in situ observations (interpolated datasets) and two products that combine both remote sensed data and in situ observations. We find that all precipitation grids have similar climatologies for annual aggregated precipitation totals and annual maximum precipitation. The temporal correlations of daily precipitation values are higher between the interpolated datasets, but the correlations between the most widely used interpolated product (AWAP) and the two remotely sensed products (TRMM and GPCP) are still reasonable. Our results, however, point to distinct structural uncertainties between those datasets gridding in situ observations and those datasets deriving precipitation estimates primarily from satellite measurements. All datasets analysed agree well for low to moderate daily precipitation amounts up to about 20 mm but diverge at upper quantiles, indicating that substantial uncertainty exists in gridded precipitation extremes over Australia.",

The results indicate that SPI and SSI have a decreasing trend during recent several decades. Monthly scales of SSI series have a significant decreasing trend from November to the following February and a significant increasing trend from May to July at Shilong hydrological station. There are three significant periodic variations with a cycle of 6-7 years, 11-12 years, and 20-21 years for annual scales of SSI series. SPI series have the same periodic variations before the 1980s, but they have not been synchronous with SSI since the 1980s at Shilong due to influences of Shanmei reservoir, especially at the periodic variations of 20-21 years. The variation of the lag time of hydrological drought in response to meteorological drought is significant at the seasonal scale. The lag time of hydrological drought to meteorological drought extends one month on average in spring, summer, and autumn but about three months in winter.",

It highlights various areas of trajectory applications and errors associated with trajectory calculations. South Asian region receives airmasses from Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Indian Ocean, and so forth, depending upon the season. These airmasses are responsible for export and import of pollutants depositing in nearby states. Trajectory analysis revealed that soil is contributed by the dust storms coming from Oman through Gulf and Iran, while most of black carbon (BC) sources are located in India. A detailed review of trajectories associated with wet deposition events indicated that airmasses coming from Europe and Middle East carry high concentration of acidic pollutants which are deposited in Himalayan ranges. Similarly, trajectory analysis revealed that acidic pollutants from continental anthropogenic sources are transported to an ecosensitive site in Western Ghats in India and the outward fluxes of anthropogenic activities of Indo-Gangetic region are transported towards Bay of Bengal. Hence, transboundary and long range transport of pollutants are very important issues in South Asia which need immediate attention of scientists and policy makers.",

Using hydrometeorological observations during 1964–2009, meteorological and hydrological droughts are firstly analyzed with the threshold level method. Then, a comprehensive analysis on the changes within the catchment is conducted on the basis of hydrological variables and socioeconomic indices, and the whole period is divided into two parts: the undisturbed period (1964–1979) and the disturbed period (1980–2009). A separating framework is further introduced to distinguish droughts induced by different causes, that is, the naturalized drought and human-induced drought. Results showed that human activities are more inclined to play a negative role in aggravating droughts. Drought duration and deficit volume in naturalized conditions are amplified two to four times and three to eight times, respectively, when human activities are involved. For the two dry decades 1980s and 2000s, human activities have caused several consecutive drought events with rather long durations (up to 29 months). These results reflect the considerable impacts of human activities on hydrological drought, which could provide some theoretical support for local drought mitigation and water resources management.",

An accurate understanding of water cycle, energy exchange, carbon cycle, and many other biogeophysical or biogeochemical processes in this area has become more and more important for climate change study. Due to the influences from complex topography and rapid variation in elevation, it is usually difficult for field measurements to capture the land-atmosphere interactions well, whereas land surface model (LSM) simulation provides a good alternative. A systematic review is introduced by pointing out the key issues for land surface processes simulation over complex terrain: (1) high spatial heterogeneity for land surface parameters in horizontal direction, (2) big variation of atmospheric forcing data in vertical direction related to elevation change, (3) scale effect on land surface parameterization in LSM, and (4) two-dimensional modelling which considers the gravity influence. Regarding these issues, it is promising for better simulation at this special region by involving higher spatial resolution atmospheric forcing data which can reflect the influences from topographic changes and making necessary improvements on model structure related to topographic factors. In addition, the incorporation of remote sensing techniques will significantly help to reduce uncertainties in model initialization, simulation, and validation.",

Five high-resolution satellite rainfall products (CPC RFE2.0, RFE2.0-Modified, CMORPH, GSMaP, and TRMM 3B42) were evaluated at different spatial and temporal resolutions (daily, dekadal, monthly, and seasonal) with observed rain gauge data from 2004 to 2006 to determine their ability to fill the data gap and suitability for use in hydrological and water resources management applications. Grid-to-grid (G-G) and catchment-to-catchment (C-C) comparisons were performed using the verification methods developed by the International Precipitation Working Group (IPWG). Comparing different products, RFE2.0-Modified, TRMM 3B42, and CMORPH performed best; they all detected heavy, moderate, and low rainfall but still significantly underestimated magnitude of rainfall, particularly in orographically influenced areas. Overall, RFE2.0-Modified performed best showing a high correlation coefficient with observed data and low mean absolute error, root mean square error, and multiple bias and is reasonably good at detecting the occurrence of rainfall. TRMM 3B42 showed the second best performance. The study demonstrates that there is a potential use of satellite rainfall in a data scarce region.",

It is a complex process and requires adequate representation of the local perturbations in weather prediction models. It mainly depends upon microphysical and mesoscale processes that act within the boundary layer. This study utilizes a multirule based diagnostic (MRD) approach using postprocessing of the model simulations for fog predictions. The empiricism involved in this approach is mainly to bridge the gap between mesoscale and microscale variables, which are related to mechanism of the fog formation. Fog occurrence is a common phenomenon during winter season over Delhi, India, with the passage of the western disturbances across northwestern part of the country accompanied with significant amount of moisture. This study implements the above cited approach for the prediction of occurrences of fog and its onset time over Delhi. For this purpose, a high resolution weather research and forecasting (WRF) model is used for fog simulations. The study involves depiction of model validation and postprocessing of the model simulations for MRD approach and its subsequent application to fog predictions. Through this approach model identified foggy and nonfoggy days successfully 94% of the time. Further, the onset of fog events is well captured within an accuracy of 30–90 minutes. This study demonstrates that the multirule based postprocessing approach is a useful and highly promising tool in improving the fog predictions.",

The existing research has focused on the characteristics of PM 2.5 and PM 10 , respectively, or analyzed the correlation between the two pollutants, while the ratio of PM 2.5 to PM 10 has been taken less consideration. In this study, daily mean PM 2.5 and PM 10 mass concentrations in 31 provincial capitals from 2014 to 2016 were used to present the temporal variations and spatial distribution of PM 2.5 /PM 10 ratios among eight economic regions. And then, statistical method and correlation analysis were adopted to investigate the relationship between the ratios and AQI, the rate of change on the ratios, and the impact of meteorological parameters on the ratios. The results indicated that PM 2.5 /PM 10 ratios showed an increasing trend from northwest to southeast due to different economic development and industrial types. The highest values were observed in winter among all regions, and the ratios on weekends were higher than that of on weekdays in most of the regions. Besides, domestic heating in northern China had a significant contribution to the ratios. Moreover, ratios had less changes, and the rate of change was stable in summer. As for air quality, the higher the ratio, the larger the possibility of high AQI so that the air pollution will be more severe. In terms of meteorological factors, the results demonstrated that relative humidity, precipitation, and pressure were the most important factors and had significantly positive impacts, while sunshine duration, temperature, and wind speed had negative effects on the ratios. The findings could identify the pollution sources among PM 10 and be helpful for making regulation locally to reduce emission which considers anthropogenic sources and meteorological diffusion simultaneously.",

The first two methods are physical, whereas the statistical method is purely mathematical. Comparing mean and median of <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M7\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math>, we find that the median is a more robust statistics because the mean varies by over four orders of magnitude across the three methods and the two campaigns. In general, the median <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M8\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math> exhibits little seasonal variability and a weak dependency on atmospheric stability, which was predominantly unstable (54–67%). With the goal of providing the most accurate estimates of wind speed near the hub height of modern turbines, the statistical method, despite delivering unrealistic <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M9\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math> values at times, gives the best estimates of 60 m winds, even when the 5 m wind speed from a nearby buoy is used as the reference. The unrealistic <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M10\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math> values are caused by nonmonotonic wind speed profiles, occurring about 41% of the time, and should not be rejected because they produce realistic fits. Furthermore, the statistical method outperforms the other two even though it does not need any stability information. In summary, if wind speed data from multiple levels are available, as is the case with vertically pointing floating lidar and meteorological towers, the statistical method is recommended, regardless of the seemingly unrealistic <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M11\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math> values at times. If multilevel wind speeds are not available but advanced sonic anemometry is available at one level, the analytical method is recommended over Charnock’s. Lastly, if a single, constant value of <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M12\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>z</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math> is sought after to characterize the region, we recommend the median from the statistical method, i.e., <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M13\"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>6.09</mml:mn><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mtext> m</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:math>, which is typical of rough seas.",

Compared to the inventories in 1970s, the areas of glaciers are reduced by 19.05% while the areas of glacial lakes are increased by 26.76%. The magnitudes of glacier retreat rate and glacial lake increase rate during the period of 2001–2013 are more significant than those for the period of the 1970s–2001. The accelerated changes in areas of the glaciers and glacial lakes, as well as the increasing temperature and rising variability of precipitation, have resulted in an increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) in the Pumqu river basin. Integrated criteria were established to identify potentially dangerous glacial lakes based on a bibliometric analysis method. It is found, in total, 19 glacial lakes were identified as dangerous. Such finding suggests that there is an immediate need to conduct field surveys not only to validate the findings, but also to acquire information for further use in order to assure the welfare of the humans.",

And the presence of cities cannot change the general state of the sea-land breeze (SLB) circulation and mountain-valley breeze (MVB) circulation but acted to modify these local circulations slightly.

ET fluctuated much more strongly in the 1990s than in the 1980s and 2000s, and, apart from in autumn, ET decreased in all seasons. In particular, ET in summer comprised about half of the annual ET trend and had the sharpest trend, dominating the interannual decline. ET also decreased more sharply in the semiarid than semihumid regions. The declining trend of ET was attributed to declining precipitation and air humidity. Locally, the ET trend was closely related to local mean annual precipitation: in areas with precipitation less than 400 mm, ET showed a decreasing trend; in areas with precipitation larger than 600 mm, ET showed an increasing trend; and in areas with precipitation in the range of 400–600 mm could be classified as a transitional zone.",

From the results of this work it was possible to estimate the average relative frequency of each type of cloud present in weather systems that influence the Northeast of Brazil. In general, the stratiform clouds and shallow convective clouds are the most frequent in this region, but the associated rainfall is not as abundant as precipitation caused by deep convective clouds. It is also seen that a strong signal of shallow convective clouds modulates rainfall over the coastal areas of Northeast of Brazil and adjacent ocean. In this scenario, the main objective of this study is to contribute to a better understanding of the patterns of cloud types associated with precipitation and building a climatological analysis from the classification of clouds.",

The data consist of 55 years (1961–2015) of daily rainfall, maximum temperature ( T max ), and minimum temperature ( T min ) records from 20 stations scattered throughout Sri Lanka. The linear trends were analyzed using the nonparametric Mann–Kendall test and Sen–Theil regression. The prewhitening method was first used to remove autocorrelation from the time series, and the modified seasonal Mann–Kendall test was then applied for the seasonal data. The results show that, during May, 15% of the stations showed a significant decrease in wet days, which may be due to the delayed southwest monsoon (SWM) to Sri Lanka. A remarkable increase in the annual average temperature of T min and T max was observed as 70% and 55% of the stations, respectively. For the entire period, 80% of the stations demonstrated statistically significant increases of T min during June and July. The daily temperature range (DTR) exhibited a widespread increase at the stations located within the southwestern coast region of Sri Lanka. Although changes in global climate, teleconnections, and local deforestation in recent decades at least partially influence the trends observed in Sri Lanka, a formal trend attribution study should be conducted.",

The satellite gridded data for rainfall are acquired from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) along with rainfall and temperature data from 15 ground stations of Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD). Data were analysed to identify changes in climatic parameters and spatiotemporal shift in monsoon precipitation in Pakistan. Analysis shows that there is significant correlation between TRMM and PMD datasets. Decrease in monsoon rainfall is observed during the last two decades. A more pronounced decrease is observed in monsoon rainfall during the years 2010–2017, i.e., 17.58 mm/year accompanied by 0.18°C increase in temperature. A southward spatial shift in monsoon rainfall occurrence (rainfall ≥2.5 mm/day) is observed while an eastward shift in moderate to heavy monsoon rainfall is identified.

The results revealed that an increase in rainfall and temperature would significantly and positively contribute to the land improvement, and conversion from cultivated land to grassland and forest land showed positive relationship with land improvement, while conversion to built-up area will lead to land degradation. Besides, human agricultural intensification represented by fertilizer utilization will help to improve the land quality. The economic development may exert positive impacts on land quality to alleviate land degradation, although the rural economic development and agricultural production will exert negative impacts on the land and lead to land degradation.

    "abstract": "The comprehensive assessment of the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) V05B is important for benchmarking the product’s continued improvement and future development. The performance of IMERG V05B precipitation products was systematically evaluated using 542 precipitation gauges at multiple spatiotemporal scales from March 2014 to February 2017 over China. Moreover, IMERG V05B was compared with IMERG V04A, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42, and the Climate Prediction Center Morphing technique (CMORPH)-CRT in this study. Categorical verification techniques and statistical methods are used to quantify their performance. Results illustrate the following. (1) Except for IMERG V04A’s severe underestimation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and Xinjiang (XJ) with high negative relative biases (RBs) and CMORPH-CRT’s overestimation over XJ with high positive RB, the four satellite-based precipitation products generally capture the same spatial patterns of precipitation over China. (2) At the annual scale over China, the IMERG products do not show an advantage over its predecessor (TRMM 3B42) in terms of RMSEs, RRMSEs, and Rs; meanwhile, the performance of IMERG products is worse than TRMM 3B42 in spring and summer according to the RMSE, RRMSE, and R metrics. Between the two IMERG products, IMERG V05B shows the anticipated improvement (over IMERG V04A) with a decrease in RMSE from 0.4496 to 0.4097 mm/day, a decrease of RRMSE from 16.95% to 15.44%, and an increase of R from 0.9689 to 0.9759 during the whole study period. Similar results are obtained at the seasonal scale. Among the four satellite products, CMORPH-CRT shows the worst seasonal performance with the highest RMSE (0.6247 mm/day), RRMSE (23.55%), and lowest R (0.9343) over China. (3) Over XJ and TP, IMERG V05B clearly improves the strong underestimation of precipitation in IMERG V04A with the RBs of 5.2% vs. −21.8% over XJ, and 2.78% vs. −46% over TP. Results at the annual scale are similar to those obtained at the seasonal scale, except for summer results over XJ. While, over the remaining subregions, the two IMERG products have a close performance; meanwhile, IMERG V04A slightly improves IMERG V05B’s overestimation according to RBs (except for HN) at the annual scale. However, all four products are unreliable over XJ at both an annual and seasonal scale. (4) Across all products, TRMM 3B42 best reproduces the probability density function (PDF) of daily precipitation intensity. (5) According to the categorical verification technique in this study, both IMERG products yield better results for the detection of precipitation events on the basis of probability of detection (POD) and critical success index (CSI) categorical evaluations compared to TRMM 3B42 and CMORPH-CRT over China and across most of the subregions. However, all four products have room for further improvement, especially in high-latitude and dry climate regions. These findings provide valuable feedback for both IMERG algorithm developers and data set users.",

Observations of 15 rain gauging stations were used for the evaluation of TMPA products. Results showed that the spatial pattern of precipitation in the event was generally captured by post-real-time product (3B42V7) but misplaced by real-time product (3B42RT), witnessed by a high spatial correlation coefficient for 3B42V7 (CC = 0.87) and low spatial correlation coefficient for 3B42RT (CC = 0.20). The temporal variation of the storm precipitation was not well captured by both TMPA products. 3B42V7 product underestimated the storm accumulated precipitation by 32.15%, while underestimation by 3B42RT was 66.73%. Based on the findings of this study, we suggest that the latest TMPA-based precipitation products, 3B42RT and 3B42V7, might not be able to perform well during extreme precipitation events, particularly in complex terrain regions like Hindukush Mountains. Therefore, cautions should be considered while using 3B42RT and 3B42V7 as input data source for the modelling, forecasting, and monitoring of floods and potential landslides in Hindukush Region.",

TRMM 3B42V7 data (TRMM precipitation) is an essential RSPP outperforming other RSPPs. Yet the utilization of TRMM precipitation is still limited by the inaccuracy and low spatial resolution at regional scale. In this paper, linear regression models (LRMs) have been constructed to correct and downscale the TRMM precipitation based on the gauge precipitation at 2257 stations over China from 1998 to 2013. Then, the corrected TRMM precipitation was validated by gauge precipitation at 839 out of 2257 stations in 2014 at station and grid scales. The results show that both monthly and annual LRMs have obviously improved the accuracy of corrected TRMM precipitation with acceptable error, and monthly LRM performs slightly better than annual LRM in Mideastern China. Although the performance of corrected TRMM precipitation from the LRMs has been increased in Northwest China and Tibetan plateau, the error of corrected TRMM precipitation is still significant due to the large deviation between TRMM precipitation and low-density gauge precipitation.",

In this study, we used remotely sensed rainfall and land surface temperature to investigate the spatiotemporal pattern and trend in vegetation condition using NDVI as proxy from 2001 to 2017 in a humid and dry tropical region. We also determined the partial correlation coefficient of temperature and rainfall with NDVI and the response of NDVI to changes in landcover categories due to human activities. We found that the mean annual maximum NDVI was 0.42, decreasing at a rate of 0.06 per decade. About 27.4% of the area was found to have experienced a significant negative trend in vegetation cover, while only 0.34% exhibited significant increasing vegetation vigour. Land surface temperature increased at a mean rate of 0.75°C/decade, with higher rates in agriculture, savanna, settlements, woodlands, and riparian vegetation than in forest and mangrove vegetations. Precipitation also reduced at a mean rate of 58.69 mm/decade, with higher rates in agriculture savanna and riparian vegetation than in sahelian grasslands, mangrove, forest, and woodlands. NDVI was negatively correlated with temperature in savanna, settlements, degraded forest, and sahelian grasslands providing confirmation of ongoing land degradation. It was concluded that vegetation vigour will continue to decline under rainfall and increasing temperature conditions especially in dryer regions. The use of land surface temperature in this study is particularly valuable in highlighting areas where changes in NDVI occurred as a result of synergistic action between climate and human-induced landcover changes. Our findings underscore the importance of landuse policies that account for spatial variation in synergistic relationships between the nexus of climate and land conversion processes that influence vegetation cover change in different landcover types in tropical regions.",

    "abstract": "Severe weather conditions will have a great impact on urban traffic. Automatic recognition of weather condition has important application value in traffic condition warning, automobile auxiliary driving, intelligent transportation system, and other aspects. With the rapid development of deep learning, deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) are used to recognize weather conditions on traffic road. A new simplified model named ResNet15 is proposed based on the residual network ResNet50 in this paper. The convolutional layers of ResNet15 are utilized to extract weather characteristics, and then the characteristics extracted at the previous layer are shortcut to the next layer through four groups of residual modules. Finally, the weather images are classified and recognized through the fully connected layer and Softmax classifier. In addition, we build a medium-scale dataset of weather images on traffic road, called “WeatherDataset-4,” which consists of 4 categories and contains 4983 weather images covering most of the severe weather. In this paper, ResNet15 is used to train and test on the “WeatherDataset-4,” and desirable recognition results are obtained. The evaluation of a large number of experiments demonstrates that the proposed ResNet15 is superior to traditional network models such as ResNet50 in recognition accuracy, recognition speed, and model size.",

    "abstract": "The impact of climate change is a global threat, and its effect is more pronounced in developing countries. It is vital to link physical data analysis with endogenous knowledge and practices of farmers to strengthen their adaptive capacity. This study was conducted to explore spatial variability and temporal trends of temperature and rainfall in association with farmers’ perceptions and their adaptation strategies in Southwest Ethiopia. Daily rainfall and temperature data of twelve weather stations were collected from the National Meteorological Agency of Ethiopia for the period 1983 to 2016. Farmers’ perceptions about climate change and its impact and their adaptation strategies were assessed through a survey. Spatial variability and temporal trends of rainfall and temperature were analyzed using ArcGIS and R software. Sen’s slope estimator and Mann–Kendall’s trend tests were used to detect the magnitude and statistical significance of changes in rainfall and temperature. Spatial analysis of rainfall showed high variability over the region. There were no consistent and significant temporal trends of annual and seasonal rainfall of the area. Significant and upward trends of annual maximum and minimum temperatures were reported for all stations. Accordingly, annual maximum and minimum temperatures were increased by 0.71 and 0.65°C, respectively, over the period 1983 to 2016. Farmers had a good awareness of climate change and its impact. Adaptation strategies used by farmers included soil and water conservation practices (66.21%), crop diversification (62.16%), modifying planting date (42.56%), agroforestry practices (35.13%), use of drought-tolerant variety (33.95%), use of early maturing crop (27.03%), and livelihood diversification (25.42%). As most of these adaptation strategies were familiarized by a small number of farmers, further effort is needed to identify factors limiting the adoption of these strategies. Furthermore, additional planned strategies and supports that widen available options at the farmers’ disposal should be introduced to strengthen their adaptive capacity.",

Recently, deep learning techniques have been applied to this field, and the effect is promoted remarkably compared with traditional methods.

In this paper, we propose to incorporate the multihead attention into a dual-channel neural network to highlight the key areas for precipitation forecast. Furthermore, to solve the problem of excessive loss of global information caused by the attention mechanism, the residual connection is introduced into the proposed model.

    "abstract": "Myanmar’s climate is heavily influenced by its geographic location and relief. Located between the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), Myanmar’s climate is distinguished by the alternation of seasons known as the monsoon. The north-south direction of peaks and valleys creates a pattern of alternate zones of heavy and scanty precipitation during both the northeast and southwest monsoons. The majority of the rainfall has come from Myanmar’s southwest monsoon (MSwM), which is Myanmar’s rainy season (summer in global terms, June–September). This study explained both threshold-based and nonthreshold-based objective definitions of the onset and withdrawal of large-scale MSwM. The seasonal transitions in MSwM circulation and precipitation are convincingly represented by the new index, which is based on change point detection of the atmospheric moisture flow converging in the MSwM region (10–28 N, 92–102 E). A transition in vertically integrated moisture transport (VIMT), the reversal of surface winds, and an increase in precipitation may also be considered when defining MSwM onset objectively. We also define a change point of the MSwM (CPI) index for MSwM onset and withdrawal dates. The climatological mean onset of MSwM is day 135 (May 14), withdrawal is day 278 (October 4), and the total season length is 144 days. We are investigating spatial patterns of rainfall progression at and after the start of the monsoon, rather than transitions within a single region of the MSwM. The local southwest monsoon duration is well correlated with the CPI duration on interannual timescales, particularly in the peak rainfall regions, with a delay (advance) in large-scale onset or withdrawal associated with a delay (advance) of onset or withdrawal by local index. Hence, the next phase of this research is to study the maintenance and break of the monsoon to understand the underlying physical processes governing the monsoon circulation. The results of this study provide a possibility to reconstruct Myanmar’s monsoon climate dynamics, and the findings of this study can help unravel many remaining questions regarding the greater Asian monsoon system’s variability.",

Assessesment of variability and trend of rainfall and temperature for the district of Musanze in Rwanda was conducted using six meteorological stations for a period of 37 years, ranging from 1981 to 2018, and data were obtained from Rwanda Meteorology Agency. Musanze district is located in highland areas of Rwanda, understanding the variability and trend in rainfall and temperature is paramount to increase the uptake of climate information and support strategic orientation. The Mann–Kendall nonparametric test and modified Mann–Kendall were used to assess the trend in rainfall and temperature, whereas Sen’s slope estimator was used to assess the magnitude of change. The results from both methods showed much similarity and consistency. The assessment of variability and trend in rainfall and temperature in Musanza district indicated that increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall trends gave an indication of changes in variability and trend in rainfall and temperature. The annual pattern revealed a substantial downward tendency of −25.7% for Nyange, the only station with constant decreasing trend over all seasons, DJF, −61.4%, SON, −12.2%, JJA, −40.3%, and MAM, −4.35. Temperature analysis for both maximum and minimum indicated increasing trend which was signal for constant warming up in the area. The results from coefficient of variation indicated a high disparity in rainfall variation from June to August which ranged between 51 and 74%, and other seasons changes were moderate.",

    "abstract": "The variability, intensity, and distribution of rainfall have drawn a lot of interest globally and especially in nations where rainfed agriculture is the norm. This article uses rainfall data from the Rwanda Meteorology Agency for the years 1981 to 2021 to delineate and analyze rainfall variability and trends in the Kayonza District. The time series were grouped using the K-means clustering technique based on computed Euclidean distance, the total within-cluster sum of squares, and the elbow plot technique to determine the optimal number of clusters. The coefficient of variation measures was employed to analyze rainfall variability, while Sen’s slope and the Mann–Kendall (MK) test were used, respectively, to find trends and changes in magnitude. The results indicated four near homogeneous zones named region one to four. The dry seasons indicated higher variability compared to rainy seasons and annual rainfall total with a variability of 128–142% over the southeastern part during June to August (JJA) season, while a variability of 16–48% was observed over most of the district during both annual and rainy seasons. It was further noted that the areas in the central part of the Kayonza District indicated a significant increasing trend at a significance level of 95% and above during January to February (JF), September to December (SOND), and on annual basis, while March to May (MAM) and JJA season exhibited no significant trend. The findings of this study are essential for creating adequate mitigation strategies to lessen climate change’s effects on agriculture as well as other socioeconomic sectors.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is an environmental challenge for rural communities that rely heavily on rainwater-based agriculture. The main goal of this study is to investigate spatiotemporal variability and trends in rainfall and temperature in southern Ethiopia. Extreme temperature and rainfall indices were computed using the ClimPACT2 software. The detection and quantification of trends in rainfall and temperature extremes were analyzed using a nonparametric modified Mann–Kendall (MMK) test and Sen’s slope estimator. Results indicated that the mean annual rainfall has a declining trend at Boditi School and Mayokote stations with a statistically significant amount at magnitudes of 0.02 mm and 0.04 mm, respectively. The highest average monthly rainfall in the catchment was observed in the months of April, May, June, July, and August up to maximum rainfall of 117.50 mm, 177.43 mm, and 228.84 mm in Bilate Tena, Boditi, and Mayakote stations, respectively. On a seasonal scale, rainfall in Bilate Tena station was highly variable in all months, ranging from 49.54% to 126.92%, and three seasons except spring which showed moderate variation at 40.65%. In addition, the three locations over the catchment exhibited varied drought signs such as severe (1.28 &lt; SRA &lt; 1.65) and extreme drought (SRA &gt; 1.65). The temperature indices, on the other hand, exhibited a warming trend over the catchment which was observed through an increased annual number of warm days (TX90p) and warm nights (TN90p) ranges from 0.274 to 6.03 and 0.274 to 3.16, respectively. The annual maximum value of the daily maximum temperature (TXx) ranges from 30.10 to 33.76°C in the three agroecological zones and showed low, medium, and high values in Dega, Woyna Dega, and Kola agroecologies, while the annual maximum value of the daily minimum temperature (TNx) ranged between 17 and 17.44°C at Dega and Kola, respectively. Therefore, based on trends in rainfall variability and persistent temperature rise, appropriate adaptation strategies should be adopted.",

The correlation coefficient for remotely sensed surface chlorophyll a concentration ([Chl‐ a ]) and liquid cloud effective radii over productive areas of the oceans varies between −0.2 and −0.6. Special attention is given to identifying (and addressing) problems from correlation analysis used in the previous studies that can lead to erroneous conclusions. A new approach (using the difference between retrieved AOD and predicted sea salt aerosol optical depth, AOD diff ) is developed to explore causal links between ocean physical and biological systems and the abundance of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the remote marine atmosphere. We have found that over multiple time periods, 550 nm AOD diff (sensitive to accumulation mode aerosol, which is the prime contributor to CCN) correlates well with [Chl‐ a ] over the productive waters of the Southern Ocean. Since [Chl‐ a ] can be used as a proxy of ocean biological productivity, our analysis demonstrates the role of ocean ecology in contributing CCN, thus shaping the microphysical properties of low‐level marine clouds.",

Study reveals that PRECIS simulations under scenarios of increasing greenhouse gas concentration and sulphate aerosols indicate marked increase in precipitation towards the end of the 21st century and is expected to increase throughout the year. However the changes in daily precipitation and the precipitation extremes during summer monsoon (June through September) season are prominent than during the rest of year. PRECIS simulations under both A2 and B2 scenarios indicate increase in frequency of heavy precipitation events and also enhancement in their intensity towards the end of the 21st century. Both A2 and B2 scenarios show similar patterns of projected changes in the precipitation extremes towards the end of the 21st century.

Using the National Centers for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis datasets, the climatological and dynamic character of blocking events for summer 2010 and a precursor May blocking event were examined. We found that these events were stronger and longer lived than typical warm season events. Using dynamic methods, we demonstrate that the July 2010 event was a synoptic-scale dominant blocking event; unusual in the summer season. An analysis of phase diagrams demonstrated that the planetary-scale did not become stable until almost one week after block onset. For all other blocking events studied here and previously, the planetary-scale became stable around onset. Analysis using area integrated regional enstrophy (IRE) demonstrated that for the July 2010 event, synoptic-scale IRE increased at block onset. This was similar for the May 2010 event, but different from case studies examined previously that demonstrated the planetary-scale IRE was prominent at block onset.",

The synoptic analysis on the dusty days showed the presence of low-pressure systems in the west coasts of Europe and the north Tyrrhenian Sea, respectively, associated with a trough reaching the north African coast. The result of these conditions was the strong surface and mid troposphere winds that carried significant amounts of dust over Greece. During the dusty days extensive cloud cover associated with the dust plume occurred over Greece. The air-mass trajectories showed a clear Saharan origin in all atmospheric levels, while the satellite (MODIS Terra/Aqua) observations as well as the model (DREAM) predictions verified the intense dust outbreaks over eastern Mediterranean and Greece.

Meanwhile, the changes in precipitation and surface runoff fluxes before and after the typical wetland degradation were discussed, and the effects of wetland degradation on soil organic carbon were assessed. Correlation and regression analyses were applied to exhibit the relationships between wetland landscape areas and meteorological factors. Our results showed that the cooling effects of wetlands on ambient environment were very obvious, and soil temperature could be higher in the area with less surrounding wetland area. The evaporation capacity and relative humidity in wetlands were higher compared to the surrounding non-wetlands. Precipitation and surface runoff flux decreased due to serious wetland degradation, indicating that wetland degradation or expansion had close relation with regional precipitation. Once peat soils were converted to meadow soils or Aeolian sandy soils, soil organic carbon (SOC) would decline linearly. Correlation and regression analyses showed that there were significant correlations between wetland landscape areas and the annual average air temperature, the average air temperature in growing seasons, and the evaporation in growing seasons (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.05</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math>).",

    "abstract": "The mesoscale atmospheric model WRF is used over three Svalbard glaciers. The simulations are done with a setup of the model corresponding to the state-of-the-art model for polar conditions, Polar WRF, and it was validated using surface observations. The ERA-Interim reanalysis was used for boundary forcing and the model was used with three nested smaller domains, 24 and 8 km, and 2.7 km resolution. The model was used for a two-year period as well as for a more detailed study using 3 summer and winter months. In addition sensitivity tests using finer horizontal and vertical resolution in the boundary layer and using different physics schemes were performed. Temperature and incoming short- and long-wave radiation were skillfully simulated, with lower agreement between measured and modelled wind speed. Increased vertical resolution improved the frequency distributions of the wind speed and the temperature. The choice of different physics schemes only slightly changed the model results. The polar-optimized microphysics scheme outperformed a slightly simpler microphysics scheme, but the two alternative and more sophisticated PBL schemes improved the model score. A PBL scheme developed for very stable stratifications (QNSE) proved to be better in the winter.",

    "abstract": "A hybrid 3DVAR-EnKF data assimilation algorithm is developed based on 3DVAR and ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) programs within the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS). The hybrid algorithm uses the extended alpha control variable approach to combine the static and ensemble-derived flow-dependent forecast error covariances. The hybrid variational analysis is performed using an equal weighting of static and flow-dependent error covariance as derived from ensemble forecasts. The method is first applied to the assimilation of simulated radar data for a supercell storm. Results obtained using 3DVAR (with static covariance entirely), hybrid 3DVAR-EnKF, and the EnKF are compared. When data from a single radar are used, the EnKF method provides the best results for the model dynamic variables, while the hybrid method provides the best results for hydrometeor related variables in term of rms errors. Although storm structures can be established reasonably well using 3DVAR, the rms errors are generally worse than seen from the other two methods. With two radars, the results from 3DVAR are closer to those from EnKF. Our tests indicate that the hybrid scheme can reduce the storm spin-up time because it fits the observations, especially the reflectivity observations, better than the EnKF and the 3DVAR at the beginning of the assimilation cycles.",

Key weather factors for diagnosing the air pollution intensity are identified and included in PLAM that include atmospheric condensation of water vapour, wet potential equivalent temperature, and wind velocity. It is found that the poor air quality days with elevated PM 10 are usually associated with higher PLAM values, featuring higher temperature, humidity, lower wind velocity, and higher stability compared to the averaged values in the same period. Both 24 h and 72 h forecasts provided useful services for the day of the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympic Games and subsequent sport events. A correlation coefficient of 0.82 was achieved between the forecasts and (air pollution index API) and 0.59 between the forecasts and observed PM 10 , all reaching the significant level of 0.001, for the summer period.

The procedures used included the Mann-Kendall test, the Mann-Kendall rank statistic test, and the Theil-Sen’s slope method. The analytical results indicated that when there were increasing and decreasing trends in the annual and seasonal precipitation and temperature, only the increasing trends were significant at the 95% confidence level. The Theil-Sen’s slope method showed that the rate of increment in the annual precipitation is greater than the seasonal precipitation. A bootstrap technique was applied to explore uncertainty about significant slope values for rainfall, as well as the maximum and minimum temperatures. The Mann-Kendall rank statistics test indicated that most of the trends in the annual and seasonal time series started in the year 2000.

The combined SB-HI produces direct circulation over the MASP and produces severe weather and socioeconomic impacts. All SB-HI episodes between 2005 and 2008 are identified and analyzed with surface and upper air measurements, weather radar, and satellite data. The current work indicates that intense SB-HI episodes are related to air and dew point temperatures above 30°C and 20°C, respectively, right after the passage of the SB front over MASP. Results indicate that the precipitation related to SB-HI episodes is up to 600 mm or about four times higher than that in rural or less urbanized areas in its surroundings. Measurements indicate that 74% of SB-HI episodes are related to NW winds in earlier afternoon hours. Moving cold fronts in southern Brazil tend to intensify the SB-HI circulation in MASP.

Annual rainfall and seasonal rainfall extending over a period of 81 years (1934–2014) recorded at Sharjah International Airport have been analyzed. To this end, several parametric and nonparametric statistical measures have been applied following systematic data quality assessment. The analyses revealed that the annual rainfall trend decreased from −3 mm to −9.4 mm per decade over the study periods. The decreasing annual rainfall trend is mainly driven by the significant drop in winter rainfall, particularly during the period from 1977 to 2014. The results also indicate that high probability extreme events have shifted toward low frequency (12.7 years) with significant variations in monthly rainfall patterns and periodicity. The findings of the present study suggest reevaluating the derivation of design rainfall for infrastructure of Sharjah City and urge developing an integrated framework for its water resources planning and risk under climate change impacts scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Precipitation concentration is an important component of climate, and an unbalanced distribution of precipitation can yield excess or scarcity of water resources, which in turn can influence plant growth, flood risk, and water resource use. The precipitation concentration index (PCI) is a well-known indicator for the measurement of temporal precipitation in a short or long area. The purpose of this study was to analyze precipitation concentration rates in different regions of Bangladesh using the precipitation concentration index (PCI) and the inverse distance weighting method. In this study, the rainfall data from 30 meteorological observatory stations across Bangladesh were collected for the period 1980 to 2011. We defined periods of varying lengths (i.e., annual, supraseasonal, seasonal, and three- and two-month rainfall concentrations) and compared their PCI values. The results showed that precipitation concentrations were mostly irregular when rainfall was concentrated within two to four months of the year. Higher PCI values were mainly identified in the eastern region and have strong seasonal influences, whereas lower PCI values were mostly observed in the northern region. The analyses of periodic variation and precipitation in Bangladesh generally follow through the SW–NE direction due to the summer monsoon, while during the winter monsoon, they follow the N–S direction where JAS and JFM showed higher and lower PCI values. We observed variations in PCI among different regions using the Kruskal–Wallis test of the mean PCI on a decadal scale (1980–1989, 1990–1999, and 2000–2011). The result showed that significant changes in the precipitation occurred during the period of 1980–2011. At a two-month scale, significant changes were identified during transition periods where PCI values were lower from 2000 to 2011 than those in the earlier decades.",

A total of 95 samples, including precipitation, groundwater, and glacial meltwater, were collected and analyzed for stable water isotopes ( 18 O and 2 H) and major chemical ion parameters (potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, sulfate, chloride, and bicarbonate). Based on the isotope and water chemistry data, we applied end member mixing analysis (EMMA) to identify and quantify the major runoff generating sources and their contributions. The contributions of groundwater, precipitation, and glacial meltwater were 66.7%, 19.9%, and 13.4%, respectively. The study indicated that groundwater dominated runoff in the headwater area of Shule River Basin. The roles of glacier meltwater should be remarkable in water resource management in this basin. The uncertainties of the EMMA method were summarized and estimated via a classical Gaussian error propagation technique. Analyses suggested that the uncertainty in the measurement method was less important than that in the temporal and spatial variations of tracer concentrations. The uncertainty was sensitive when the difference between mixing components was small. Therefore, the variation of tracers and the difference of mixing components should be considered when hydrograph separation was applied in the basin.",

We find an average value of NO 2 1.0 ± 0.05 × 10 15 molec/cm 2 and a significant decadal increase of 14%. The elevating NO 2 pollution over the region is linked to rise in motor vehicles and industrial and agricultural activities and increase in biomass fuel usage. The observed seasonality of NO 2 is associated with change in meteorological conditions and seasonal cycles of anthropogenic emissions. OMI data reveal a seasonal peak in spring followed by winter largely linked to metrological conditions and anthropogenic emissions from crop residue and biomass burning for heating purpose, and low concentration in summer is mostly attributed to meteorological conditions. Significant increase, up to 42%, in NO 2 concentrations over northwestern IGB, is observed connected to large scale postmonsoon crop residue events of 2010 and 2012. It is seen that NO 2 is mounting over all the hotspot locations and most of the cities.

The depolarization lidar registered 13 dust events, most of which occurred in the spring (5 events) and winter (6 events). The dust layers occurred at heights of approximately 1.4–3.5 km.

    "abstract": "Atmospheric aerosols can interact with clouds and influence the hydrological cycle by acting as cloud condensation nuclei. The current study reviews the results obtained on aerosol-precipitation interactions over India and the surrounding oceanic regions. An analysis of aerosol and cloud characteristics over the Arabian Sea, India, and the Bay of Bengal during summer monsoon in the last decade reveals large regional, intraseasonal, and interannual variations. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol absorbing index (AAI) in 2002 (a drought year) are higher over India when compared to normal monsoon years. Cloud effective radius (CER) and cloud optical thickness exhibit a negative correlation with AOD over India, which agrees well with the indirect radiative effects of aerosols. Over Bay of Bengal CER is positively correlated with AOD suggesting an inverse aerosol indirect effect. In future, observatories to measure aerosol characteristics (amount, size, type, chemical composition, mixing, vertical and horizontal distributions), and cloud properties (number and size) over several locations in India, and intense observational campaigns involving aircraft and ships are crucial to unravel the quantitative impact that aerosols have on Indian monsoon. Satellite remote sensing of aerosol distribution, their chemical composition, microphysical properties of clouds, solar irradiance, and terrestrial longwave radiation is important.",

    "abstract": "Precipitation is an essential input parameter for land surface models because it controls a large variety of environmental processes. However, the commonly sparse meteorological networks in complex terrains are unable to provide the information needed for many applications. Therefore, downscaling local precipitation is necessary. To this end, a new machine learning method, LASSO algorithm (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), is used to address the disparity between ERA-Interim forecast precipitation data (0.25° grid) and point-scale meteorological observations. LASSO was tested and validated against other three downscaling methods, local intensity scaling (LOCI), quantile-mapping (QM), and stepwise regression (Stepwise) at 50 meteorological stations, located in the high mountainous region of the central Alps. The downscaling procedure is implemented in two steps. Firstly, the dry or wet days are classified and the precipitation amounts conditional on the occurrence of wet days are modeled subsequently. Compared to other three downscaling methods, LASSO shows the best performances in precipitation occurrence and precipitation amount prediction on average. Furthermore, LASSO could reduce the error for certain sites, where no improvement could be seen when LOCI and QM were used. This study proves that LASSO is a reasonable alternative to other statistical methods with respect to the downscaling of precipitation data.",

At each model time step, the calculated effective radii of hydrometeors from the WDM6 scheme are linked to the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for GCMs (RRTMG) scheme to consider the cloud effects in radiative flux calculation. This coupling effect of cloud properties between the WDM6 and RRTMG algorithms is examined for a heavy rainfall event in Korea during 25–27 July 2011, and it is compared to the results from the control simulation in which the effective radius is prescribed as a constant value. It is found that the derived radii of hydrometeors in the WDM6 scheme are generally larger than the prescribed values in the RRTMG scheme. Consequently, shortwave fluxes reaching the ground (SWDOWN) are increased over less cloudy regions, showing a better agreement with a satellite image. The overall distribution of the 24-hour accumulated rainfall is not affected but its amount is changed. A spurious rainfall peak over the Yellow Sea is alleviated, whereas the local maximum in the central part of the peninsula is increased.",

The contribution of the extreme rainfall amount reaches ~50–90% in the northern region while it is ~30–50% in the south. The yearly cumulated extreme rainfall amount indicates significant and negative trends in the 6°N–12°N; 6°N–12°N; 17°W–10°W and 4°N–7°N; 4°N–7°N; 6°E–10°E 4°N–7°N; 6°E–10°E 4°N–7°N; 6°E–10°E domains, while the number of days exhibits nonsignificant trends over West Africa. The empirical orthogonal functions performed on the standardized anomalies show four variability modes that include all West Africa with a focus on the Sahelian region, the eastern region including the south of Nigeria, the western part including Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea-Bissau, and finally a small region at the coast of Ghana and Togo. These four modes are influenced differently by the large-scale ocean surface and atmospheric conditions in the tropical Atlantic. The results are applicable in planning the risks associated with these climate hazards, particularly on water resource management and civil defense.",

Because cultivated land resources are fairly limited, bioenergy development may rely on the exploitation of marginal land. This study focused on the assessment of marginal land resources and biofuel potential in Asia. A multiple factor analysis method was used to identify marginal land for bioenergy development in Asia using multiple datasets including remote sensing-derived land cover, meteorological data, soil data, and characteristics of energy plants and Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. A combined planting zonation strategy was proposed, which targeted three species of energy plants, including Pistacia chinensis (P. chinensis), Jatropha curcas L. (JCL) , and Cassava . The marginal land with potential for planting these types of energy plants was identified for each 1 km 2 pixel across Asia. The results indicated that the areas with marginal land suitable for Cassava , P. chinensis , and JCL were established to be 1.12 million, 2.41 million, and 0.237 million km 2 , respectively. Shrub land, sparse forest, and grassland are the major classifications of exploitable land. The spatial distribution of the analysis and suggestions for regional planning of bioenergy are also discussed.",

The dynamic process of this ozone episode was studied using an integrated numerical model, that is, a mesoscale meteorological model and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Model performance has been evaluated using both ground-based meteorological and air quality observations. Analysis of simulated wind fields and ozone budget has been performed. This dynamic process is summarized into three physical factors. First, the westerly wind placed Hong Kong directly downwind of the PRD emissions. Second, the convergence of wind flow stimulated a vertical local circulation near the surface layer. This recirculation allowed primary and secondary pollutants to accumulate. Third, the conditions of high air temperature and low humidity resulted in active photochemical reactions. These combined effects resulted in the formation of high ozone in this episode.",

This paper examines the spatiotemporal variation of the diurnal surface urban heat island (SUHI) in Shanghai from 1989 to 2013, a period during which the city has experienced drastic development changes. A remote sensing approach was taken to derive the spatial patterns of Shanghai’s land surface temperature (LST) from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images and Operational Land Imager (OLI) data. The LST pattern was further classified into five LST classes to look at the relative SUHI intensity level across the whole city. Spatial analyses, namely, spatial association and centroid movement analysis, were conducted to reveal the trends of LST changes at both local and holistic scales. To understand the potential drivers for the present spatiotemporal variation of SUHI, different indicators including land use change, population density, night light data, and vegetation were analyzed and compared with LST changes. Based on the quantitative analysis and the socioeconomic context of Shanghai, “heating up” regions were identified, possible reasons for such SUHI variation were summarized, and districts that are most vulnerable to extreme heat conditions were projected. In terms of implication for urban development, planning and design recommendations were suggested to improve the urban thermal environment in Shanghai.",

The evaluation was conducted by comparing the WRF simulations with the present land use and no-urban land use (replacing “Urban” with “Paddy”) for August from 2006 to 2010. The urbanization increased mean air temperature by 2.1°C in urban areas because of increased sensible heat flux and decreased mean humidity by 0.8 g kg −1 because of decreased latent heat flux. In addition, the urbanization increased duration of the southwesterly sea breeze. The urbanization increased precipitation in urban areas and decreased in the surrounding areas. The mean precipitation in urban areas was increased by 20 mm month −1 (27% of the total amount without the synoptic-scale precipitation). The precipitation increase was generally due to the enhancement of the formation and development of convective clouds by the increase in sensible heat flux during afternoon and evening time periods. The urbanization in Osaka changes spatial and temporal distribution patterns of precipitation and evaporation, and consequently it substantially affects the water cycle in and around the urban areas of Osaka.",

In the present study, we assessed the effects of two vital ecological restoration policies (Grain-for-Green and Grain-for-Blue) on valued ecosystem services in Shandong province. A new method based on the net primary productivity and soil erosion was developed to assess the ecosystem service value. In the areas implementing the Grain-for-Green and Grain-for-Blue policies, the ecosystem service value increased by 24.01% and 43.10% during 2000–2008, respectively. However, comparing to the average increase of ecosystem service value (46.00%) in the whole of Shandong province in the same period, Grain-for-Green and Grain-for-Blue did not significantly improve overall ecosystem services. The ecological restoration policy led to significant tradeoffs in ecosystem services. Grain-for-Green improved the ecosystem service function of nutrient cycling, organic material provision, and regulation of gases but decreased that of water conservation. Grain-for-Blue increased the water conservation function but led to a reduction in the function of soil conservation and nutrient cycling.",

Lin-Purdué, Thompson, and Morrison microphysics schemes were tested, as well as the Grell–Freitas, Grell 3d, and Betts–Miller–Janjic cumulus parameterizations. The tested boundary layer schemes were the Yonsei University and Mellor–Yamada–Janjic. A control configuration was defined, using the Thompson, Grell–Freitas, and Yonsei University schemes, and a set of numerical experiments is made, using different combinations of parameterizations. Data from 19 local meteorological stations and regional and global gridded were used for verification. It was concluded that all the configurations overestimate precipitation, but the one using the Morrison microphysical scheme had the best performance, based on the indicators of bias (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:math>) and root mean square error (RMSE). It is recommended not to use the Betts–Miller–Janjic scheme in this region for low resolution domains. Categorical forecast verification of the occurrence of rainfall as a binary variable showed detection rates higher than 85%. According to this criterion, the best performing configuration was the combination of Betts–Miller–Janjic and Morrison. Spatial verification showed that, even if all the configurations overestimated precipitation in some degree, spatial patterns of rainfall match the TRMM and PISCO rainfall data. Morrison’s microphysics scheme shows the best results, and consequently, this configuration is recommended for short- and medium-term rainfall forecasting tasks in the Central Andes of Peru and particularly in the Mantaro basin. The results of a special sensitivity experiment showed that the activation or not of cumulus parametrization for the domain of 3 km resolution is not relevant for the precipitation forecast in the study region.",

Nevertheless, little has been done regarding the ability of CHIRPS for the assessment of wet and dry conditions, particularly in areas where in situ precipitation records are scarce. In this paper, we investigated the performance of CHIRPS for monitoring wet and dry events along the semiarid Central-Western Argentina. Using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), we compared the CHIRPS database with records from 49 meteorological stations along the study area for the period 1987–2016. Results indicate that the CHIRPS dataset adequately reproduced the temporal variability of SPI on multiple timescales (1 month, 3 months, and 6 months), particularly in the region dominated by warm season precipitation. The large overestimation of the seasonal precipitation in the region dominated by cold season precipitation can introduce errors that are reflected in the performance of CHIRPS over the western portion of the domain. The frequency of wet and dry classes was accurately reproduced by CHIRPS on timescales larger than 1 month (SPI1), given the existence of a wet bias that produces an underestimation of the frequency of zero values. This bias is further translated to the evaluation of the SPI1 during the spatial and temporal assessment of historical dry (1998) and wet (2016) events, especially for the classification of extreme dry/wet months. The results from the evaluation indicate that CHIRPS is a suitable tool for assessing dry and wet conditions for timescales longer than 1 month and can support decision-making process within the hydrometeorological agencies over the region.",

    "abstract": "Exploring the impacts of climate change on agriculture is one of important topics with respect to climate change. We quantitatively examined the impacts of climate change on winter wheat yield in Northern China using the Cobb–Douglas production function. Utilizing time-series data of agricultural production and meteorological observations from 1981 to 2016, the impacts of climatic factors on wheat production were assessed. It was found that the contribution of climatic factors to winter wheat yield per unit area (WYPA) was 0.762–1.921% in absolute terms. Growing season average temperature (GSAT) had a negative impact on WYPA for the period of 1981–2016. A 1% increase in GSAT could lead to a loss of 0.109% of WYPA when the other factors were constant. While growing season precipitation (GSP) had a positive impact on WYPA, as a 1% increase in GSP could result in 0.186% increase in WYPA, other factors kept constant. Then, the impacts on WYPA for the period 2021–2050 under two different emissions scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 were forecasted. For the whole study area, GSAT is projected to increase 1.37°C under RCP4.5 and 1.54°C under RCP8.5 for the period 2021–2050, which will lower the average WYPA by 1.75% and 1.97%, respectively. GSP is tended to increase by 17.31% under RCP4.5 and 22.22% under RCP8.5 and will give a rise of 3.22% and 4.13% in WYPA. The comprehensive effect of GSAT and GSP will increase WYPA by 1.47% under RCP4.5 and 2.16% under RCP8.5.",

Without consideration of uncertainty, the evapotranspiration values estimated by BREB, ML, and EC were 270.6 mm, 238.9 mm, and 236.1 mm, respectively. Significant correlation existed between the evapotranspiration results by the three methods. Uncertainties of the evapotranspiration estimation by BREB, ML, and EC were 19.6 mm, 15.6 mm, and 15.1 mm, respectively. Deduced by facts on the natural and vegetation conditions, the value of evapotranspiration should be equal to that of precipitation, that is, about 252 mm. From this point, the evapotranspiration values estimated by the three methods were within a reliable range. The EC method has larger advantage and wider scope for the estimation of evapotranspiration in alpine meadow area.",

The model performance for LRT and local pollution (LP) of PM 2.5 was evaluated to identify the model processes that need to be improved. CMAQ well simulated temporal and spatial variation patterns of PM 2.5 but underestimated the concentration level by 15% on average. The contribution of LRT was estimated from the difference between the baseline simulation case and a zero-emission case for anthropogenic emissions in the continent. The estimated LRT contribution to PM 2.5 was 50% on average and generally higher in the western areas of Japan (closer to the continent). Days that were dominantly affected by LRT or LP were determined based on the contribution of LRT to sulfate, which was fairly well simulated and strongly affected by LRT among major PM 2.5 components. The underestimation of PM 2.5 was larger in LP days (by 26% on average) than LRT days (by 10% on average). Therefore, it is essential to improve local emissions, formation, and loss processes of precursors and PM 2.5 in Japan.",

The results obtained from the present work were interpreted by comparing them with the standards of different countries. The relations between all parameters were statistically examined by means of correlation and regression analysis in SPSS 17 statistical program. As a result, it was observed that indoor temperature was lower than the standards, yet carbon dioxide and PM values were higher than the upper limit, but relative humidity level was within comfort conditions. The average indoor radon concentrations were found to be below the recommended reference levels for International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), yet it was seen that the results were relatively higher in comparison with the worldwide values. In addition, it was determined that there was a meaningful relation between outdoor relative humidity, indoor relative humidity, and particulate matters in different diameters.

The CINRAD network consists of 217 radars comprising 123 S-band and 94 C-band radars over mainland China. In this paper, a high-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) and beam propagation simulations are used to compute radar beam blockage and evaluate the effective radar coverage over China. Results show that the radar coverage at a height of 1 km above ground level (AGL) is restricted in complex terrain regions. The effective coverage maps at heights of 2 km and 3 km AGL indicate that the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and North China Plain have more overlapping radar coverage than other regions in China. Over eastern China, almost all areas can be sampled by more than 2 radars within 5 km above mean sea level (MSL), but the radars operating in Qinghai-Tibet Plateau still suffer from serious beam blockage caused by intervening terrain. Overall, the radars installed in western China suffer from much more severe beam blockage than those deployed in eastern China. Maps generated in this study will inform users of the CINRAD data of their limitations for use in precipitation estimation, as inputs to other weather and hydrological models, and for satellite validation studies.",

Partial autocorrelation function is adopted to analyze the inner relationships between the historical wind speed series in order to determine input variables of LSSVM models for prediction of every subseries. Finally, the superposition principle is employed to sum the predicted values of every subseries as the final wind speed prediction. The performance of hybrid model is evaluated based on six metrics.

Among the six satellite-based rainfall products, adjusted CMORPH exhibits the best accuracy of the wet season rainfall estimate. In the secondary rainy season, unadjusted CMORPH and 3B42V7 are nearly equivalent in terms of bias, POD, and CSI error metrics. All error metric statistics show that MSWEP outperform both unadjusted and gauge adjusted ERA-Interim estimates. The magnitude of error metrics is linearly increasing with increasing percentile threshold values of gauge rainfall categories. Overall, all precipitation datasets need further improvement in terms of detection during the occurrence of high rainfall intensity. MSWEP detects higher percentiles values better than satellite estimate in the wet and poor in the secondary rainy seasons.",

    "abstract": "The statistical characteristics of precipitation play important roles not only in flood and drought risk assessments but also in water resource management. This paper implements a statistical analysis to study the spatial and temporal variability in precipitation in the upper reaches of the Hongshui River basin (UHRB), southwestern China, by analysing time series of daily precipitation from 18 weather stations during the period of 1959 to 2015. To detect precipitation concentrations and the associated patterns, three indices, the precipitation concentration index (PCI), precipitation concentration degree (PCD), and precipitation concentration period (PCP), were used. The relationships between the precipitation concentration indices (PCI, PCD, and PCP) and geographic variables (latitude, longitude, and elevation), large-scale atmospheric circulation indices, and summer monsoon indices were investigated to identify specific dependencies and spatial patterns in the precipitation distribution and concentration. The results show that high PCI values were mainly observed in the northeastern portion of the basin, whereas low PCI values were mainly detected in the southwest. The Mann-Kendall test results demonstrate that the majority of the UHRB is characterized by nonsignificant trends in the PCI, PCD, and PCP from 1959 to 2015. The PCP results reveal that rainfall in the UHRB mainly occurs in summer months, and the rainy season arrives earlier in the eastern UHRB than in the western UHRB. Additionally, the PCD results indicate that the rainfall in the western UHRB is more dispersed throughout the year than that in the eastern UHRB. Compared with other geographical factors, longitude is the most important variable that governs the spatial distribution and variations in annual precipitation and the precipitation concentration indices. Due to a combination of topography, the Indian subtropical high, and monsoon weakening, precipitation may be more concentrated in one period, especially in the eastern part of the basin, which increases the risk of drought.",

Values of the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) calculated using station-based meteorological data collected from 1961 to 2013 in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MLRYRB) are used to monitor droughts. In addition, the SPEI is determined for different timescales (1, 3, 6, and 12 months) to characterize dry or wet conditions in this study area. Moreover, remote sensing methods can cover large areas, and multispectral and temporal observations are provided by satellite sensors. The temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) is selected to permit assessment of drought conditions. In addition, the correlation between the SPEI and TVDI values is calculated. The results show that the SPEI values over different timescales reflect complex variations in drought conditions and have been well applied in the MLRYRB. Droughts occurred on an annual basis in 1963, 1966, 1971, 1978, 1979, 1986, 2001, 2011, and 2013, particularly 2011. In addition, the regional average drought frequency in the study area during 1961–2013 is 30%, as determined using the SPEI. An analysis of the correlation between the monthly values of the TVDI and the SPEI-3 shows that a negative relationship exists between the SPEI-3 and the TVDI. That is, smaller TVDI values are associated with greater SPEI-3 values and reduced drought conditions, whereas larger TVDI values are associated with smaller SPEI-3 values and enhanced drought conditions. Therefore, this study of the relationship between the SPEI and the TVDI can provide a basis for government to mitigate the effects of drought.",

Model performance was tested under both moderate and extreme flow conditions. Extreme events for the model performance evaluation were extracted based on seven criteria. Apart from graphical techniques, there were nine statistical “goodness-of-fit” metrics used to judge the model performance. It was found that whereas the influence of model selection may be minimal in the simulation of normal flow events, it can lead to large under- and/or overestimations of extreme events. Besides, the selection of the best model for extreme events may be influenced by the choice of the statistical “goodness-of-fit” measures as well as the criteria for extraction of high and low flows. It was noted that the use of overall water-balance-based objective function not only is suitable for moderate flow conditions but also influences the models to perform better for high flows than low flows. Thus, the choice of a particular model is recommended to be made on a case by case basis with respect to the objectives of the modeling as well as the results from evaluation of the intermodel differences.",

As one of the most polluted regions in China, air quality in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region has attracted more attention. This paper aims to study the characteristics of SO 2 distribution and variation over BTH. Spatial and temporal variations for a long term (2006–2017) over BTH derived from OMI PBL SO 2 products were discussed. The temporal trends confirm that the SO 2 loading falls from average 0.88 DU to 0.16 DU in the past 12 years. Two ascending fluctuations in 2007 and 2011 appeared to be closely related to the economic stimulus of each five-year plan (FYP). The spatial analysis indicates an imbalanced spatial distribution pattern, with higher SO 2 level in the southern BTH and lower in the northern. This is a result of both natural and human factors. Meanwhile, the SO 2 concentration demonstrates a decreasing trend with 14.92%, 28.57%, and 27.43% compared with 2006, during the events of 2008 Olympic Games, 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, and 2015 Military Parade, respectively. The improvement indicates that the direct effect is attributed to a series of long-term and short-term control measures, which have been implemented by the government. The findings of this study are desirable to assist local policy makers in the BTH for drawing up control strategies regarding the mitigation of environmental pollution in the future.",

A study exposing specific areas of concern for appropriate responses in this regard is a welcome one. This study sought to describe the temporal variations in temperature and rainfall in the Bawku Area of Ghana. A forty-year (1976–2015) daily climate data was collected on three meteorological stations from the Ghana Meteorological Agency. Normality test, homogeneity test, Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) analysis, Mann–Kendall trend test, and One-way post hoc ANOVA were performed using XLSTAT and DrinC. Over the period under study, the mean annual rainfall pattern was generally erratic, fluctuating between 669.8 mm and 1339.4.6 mm with an annual average of 935.3 mm.

    "abstract": "Accurately estimating the amount of evaporation loss is necessary for scheduling and calculating irrigation water requirements. In this study, four machine learning (ML) modeling approaches, extreme learning machine (ELM), gradient boosting machine (GBM), quantile random forest (QRF), and Gaussian process regression (GPR), have been developed to estimate the monthly evaporation loss over two stations located in Iraq. Monthly climatical parameters have been used as an input variable for simulating the evaporation rate. Several statistical measures (e.g., mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and modified index of agreement (Md)), as well as graphical inspection, were used to compare the performances of the applied models. The results showed that the GBM model has much better performance in predicting monthly evaporation over two stations compared to other applied models. For the first case study which was in Diyala, the results showed a prediction enhancement in terms of MAE and RMSE by 7.17%, 21.01%; 16.51%, 15.74%; and 23.14%, 26.64%; using GBM compared to ELM, GPR, and QRF, respectively. However, for the second case study (in Erbil), the prediction enhancement was improved in terms of reduction of MAE and RMSE by 10.88%, 9.24%; 15.24%, 5%; and 16.06%, 15.76%; respectively, compared to ELM, GPR, and QRF models. The results of the proposed GMBM model can therefore assist local stakeholders in the management of water resources.",

    "abstract": "The doubt in the calculation algorithm of the standardized precipitation index (SPI), which is widely preferred in the evaluation and monitoring of drought, still remains up-to-date because its calculation process is performed in the form of standardization or normalization with a default probability distribution. Therefore, the success of this index is directly affected by the choice of the probability distribution model. This study is based on the effect of three different parameter estimation methods on the calculation process, as well as the comparison of the SPI results calculated based on the default Gamma distribution and the distribution with the best ability to represent the 3-and 12-month consecutive summed rainfall data among the 15 candidate distributions namely Gamma (GAM), Generalized Extreme Value (GEV), Pearson Type III (P III), Log Pearson Type III (LP III), two-parameter Lognormal (LN2), three-parameter Lognormal (LN3), Generalized Logistic (GLOG), Extreme Value Type I (EVI), Generalized Pareto (GPAR), Weilbul (W), Normal (N), Exponential (EXP), Logistic (LOG), four-parameter Wakeby (WK4), and five-parameter Wakeby (WK5) distributions. Approximately 68.4% and 18.4% of the 3-month data considered had the best fit to the Weibull and Pearson III distribution, while approximately 24% and 18% of the 12-month data had the best fit to the Weibull and Logistic distribution. On the other hand, it was found that the default Gamma distribution calculated the extreme drought categories significantly more than the best-fit distribution model. In terms of parameter estimation methods, L-moments for 3-month series and maximum likelihood approaches for 12-month series were most dominant.",

    "abstract": "An increasing trend in ground‐level ozone (O 3 ) concentrations has recently been recognized in Japan, although concentrations of ozone precursors, nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) have decreased. In this paper, the relationship between meteorological factors (temperature and wind speed) and ground‐level ozone concentrations in the summer over the central Kanto area of Japan was examined using both statistical analyses and numerical models. The Fifth‐Generation NCAR/Penn State Mesoscale Model (MM5) and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model were employed in this study. It was found that there is a close relationship between meteorological conditions and ground‐level ozone concentrations over the central Kanto area. In summer, up to 84% of the long‐term variation in peak ozone concentrations may be accounted for by changes in the seasonally averaged daily maximum temperature and seasonally averaged wind speed, while about 70% of the recent short‐term variation in peak ozone depends on the daily maximum temperature and the daily averaged wind speed. The results of numerical simulations also indicate that urban heat island (UHI) phenomena can play an important role in the formation of high ozone concentrations in this area.",

The model sensitivity is studied for meteorological and gaseous criteria pollutants (O 3 , NO 2 ) using three Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) and four land surface model (LSM) schemes and comparison of model results with monitoring station observations. Results indicated that a few combinations of PBL and LSMs could reasonably produce realistic meteorological fields and that the combination of Yonsei University (YSU) PBL and NOAH LSM provides best predictions for winds, temperature, humidity and mixed layer depth in the study region for the period of study. The diurnal range in ozone concentration is better estimated by the YSU PBL in association with either 5‐layer or NOAH land surface model. The model seems to underestimate the ozone concentrations in the study domain because of underestimation of temperatures and overestimation of winds. The underestimation of NO 2 by model suggests the necessity of examining the emission data in respect of its accurate representation at model resolution. Quantitative analysis for most monitoring stations indicates that the combination of YSU PBL with NOAH LSM provides the best results for various chemical species with minimum BIAS, RMSE, and high correlation values.",

Consequently we provide improved assessment of short wave aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) (on both regional and seasonal scales) estimates over this region. Large gradients in north‐south ARF were observed as a consequence of gradients in single scattering albedo as well as aerosol optical depth. The highest ARF (–37 W m −2 at the surface) was observed over the northern Arabian Sea during June to August period (JJA). In general, ARF was higher over northern Bay of Bengal (NBoB) during winter and premonsoon period, whereas the ARF was higher over northern Arabian Sea (NAS) during the monsoon and postmonsoon period. The largest forcing observed over NAS during JJA is the consequence of large amounts of desert dust transported from the west Asian dust sources. High as well as seasonally invariant aerosol single scattering albedos ( ~ 0.98) were observed over the southern Indian Ocean region far from continents. The ARF estimates based on direct measurements made at a remote island location, Minicoy (8.3 ∘ N, 73 ∘ E) in the southern Arabian Sea are in good agreement with the estimates made following multisatellite analysis.",

The model was forced with NARR data (32 km) and both the daily IMS product (4 km) and the MODIS snow product (500 m) were assessed for their utility at determining lake ice phenology at the subgrid cell level (based on the 32 km NARR grid). Both products were useful for detecting ice-off; however, the MODIS product was advantageous for detecting ice-on, mainly due to the finer resolution and resulting spatial detail. The subgrid cell variability in ice-on/off dates was typically less than 2% of the mean, although it ranged up to 10% for some grid cells. The simulations were found to be within the satellite-detected subgrid cell variability: 62% of the time for ice-off and 80% of the time for ice-on. Forcing the model with future climate scenarios from the Canadian Regional Climate Model predicts the regional ice cover durations will decrease by up to 50 days from the current 1981–2010 means to the 2041–2070 means and decrease from 15 to nearly 100 days shorter from the current means to the 2071–2100 means.",

The study is a two-step investigation of the BL structure based on (i) the intercomparison of the backscatter profiles from the three laser sensors, namely the Leosphere ALS300 LIDAR, the Vaisala CL31 ceilometer and the Jenoptik CHM15K ceilometer; (ii) and the comparison of the backscatter profiles with twenty-three radiosoundings performed during the period from the 8th to the 15th of June, 2009. The sensor-independent Temporal Height-Tracking algorithm was applied to the backscatter profiles as retrieved by each instrument to determine the decoupled structure of the BL over Mace Head. The LIDAR and ceilometers-retrieved BL heights were compared to the radiosoundings temperature profiles. The comparison between the remote and the in-situ data proved the existence of the inherent link between temperature and aerosol backscatter profiles and opened at future studies focusing on the further assessment of LIDAR-ceilometer comparison.",

There was some variation in the parameter estimates derived with GWR, but the majority of the estimates indicated a positive association. Results from this study corroborate those of selected other studies in which rainfall and altitude were found to be correlated spatially. The authors concluded that the use of a nonstationary local model such as GWR enabled them to provide a deeper explanation of relations between rainfall and the altitude of the terrain than a global model such as OLS in terms of spatial estimation and prediction.",

On an annual basis, the PC paradigm is the most effective tool to assess the effect of the large-scale atmospheric forcing in the Mediterranean Sea because the station-based indices exhibit a very poor correlation with all climatic variables and only influence a reduced fraction of the basin. In winter, the station-based indices highly improve their ability to represent the atmospheric forcing and results are fairly independent of the paradigm used.",

The study includes cities in the North Western, Western, Eastern provinces of Saudi Arabia and in the Rub al Khali desert or Empty Quarter. Satellite and ground observations showed that the dust season extends from April to August with prominent peaks yet with high anthropogenic contribution late summer and early fall. Analysis shows an increase in the aerosol concentration during March 2009 which could be attributed to a major dust storm during that time. Comparing the AOD time series over regions 1–3 and region 4 (desert) we observe monthly and annual variability with no recurrence pattern over the years. The Aqua Deep Blue AOD 550 data shows a single peak pattern that occurs over region 4 during the spring season known for its frequent dust events. OMI data shed the light on the presence of higher air pollution levels over region 3, representing the oil rich eastern province of Saudi Arabia.",

The main sources and paths of advection to the south-eastern Baltic region and its relation to black carbon concentration were identified. The 72 h backward trajectories of air masses arriving at Preila from January to December 2013 were determined and were categorized by clustering them into six clusters. Subsequently, BC levels at Preila associated with each air mass cluster during this period were analyzed. The PSCF and CWT analysis shows that, on high BC concentration days, the air masses commonly originated and passed over southern regions of Europe before arriving at Preila in winter, while a strong impact of wildfires was observed in spring.",

In this work, the ability of the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with the Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model using the GOCART dust scheme is evaluated. The period comprises the West African Monsoon onset phase (the 7th to 12th of June, 2006) coinciding with the AMMA Special Observing Period (SOP). Different features in the horizontal and vertical dynamical structure of the Saharan atmosphere are analyzed with a combination of satellite and ground-based observations and model experimentation at 10 and 30 km model resolution. The main features of key Saharan dust processes during summer are identifiable, and WRF-CHEM replicates these adequately. Observations and model analyses have shown that cold pools ( haboobs ) contributed a substantial proportion of total dust during the study period. The comparative analysis between observations and WRF-Chem simulations demonstrates the model efficiency to simulate the spatial and 3D structure of dust transport over the Sahara and Sahel. There is, therefore, a strong basis for accurate forecasting of dust events associated with synoptic scale events when model dust emission parameterization is suitably calibrated.",

We analyzed over two years of LIDAR measurements from NASA’s CALIPSO and CloudSat satellites to document the vertical pathways of transatlantic transport of Saharan dust. Our analysis overcomes the limitations of quantitative dust detections with passive satellite measurements over land and low clouds and provides the fine vertical resolved structures. The results show the strong seasonal shift in dust source regions and transportation pathways due to the meteorological and thermodynamical conditions, which also control the dust vertical distribution as well as the depth of the dust layer. The dust layer top descending rates of 35 m/degree in summer, 25 m/degree in autumn and spring, and 10 m/degree in winter are found, respectively, while the dust is being transported across the Atlantic. Comparison with the model simulation highlights the potentials of dust observations using CALIPSO LIDAR. The observed seasonal dependence of these pathways gives new insights into the transport of the Saharan dust and provides important guidance for simulations of the production and transport of the global dust aerosol.",

We overlaid land cover maps from different sources, and the grids with consistent classification were selected as the sample grids. By comparing the results obtained with different decision tree classifiers with the WEKA toolkit for data mining, it was found that the C4.5 algorithm was more suitable for converting land use data of CAS classification to land cover data of IGBP classification. We reset the decision rules with Net Primary Productivity (NPP) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the indicators. The accuracy of the reclassified land cover data was proven to reach 83.14% through comparing with the Terrestrial Ecosystem Monitoring Sites and high resolution images. Therefore, it is feasible to produce the temporal land cover data with this method, which can be used as the parameters of dynamical downscaling in the regional climate simulation.",

To improve the simulation accuracy of downscaling methods, the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) method combined with three statistical downscaling methods, which are support vector machine (SVM), BCC/RCG-Weather Generators (BCC/RCG-WG), and Statistics Downscaling Model (SDSM), is proposed in this study, based on the statistical relationship between the larger scale climate predictors and observed precipitation in upper Hanjiang River Basin (HRB). The statistical analysis of three performance criteria (the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency, the coefficient of correlation, and the relative error) shows that the performance of ensemble downscaling method based on BMA for rainfall is better than that of each single statistical downscaling method. Moreover, the performance for the runoff modelled by the SWAT rainfall-runoff model using the downscaled daily rainfall by four methods is also compared, and the ensemble downscaling method has better simulation accuracy. The ensemble downscaling technology based on BMA can provide scientific basis for the study of runoff response to climate change.",

The study aimed at determining the effects of buildings’ height and street orientations on human thermal conditions at pedestrian level.

The simulations were conducted in the microscale applied climate model of RayMan, and results were interpreted in terms of the thermal comfort parameters of mean radiant (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>mrt</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math>) and physiologically equivalent (PET) temperatures.

Both annual and seasonal maximum precipitations (MP) are investigated based on daily precipitation data at 13 stations from 1960 to 2010 in Heihe River and Shiyang River basins. Results show that GEV, Burr, and Weibull distributions provide the best fit to both annual and seasonal MP. Exponential and Pareto 2 distributions show the worst fit. The estimated return levels for spring MP show decreasing trends from the upper to the middle and then to the lower reaches totally speaking. Summer MP approximates to annual MP both in the quantity and in the spatial distributions. Autumn MP shows a little higher value in the estimated return levels than Spring MP, while keeping consistent with spring MP in the spatial distribution. It is also found that the estimated return levels for annual MP derived from various distributions differ by 22%, 36%, and 53% on average at 20-year, 50-year, and 100-year return periods, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Recently, microwave communication networks have been shown to be valuable tools for rainfall monitoring, based on the well-known Power-Law which relates rain-rate to attenuation in microwave frequencies. However, once precipitation other than pure rain exists (e.g., snow), the Power-Law relation is no longer accurate. In this paper we propose a model which relates the induced attenuation to rain, snow, and sleet. Based on this model we propose estimating the total accumulated precipitation, regardless of the precipitation type, using measurements from multiple microwave links. Our technique takes advantage of the commercial communication networks, need for redundancy, which dictates the use of multiple microwave links at the same area. We show that by using measurements from at least three microwave links better estimation of the total accumulated precipitation fall can be provided, when rain, snow, sleet, or a mixture of them coexists. To demonstrate the proposed approach, it has been applied on actual microwave links attenuation measurements, which were provided by a cellular carrier. The estimation results were compared with Rain-Gauges and disdrometer measurements and show very good agreement and improved accuracy.",

Variability was analyzed using nonparametric anomaly indicator method and empirical orthogonal functions. Possible drivers of the rainfall variability were investigated. Trends were analyzed using the cumulative rank difference approach. Generally, rainfall was above the long-term mean from the mid-1950s to the late 1960s and again in the 1990s. From around 1970 to the late 1980s, rainfall was characterized by a decrease. The first and second dominant modes of variability correspond with the variation in Indian Ocean Dipole and North Atlantic Ocean index, respectively.

This study adopted the bottom-up approach to estimate the spatiotemporal change of CO 2 emissions of the tourism industry in China and its 31 provinces over the period 2000–2015. In addition, the decoupling index was applied to analyze the decoupling effects between tourism-related CO 2 emissions and tourism economy from 2000 to 2015. The results showed that the total CO 2 emissions of the tourism industry rose from 37.95 Mt in 2000 to 100.98 Mt in 2015 with an average annual growth rate of 7.1%. The highest CO 2 emissions from the tourism industry occurred in eastern coastal China, whereas the least CO 2 emissions were in the west of China. Additionally, the decoupling of CO 2 emissions from economic growth in China’s tourism industry had mainly gone through the alternations of negative decoupling and weak decoupling. The decoupling states in most of the Chinese provinces were desirable during the study period. This study may serve as a scientific reference regarding decision-making in the sustainable development of the tourism industry in China.",

A total of 822 HREs were revealed, concentrated over the northern sector (NS) of the country. Years with anomalous HREs are associated with low-level westerly convergence, advection of moisture from both the Indian Ocean and Congo basin, an upper warm temperature anomaly (UWTA), intensified and well-positioned Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), and pronounced rising motion since the ascending limb of the Walker type of circulation is centered over Tanzania. The analysis of the UWTA in this study has brought a key factor in exploring the possible likely cause and improved early warning system for the HREs during the MAM rainfall season in Tanzania. Making use of the thermal wind equation and the velocity divergent form of the continuity equation (DFCE), we found that the UWTA results into an upper-level horizontal wind divergence which significantly accelerates vertical ascent, deepening the surface low pressure for an enhanced convective process and HREs formation.",

Daily water consumption by E increased 24.3% in GE relative to G, and C showed 20.2% more than GE. At 0.46, E/ET in C was significantly higher than G at 0.35. Air temperature and the vapor pressure deficit were closely correlated with variation in diurnal ET, E, and T. The leaf area index (LAI) was also positively correlated with daily ET and E varied among grassland use patterns and explained variation in E/ET (81%).

The seasonality of MCSs occurrence shows a bimodal pattern, with higher occurrence during March-April (MA) and October-November (ON), analogous to the regional rainfall seasonality. The diurnal cycle of MCSs shows a clear nocturnal occurrence, especially during the MA and ON periods. Interestingly, despite the higher occurrence of MCSs during the rainy seasons, the monthly size relative frequency remains fairly constant throughout the year. On the east of the PB, the persistent high convective available potential and low convective inhibition values from midday to nighttime are likely related to the nocturnal development of the MCSs. A significant positive correlation between the MCSs occurrence to the west of the PB and the Trans-Niño index was found, suggesting that ENSO is an important source of interannual variability of MCSs frequency with increasing development of MCSs during warm ENSO phases. On the east of the PB, the variability of MCSs is positively correlated to the tropical Atlantic sea surface temperature anomalies south of the equator, due to the variability of the Atlantic subtropical anticyclone, showing main departures from this relation when anomalous conditions occur in the tropical Pacific due to ENSO.",

The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite product offers new options for the global study of precipitation. This paper evaluates the applicability of GPM IMERG products at different time resolutions in comparison to ground-measured data. Based on precipitation data from 107 meteorological stations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, GPM products were analysed at three timescales: half-hourly (GPM-HH), daily (GPM-D), and monthly (GPM-M). We use a cumulative distribution function (CDF) model to correct GPM-D and GPM-M products to analyse temporal and spatial distributions of precipitation. We came to the following conclusions: (1) The GPM-M product is strongly correlated with ground station data. Based on five evaluation indexes, NRMSE (Normalized Root Mean Square Error), NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe), FAR (False Alarm Ratio), UR (Underreporting Rate), and CSI (Critical Success Index), the monthly GPM products showed the best performance, better than GPM-HH products and GPM-D products. (2) The performance of GPM products in summer and autumn was better than in winter and spring. However, the GPM satellite’s precision in undulating terrain was poor, which could easily lead to serious errors. (3) CDF models were successfully used to modify GPM-D and GPM-M products and improve their accuracy. (4) The range of 0–100 mm precipitation could be corrected best, but the GPM-M products were underestimated. Corrected GPM-M data in the range &gt;100 mm were overestimated. According to this analysis, the GPM IMERG Final Run products at daily and monthly timescales have good detection ability and can provide data support for long-time series analyses in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region.",

Moreover, the parameters of the Gamma distribution and the normalized Gamma model are also derived by means of method of moment (MoM) and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Their performances are subsequently validated using the rain rate estimation accuracy: the normalized Gamma model with the MLE-generated shape parameter µ was found to provide better accuracy in terms of long-term rainfall rate statistics, which reflects the peculiarities of the local climatology in this heavy rain region.

    "abstract": "Characterization of precipitation is critical in quantifying distributed catchment-wide discharge. The gauge network is a key driver in hydrologic modeling to characterize discharge. The accuracy of precipitation is dependent on the location of stations, the density of the network, and the interpolation scheme. Our study examines 16 weather stations in a 64 km 2 catchment. We develop a weighted, distributed approach for gap-filling the observed meteorological dataset. We analyze five interpolation methods (Thiessen, IDW, nearest neighbor, spline, and ordinary Kriging) at five gauge densities. We utilize precipitation in a SWAT model to estimate discharge in lumped parameter simulations and in a distributed approach at the multiple densities (1, 16, 50, 142, and 300 stations). Gauge density has a substantial impact on distributed discharge and the optimal gauge density is between 50 and 142 stations. Our results also indicate that the IDW interpolation scheme was optimum, although the Kriging and Thiessen polygon methods produced similar results. To further examine variability in discharge, we characterized the land use and soil distribution throughout each of the subbasins. The optimal rain gauge position and distribution of the gauges drastically influence catchment-wide runoff. We found that it is best to locate the gauges near less permeable locations.",

    "abstract": "During the 2010 summer, a severe drought impacted Western Russia, including regions surrounding Moscow and Belgorod (about 700 km south of Moscow). The drought was accompanied by high temperatures. Moscow recorded 37.8°C (100°F) for the first time in over 130 years of record keeping. The record heat, high humidity, dry weather, and smoke from forest fires caused increased human mortality rates in the Moscow region during the summer. The excessive heat and humidity in Western Russia were the result of atmospheric blocking from June through mid-August. The NCAR-NCEP reanalyses were used to examine blocking in the Eastern European and Western Russia sector during the spring and summer seasons from 1970 to 2012. We found that drier years were correlated with stronger and more persistent blocking during the spring and summer seasons. During these years, the Moscow region was drier in the summer and Belgorod during the spring seasons. In the Moscow region, the drier summers were correlated with transitions from El Niño to La Niña, but the opposite was true in the Belgorod region. Synoptic flow regimes were then analyzed and support the contention that dry years are associated with more blocking and El Niño transitions.",

It has always been a difficult problem for event hydrological simulation to distinguish the two types of runoff processes. Based on the concept of dominant runoff processes, combined with GIS and RS techniques, this paper proposed an event-based spatial combination modeling framework and built two spatial combination models (SCMs) accordingly. The CN parameter and topographic index, both of which are widely used in hydrological researches, are adopted by the SCM to divide the entire watershed into infiltration-excess dominated (IED) areas and saturation-excess dominated (SED) areas. Dongwan watershed was taken as an example to test the performances of infiltration-excess model, saturation-excess model, and SCM, respectively. The results of parameter optimization showed that the parameter values and state variables of SCM are much more realistic than those of infiltration-excess model and saturation-excess model. The more accurate the divisions of infiltration-excess and saturation-excess dominated areas, the more realistic the SCM parameter values. The simulation results showed that the performance of SCM was improved in both calibration and validation periods. The framework is useful for flood forecasting in semihumid watersheds.",

Such windshear occurring in a planetary boundary layer without temperature inversions is studied in this paper by using the data from the Terminal Doppler Weather Radar and Light Detection and Ranging systems. A high resolution numerical model, called aviation model (AVM), is also employed to find out its capability to forecast the occurrence of such windshear. The model is found to have skills in capturing the terrain-induced windshear, including the terrain-induced microburst due to the mountains of Lantau Island. Moreover, the windshear detection algorithm as applied to the AVM output, called AVM-GLYGA, is able to give advance alert for the occurrence of low-level windshear. The model also offers new dataset, such as vertical velocity and vertical cross sections across the windshear feature, to study the terrain-induced windshear phenomena with new insights. The AVM is found to have good skills in depicting the terrain-disrupted airflow at the airport area, and more comprehensive study would be conducted to study the skills of AVM-GLYGA as compared with pilot windshear report as sky truth.",

Results from the spatial patterns of ozone and polar vortex suggest that the morphological changes of polar vortex can impact the horizontal distribution of ozone and the ozone within the polar vortex experiences a severe depletion in spring. The negative relationship between ozone and polar vortex in terms of vortex area, strength, and breakup time is significant with the correlation coefficients of −0.57, −0.68, and −0.76, respectively. The breakup time of polar vortex plays an important role in the relation between polar vortex and ozone depletion with the highest-value correlation coefficient among three polar vortex parameters.

Nevertheless, there are few studies in comparing various methods in the trend analysis to suggest the simplest methods in analyzing rainfall trends. Therefore, this paper presents a comparison analysis of statistical and graphical trend analysis techniques for two tropical catchments in Sri Lanka.

These stations were selectively chosen to provide a representative regional distribution of sites while ensuring conventional meteorological observations were available. Good agreement of PWV estimates was found between GPS and VLBI comparison with a mean difference of less than 1 mm and standard deviation of 3.5 mm and a mean difference and standard deviation of 0.1 mm and 4.0 mm, respectively, between GPS and radiosonde measurements. Systematic errors have also been discovered during the course of this study, which highlights the benefit of using GPS as a supplementary atmospheric PWV sensor and calibration system. The selected eight GPS sites sample different climates across Australia covering an area of approximately 30° NS/EW. It has also shown that the magnitude and variation of PWV estimates depend on the amount of moisture in the atmosphere, which is a function of season, topography, and other regional climate conditions.",

In this study, a modeling system for projecting the potential future climate change impacts on hydrological droughts in the Weihe River basin (WRB) in North China is presented. This system consists of a large-scale hydrological model driven by climate outputs from three climate models (CMs) for future streamflow projections, a probabilistic model for univariate drought assessment, and a copula-based bivariate model for joint drought frequency analysis under historical and future climates. With the observed historical climate data as the inputs, the Variable Infiltration Capacity hydrological model projects an overall runoff reduction in the WRB under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A1B scenario. The univariate drought assessment found that although fewer hydrological drought events would occur under A1B scenario, drought duration and severity tend to increase remarkably. Moreover, the bivariate drought assessment reveals that future droughts in the same return period as the baseline droughts would become more serious. With these trends in the future, the hydrological drought situation in the WRB would be further deteriorated.",

This paper analyzes indexes of continentality and oceanity, as well as their variations in the middle and high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere in the period 1950–2015. Climatology and changes in continentality and oceanity are examined using Conrad’s Continentality Index (CCI) and Kerner’s Oceanity Index (KOI). The impact of Northern Hemisphere teleconnection patterns on continentality/oceanity conditions was also evaluated. According to CCI, continentality is more significant in Northeast Siberia and lower along the Pacific coast of North America as well as in coastal areas in the northern part of the Atlantic Ocean. However, according to KOI, areas of high continentality do not precisely correspond with those of low oceanity, appearing to the south and west of those identified by CCI. The spatial patterns of changes in continentality thus seem to be different. According to CCI, a statistically significant increase in continentality has only been found in Northeast Siberia. In contrast, in the western part of North America and the majority of Asia, continentality has weakened. According to KOI, the climate has become increasingly continental in Northern Europe and the majority of North America and East Asia. Oceanity has increased in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago and in some parts of the Mediterranean region. Changes in continentality were primarily related to the increased temperature of the coldest month as a consequence of changes in atmospheric circulation: the positive phase of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and East Atlantic (EA) patterns has dominated in winter in recent decades. Trends in oceanity may be connected with the diminishing extent of seasonal sea ice and an associated increase in sea surface temperature.",

Trends in warm nights, cool days, and warm days were generally well reproduced. Projections for 2071–2099 relative to 1961–1989 are obtained from the ECHAM5 driven RCM. Northern and eastern zones are projected to experience more intense rainfall under A2 and B2. There is less consensus across scenarios with respect to changes in the dry and wet spell lengths. However, there is indication that a drying trend may be manifest over zone 5 (Trinidad and northern Guyana).

The world has taken active measures in dealing with climate change to mitigate carbon emissions. Predicting the carbon emissions peak has become a global focus, as well as a leading target for China’s low carbon development. China has promised its carbon emissions will have peaked by around 2030, with the intention of peaking earlier. Scholars generally have studied the influencing factors of carbon emissions. However, research on carbon emissions peaks is not extensive. Therefore, by setting a low scenario, a middle scenario, and a high scenario, this paper predicts China’s carbon emissions peak from 2015 to 2035 based on the data from 1998 to 2014 using the Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model. The results show that in the low, middle, and high scenarios China will reach its carbon emissions peak in 2024, 2027, and 2030, respectively. Thus, this paper puts forward the large-scale application of technology innovation to improve energy efficiency and optimize energy structure and supply and demand. China should use industrial policy and human capital investment to stimulate the rapid development of low carbon industries and modern agriculture and service industries to help China to reach its carbon emissions peak by around 2030 or earlier.",

    "abstract": "Climate change directly impacts the hydrological cycle via increasing temperatures and seasonal precipitation shifts, which are variable at local scales. The water resources of the Upper Yangtze River Basin (UYRB) account for almost 40% and 15% of all water resources used in the Yangtze Basin and China, respectively. Future climate change and the possible responses of surface runoff in this region are urgent issues for China’s water security and sustainable socioeconomic development. This study evaluated the potential impacts of future climate change on the hydrological regimes (high flow ( Q 5 ), low flow ( Q 95 ), and mean annual runoff (MAR)) of the UYRB using global climate models (GCMs) and a variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model. We used the eight bias-corrected GCM outputs from Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to examine the effects of climate change under two future representative concentration pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The direct variance method was adopted to analyze the contributions of precipitation and temperature to future Q 5 , Q 95 , and MAR. The results showed that the equidistant cumulative distribution function (EDCDF) can considerably reduce biases in the temperature and precipitation fields of CMIP5 models and that the EDCDF captured the extreme values and spatial pattern of the climate fields. Relative to the baseline period (1961–1990), precipitation is projected to slightly increase in the future, while temperature is projected to considerably increase. Furthermore, Q 5 , Q 95 , and MAR are projected to decrease. The projected decreases in the median value of Q 95 were 21.08% to 24.88% and 16.05% to 26.70% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively; these decreases were larger than those of MAR and Q 5 . Temperature increases accounted for more than 99% of the projected changes, whereas precipitation had limited projected effects on Q 95 and MAR. These results indicate the drought risk over the UYRB will increase considerably in the future.",

The EREs are defined based on the PFs area, depth (maximum height of radar reflectivity), and the rain rate and called them largest, deepest, and intense EREs, respectively. The EREs are divided into top 10%, 1%, 0.1%, and 0.01% based on their frequency of occurrences. It is observed that occurrences of EREs belonging to less than top 0.01% EREs follow the tropical rainfall climatology over the tropics based on all the parameters. Subtropical oceanic areas consist of a higher frequency of largest EREs, whereas tropical land areas consist of the higher number of deepest EREs. The most intense EREs (top 0.01%) are uniformly distributed over tropical areas and subtropical oceans, and spatial distribution shows that a deepest ERE belongs to intense EREs in the tropical land areas. Large differences between the precipitation contribution from the largest and deepest EREs are seen; for example, the top 1% of largest EREs contribute to ∼80.7% of Earth’s precipitation, whereas the corresponding percentage for deepest EREs is only 53%. On the regional and seasonal scale, South Asia (SAsia) and South America (SA) nearly show common features, as oceanic and land areas consist of largest and deepest EREs, respectively, and contribute to higher precipitation. Subtropical latitudes over South America, including Sierra de Cordoba and La Plata basin, consist of deepest and intense EREs and match with those of the Indo-Gangetic plain over South Asia, which also shows the similar characteristics. EREs based on various parameters are strongly linked over SAsia compared to SA. For example, the largest top 10% EREs have a higher probability to be part of the top 10% deepest and intense EREs over SAsia. The seasonal and regional water budget reveals different characteristics, as in the southern hemisphere, the deeper EREs contribute to the higher fraction of rainfall, but over SAsia, the shallower EREs could also contribute to significant rainfall.",

The PM 2.5 concentration simulated using the three schemes, together with the meteorological factors closely related to PM 2.5 (wind speed, local vertical diffusivity, and PBL height), was evaluated through comparison with observations. The results indicated that the eastern plain cities produced better simulation results than the western cities, and the cities under the eastern root of Taihang Mountain produced the worst results in simulating high PM 2.5 concentration in haze. All three schemes simulated very similar variation trends of the surface PM 2.5 concentration compared with observations. The diurnal variations of simulated surface PM 2.5 were not as reasonable as their reflection of daily averaged variation. The simulated concentrations of surface PM 2.5 using the YSU, MYJ, and Boulac schemes all showed large negative errors during daytime in polluted days due to their inefficient descriptions of local atmospheric stability or diffusion processes in haze. The lower ability of PBL schemes in distinguishing the diffusion between haze and clean days in the complex topography areas in China is an important problem for PM 2.5 forecasting, which is worthy of being studied in detail.",

We subsequently discussed potential flooding impacts in the context of urban vulnerability, based on future urbanisation and forecasted precipitation projections for Singapore. We find that, despite effective flood management, (i) significant increases in reported flash flood frequency occurred in contemporary (post-2000) relative to preceding (1984–1999) periods, (ii) these flash floods coincide with more localised, “patchy” storm events, (iii) storms in recent years are also more intense and frequent, and (iv) floods result in low human casualties but have high economic costs via insurance damage claims. We assess that Singapore presently has low vulnerability to floods vis-à-vis other regional cities largely due to holistic flood management via consistent and successful infrastructural development, widespread flood monitoring, and effective advisory platforms. We conclude, however, that future vulnerabilities may increase from stresses arising from physical exposure to climate change and from demographic sensitivity via rapid population growth. Anticipating these changes is potentially useful in maintaining the high resilience of Singapore towards this hydrometeorological hazard.",

    "abstract": "To overcome the problem that the horizontal resolution of global climate models may be too low to resolve features which are important at the regional or local scales, dynamical downscaling has been extensively used. However, dynamical downscaling results generally drift away from large-scale driving fields. The nudging technique can be used to balance the performance of dynamical downscaling at large and small scales, but the performances of the two nudging techniques (analysis nudging and spectral nudging) are debated. Moreover, dynamical downscaling is now performed at the convection-permitting scale to reduce the parameterization uncertainty and obtain the finer resolution. To compare the performances of the two nudging techniques in this study, three sensitivity experiments (with no nudging, analysis nudging, and spectral nudging) covering a period of two months with a grid spacing of 6 km over continental China are conducted to downscale the 1-degree National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) dataset with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Compared with observations, the results show that both of the nudging experiments decrease the bias of conventional meteorological elements near the surface and at different heights during the process of dynamical downscaling. However, spectral nudging outperforms analysis nudging for predicting precipitation, and analysis nudging outperforms spectral nudging for the simulation of air humidity and wind speed.",

Based on daily air and soil temperatures (depth: 0, 20, 80, and 320 cm) recorded at the Nanchang Weather Station (1961–2018), this study investigated the variation trend, abrupt changes, and years of anomalous annual and seasonal mean air and soil temperatures. The differences and relationships between annual air and soil temperatures were also analyzed. The results showed close correlations between air temperature and soil temperature at different depths. Annual and seasonal mean air and soil temperatures mainly displayed significant trends of increase over the past 58 years, although the rise of the mean air temperature and the mean soil temperature was asymmetric. The rates of increase in air temperature and soil temperature (depth: 0, 20, and 80 cm) were most obvious in spring; the most significant increase in soil temperature at the depth of 320 cm was in summer. Mean soil temperature displayed a decreasing trend with increasing soil depth in both spring and summer. Air temperature was lower than the soil temperature at depths of 0 and 20 cm but higher than the soil temperature at depths of 80 and 320 cm in spring and summer. Mean ground temperature had a rising trend with increasing soil depth in autumn and winter. Air temperature was lower than the soil temperature at all depths in autumn and winter. Years with anomalously low air temperature and soil temperature at depths of 0, 20, 80, and 320 cm were relatively consistent in winter. Years with anomalous air and soil temperatures (depths: 0, 20, and 80 cm) were generally consistent; however, the relationship between air temperature and soil temperature at 320 cm depth was less consistent. The findings provide a basis for understanding and assessing climate change impact on terrestrial ecosystems.",

Mann–Kendall and Sen’s slope estimator tests were used to analyze the variability in the temperature, precipitation, and streamflow time-series data at 27 meteorological stations and 34 hydrological stations for the period of 1963 to 2014. The time-series data of entire study period were divided into two equal subseries of 26 years each (1963–1988 and 1989–2014) to assess the overlapping aspect of climate change acceleration over UIB. The results showed a warming pattern at low altitude stations, while a cooling tendency was detected at high-altitude stations. An increase in streamflow was detected during winter and spring seasons at all hydrological stations, whereas the streamflow in summer and autumn seasons exhibited decreasing trends. The annual precipitation showed a significant decreasing trend at ten stations, while a significant increasing trend was observed at Kohat station during second subseries of the study period. The most significant winter drying trends were observed at Gupis, Chitral, Garidopatta, and Naran stations of magnitude of 47%, 13%, 25%, and 18%, respectively, during the second subseries. The annual runoff exhibited significant deceasing trends over Jhelum subbasin at Azad Pattan, Chinari, Domel Kohala, Muzaffarabad, and Palote, while within Indus basin at Chahan, Gurriala, Khairabad, Karora, and Kalam in the second time-series.

Here, Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Streamflow Drought Index (SDI), and Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) were used to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of different drought types and correlations between Pre (Pre-R)/post (Pos-R)-reservoir. Results showed that the average peak/intensity/duration/severity of meteorological droughts (MD) were greater in the Pre-R than in the Pos-R period in the upstream Heihe River Basin (UHRB), while there was little change between the Pre-R and Pos-R periods in the midstream Heihe River Basin (MHRB). The average peak/intensity/duration/severity of hydrological drought (HD) decreased in the mainstream for Yingluoxia (Ylx) but increased for Zhengyixia (Zyx) station in the Pos-R period. Propagation time decreased by 3 months (negative effect) in Ylx and increased by 8 months (positive effect) in Zyx compared with the Pre-R period. In the Pos-R period, propagation time increased (1–3 months) for tributaries (positive effect). Propagation times for the mainstream and tributaries varied for different seasons and time periods. Pearson’s correlation coefficient values were lower at short timescales (1–3 months) but higher at long timescales for the Pos-R period in Ylx and Zyx for SDI-1 with different timescales of SPI. The SDI and SPI had no lag in the UHRB and MHRB. However, VCI with SPI had a significant lag correlation at short timescales in the UHRB (lag 6 months) and MHRB (lag 4 months), and the VCI with SDI had a significant lag correlation for 1 month in the MHRB. The propagation time from MD to HD has been reduced for Pos-R in the UHRB.

    "abstract": "Water resources in Northern Thailand have been less explored with regard to the impact on hydrology that the future climate would have. For this study, three regional climate models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) were used to project future climate of the upper Nan River basin. Future climate data of ACCESS_CCAM, MPI_ESM_CCAM, and CNRM_CCAM under Representation Concentration Pathways RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 were bias-corrected by the linear scaling method and subsequently drove the Hydrological Engineering Center-Hydrological Modeling System (HEC-HMS) to simulate future streamflow. This study compared baseline (1988–2005) climate and streamflow values with future time scales during 2020–2039 (2030s), 2040–2069 (2050s), and 2070–2099 (2080s). The upper Nan River basin will become warmer in future with highest increases in the maximum temperature of 3.8°C/year for MPI_ESM and minimum temperature of 3.6°C/year for ACCESS_CCAM under RCP8.5 during 2080s. The magnitude of changes and directions in mean monthly precipitation varies, with the highest increase of 109 mm for ACESSS_CCAM under RCP 4.5 in September and highest decrease of 77 mm in July for CNRM, during 2080s. Average of RCM combinations shows that decreases will be in ranges of −5.5 to −48.9% for annual flows, −31 to −47% for rainy season flows, and −47 to −67% for winter season flows. Increases in summer seasonal flows will be between 14 and 58%. Projection of future temperature levels indicates that higher increases will be during the latter part of the 20th century, and in general, the increases in the minimum temperature will be higher than those in the maximum temperature. The results of this study will be useful for river basin planners and government agencies to develop sustainable water management strategies and adaptation options to offset negative impacts of future changes in climate. In addition, the results will also be valuable for agriculturists and hydropower planners.",

The results showed that light rain occurred most frequently in the pollution process, with Xiangyang being affected for up to 587 h. PM concentration would not change drastically under the effect of precipitation. Mean rainfall intensity responsible for wet growth of PM 10 and PM 2.5 was mainly &lt;0.5 mm/h, while that responsible for wet removal of PM 2.5 was significantly higher (&gt;1.4 mm/h) than that of PM 10 (&gt;1.0 mm/h). Precipitation was more likely to produce a wet removal effect for a greater initial value of PM mass concentration, and on the contrary, a wet growth effect was more likely, with the threshold of PM 10 mass concentration being 150 μ g/m 3 and that of PM 2.5 mass concentration being 95 μ g/m 3 . Wet removal played a leading role in lower humidity (∼60%) and greater rainfall intensity, but wet growth played a leading role in higher humidity (∼90%) and lower rainfall intensity. As the precipitation level increased (rainfall ≥1.5 mm·h −1 ), the wet removal to PM 10 mass concentration was enhanced more obviously. The variations of PM 2.5 had similar distributions to those of PM 10 under the effect of precipitation, but the wet removal effect of precipitation was weakened and the wet growth effect was enhanced.",

Several scientific studies have reported on improvements in air quality due to the impact of these COVID-19 lockdowns. This study aims to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown and its driving influencing factors on air pollution in Greater Bangkok, Thailand, using in situ measurements. Overall, PM2.5, PM10, O3, and CO concentrations presented a significant decreasing trend during the COVID-19 outbreak year based on three periods: the Before Lockdown, Lockdown, and After Lockdown periods, for PM2.5: −0.7%, −15.8%, and −20.7%; PM10: −4.1%, −31.7%, and −6.1%; and O3: −0.3%, −7.1%, and −4.7%, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2019. CO concentrations, especially which had increased by 14.7% Before Lockdown, decreased by −8.0% and −23.6% during the Lockdown and After Lockdown periods, respectively. Meanwhile, SO2 increased by 54.0%, 41.5%, and 84.6%, and NO2 increased by 20.1%, 3.2%, and 26.6%, respectively, for the Before Lockdown, Lockdown, and After Lockdown periods. PCA indicated a significant combination effect of atmospheric mechanisms that were strongly linked to emission sources such as traffic and biomass burning. It has been demonstrated that the COVID-19 lockdown did pause some of these anthropogenic emissions, i.e., traffic and commercial and industrial activities, but not all of them. Even low traffic emissions, on their own, did not cause an absolute reduction in air pollution since there are several primary emission sources that dominate the air quality over Greater Bangkok. Finally, these findings highlight the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures not only on air pollution levels but on their effects on air pollution characteristics, as well.",

The temporal rainfall trend analysis of sixteen rain gauges was performed on annual basis with long-term (1981–2016) data. The results depicted that there is substantial year-to-year and season-to-season variability in rainfall patterns, and rainfall patterns are generally erratic in nature. The results highlight that most of the highland rainfall stations showed decreasing trends on annual basis. The central and lowland stations of the study area recorded an increasing trend of rainfall except for Talagang station. The average annual rainfall of the study area ranges between 492 mm and 1710 mm in lowland and high-altitude areas, respectively. Of the whole year’s rainfall, about 70 to 75% fall during the monsoon season. The rainfall spatial distribution maps obtained using the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method, through the GIS software, revealed the major rainfall range within the study area. There is a lack of water during postmonsoon months (November–February) and great differences in rainfall amounts between the mountainous areas and the lowlands. There is a need for the rational management of mountainous areas using mini and check dams to increase water production and stream regulation for lowland areas water availability. The spatiotemporal rainfall variability is crucial for better water resource management schemes in the study area of Pothwar region, Pakistan.",

    "abstract": "The devastating effects of drought on agriculture, water resources, and other socioeconomic activities have severe consequences on food security and water resource management. Understanding the mechanism that drives drought and predicting its variability is important for enhancing early warning and disaster risk management. In this study, meteorological droughts over six coastal synoptic stations were investigated using three-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The dry seasons of November-December-January (NDJ), December-January-February (DJF), and January-February-March (JFM) were the focal seasons for the study. Trends of dry seasons SPIs were evaluated using seasonal Mann–Kendall test. The relationship between drought SPI and ocean-atmosphere climate indices and their predictive ability were assessed using Pearson correlation and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) stepwise regression method to select best climate indices at lagged timestep that fit the SPI. The SPI exhibited moderate to severe drought during the dry seasons. Accra exhibited a significant increasing SPI trend in JFM, NDJ, and DJF seasons. Besides, Saltpond during DJF, Tema, and Axim in NDJ season showed significant increasing trend of SPI. In recent years, SPIs in dry seasons are increasing, an indication of weak drought intensity, and the catchment areas are becoming wetter in the traditional dry seasons. Direct (inverse) relationship was established between dry seasons SPIs and Atlantic (equatorial Pacific) ocean's climate indices. The significant climate indices modulating drought SPIs at different time lags are a combination of either Nino 3.4, Nino 4, Nino 3, Nino 1 + 2, TNA, TSA, AMM, or AMO for a given station. The AIC stepwise regression model explained up to 48% of the variance in the drought SPI and indicates Nino 3.4, Nino 4, Nino 3, Nino 1 + 2, TNA, TSA, AMM, and AMO have great potential for seasonal drought prediction over Coastal Ghana.",

    "abstract": "Drought is a frequent occurrence in semidesert areas of southern Ethiopia that significantly affect regional, social, economic, and environmental conditions. Lack of rainfall monitoring network, instrument measurement, and failure are major bottlenecks for agro-and hydroclimate research in developing countries. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the performance of CHIRPS rainfall product and to assess meteorological drought using SPI for the period 2000 to 2020 over Gamo Zone, southern Ethiopia. The performance of CHIRPS v2 was assessed and compared to station observations (2000–2020) in the study domain to derive SPI on a three-month timescale. The Pearson correlation coefficient (R), bias, probability of bias (PBias), mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and Nash simulation efficiency (NSE) values across the zone for CHIRPS v2 were found to be 0.88, 1.02, 2.56, 0.25, 22.41, 33.14, and 0.77, respectively. The results indicate that CHIRPS performed good ability to analyze the drought characteristics in the Gamo Zone. The spatial and temporal distribution method of meteorological drought has been evaluated using the Climate Data Tool (CDT). The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was computed using the gamma distribution method. The magnitude of (SPI-3) of monthly and seasonal (MAM) meteorological drought in the zone from 2000 to 2020. The result shows that the known historic drought years (2014, 2015, 2010, 2009, and 2008) were indicated very well. Furthermore, sever and extreme droughts were observed in 2008 and 2009 with drought duration of 6.7 and 6.3, respectively, in most areas of the zone. Hence, this study revealed that CHIRPS can be a useful supplement for measuring rainfall data to estimate rainfall and drought monitoring in this region.",

    "abstract": "This study applies a novel cloud seeding method using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a research aircraft in Korea. For this experiment, the UAV sprayed a cloud seeding material (calcium chloride), and the aircraft monitored the clouds in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula on April 25, 2019. Cloud observation equipment in the aircraft indicated an increase in the number concentration and average particle size of large cloud particles after the seeding. Weather radar reflectivity increased by approximately 10 dBZ above the experimental area due to the development of clouds and precipitation systems. Rain was observed after seeding, and 0.5 mm was recorded, including natural and mixed precipitation from the cloud seeding. In addition, it showed that the rapid increase in the number of raindrops and vertical reflectivity was approximately 10 dBZ. Therefore, these results showed the possibility of cloud seeding using UAVs and atmospheric research aircraft. The effects of cloud seeding are indicated through the increased number concentration and size of cloud particles, radar reflectivity, and ground-based precipitation detection.",

    "abstract": "Incorporating large‐scale climate indices like the El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is essential for understanding climate variability and change on a finer scale. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the trends and magnitude of climate variability and change in the Kembata Tembaro zone in Southern Ethiopia. Climate data from the Kadida Gamella (KG), Kacha Birra (KB), and Hadaro Tunto (HT) stations were collected. The coefficient of variation (CV), standardized anomaly index (SAI), and standard precipitation index (SPI) were used to assess the climate variability. The Pearson product moment correlation was used to determine the association between rainfall variability and ENSO. In addition, the Mann–Kendall (MK) trend test was used to assess climate trends. The results revealed that rainfall variability was observed between seasons, with CVs ranging from 14.1% to 25.0%. Higher percentages of dry (negative) rainfall anomaly values over time were estimated during the Kiremt (June–September) (51.6%) and Belg (February–May) (53.8%) seasons, indicating an increase in the number of dry years. These findings show that droughts have become more frequent and severe in the study area. Additionally, ENSO strongly influences both Kiremt and Belg rainfall amounts. However, some of the stations had significant ( p &lt; 0.05) positive trends in Kiremt for KB and HT as well as in annual rainfall for KB. Furthermore, annual and seasonal temperature trends showed significant ( p &lt; 0.05) increasing trends at all stations. The average rates of change for the maximum and minimum annual temperatures were 0.029 and 0.030°C, respectively. Overall, the findings showed that over the past 31 years, the study area has experienced significant fine‐scale climatic variability and change. This suggests that microscale analysis of trends and magnitude of climate variability and change could be useful for developing context‐specific adaptation strategies.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to look at the potential effects of climate change on the Bilate watershed’s crop water requirements (CWRs). Under two climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), the CWR was anticipated for 2021–2050 and 2071–2100. The power transformation (PT) and variance scaling (VARI) methods were employed to correct biases in the rainfall and temperature climate variables, respectively. The CROPWAT 8.0 model was used to simulate CWRs and crop irrigation requirements (CIRs) for both the current and future periods. The estimated results for 2071–2100 reveal a drop in effective rainfall ( Pe ) of 29.6%–38% under RCP 4.5 and 24.7%–43.3% under RCP 8.5. CWRs would increase by 12.3–51 mm under RCP 4.5 and 16.3–62 mm under RCP 8.5 per growing season, but the rates of decrease/increase would vary by crop. Similarly, the anticipated irrigation requirements for the following crops increased when compared to the baseline period: wheat (from 68.1 to 81.6 mm), tomato (from 163 to 193 mm), sorghum (from 80 to 102 mm), maize (from 121 to 134 mm), cotton (from 163 to 192 mm), cabbage (from 193 to 221 mm), soybean (from 104 to 120 mm), and banana (from 95 to 135 mm). The study’s findings are important in demonstrating how climate change has a detrimental impact on crop water availability in the Bilate watershed, as well as in improving water resource management planning.",

    "abstract": "Cloud is an important factor affecting climate change, playing a crucial role in controlling the Earth’s energy and water cycle. In this study, total cloud cover (TCC) from the fifth‐generation atmospheric reanalysis of the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ERA5) and the International Satellite Cloud Climate Project H‐series (ISCCP) were compared with those from the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) aboard Fengyun4A (FY4A) and ground observations (OBS), revealing the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of TCC in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (Xinjiang), northwest China. The findings indicate that the interannual fluctuations in the annual mean TCC from OBS in Xinjiang exhibit no discernible trend, while those based on ERA5 and ISCCP demonstrate a decline. The TCC from FY4A and ISCCP shows a distribution pattern of high in the south and low in the north, whereas the opposite is true for that from OBS and ERA5. For all ground observation stations, the mean values of TCC from ERA5, OBS, FY4A, and ISCCP are 45.9%, 49.1%, 49.5%, and 63.0%, respectively. At the majority of ground observation stations (with the exception of those in southwest Xinjiang), the discrepancy between the TCCs from FY4A and those from OBS (ERA5) is less than 10%. However, at the majority of stations in north Xinjiang, the TCCs from ISCCP are more than 10% larger than those from FY4A. Furthermore, there are discernible discrepancies in the frequency of occurrence and spatial distribution of distinct cloud types. The findings of this study serve to enhance the comprehension of the spatiotemporal characteristics of TCC in Xinjiang, northwest China, thereby facilitating the more effective application of FY4A in arid regions.",

We find that the model produces storms of hurricane strength with realistic dynamical features. We also find that tropical storm statistics are reasonable, both globally and in the north Atlantic, when compared to recent observations. The sensitivity of simulated tropical storm statistics to increases in sea surface temperature (SST) is also investigated, revealing that a credible late 21st century SST increase produced increases in simulated tropical storm numbers and intensities in all ocean basins. While this paper supports previous high‐resolution model and theoretical findings that the frequency of very intense storms will increase in a warmer climate, it differs notably from previous medium and high‐resolution model studies that show a global reduction in total tropical storm frequency. However, we are quick to point out that this particular model finding remains speculative due to a lack of radiative forcing changes in our time‐slice experiments as well as a focus on the Northern hemisphere tropical storm seasons.",

Data from four weather stations situated in Nairobi were collected from the Kenya Meteorological Department for the period from 1966 to 1999 inclusive. The data included mean annual maximum and minimum temperatures, and was first subjected to homogeneity test before analysis. Both linear regression and Mann‐Kendall rank test were used to discern the mean annual trends. Results show that the change of temperature over the thirty‐four years study period is higher for minimum temperature than maximum temperature. The warming trends began earlier and are more significant at the urban stations than is the case at the sub‐urban stations, an indication of the spread of urbanisation from the built‐up Central Business District (CBD) to the suburbs. The established significant warming trends in minimum temperature, which are likely to reach higher proportions in future, pose serious challenges on climate and urban planning of the city. In particular the effect of increased minimum temperature on human physiological comfort, building and urban design, wind circulation and air pollution needs to be incorporated in future urban planning programmes of the city.",

Mean annual total nitrogen deposition was 74 mg N/(m 2 yr) but exhibited large interannual variability and was dominated by highly episodic “strong” events, probably caused by rapid transport from European sources. The majority (90%) of precipitation samples were defined as “weak” (&lt;2 mg N/m 2 ) and contributed an annual baseline of ~17 mg N/(m 2 yr), whereas 10% of precipitation samples were defined as “strong” (&gt;2 mg N/m 2 ) and additionally contributed up to 225 mg N/(m 2 yr). Nitrate deposition largely occurred in samples within the solid-precipitation season (16 September–2 June), and ammonium deposition occurred equally in both solid and liquid seasons. Trends of reactive nitrogen emissions from Europe are uncertain, and increasing cyclonic activity over the North Atlantic caused by a changing climate might lead to more strong deposition events in Svalbard.",

The application area is the Sahara desert and the eastern Mediterranean, where two dust events occurred during the period 4–6 February 2009, an unusual event for a winter period. The Aqua-MODIS and OMI observations clearly define the spatial distribution of the dust plumes, while the CALIPSO observations of total attenuated backscatter (TAB) at 532 nm, depolarization ratio (DR), and attenuated color ratio (1064/532 nm) on 5 February 2009 provide a clear view and vertical structure of the dust-laden layer. The dust source region is defined to be near the Chad-Niger-Libyan borders, using satellite observations and model (DREAM) output. This dust plume is vertically extended up to 2.5 km and is observed as a mass plume of dust from surface level to that altitude, where the vertical variation of TAB (0.002 to 0.2) and DR (0.2–0.5) implies dust-laden layer with non-spherical particles. CALIPSO profiles show that after the dust plume reached at its highest level, the dust particles start to be deposited over the Mediterranean and the initial dust plume was strongly attenuated, while features of dust were limited below about 1–1.5 km for latitudes northern of ~36° (Greek territory).",

Spatial distribution of CO concentration is simulated with a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. An exposure model is developed that associates the georeferenced location of the student with the computed air quality levels (at an average breathing height) for that specific grid cell. For each individual, the model calculates the instantaneous exposure at each time frame and the mean value for a given period. Results show a general benefit induced by the trees over the mean exposure of the student in each route. However, in the case of instantaneous exposure values, this is not consistent along the entire period.

For a better understanding of these exchanges, an appropriate cloud type classification method is necessary. The present study proposes an alternative approach to the often used cloud optical and thermodynamic properties based classifications. This approach relies on the application of edge detection techniques on cloud top temperature (CTT) derived from global satellite maps. The gradient map obtained through these techniques is then used to distinguish various types of clouds. The edge detection techniques used are based on the idea that a pixel's neighborhood contains information about its intensity. The variation of this intensity (gradient) offers the possibility to decompose the image into different cloud morphological features. High gradient areas would correspond to cumulus-like clouds, while low gradient areas would be associated with stratus-like clouds. Following the application of these principles, the results of the cloud classification obtained are evaluated against a common cloud classification method based on cloud optical properties' variations. Relatively good matches between the two approaches are obtained. The best results are observed with high gradient clouds and the worst with low gradient clouds.",

The analysis shows negative trends in the total number of rainy days over Hyderabad (−10.4%), Kanpur (−7.1%), Jaipur (−10.5%), and Nagpur (−4.8%) and positive trends over Delhi (7.4%) and Bangalore (22.9%).

The lesser rainfall and rainy days, along with the mostly declining trend, in the downwind directions of the cities may imply an urban influence in precipitation associated with the increased anthropogenic emissions due to expansion of the urban areas and the increase of population. However, the large spatiotemporal variability of precipitation and the lack of statistical significance in the vast majority of the trends do not allow the extraction of safe conclusion concerning the aerosol-precipitation interactions around Indian cities.",

Our analysis shows that accumulation at the high elevated regions of the central Karakoram is dominated by the west wind circulation (WWC). Incursions of the South Asian monsoon (SAM) occur sometimes during the summer months accompanied by strong precipitation but play a minor role for the total accumulation amount. Dust layers found in the snow pits show a rare earth elements signature which indicates that the dust very likely originates from the arid regions of western China and Central Asia. Our trajectory calculations based on NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data confirm that especially during late spring and early summer the westerly flow is redirected over the Tarim basin to reach central Karakoram from an East/Southeast direction. The preservation of the layer structure and the clear seasonal signals in the snow pits indicate that locations above 5200 m in central Karakoram will be suitable places for retrieving longer climate records from ice cores.",

    "abstract": "Results are presented from a series of numerical studies designed to investigate the atmospheric boundary layer structure, ambient wind, and pollutant source location and their impacts on the wind field and pollutant distribution within the built-up areas of Shenyang, China. Two models, namely, Open Source Field Operation and Manipulation (OpenFOAM) software package and Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, are used in the present study. Then the high resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) numerical experiments were performed under the typical simulated atmospheric boundary conditions. It was found that the atmospheric boundary structure played a crucial role in the pollution within the building cluster, which determined the potential turbulent diffusion ability of the atmospheric surface layer; the change of the ambient wind direction can significantly affect the dispersion pattern of pollutants, which was a more sensitive factor than the ambient wind speed; under a given atmospheric state, the location of the pollution sources would dramatically determine the pollution patterns within built-up areas. The WRF-CFD numerical evaluation is a reliable method to understand the complicated flow and dispersion within built-up areas.",

    "abstract": "Yunnan province is the core region of the drought in the Southwest China, which makes the region become the hot spot in the meteorological research. However, among the various influencing factors of the drought in Yunnan province, the influence of the land use/cover change (LUCC) on the drought has not been quantitatively analyzed. The LUCC in recent decades was first quantitatively analyzed in this study. Given the fact that severe drought in Yunnan province is mainly due to much-less-than-normal precipitation and much-warmer-than-normal surface temperature, this study focused on the future spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the temperature and precipitation, which have great impacts on the drought. Finally, the influencing factors of drought in Yunnan province were simulated with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, and the risk of drought was spatially analyzed with the meteorological drought composite index. The results indicate that the large-area forest plays a more important role in alleviating the risk of drought than other vegetation types do. Besides, the changes of the landscape structure resulting from the urban expansion play a significant role in intensifying the risk of drought.",

The results show that under the steering of upper-level jet (ULJ) and mid-level westerly trough, SWV moved eastward from southern Sichuan Plateau, across eastern Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau to South China, forming an obvious heavy rain belt. SWV developed in the large storm-relative helicity (SRH) environment, as environmental wind field continuously transferred positive vorticity to it to support its development. The thermodynamic structures of distinctive warm (cold) advections in front (rear) of the SWV movement are also important factors for the SWV evolutions with a southwest low-level jet (LLJ) and vertical wind shear. SWV development was associated with the distributions of negative MPV1 (the barotropic item of moist potential vorticity) and positive MPV2 (the baroclinic item of it). The MPV1 and MPV2 played the dominant role in the formation and the evolution of SWV, respectively. The mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) frequently occurred and persisted in water vapor convergence areas causing the severe heavy rainfall. The areas of high moist helicity divergence and heavy rainfall are consistent, and the moist helicity divergence could be a good indicator for heavy rainfall occurrence.",

The dependence of simulated rainfall on model resolution is explore by climate downscaling experiments using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. The model’s horizontal resolution was refined from 12 to 6, then to 3 km. The total rainfall for winter and for different subdomains of Arizona is found to increase substantially with the refinement from 12 to 6 km grid. A further refinement to 3 km leads to a smaller change in rainfall, indicating numerical convergence at that scale. Comparisons with observations revealed that the 6 and 3 km runs produced excessive rainfall for winter while the 12 km simulations are closer to observation. This implies that the parameterization schemes for rainfall are not resolution independent, thus a refinement of resolution does not guarantee better results. It cautions against hastily pushing for increasingly higher resolution in practical downscaling simulations. An analysis of the simulated hourly rainfall shows that the 3 km runs produce significantly more extreme rainfall events than the 12 km runs. The 6 and 3 km runs also produced more complicated spatial patterns of seasonal rainfall and vertical velocity, reflecting the influence of fine-scale topography.",

Referring to the measurement of arbitrary oriented microwave link, the ACML method optimizes the ratio of specific attenuation to specific differential phase which is a key parameter in attenuation correction schemes. The proposed method was evaluated using real data of a dual-polarization X-band radar and measurements of two microwave links during two rainstorm events. The results showed that the variation range of the optimized ratio was overall consistent with the results of the previous studies. After attenuation correction with the optimal ratios, the radar reflectivity was significantly compensated, especially at long distances. The corrected reflectivity was more intense than the reflectivity corrected by the “self-consistent” (SC) method and closer to the reflectivity of a nearby S-band radar. The effectiveness of the method was also verified by comparing the rain rates estimated by the X-band radar with those derived by rain gauges. It is demonstrated that arbitrary oriented microwave link can be adopted to optimize the attenuation correction of radar reflectivity.",

We examined the correlation between burned area of individual wildfires and the rainfall amounts occurring on the day of the burn and the number of consecutive dry days for a range of limiting daily rainfall amounts (0–6mm) used to define a “dry” day. Daily threshold rainfall levels that most significantly affected area burned were determined for each ecoregion in Yunnan province, a major fire-prone area, in southwestern China. Results showed that the burned area of a wildfire decreased exponentially with increasing rainfall amounts on the day of burning. Burned area was also positively correlated to the number of consecutive dry days prior to burning. The threshold rainfall value providing the highest correlation between burned area and the number of consecutive dry days prior to a burn varied between ecoregions. Consecutive dry days with rainfall less than the specified threshold predominantly affected large fires (&gt;100 ha) rather than more frequently occurring small fires.

Despite the increasing occurrence and intensity of the 2009/2010 drought in southwestern China, the impacts of drought on vegetation in this region remain unclear. We examined the impacts of the 2009/2010 drought in southwestern China on vegetation by calculating the standardized anomalies of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Land Surface Temperature (LST). The standardized anomalies of NDVI, EVI, and NDWI exhibited positively skewed frequency distributions, while the standardized anomalies of LST exhibited a negatively skewed frequency distribution. These results implied that the NDVI, EVI, and NDWI declined, while LST increased in the 2009/2010 drought-stricken vegetated areas during the drought period. The responses of vegetation to the 2009/2010 drought differed substantially among biomes. Savannas, croplands, and mixed forests were more vulnerable to the 2009/2010 drought than deciduous forest and grasslands, while evergreen forest was resistant to the 2009/2010 drought in southwestern China. We concluded that the 2009/2010 drought had negative impacts on vegetation in southwestern China.

Also, while one cumulus scheme captures the overall spatial convective structure of the event more accurately than others, it fails to capture the precipitation intensity. This apparent discrepancy leads to sensitivity related to the verification method used to rank the scheme combinations. This sensitivity is also observed in a comparison between parameterized and explicit cumulus formation when the Kain-Fritsch scheme was used. A loss of added value is also found when the Grell-Freitas cumulus scheme was activated at 1 km grid spacing.",

The Mediterranean belt is characterized by strong climatic variability and specific seasonal features, where dry periods are often interrupted by pulsing storms. Identifying the thresholds associated with extreme rainfall events is among the most important challenges for this region. To discern the spatial patterns of rainfall erosivity hazard in the Rhone region (eastern France), this study establishes thresholds in the power of rainstorms. An indicator Kriging approach was employed for computing probability maps of the annual rainfall erosivity exceeding the threshold of 1800 MJ mm ha −1 h −1 , the latter being twice greater than the standard deviation. The interdecadal spatial patterns of hazard were assessed for recent decades (1991–2010) and the precedents ones (1961–1990). Climate fluctuations of rainfall erosivity revealed possible signals of increased storminess hazard across the region in recent times. We also discussed changes in the rainfall erosivity hazard forcing as related to climatic changes in daily rain rate, especially in autumn when the erosivity is likely affected by more intense storminess occurring across the southern part of the Rhone region.",

On the interannual timescale, the strong correlation between winter PDO and the YSCWM may indicate the dominant effect of winter PDO on the YSCWM through the modulation of local heat flux and wind stress. It is also found that the local wind stress and heat flux in summer have little impact on the interannual variability of the YSCWM. On the decadal time scale, the YSCWM is associated with winter AO and winter PDO. Winter AO mainly controls local heat flux, modulating the decadal variability of the YSCWM. In contrast, winter PDO is strongly connected with winter heat flux and wind stress to modulate the decadal variability of the YSCWM. In summer, for three climate factors, ENSO is the dominant factor controlling the decadal variability of the YSCWM.",

Surface temperature data were extracted from the thermal infrared (TIR) band of ASTER on four dates during the summer and fall of 2012, and corresponding in situ measurements of temperature were also collected. Comparisons showed that ASTER derived temperatures were generally 4.27°C lower than temperatures collected by in situ measurements during the daytime, except on cloudy days. However, ASTER temperatures were higher by 2.23–2.69°C on two dates during the nighttime. Temperature differences between a city park and a paved area were insignificant. Differences between ASTER derived temperatures and onsite measurements are caused by a variety of factors including the application of emissivity values that do not consider the complex spatial characteristics of urban areas. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of surface temperatures extracted from infrared satellite imagery, we propose a revised model whereby temperature data is obtained from ASTER and emissivity values for various land covers are extracted based on in situ measurements.",

The current study on the impact of urbanization on the annual average temperature of the recent 60 years in Beijing was conducted using 1951–2012 temperature data. Anomaly analysis, quadratic polynomial trend method, and moving average method were employed to indicate the temporal variation of temperature. The results showed that average temperature increased both in urban and rural areas. The temperature of urban Beijing increased during the period from 1951 to 2012, especially from 1971 to 1994. The temperature of rural Beijing showed a faster increase than that of the urban area from 1989 to 1998. However, the rate of temperature increase slowed down in recent years. This type of change was temporally consistent with the process of land use change and urbanization in Beijing. Economic restructuring and improvement of urban planning may have been one of the reasons that the regional warming has been slowed down in the rural area.",

    "abstract": "Evaluation of different reanalysis precipitation datasets is of great importance to understanding the hydrological processes and water resource management practice in the Qinling-Daba Mountains (QDM), located at the eastern fringe of the Tibetan Plateau. Although the evaluation of satellite precipitation data in this region has been performed, another kind of popular precipitation product-reanalysis dataset has not been assessed in depth. Three popular reanalysis precipitation datasets, including ERA-Interim Reanalysis of European Centre for Medium Forecasts (ERA-Interim), Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55), and National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis-1 (NCEP/NCAR-1) were evaluated against rain gauge data over the Qinling-Daba Mountains from 2000 to 2014 on monthly, seasonal, and annual scales. Different statistical measures based on the Correlation Coefficient (CC), relative BIAS (BIAS), Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were adopted to determine the performance of the above reanalysis datasets. Results show that ERA-Interim and JRA-55 have good performance on a monthly scale and annual scale. However, the NCEP/NCAR-1 has the least BIAS with the observed precipitation in annual scale in QDM. All reanalysis datasets performed better in spring, summer, and autumn than in winter. The advantages of involving more precipitation observation stations was probably the main reason of the different performance of three precipitation reanalysis products, and the benefit of a four-dimensional variational analysis model over a three-dimensional variational analysis model may be another reason. The evaluation suggested that ERA-Interim is more suitable for study the precipitation and water cycles in the QDM.",

The focus is on the Arabian Peninsula in the 21 st century, using data from three Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models downscaled by RegCM4, a regional climate model. The analysis includes surface observations along with RegCM4 simulations and changes in threshold based on extreme temperature at the end of the 21 st century relative to the base period (1971–2000). Irrespective of the driving CMIP5 models, the RegCM4 simulations show enhanced future temperature changes for RCP8.5 as compared to RCP4.5. The Arabian Peninsula will warm at a faster rate (0.83°C per decade) as compared to the entire domain (0.79°C per decade) for RCP8.5 during the period 2071–2100. Moreover, the number of hot days ( T max ≥ 50°C) (cold nights: T min ≤ 5°C) will increase (decrease) faster in the Arabian Peninsula as compared to the entire domain. This increase (decrease) of hot days (cold nights) will be more prominent in the far future (2071–2100) as compared to the near future (2021–2050) period. Moreover, the future changes in temperature over the main cities in Saudi Arabia are also projected. The RegCM4-based temperature simulation data from two suitable CMIP5 models are recommended as a useful database for further climate-change-related studies.",

The study found that managers acted in response to environmental cues, but that their responses were significantly delayed compared to when drought conditions emerged. External warnings did not influence the timing of their decisions, though on-farm monitoring and assessment of conditions did. Though this case focused only on a one-year flash drought characterized by rapid drought intensification, waiting to destock pastures was associated with greater losses to range productivity and health and diversity.

Investigation of the features of tropopause folds over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is important since the TP is a hotspot in global STE. In this study, we investigated seasonal features of the tropopause fold events over the TP using the 40-year ERA-Interim reanalysis data. The development of a tropopause folding case is specifically examined. The results show that shallow tropopause folds occur mostly in spring, while medium and deep folds occur mostly in winter. The multiyear mean monthly frequency of shallow tropopause folds over the TP reaches its maximum value of about 7% in May and then decreases gradually to its minimum value of 1% in August and increases again since September. Deep folds rarely occur in summer and autumn. Both the seasonal cycle and seasonal distribution of total tropopause folds over the TP are dominated by shallow folds. The relative high-frequency areas of medium and deep folds are located over the southern edge of the TP. The westerly jet movement controls the displacement of the high-frequency folding region over the TP. The region of high-frequency tropopause folds is located in the southern portion of the plateau in spring and moves northward in summer. The jet migrates back to the south in autumn and is located along about 30°N in winter, and the region where folds occur most frequently also shifts southward correspondingly. A medium fold event that occurred on 29 December 2018 is used to demonstrate the evolution of a tropopause fold case over the TP in winter; that is, the folding structure moves from west to east, the tropopause pressure is greater than 320 hPa over the folding region, while it is about 200 hPa in the surrounding areas, and the stratospheric air with high potential vorticity (PV) is transported from the high latitudes to the plateau by meridional winds. A trajectory model result verifies the transport pathway of the air parcels during the intrusion event.",

The changes in the preexisting CCE acted upon by typhoons were described by eddy kinetic energy (EKE) and eddy available gravitational potential energy (EAGPE). The mechanical energy of CCE was estimated from a two-layer reduced gravity model. Comparing with the scenario that typhoon passes by the region without CCEs, the preexisting CCE area plays an important role in the increase of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentration in the CCEs impacted by the typhoons. The preexisting chl-a in CCE is about 25%~45% (8%~25%) of postexisting chl-a in CCE for higher (slower) transit speed typhoons. If the EAGPE of CCE increases greatly after typhoon passing by with slow transit speed, so does the chl-a in the CCE area. The EKE (EAGPE) changes of the preexisting CCE are in the order of O(10 14 ~10 15 J). EKE and EAGPE of CCE are dominantly enhanced by typhoon with slow transit speed (&lt;3 m/s) and the posttyphoon EAGPE is always larger than posttyphoon EKE for 8 cases.

Drawing on principles of the ecosystem resilience highlighted in the literature, we built on the theory of dissipative structures to develop a conceptual model of the ecosystem resilience of forests. A hierarchical indicator system was designed with the influencing factors of the forest ecosystem resilience, including the stand conditions and the ecological memory, which were further disaggregated into specific indicators. Furthermore, indicator weights were determined with the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the coefficient of variation method. Based on the remote sensing data and forest inventory data and so forth, the resilience index of forests was calculated. The result suggests that there is significant spatial heterogeneity of the ecosystem resilience of forests, indicating it is feasible to generate large-scale ecosystem resilience maps with this assessment model, and the results can provide a scientific basis for the conservation of forests, which is of great significance to the climate change mitigation.",

    "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is normally considered as the sum of all water that evaporates from the soil and transpires from plants. However, accurately estimating ET from complex landscapes can be difficult because of its high spatial heterogeneity and diversity of driver factors, which make extrapolation of data from a point to a larger area quite inaccurate. In this paper, we hypothesize that MODIS products can be of use to estimate ET in areas of Caatinga vegetation, the hydrology of which has not been adequately studied. The experiment was conducted in a preserved level area of Caatinga in which meteorological and water flux measures were taken throughout 2012 by eddy covariance. Evapotranspiration estimates from eddy covariance were compared with remotely sensed evapotranspiration estimates from MOD16A2 and SAFER products.

The purpose of this study is to explore the response of extreme precipitation to solar activity and El Nino events in typical regions of the Loess Plateau—a case study in the Yan’an area. The precipitation data was from nine weather stations in Yan’an and the sunspot number and the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) were from 1951 to 2015. The results show that maximum precipitation occurred mainly at the peak sunspot number or 2a near it and the sunspot number minimum and valley values were not significantly correlated. The results of Morlet wavelet showed that a 41-year period of precipitation was the most obvious within the 64-year scale. Similarly, sunspot number showed a 16-year periodic variability. Correlation analyses of the 16-year and 41-year scales demonstrated that the relationships between precipitation and sunspot number were close. In addition, extreme precipitation often occurred in the year following El Nino events. According to 10-year moving average curves, precipitation generally showed a downward trend when SOI was negative. The results indicate that solar activity and El Nino events had significant impacts on precipitation in typical regions of the Loess Plateau.",

    "abstract": "The estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for meteorological modeling of surface exchange processes, as well as for the agricultural practice of irrigation management. Hitherto, a number of methods for estimation of ET at different temporal scales and climatic conditions are constantly under investigation and improvement. One of these methods is surface renewal (SR). Therefore, the premise of this review is to present recent developments and applications of SR for ET measurements. The SR method is based on estimating the turbulent exchange of sensible heat flux between plant canopy and atmosphere caused by the instantaneous replacement of air parcels in contact with the surface. Additional measurements of net radiation and soil heat flux facilitate extracting ET using the shortened energy balance equation. The challenge, however, is the calibration of SR results against direct sensible heat flux measurements. For the classical SR method, only air temperature measured at high frequency is required. In addition, a new model suggests that the SR method could be exempted from calibration by measuring additional micrometeorological variables. However, further improvement of the SR method is required to provide improved results in the future.",

Based on the generalized complementary principle proposed by Brutsaert in 2015, we used meteorological and hydrological data to estimate the actual evapotranspiration at a resolution of 1 km × 1 km between the years of 1961 and 2000 and also verified the model’s stability. In this study, we used the water balance equation to calibrate the parameters, coupled with the spatial simulation results of the meteorological elements in the actual evapotranspiration model. The estimation results of actual evapotranspiration show that the generalized complementary principle model had high estimation precision in this basin, with an average absolute error of 16.64 mm and an average relative error of 2.25%. With respect to spatial distribution, the average actual evapotranspiration over the years in the basin tended to have high and low distribution in the northern and southern parts of the basin, respectively. The actual evapotranspiration in the basin showed a decreasing trend over the period, with a rate of 24.1 mm/10 years. Correlation coefficient analysis showed that the percentage decreases in percentage sunshine and the decreases in the daily range of temperature were the main reasons for the decrease in actual evapotranspiration.",

Using field inventory data, this study underlines the patterns of biomass and carbon allocation across a chronosequence of Chir Pine forest. Based on the uniform shelterwood silvicultural management system, the forest was classified into three stand age classes representing the young stand (&lt;50 years), mature stand (50–75 years), and overmature stand (&gt; 75 years). The results showed an increasing trend in living tree biomass carbon with stand age. However, soil carbon showed gradually decreasing trend from young to overmature stand. Similarly, deadwood, litter, and understory biomass carbon showed an increase pattern of changes. Altogether, the results highlighted that the mean carbon values of all components varied between 90.3 t·C·ha −1 in the young stand and 309.5 t·C·ha −1 in the overmature stand. Furthermore, our results confirm that the current management operations affect the forest floor and soil carbon. Therefore, we suggest that different protection measures should be considered during management operations to enhance soil and forest floor carbon.",

The Uma Oya basin (720 km 2 ) is given utmost precedence due to environmental concerns seen in the ongoing Uma Oya multipurpose development project (529 million USD worth) which is expected to divert water to the southeast dry zone of the country while adding 231 GWh/year electricity to the national grid. The rainfall data for a period of 26 years (1992–2017) were analysed using Mann–Kendall’s test and Sen’s slope estimator test to identify the rainfall trends. Both of these trend analysis test results depict only one negative trend for Hilpankandura Estate for the month of June; however, the seasonal trend analysis and annual trend analysis do not support this observation. Nevertheless, Mann–Kendall’s test showed potential positive trends for the 3 rainfall gauging stations Kirklees Estate, Ledgerwatte Estate, and Welimada Group only in the 1 st intermediate period (March-April), and this is well supported by the monthly trend analysis. Other than these trends, the results do not show any significant negative trends in the Uma Oya catchment. Therefore, the results vividly explain that there is no threat of water scarcity to the catchment area being resistant to changing global climate for the past 26 years.",

First, the Mann-Kendall method was adopted to identify drought trends at the five major watersheds. The simulated temporal evolution of SPI (standardized precipitation index) during the winter showed significant drying trends in most parts of the watersheds, while the simulated SPI during the spring showed a somewhat different feature in the GCMs. Second, this study explored the low-frequency patterns associated with drought by comparing global wavelet power, with significance test. Future spectra decreased in the fractional variance attributed to a reduction in the interannual band from 2 to 8 years. Finally, the changes in the frequency and the severity under climate change were evaluated through the drought spell analyses. Overall features of drought conditions in the future showed a tendency to increase (about 6%) in frequency and severity of droughts during the dry season (i.e., from October to May) under climate change.",

Ninety-six-hour backward trajectories with every 3-hour interval were computed and clustered into 06 groups based on angle distance matrix. Probabilities of individual cluster to be associated with different ranges of coarse and fine particles were studied. Gazipur station near Dhaka city was found to have 68% probability of receiving PM 10 concentration higher than 150 μ g/m 3 when air masses followed the route of Middle East through the Himalayan valley to the station. This channel was identified as the main route of PM transport to Bangladesh during dry season. Transboundary source-regions were spotted by concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) method and also by the monthly average aerosol optical depths (AOD) over South Asia. North-western Indian regions, Nepal and its neighboring areas, and Indian state of West Bengal were identified as the most probable zones that might have contributed to PM pollution in Gazipur, Dhaka.

    "abstract": "Accurate daily rainfall estimation is required in several applications such as in hydrology, hydrometeorology, water resources management, geomorphology, civil protection, and agriculture, among others. CMORPH daily rainfall estimations were integrated with rain gauge measurements in Brazil between 2000 and 2015, in order to reduce daily rainfall estimation errors by means of the statistical objective analysis scheme (SOAS). Early comparisons indicated high discrepancies between daily rain gauge rainfall measurements and respective CMORPH areal rainfall accumulation estimates that tended to be reduced with accumulation time span (e.g., yearly accumulation). Current results show CMORPH systematically underestimates daily rainfall accumulation along the coastal areas. The normalized error variance (NEXERVA) is higher in sparsely gauged areas at Brazilian North and Central-West regions. Monthly areal rainfall averages and standard deviation were obtained for eleven Brazilian watersheds. While an overall negative tendency (3 mm·h −1 ) was estimated, the Amazon watershed presented a long-term positive tendency. Monthly areal mean precipitation and respective spatial standard deviation closely follow a power-law relationship for data-rich watersheds, i.e., with denser rain gauge networks. Daily SOAS rainfall accumulation was also used to calculate the spatial distribution of frequencies of 3-day rainfall episodes greater than 100 mm. Frequencies greater than 3% were identified downwind of the Peruvian Andes, the Bolivian Amazon Basin, and the La Plata Basin, as well as along the Brazilian coast, where landslides are recurrently triggered by precipitation.",

Also, changes in precipitation extremes with topography are investigated, and possible causes are briefly discussed. The results show that extreme precipitation over the Poyang Lake basin is intensified during the last 50 years, especially the increasing trends are more significant before the end of the 1990s. Moreover, high contribution rates of extreme precipitation to the total rainfall (40–60%) indicated that extreme precipitation plays an important role to the total water resources in this area. The precipitation extremes also exhibited a significant spatial dependence in the basin. The northeastern and eastern areas are exposed to high risk of flood disaster with the higher frequency of extreme precipitation events. In addition, the distribution of precipitation extremes had a clear dependence on elevation, and the topography is an important factor affecting the variability of extreme precipitation over the Poyang Lake basin.",

Therefore, predicting temporal trends of precipitation and temperature is very useful for societal and urban planning. In this research, in order to study the future trends in precipitation and temperature, we have applied scenarios of the fifth assessment report of IPCC. The results suggest that both parameters will be increasing in the studied area (Iran) in future. Since there is interdependence between these two climatic parameters, the independent analysis of the two fields will generate errors in the interpretation of model simulations. Therefore, in this study, copula theory was used for joint modeling of precipitation and temperature under climate change scenarios. By the joint distribution, we can find the structure of interdependence of precipitation and temperature in current and future under climate change conditions, which can assist in the risk assessment of extreme hydrological and meteorological events. Based on the results of goodness of fit test, the Frank copula function was selected for modeling of recorded and constructed data under RCP2.6 scenario and the Gaussian copula function was used for joint modeling of the constructed data under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.",

At first, forecast rainfall error based on the BIAS is compared with flood forecast error to assess the error propagation. Second, the variability of flood forecast uncertainty according to catchment scale is discussed using ensemble spread.

    "abstract": "The Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences Lightning Nowcasting and Warning System (CAMS_LNWS) was designed to predict lightning within the upcoming 0-1 h and provide lightning activity potential and warning products. Multiple remote sensing data and numerical simulation of an electrification and discharge model were integrated in the system. Two core algorithms were implemented: (1) an area identification, tracking, and extrapolating algorithm and (2) a decision tree algorithm. The system was designed using a framework and modular structure, and integrated warning methods were applied in the warning program. Two new algorithms related to the early warning of the first lightning and thunderstorm dissipation were also introduced into the system during the upgrade process. Thunderstorms occurring in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei during 2016-2017 were used to evaluate the CAMS_LNWS by the low-frequency cloud to ground lightning detection data, and the results showed that the system has good forecasting and warning ability for local lightning activities. The TS score in 0-1 h ranged from 0.11 to 0.32, with a mean of 0.20. Operational experiments and promotional work for the CAMS_LNWS are now in progress.",

    "abstract": "Understanding long-term trends in hydroclimatic variables is important for future sustainable water resource management as it could show the possible regime shifts in hydrology. The main objective of this study was to analyze the homogeneity and trends of hydroclimatic data of Upper Awash Sab-Basin (UASB) in Oromia, Ethiopia, by employing homogeneity tests and Mann-Kendall and Sen’s slope tests. The data consist of 18 rainfall stations, 8 temperature stations, and 8 flow gauging stations across the UASB. Homogeneity and trends in streamflow, rainfall, and temperature variables were analyzed for the time period 1980 to 2017. In order to analyze homogeneity of hydroclimatic variables, we used four homogeneity tests (Pettitt’s test, Buishand’s test, standard normal homogeneity test, and von Neumann ratio test) at 5% significance level. Based on the outputs of four homogeneity tests, the results were classified into three categories, namely, “useful,” “doubtful,” and “suspect” to select the homogeneity stations. Mann-Kendall (Z) and Sen’s slope tests (Q) were applied for the selected homogeneous time series to detect the trend and magnitude of changes in hydroclimatic variables. The result showed that most of the stations in annual rainfall and streamflow data series were classified as useful. It is found that 58% of the rainfall stations were homogeneous. It is highlighted that 3 out of 8 discharge gauging stations have an inhomogeneity as they failed from one or a combination of the four tests. The MK revealed significant decreasing trends of annual rainfall in Addis Alem (Q = −19.81), Akaki (Q = −5.60), Hombole (Q = −9.49), and Ghinch (Q = −12.38) stations. The trend of annual temperature was a significant increasing trend in Addis Ababa Bole (Q = 0.05), Addis Ababa Tikur Ambessa (Q = 0.03), Tulu Bolo (Q = 0.07), and Addis Alem (Q = 0.06) stations. The results of discharge showed a significant increasing trend in Bega at Mojo (Q = 0.17) and Hombole (Q = 0.03) gauging stations. In general, the results obtained from discharge, rainfall, and temperature series indicated that most of the stations exhibited no trends in both annual and seasonal time series. It can be concluded that decreases in average annual rainfall totals and increases in mean annual temperature will probably drive sub-basin scale changes in discharge. We believe that the results obtained can fill information gaps on homogeneity and trends of hydroclimatic variables, which is very crucial for future water resource planning and management in the face of climate change.",

ERA-Interim generally captures the monthly, seasonal, and annual variation very well. High daily correlations ranging from 0.956 to 0.996 indicate that ERA-Interim captures the daily temperature observations very well. However, an average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of ±2.7°C of all stations reveals that ERA-Interim should not be directly applied at individual sites. The biases are mainly attributed to the altitude differences between ERA-Interim grid points and stations. The positive trend (0.457°C/decade) is significant over the Qilian Mountains based on the 1979–2017 observations. ERA-Interim captures the warming trend very well with an increase rate of 0.384°C/decade. The observations and ERA-Interim both show the largest positive trends in summer with the values of 0.552°C/decade and 0.481°C/decade, respectively. We conclude that in general ERA-Interim captures the trend very well for observed 2 m air temperatures and ERA-Interim is generally reliable for climate change research over the Qilian Mountains.",

    "abstract": "Precipitation and temperature are among major climatic variables that are used to characterize extreme weather events, which can have profound impacts on ecosystems and society. Accurate simulation of these variables at the local scale is essential to adapt urban systems and policies to future climatic changes. However, accurate simulation of these climatic variables is difficult due to possible interdependence and feedbacks among them. In this paper, the concept of copulas was used to model seasonal interdependence between precipitation and temperature. Five copula functions were fitted to grid (approximately 10 km × 10 km) climate data from 1960 to 2013 in southern Ontario, Canada. Theoretical and empirical copulas were then compared with each other to select the most appropriate copula family for this region. Results showed that, of the tested copulas, none of them consistently performed the best over the entire region during all seasons. However, Gumbel copula was the best performer during the winter season, and Clayton performed best in the summer. More variability in terms of best copula was found in spring and fall seasons. By examining the likelihoods of concurrent extreme temperature and precipitation periods including wet/cool in the winter and dry/hot in the summer, we found that ignoring the joint distribution and confounding impacts of precipitation and temperature lead to the underestimation of occurrence of probabilities for these two concurrent extreme modes. This underestimation can also lead to incorrect conclusions and flawed decisions in terms of the severity of these extreme events.",

Based on data from 61 meteorological stations from 1961 to 2014 in the North China Plain (NCP), the spatiotemporal characteristics of climate variables, such as humidity index, precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration (ET 0 ), were analyzed. The sensitivity coefficients and contribution rates were applied to ET 0 . The NCP has experienced a semiarid to humid climate from north to south due to the significant decline of ET 0 (−13.8 mm decade −1 ). In the study region, 71.0% of the sites showed a “pan evaporation paradox” phenomenon. Relative humidity had the most negative influence on ET 0 , while wind speed, sunshine hours, and air temperature had a positive effect on ET 0 . Wind speed and sunshine hours contributed the most to the spatiotemporal variation of ET 0 , followed by relative humidity and air temperature. Overall, the key climate factor impacting ET 0 was wind speed decline in the NCP, particularly in Beijing and Tianjin. The crop yield in Shandong and Henan provinces was higher than that in the other regions with a higher humidity index. The lower the humidity index in Hebei province, the lower the crop yield. Therefore, potential water shortages and water conflict should be considered in the future because of spatiotemporal humidity variations in the NCP.",

However, in the past, there was a lack of relevant research on Xinjiang in the arid region of northwest China. In this study, the rainy season data collected by the disdrometer in the Yining area of Xinjiang were used for more than two years, and the characteristics of DSDs for all samples, for two rain types (convective and stratiform), and for six different rain rates were studied. The results showed that nearly 70% of the total samples had a rainfall rate of less than 1 mm·h−1, the convective rain was neither continental nor maritime, and there was a clear boundary between convective rain and stratiform rain in terms of the scattergram of the standardized intercept parameter ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <msub> <mrow> <mi mathvariant=\"normal\">log</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>10</mn> </mrow> </msub> <msub> <mrow> <mi>N</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mi>w</mi> </mrow> </msub> </math> ) versus the mass-weighted average diameter ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <msub> <mrow> <mi>D</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mi>m</mi> </mrow> </msub> </math> ). When the raindrop diameter was less than 0.7 mm, DSDs of the two rainfalls basically coincided, while when the raindrop diameter was greater than 0.7 mm, DSDs of convective rainfall were located above the stratiform rain.

To supplement ground-based monitoring where PM2.5 observation is limited, this study applied a multivariate linear regression model to predict PM2.5 concentrations in 2020 using aerosol optical depth (AOD); meteorological parameters of wind velocity, temperature, and relative humidity; and gaseous pollutants such as SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 from ground-based measurements at three locations: Chiang Mai, Lampang, and Nan provinces in Northern Thailand. Two multivariate linear regression models were conducted in this study. The first model (model 1) is a generic model with meteorological parameters of aerosol optical depth (AOD), temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed. The second model (model 2) includes meteorological parameters and several gaseous pollutants, such as SO2, NO2, CO, and O3. In general, the regression model, which used hourly data from 2020 of the three provinces, adequately characterized the PM2.5 concentrations. The performance of model 2 was good for the prediction of PM2.5 concentrations at Chiang Mai (R2 = 0.52) and Lampang (R2 = 0.60). Model 2 improved the prediction of PM2.5 concentration compared to model 1 for both wet and dry seasons. However, model uncertainties were also present, which lays a foundation for further study.",

The study used the Mann–Kendall (MK) test and Sen’s slope estimator to estimate the trend and magnitude of changes in precipitation and temperature. The analysis from the observation indicates that there had been a consistent warming trend and inconsistent changes in precipitation extremes in the study agroecologies. A statistically significant increase in the numbers of warm days and nights and a statistically significant reduction in the numbers of cold days and nights were observed in most of the agroecologies. The duration of extreme trend showed inconsistency; however, a drier condition is observed in lowland agroecology.

Here we examine the corresponding changes in dynamical modes of variability ranging from storm tracks, onset-of-blocking modes, northwest cloud-band disturbances, Antarctic low-frequency modes, intraseasonal oscillations, and African easterly waves. Our study is performed using a global two-level primitive equation instability-model with reanalyzed observed July three-dimensional basic states for the periods 1949–1968, 1975–1994, and 1997–2006. We relate the reduction in the winter rainfall in the southwest of Western Australia since the mid-1970s and in south-eastern Australia since the mid-1990s to changes in growth rate and structures of leading storm track and blocking modes. We find that cyclogenesis and onset-of-blocking modes growing on the subtropical jet have significantly reduced growth rates in the latter periods. On the other hand there is a significant increase in the growth rate of northwest cloud-band modes and intraseasonal oscillation disturbances that cross Australia and are shown to be related to recent positive trends in winter rainfall over northwest Western Australia and central Australia, in general. The implications of our findings are discussed.",

The spatial pattern of the climate change basically corresponded to that of the land cover change; for example, the temperature increased most significantly in the regions mainly consisting of cities and built-up area. Besides, there were some variations in the degree and range of influence of the land cover change on the temperature among seasons.

To explore the impact of model physics on the creation of environmental variability and its uncertainty, combined mesoscale-convective scale data assimilation experiments are conducted for a tornadic supercell storm. Two 36-member WRF-ARW model-based mesoscale EAKF experiments are conducted to provide background environments using either fixed or multiple physics schemes across the ensemble members. Two 36-member convective-scale ensembles are initialized using background fields from either fixed physics or multiple physics mesoscale ensemble analyses. Radar observations from four operational WSR-88Ds are assimilated into convective-scale ensembles using ARPS model-based 3DVAR system and ensemble forecasts are launched. Results show that the ensemble with background fields from multiple physics ensemble provides more realistic forecasts of significant tornado parameter, dryline structure, and near surface variables than ensemble from fixed physics background fields. The probabilities of strong low-level updraft helicity from multiple physics ensemble correlate better with observed tornado and rotation tracks than probabilities from fixed physics ensemble. This suggests that incorporating physics diversity across the ensemble can be important to successful probabilistic convective-scale forecast of supercell thunderstorms, which is the main goal of NOAA’s Warn-on-Forecast initiative.",

The results showed that Geonor was hard to catch light precipitation (precipitation amount was less than 1 mm during a single event) when the wind speeds were higher than 3.5 m/s. Even when the wind speeds were smaller than 3.5 m/s, about 44% of such light precipitation events were not recorded by Geonor. The optical instruments had much better performance in recording light precipitation. Three methods were used to correct Geonor measurements of daily solid precipitation and the corrected values were set as reference for assessing the performance of LPM and Parsivel; the results showed that LPM had good performance in measuring the solid precipitation but Parsivel overestimated the precipitation amount. Methods for correcting Geonor’s hourly solid precipitation and recalculating Parsivel’s solid precipitation amount were also proposed in this paper.",

Some models have been used to simulate the relationship between land use and land cover change and climate change; however, there is still no sufficient evidence for the impacts of urbanization on the regional climate. This study aims to identify the impact of urban land use change on regional temperature and precipitation in summer in the Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan Metropolitan area during 2030–2040 based on the analysis of the simulation results of WRF model. Firstly, we analyzed the land use change and climate change during 1995–2005 in the study area. The impacts of future urbanization on regional climate change were then simulated. The results indicate that urbanization in this area has affected the regional climate and has the potential to increase temperature and precipitation in the summer of 2030–2040. These research results can offer decision-making support information related to future planning strategies in urban environments in consideration of regional climate change.",

Results show that the runoff and sediment load of the stream declined gradually in 1960–2012. According to the abrupt change point detected, the runoff and sediment series were divided into two periods: 1960–1998 and 1999–2012. The reductions of runoff and sediment load in 1999–2012 were found to be related to climate change and human activities, and the latter played a dominant role with a contribution of about 68% and 75%, respectively. The effects of rainfall intensity should be considered to avoid overestimating or underestimating the contributions of rainfall changes to the variations of runoff and sediment load in the semiarid region. An inspection of changes in water discharge and sediment regime indicated that the frequency of discharge between 0 and 5 m 3 /s increased while that between 5 and 1000 m 3 /s decreased in 2006–2012. This phenomenon can be attributed principally to the soil and water conservation practices.",

Some of these circulation regimes result in extreme weather conditions over the region. Using a classification system for Northern Hemisphere large-scale flow regimes and observations of weather within the Central Chernozem Region, the role of individual synoptic patterns in the formation of weather anomalies was identified. Also, comparing the periods 1981–2010 and 1971–2000, the mean summer temperatures increased by 0.6°C regionally. During the most recent decade the increase was 1.3°C. Total precipitation for the summer increased over the 20th century and was characterized by less variability during the second half when compared to the first half. However, in the beginning of the 21st century, precipitation has decreased during the growing season, but variability has increased. The increase in summer temperatures and increased variability in precipitation were then linked to an increase in the occurrence of weather regimes associated with warm anomalies and blocking. Finally, the results of this study can be used to translate larger-scale seasonal or climate forecasts to the regional scale.",

The relationships between glacial changes and glacial size, topographic factors, and debris cover were examined. Our results found that total glacial area decreased by 485 ± 177.3 km 2 (24.2% ± 8.8%) during the study period, and there were no advancing glaciers. Additionally, 331 glaciers disappeared and 18 disintegrated into two or three smaller glaciers. This study demonstrated a linear relationship between glacial area change and elevation. Changes in glaciers smaller than 1 km 2 were affected by both glacial size and topographic factors, while larger ones were affected by size only. Area losses in debris-covered glaciers were smaller by 2.5% to 7.5% compared to clean ice of the same size in this basin. As in other glaciated regions, glacial retreat in the Ili River basin is attributed to global warming. The slightly increasing precipitation over the study period could not offset the ice melting.",

To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first time such detailed characteristics of positive lightning in Malaysia are thoroughly analyzed. A total of 41 positive lightning flashes containing 48 return strokes were analyzed. The average multiplicity is 1.2 strokes per flash. The majority of positive lightning was initiated from the primary positive charge rather than as a byproduct of in-cloud discharges. The cumulative probability distribution of rise time parameters, opposite polarity overshoot relative to peak, and slow front amplitude relative to peak are presented. A comparison between studies in four countries representing tropic, subtropic, and temperate regions was also carried out. Measured parameters in Florida, Sweden, and Japan are generally lower than those in Malaysia. Positive lightning occurrences in tropical regions should be further studied and analyzed to improve our current understanding on positive return strokes.",

The gridded data (5 × 5 km) displayed influence of topography on spatial variability of rainfall, and the results of the empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) analysis revealed the patterns associated with the large-scale sea surface temperature variability over Pacific. The first mode (65%) revealed the annual peaks of large rainfall in the southwestern mountainous area, which is associated with southwest monsoons and typhoons during summertime. The second temporal EOF mode (16%) revealed the rainfall variance associated with the monsoon and its interaction with the slopes of the mountain range. This pattern is the major contributor to spatial variance of rainfall in Taiwan, as indicated by the first mode (40%) of spatial variance EOF analysis. The second temporal EOF mode correlated with the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). In particular, during the autumn of the La Niña years following the strong El Niño years, the time-varying amplitude was substantially greater than that of normal years. The third temporal EOF mode (7%) revealed a north-south out-of-phase rainfall pattern, the slowly evolving variations of which were in phase with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Because of Taiwan’s geographic location and the effect of local terrestrial structures, climate variability related to ENSO differed markedly from other regions in East Asia.",

The models that can account for the role of traffic are especially valuable in urban areas, where high pollutant concentrations are often observed during particular times of day (rush hour) and year (winter). In this paper, we develop a generalized additive models approach to analyze the behavior of concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), and particulate matter (PM 10 ), collected at the environmental monitoring stations distributed throughout the city of Turin, Italy, from December 2003 to April 2005. We describe nonlinear relationships between predictors and pollutants, that are adjusted for unobserved time-varying confounders. We examine several functional forms for the traffic variable and find that a simple form can often provide adequate modeling power. Our analysis shows that there is a saturation effect of traffic on NO 2 , while such saturation is less evident in models linking traffic to PM 10 behavior, having adjusted for meteorological covariates. Moreover, we consider the proposed models separately by seasons and highlight similarities and differences in the predictors’ partial effects. Finally, we show how forecasting can help in evaluating traffic regulation policies.",

First, cloud-to-ground lightning data were converted to reflectivity using a simple assumed relationship between flash density and reflectivity. Next, the reflectivity was used in the cloud analysis of GSI to adjust the cloud/hydrometeors and moisture. Additionally, the radar/lightning-proxy reflectivity was simultaneously converted to a 3D temperature tendency. Finally, the model-calculated temperature tendencies from the explicit microphysics scheme, as well as cumulus parameterization at 3D grid points at which the radar temperature tendency is available, were updated in a forward full-physics step of diabatic digital filter initialization in the WRF-ARW. The WRF-GSI system was tested using a mesoscale convective system that occurred on June 5, 2009, and by assimilating Doppler radar and lightning data, respectively. The forecasted reflectivity with assimilation corresponded more closely to the observed reflectivity than that of the parallel experiment without assimilation, particularly during the first 6 h. After assimilation, the short-range precipitation prediction improved, although the precipitation intensity was stronger than the observed one. In addition, the improvements obtained by assimilating lightning data were worse than those from assimilating radar reflectivity over the first 3 h but improved thereafter.",

    "abstract": "Lake Victoria, Africa, supports millions of people. To produce reliable climate projections, it is desirable to successfully model the rainfall over the lake accurately. An initial step is taken here with customization of the Weather, Research, and Forecast (WRF) model. Of particular interest is an asymmetrical rainfall pattern across the lake basin, due to a diurnal land-lake breeze. The main aim is to present a customization framework for use over the lake. This framework is developed by conducting several series of model runs to investigate aspects of the customization. The runs are analyzed using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission rainfall data and Climatic Research Unit temperature data. The study shows that the choice of parameters and lake surface temperature initialization can significantly alter the results. Also, the optimal physics combinations for the climatology may not necessarily be suitable for all circumstances, such as extreme years. The study concludes that WRF is unable to reproduce the pattern across the lake. The temperature of the lake is too cold and this prevents the diurnal land-lake breeze reversal. Overall, this study highlights the importance of customizing a model to the region of research and presents a framework through which this may be achieved.",

The results showed that, in nearly 60 years, the spring precipitation increased slightly; however, the linear trend of other seasonal and annual precipitations showed a reducing trend. Seasonal and annual precipitation had the characteristics of multiple time scales. Different time scales showed the different cyclic alternating patterns. Overall, in the next period of time, different seasons and the annual precipitation will be in the periods of precipitation-reduced oscillation; high drought disaster risks may occur in Yunnan province. Particularly, by analyzing large area of severe drought of Yunnan province in 2009–2012, the predicted results of wavelet were verified.

Nonetheless, two errors were noted: (1) misinterpreting predictive intervals as diurnal fluctuation (deterministic construal errors) and (2) judging the probability of events within and beyond the interval, when asked about them separately, as greater than 100%. These errors were only partially explained by WMS and numeracy. Importantly, omitting visualizations eliminated deterministic construal errors and overestimation of percent chance was not consistently related to decision quality. Thus, there may be important benefits to predictive interval forecasts that are not dependent on a full understanding of the theoretical principles underlying them or an advanced education, making them appropriate for a broad range of users with diverse backgrounds, weather concerns, and risk tolerances.",

Therefore, while studying the global climate change, investigation of aerosol concentrations and properties is essential both at local and regional levels. In this paper, we have used relatively long-term Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data during September 2006–August 2014 to analyze aerosol properties such as aerosol optical depth at 500 nm (AOD), Ångström exponent (440–870 nm) (AE), refractive index (RI), and asymmetry parameter over Karachi, a coastal megacity of Pakistan. The average annual values of AOD and AE were found to be 0.48 ± 0.20 and 0.59 ± 0.29, respectively. The peak (0.88 ± 0.31) AOD was recorded in July with corresponding AE of 0.30 ± 0.22 representing reasonably higher concentration of coarse size particles over Karachi. The cluster analysis using the scatter plot between absorption AE and extinction AE revealed that desert dust prevailed in the atmosphere of Karachi in spring and summer, while biomass burning aerosols dominate in autumn and winter. The peak values of volume concentrations of coarse and fine-mode particulate matter were found in summer and autumn, respectively. Also, we found significant growing trend in single-scattering albedo with wavelength, indicating the domination of dust particles during summer and spring. The peak value of the real part of the RI was observed in spring (1.53) and modest in winter (1.50). On the contrary, the peak value of the imaginary part of the RI was observed to be constantly elevated in winter and lesser in spring.",

Several microwave satellite soil moisture retrieval data products have also been available for applications. However, these observational data products have not been employed in any operational numerical weather or climate prediction models. In this study, a preliminary test of assimilating satellite soil moisture data products from the NOAA-NESDIS Soil Moisture Operational Product System (SMOPS) into the NOAA-NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS) is conducted. Using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) introduced in recent year publications and implemented in the GFS, the multiple satellite blended daily global soil moisture data from SMOPS for the month of April 2012 are assimilated into the GFS. The forecasts of surface variables, anomaly correlations of isobar heights, and precipitation forecast skills of the GFS with and without the soil moisture data assimilation are assessed. The surface and deep layer soil moisture estimates of the GFS after the satellite soil moisture assimilation are found to have slightly better agreement with the ground soil moisture measurements at dozens of sites across the continental United States (CONUS). Forecasts of surface humidity and air temperature, 500 hPa height anomaly correlations, and the precipitation forecast skill demonstrated certain level of improvements after the soil moisture assimilation against those without the soil moisture assimilation. However, the methodology for the soil moisture data assimilation into operational GFS runs still requires further development efforts and tests.",

These rainfall events range from local to synoptic scale convection and caused a significant increase in the level of the Iguaçu river. In the average, the ensembles yielded up to 20% better skill than single WRF forecasts for the events analyzed. WRF ensembles also allow estimating the predictability through the dispersion of the forecasts providing relevant information for decision-making. Phase errors of ensemble forecasts are larger than amplitude errors. More complex microphysics parameterizations yielded better QPFs with smaller phase errors.

Two groups of ten-year (1992–2001) simulation experiments (hereafter referred to as BATS and CLM) were performed based on two land-surface schemes (BATS and CLM3.5, resp.) and were compared with observed data using the same domain, initial, and lateral boundary conditions, cumulus convective scheme, and spatial resolution. The results showed that the CLM monthly precipitation more closely matched the observed data compared with BATS. BATS and CLM both overestimated summer precipitation in the northern TP but underestimated summer precipitation in the southern TP. However, CLM, because of its detailed land-surface process descriptions, reduced the overestimated precipitation areas and magnitudes of BATS. Compared to CN05, the regional average summer precipitation in BATS and CLM was overestimated by 34.7% and underestimated by 24.7%, respectively. Higher soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and heating effects in the BATS experiment triggered changes in atmospheric circulation patterns over the TP. Moreover, BATS simulated the lower atmosphere as warmer and more humid and the upper atmosphere (~150 hPa) as colder than the CLM simulations; these characteristics likely increased the instability for moist convection and produced more summer precipitation.",

The model can reproduce the variations of 2 m temperature (T2) and 2 m relative humidity (RH2), but T2 is overestimated and RH2 is underestimated in the control experiment. After using the new initial drive and land use data, the simulation precision in T2 is improved by the correction of overestimated net energy flux at surface and the RH2 is improved due to the lower T2 and larger soil moisture. Due to systematic bias in WRF modeling for wind speed, we design another experiment that includes the Jimenez subgrid-scale orography scheme, which reduces the frequency of low wind speed and increases the frequency of high wind speed and that is more consistent with the observation. Meanwhile, the new drive and land-use data lead to lower boundary layer height and influence the potential temperature and wind speed in both the lower atmosphere and the upper layer, while the impact on water vapor mixing ratio is primarily concentrated in the lower atmosphere.",

This study produced a numerical forecasting experiment of the China Sea wave energy using WAVEWATCH-III (WW3, the latest version 4.18) wave model driven by T213 (WW3-T213) and T639 (WW3-T639) wind data separately. Then the WW3-T213 and WW3-T639 were verified and compared to build a short-term wave energy forecasting structure suited for the China Sea. Considering the value of wave power density (WPD), “wave energy rose,” daily and weekly total storage and effective storage of wave energy, this study also designed a series of short-term wave energy forecasting productions. Results show that both the WW3-T213 and WW3-T639 exhibit a good skill on the numerical forecasting of the China Sea WPD, while the result of WW3-T639 is much better. Judging from WPD and daily and weekly total storage and effective storage of wave energy, great wave energy caused by cold airs was found. As there are relatively frequent cold airs in winter, early spring, and later autumn in the China Sea and the surrounding waters, abundant wave energy ensues.",

However, little attention has been paid to how these relative contributions have changed over time. We analyzed the changes in surface runoff during 1980–2010 in six subbasins in the mountainous region of the Haihe River Basin, one of the most serious water shortage regions in China, and identified the changes in the relative contributions of climate (precipitation and temperature) and land-use to surface runoff decrease. There was a decreasing tendency in surface runoff in all subbasins, four of which had an abrupt change point around 1998. Comparing the relative contributions before and after 1998 in the four subbasins, the average influence of climate was found to decline dramatically from 67.1% to 30.5%, while that of land-use increased from 23.9% to 69.5% mainly due to the increase of forest area. Our results revealed that the primary environmental factor responsible for runoff variations was not constant, and an alternation may accentuate the impact and stimulate an abrupt change of runoff in semiarid and semihumid mountainous regions. This will help in taking tracking measures to deal with the complex water resource challenges according to different driving factors.",

The plan called “town of mountain” is carried out in many nonplain areas to alleviate the conflict. To avoid geological disasters and ecological risks in those areas, land use suitability assessment is of great importance. In this paper, the fuzzy weight of evidence model is applied into land use suitability assessment in low-slope hilly regions in Yunnan, China. Fuzzy weight of evidences is calculated to determine 9 map layers. Finally, posterior probabilities are modified after synthesizing each map layer, which are used to generate a land use suitability map. The results show that 9.33%, 26.18%, 45.98%, and 18.51% of low-slope hilly regions are separately highly suitable, moderately suitable, marginally suitable, and unsuitable for development. Besides, highly and moderately suitable areas are mainly located in towns with excellent natural and socioeconomic conditions. The largest areas which are marginally suitable for development are most widely distributed. Unsuitable areas are mainly distributed far away from towns and water sources. The findings of the research will promote the rational use and scientific management of the land.",

    "abstract": "Previous water budget studies over Lake Victoria basin have shown that there is near balance between rainfall and evaporation and that the variability of Lake Victoria levels is determined virtually entirely by changes in rainfall since evaporation is nearly constant. The variability of rainfall over East Africa is dominated by El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO); however, the second and third most dominant rainfall climate modes also account for significant variability across the region. The relationship between ENSO and other significant modes of precipitation variability with Lake Victoria levels is nonlinear. This relationship should be studied to determine which modes need to be accurately modeled in order to accurately model Lake Victoria levels, which are important to the hydroelectric industry in East Africa. The objective of this analysis is to estimate the relative contributions of the dominant modes of annual precipitation variability to the modulation of Lake Victoria levels for the present day (1950–2012). The first mode of annual rainfall variability accounts for most of the variability in Lake Victoria levels, while the effects of the second and third modes are negligible even though these modes are also significant over the region.",

More than 75.5% of the two ceilometers’ differences are within ±200 m and about 89.5% within ±500 m, while only 30.7% of the differences between WSIRCMS and ceilometers are within ±500 m and about 55.2% within ±1000 m.

The root mean square error (RMSE) of the river temperature was 2.21°C with the regression method, improving to 0.83°C with the stochastic model. The net shortwave radiation flux was the dominant heat gain component, while the latent heat flux accounted for the main heat loss. The sensible heat flux represented the smallest contribution.

Besides, decadal and interannual variations of different rain belts were analyzed to reveal the spatial changing pattern of precipitation. Results indicated the following.

Arid zone and humid zone are shrinking while semiarid and semihumid zone are expanding. Transformation between semiarid and arid zones, humid and semihumid zones is frequent. During 2011–2050, annual precipitation will not change much (−6~12%) except river basins in the southwest (more than 40%) compared with the baseline.

Such techniques can be grouped into two approaches of dynamical and statistical downscaling. In this study, we investigated the performances of different downscaling methods, focusing on East Asian summer monsoon precipitation to obtain more finely resolved and value added datasets. The dynamical downscaling was conducted by the Regional Model Program (RMP) of the Global/Regional Integrated Model system (GRIMs), while the statistical downscaling was performed through coupled pattern-based simple linear regression. The dynamical downscaling resulted in a better representation of the spatial distribution and long-term trend than the GCM produced; however, it tended to overestimate precipitation over East Asia. In contrast, the application of the statistical downscaling resulted in a bias in the amount of precipitation, due to low variance that is inherent in regression-based downscaling. A combination of dynamical and statistical downscaling produced the best results in time and space. This study provides a guideline for determining the most effective and robust downscaling method in the hydrometeorological applications, which are quite sensitive to the accuracy of downscaled precipitation.",

    "abstract": "The assimilation of satellite soil moisture (SM) products with coarse resolution is promising in improving rainfall-runoff modeling, but it is largely impacted by the data assimilation (DA) strategy. This study performs the assimilation of a satellite soil moisture product from the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) in a physically based semidistributed hydrological model (SWAT) in the upper Huai River basin in China, with the objective to improve its rainfall-runoff simulation. In this assimilation, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is adopted with full consideration of the model and observation error, the rescaling technique for satellite SM, and the regional applicability of the hydrological model. The results show that the ESA CCI SM assimilation generally improves the streamflow simulation of the study catchment. It is more effective for low-flow simulation, while for very high-flow/large-flood modeling, the DA performance shows uncertainty. The less-effective performance on large-flood simulation lies in the relatively low dependence of rainfall-runoff generation on the antecedent SM as during which the SM is nearly saturated and the runoff is largely dominated by precipitation. Besides, the efficiency of DA is deteriorated by the dense forest coverage and the complex topography conditions of the basin. Overall, the ESA CCI SM assimilation improves the streamflow simulation of the SWAT model in particular for low flow. This study provides an encouragement for the application of the ESA CCI SM in water management, especially over low-flow periods.",

The precipitation threshold of 1 mm and a minimum prevalence of 50% were the criteria based on which the prevalent precipitation of Iran was identified. Then, vorticity of days corresponding to prevalent winter precipitation was calculated and, by performing cluster analysis, the representative days of vorticity were specified. The results showed that prevalent winter precipitation vorticity in Iran is related to the vorticity patterns of low pressure of Mediterranean-low pressure of Persian Gulf dual-core, low pressure closed of central Iran-high pressure of East Europe, Ural low pressure-Middle East High pressure, Saudi Arabia low pressure-Europe high pressure, and high-pressure belt of Siberia-low pressure of central Iran. At the same time, the most intense vorticity occurred when the climate of Iran was influenced by a massive belt pattern of Siberian high pressure-low pressure of central Iran. However, at the time of prevalent winter precipitation in Iran, an intense vorticity is drawn with the direction of Northeast and Northwest from the center of Iraq to the south of Iran.",

    "abstract": "When compared to the wide range of atmospheric sensing techniques, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) offers the advantage of operating under all weather conditions, is continuous, with high temporal and spatial resolution and high accuracy, and has long-term stability. The utilisation of GNSS ground networks of continuous stations for operational weather and climate services is already in place in many nations in Europe, Asia, and America under different initiatives and organisations. In Africa, the situation appears to be different. The focus of this paper is to assess the conditions of the existing and anticipated GNSS reference network in the African region for meteorological applications. The technical issues related to the implementation of near-real-time (NRT) GNSS meteorology are also discussed, including the data and network requirements for meteorological and climate applications. We conclude from this study that the African GNSS network is sparse in the north and central regions of the continent, with a dense network in the south and fairly dense network in the west and east regions of the continent. Most stations lack collocated meteorological sensors and other geodetic observing systems as called for by the GCOS Reference Upper Air Network (GRUAN) GNSS Precipitable Water Task Team and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Preliminary results of calculated zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD) from the African GNSS indicate spatial variability and diurnal dependence of ZTD. To improve the density and geometry of the existing network, countries are urged to contribute more stations to the African Geodetic Reference Frame (AFREF) program and a collaborative scheme between different organisations maintaining different GNSS stations on the continent is recommended. The benefit of using spaced based GNSS radio occultation (RO) data for atmospheric sounding is highlighted and filling of geographical gaps from the station-based observation network with GNSS RO is also proposed.",

Flt and Phe had the highest contribution to PAH species. β -HCH and heptachlor had the highest share in terms of OCPs. Particle phase PCBs exhibited monomodal size distribution, whereas OCPs had bimodal size distribution. PAHs exhibited either monomodal or bimodal size distribution on different days. The mass median diameter of PAHs did not change significantly during different atmospheric conditions due to their local sources. Gas/particle partitioning of each pollutant was evaluated by plotting their subcooled vapor pressure against the partitioning coefficient. From 1 to 3 February, the slope of the regression line shifted close to −1, indicating that the least favorable conditions were present during dust incursion for an equilibrium state.",

The average numbers of selected explanatory variables were 5.7 and 2.3 for logistic regression and decision tree techniques, respectively. Fewer explanatory variables can be more appropriate for operational activities to provide a timely warning for the prevention of the frost damages to agricultural crops.

Severe storms, strong winds, floods, and droughts develop at different spatial and temporal scales, but all can become disasters that cause significant infrastructure damage and claim hundreds of thousands of lives annually worldwide. Oftentimes, multiple hazards can occur simultaneously or trigger cascading impacts from one extreme weather event. For example, in addition to causing injuries, deaths, and material damage, a tropical storm can also result in flooding and mudslides, which can disrupt water purification and sewage disposal systems, cause overflow of toxic wastes, andincrease propagation of mosquito-borne diseases.",

    "abstract": "To limit global warming to well below 2°C in accord with the Paris Agreement, countries throughout the world have submitted their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) outlining their greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation actions in the next few decades. However, it remains unclear what the resulting climate change is in response to the proposed INDCs and subsequent emission reductions. In this study, the global and regional warming under the updated INDC scenarios was estimated from a range of comprehensive Earth system models (CMIP5) and a simpler carbon-climate model (MAGICC), based on the relationship of climate response to cumulative emissions. The global GHG emissions under the updated INDC pledges are estimated to reach 14.2∼15.0 GtC/year in 2030, resulting in a global mean temperature increase of 1.29∼1.55°C (median of 1.41°C) above the preindustrial level. By extending the INDC scenarios to 2100, global GHG emissions are estimated to be around 6.4∼9.0 GtC/year in 2100, resulting in a global mean temperature increase by 2.67∼3.74°C (median of 3.17°C). The Arctic warming is projected to be most profound, exceeding the global average by a factor of three by the end of this century. Thus, climate warming under INDC scenarios is projected to greatly exceed the long-term Paris Agreement goal of stabilizing the global mean temperature at to a low level of 1.5‐2.0°C above the pre-industrial. Our study suggests that the INDC emission commitments need to be adjusted and strengthened to bridge this warming gap.",

PWV measurements from 14 radiosonde and 5 GNSS stations over the period of 2014–2017 were included in the assessments. Results show that the GMI 3-day composites have an accuracy of better than 5 mm. A further evaluation shows that RMS (root mean square) errors of the GMI 3-day composites vary greatly in the range of 3∼14 mm at different radiosonde/GNSS sites. GMI 3-day composites show very good agreements with radiosonde and GNSS measured PWVs with correlation coefficients of 0.896 and 0.970, respectively. The application of GMI products demonstrates that it is possible to reveal the weather front, moisture advection, transportation, and convergence during the Meiyu rainfall. This work indicates that the GMI PWV products can contribute to various studies such as climate change, hydrologic cycle, and weather forecasting.",

Larix gmelinii and Betula platyphylla are native and dominant forest species in the Daxing’anling Mountains of Inner Mongolia, playing a major role in carbon sequestration of this region. This study was carried out to assess the effect of climate variables including precipitation and temperature on the biomass of Larix gmelinii and Betula platyphylla forests. For this purpose, we used the climate-sensitive stem biomass allometric model for both species separately to find out accurate stem biomass along with climatic factors from 1950 to 2016. A total of 66 random plots were taken to attain the data from this study area. Larix gmelinii and Betula platyphylla stem biomass have a strong correlation with annual precipitation ( R 2 = 0.86, R 2 = 0.71, R 2 = 0.79, and R 2 = 0.59) and maximum temperature ( R 2 = 0.76, R 2 = 0.64, R 2 = 0.67, and R 2 = 0.52). However, annual minimum temperature ( R 2 = 0.58, R 2 = 0.43, R 2 = 0.55, and R 2 = 0.46) and annual mean temperature ( R 2 = 0.40, R 2 = 0.22, R 2 = 0.36, and R 2 = 0.19) have a relatively negative impact on tree biomass. Therefore, we suggest that both species have a very strong adaptive nature with climatic variation and hence can survive under drought and high-temperature stress climatic conditions.",

Correlation analysis and stepwise linear regression were used to select the predictors for T air estimation. Nine predictors such as AHI BTs in channels 14 and 15, elevation, precipitable water vapor (PWV), and relative humidity (RH) were finally selected. Stepwise linear regression and neural network (NN) methods were applied to construct summer T air estimation models over China, respectively. The estimated T air by linear and NN models was evaluated using the observed T air from 272 meteorological stations over China. The results showed that AHI BTs in channels 14 and 15, elevation, PWV, and RH were more important for T air estimation than other predictors. The accuracy of the NN models was better than the linear models. The correlation coefficient ( R ), root mean square error (RMSE), and bias were 0.97, 1.72°C, and 0.04°C, respectively, for the NN model and were 0.89, 3.28°C, and 0.07°C, respectively, for the linear model. About 75.6% of the T air differences by the NN model were within 2.0°C, and even 45.8% were within 1.0°C. The performance of the T air estimation model for each site was also investigated, and the accuracy of T air estimation in southeast China is better than northwest China.",

However, the nonlinear dynamics of the climatic factors jeopardize the development of efficient prediction models. Therefore, to enhance the reliability and accuracy of streamflow prediction, this paper developed a three-stage hybrid model, namely, IVL (ICEEMDAN-VMD-LSTM), which integrated improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with additive noise (ICEEMDAN), variational mode decomposition (VMD), and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network. Monthly data series of streamflow, temperature, and precipitation in the Swat River Watershed, Pakistan, from January 1971 to December 2015 was used as a case study. Firstly, the correlation analysis and the two-stage decomposition approach were employed to select suitable inputs for the proposed model. ICEEMDAN was employed as a first decomposition stage, to decompose the three data series into intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and a residual component. In the second decomposition stage, the component of high frequency (IMF1) was decomposed by VMD, as the second decomposition. Afterward, all the components obtained through the correction analysis and the two-stage decomposition approach were predicted by using the LSTM network. Finally, the predicted results of all components were aggregated, to formulate an ensemble prediction for the original monthly streamflow series. The predicted results showed that the performance of the proposed model was superior to the other developed models, in respect of several evaluation benchmarks, demonstrating the applicability of the proposed IVL model for monthly streamflow prediction.",

To build the algorithm, two assumptions exist: (1) land surface emissivities (LSE) at two adjacent frequencies are equal and (2) there are simple parameterizations that relate transmittance, atmospheric effective radiating temperature, and PWV. Error analyses were performed using radiosonde sounding observations from Zhangye, China, and CE318 measurements of Dalanzadgad (43°34′37′′N, 104°25′8′′E) and Singapore (1°17′52′′N, 103°46′48′′E) sites from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET), respectively.

The validations in Dalanzadgad and Singapore sites showed that the retrieval algorithm had an RMSE of 4.73 mm and a bias of 0.84 mm and the bigger errors appeared when the water vapor was very dry or very moist.",

Objectives of this paper were to evaluate correlations of meteorological parameters on strawberry yield for Santa Maria region and to develop meteorology based empirical yield forecasting models for strawberries. Results showed significant correlation between meteorological parameters and strawberry yield and provided a basis for yield forecasting with lead time. Results from empirical models showed that cross-validated yields were closely associated with observed yield with lead time of 2 to 5 months. Overall, this study showed great potential in developing meteorology based yield forecast using principal components. This study only looked at meteorology based yield forecasts.

    "abstract": "The cold pool outflow has been previously shown to be generated by decaying Mesoscale Convective Complexes (MCCs) in the Maritime Continent. The cold pool also has a main role in the development processes of oceanic convective systems inducing heavy rainfall. This study investigated a cold pool event (January 1-2, 2021) related to a heavy rainfall system over the coastal region of Lampung, Southern Sumatra, within a high-resolution model simulation using a regional numerical weather prediction of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) with convection permitting of 1 km spatial resolution, which was validated by satellite and radar data observations. It is important to note that the intensity, duration, timing, and structure of heavy rainfall simulated were in good agreement with satellite-observed rainfall. The results also showed that a cold pool (CP) plays an important role in inducing Mesoscale Convective Complex (MCC) and was responsible for the development of an offshore propagation of land-based convective systems due to the late afternoon rainfall over inland. This study also suggests that the propagation speed of the CP 8.8 m·s−1 occurring over the seaside of the coastal region, the so-called CP-coastal, is a plausible mechanism for the speed of the offshore-propagating convection, which is dependent on both the background prevailing wind and outflow. These conditions help to maintain the near-surface low temperatures and inhibit cold pool dissipation, which has implications for the development of consecutive convection.",

The study’s findings show that the ARIMA (1,1,1), Holt-Winters exponential smoothing, ARIMA (1,1,2), and ARIMA (2,1,2) models do not outperform the artificial neural network model in estimating CO2 emissions in the Gulf countries. This study gives information on the current state of CO2 emission forecasts. This study will aid the researcher’s understanding of CO2 emissions forecasts. In addition, government agencies can use the findings of this study to develop strategic plans.",

    "abstract": "Meteorological stations, mainly located in developing countries, have gigantic missing values in the climate dataset (rainfall and temperature). Ignoring the missing values from analyses has been used as a technique to manage it. However, it leads to partial and biased results in data analyses. Instead, filling the data gaps using the reference datasets is a better and widely used approach. Thus, this study was initiated to evaluate the seven gap-filling techniques in daily rainfall datasets in five meteorological stations of Wolaita Zone and the surroundings in South Ethiopia. The considered gap-filling techniques in this study were simple arithmetic means (SAM), normal ratio method (NRM), correlation coefficient weighing (CCW), inverse distance weighting (IDW), multiple linear regression (MLR), empirical quantile mapping (EQM), and empirical quantile mapping plus (EQM+). The techniques were preferred because of their computational simplicity and appreciable accuracies. Their performance was evaluated against mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), skill scores (SS), and Pearson’s correlation coefficients (R). The results indicated that MLR outperformed other techniques in all of the five meteorological stations. It showed the lowest RMSE and the highest SS and R in all stations. Four techniques (SAM, NRM, CCW, and IDW) showed similar performance and were second-ranked in all of the stations with little exceptions in time series. EQM+ improved (not substantial) the performance levels of gap-filling techniques in some stations. In general, MLR is suggested to fill in the missing values of the daily rainfall time series. However, the second-ranked techniques could also be used depending on the required time series (period) of each station. The techniques have better performance in stations located in higher altitudes. The authors expect a substantial contribution of this paper to the achievement of sustainable development goal thirteen (climate action) through the provision of gap-filling techniques with better accuracy.",

    "abstract": "The availability of accurate spatiotemporal rainfall data is of utmost importance for reliable predictions from hydroclimatological studies. Challenges and limitations faced due to the absence of dense rain gauge (RG) networks are seen especially in the developing countries. Therefore, alternative rainfall measurements such as satellite rainfall products (SRPs) are used when RG networks are scarce or completely do not exist. Noteworthy, rainfall data retrieved from satellites also possess several uncertainties. Hence, these SRPs should essentially be validated beforehand. The Mahaweli River Basin (MRB), the largest river basin in Sri Lanka, is the heart of the country’s water resources contributing to a significant share of the hydropower production and agricultural sector. Given the importance of the MRB, this study explored the suitability of SRPs as an alternative for RG data for the basin. Daily rainfall data of six types of SRPs were extracted at 14 locations within the MRB. Thereafter, statistical analysis was carried out using continuous and categorical evaluation indices to evaluate the accuracy of SRPs. Nonparametric tests, including the Mann-Kendall and Sen’s slope estimator tests, were used to detect the possibility of trends and the magnitude, respectively. Integrated MultisatellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) outperformed among all SRPs, while Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) products showed dire performances. However, IMERG also demonstrated underestimations when compared to RG data. Trend analysis results showcased that the IMERG product agreed more with RG data on monthly and annual time scales while Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis–3B42 (TRMM-3B42) agreed more on the seasonal scale. Overall, IMERG turned out to be the best alternative among the SRPs analyzed for MRB. However, it was clear that these products possess significant errors which cannot be ignored when using them in hydrological applications. The results of the study will be valuable for many parties including river basin authorities, agriculturists, meteorologists, hydrologists, and many other stakeholders.",

In this study, based on three statistical learning algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest regression (RF), and gradient boosting regressor (GBR), we proposed an efficient downscaling approach to produce high spatial resolution precipitation. In order to demonstrate efficiency and accuracy of our models over traditional multilinear regression (MLR) downscaling models, we did a downscaling analysis for daily observed precipitation data from 34 monitoring sites in Bangladesh. Validation revealed that <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <msup> <mrow> <mi>R</mi> </mrow> <mrow> <mn>2</mn> </mrow> </msup> </math> of GBR could reach 0.98, compared with RF (0.94), SVM (0.88), and multilinear regression (MLR) (0.69) models, so the GBR-based downscaling model had the best performance among all four downscaling models. We suggest that the GBR-based downscaling models should be used to replace traditional MLR downscaling models to produce a more accurate map of high-resolution precipitation for flood disaster management, drought forecasting, and long-term planning of land and water resources.",

    "abstract": "Changes in precipitation patterns significantly affect flood and drought hazard management and water resources at local to regional scales. Therefore, the main motivation behind this paper is to examine the spatial and temporal rainfall variability over Sri Lanka by Standardized Rainfall Anomaly Index (SRAI) and Precipitation Concentration Index (PCI) from 1990 to 2019. The Mann–Kendall (MK) trend test and Sen’s slope (SS) were utilized to assess the trend in the precipitation concentration based on PCI. The Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation method was incorporated to measure spatial distribution. Precipitation variability analysis showed that seasonal variations are more than those of annual variations. In addition, wet, normal, and dry years were identified over Sri Lanka using SRAI. The maximum SRAI (2.27) was observed for the year 2014 for the last 30 years (1990–2019), which shows the extremely wet year of Sri Lanka. The annual and seasonal PCI analysis showed moderate to irregular rainfall distribution except for the Jaffna and Ratnapura areas (annual scale-positive changes in Katugastota for 21.39% and Wellawaya for 17.6%; seasonal scale-Vavuniya for 33.64%, Trincomalee for 31.26%, and Batticaloa for 18.79% in SWMS). The MK test, SS-test, and percent change analyses reveal that rainfall distribution and concentration change do not show a significant positive or negative change in rainfall pattern in Sri Lanka, despite a few areas which experienced significant positive changes. Therefore, this study suggests that the rainfall in Sri Lanka follows the normal trend of precipitation with variations observed both annually and seasonally.",

    "abstract": "Meteorological drought poses a frequent challenge in the Nile River basin, yet its comprehensive evaluation across the basin has been hindered by insufficient recorded rainfall data. Common indices like the standard precipitation index, coefficients of variation, and precipitation concentration index serve as pivotal tools in gauging drought severity. This research aimed to assess the meteorological drought status in the Nile River basin by using the Power Data Access Viewer product rainfall data. Bias correction procedures were implemented to refine the monthly rainfall data for Bahirdar, Markos, Nekemt, and Muger stations, resulting in notable improvements in the coefficient of determination ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><msup><mrow><mi>R</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msup></math> ) that were increased from 0.74 to 0.93, 0.72 to 0.89, 0.71 to 0.96, and 0.69 to 0.84, respectively. The average spatial distribution of drought in the Nile basin was classified as extremely wet (3.81%), severely wet (9.01%), moderately wet (7.36%), near normal (9.97%), moderately drought (21.20%), severely drought (17.11%), and extremely drought (31.54%). Approximately 10.33% of the Nile River basin was situated in regions characterized by high rainfall variability, while around 21.17% was located in areas with a notably irregular precipitation concentration index. Overall, this study sheds light on the prevailing meteorological drought patterns in the Nile River basin, emphasizing the significance of understanding and managing these phenomena for the sustainable development of the region.",

    "abstract": "The investigation into changing rainfall patterns in the Indonesian Maritime Continent (IMC) involved testing for trends, step changes, and variance nonstationarity using the Mann–Kendall, Pettitt, and White tests, respectively. The analysis covered data from 106 meteorological stations over the period from 1981 to 2021, with all tests conducted at annual time scales to understand the evolving precipitation dynamics in the region. According to the findings of this study, the average annual rainfall in IMC is nonstationary. Rainfall has increased dramatically by 12.72 mm with a significant shift point in 1994. However, this characteristic is likely to vary if the analysis period is extended, reduced, or conducted in different time frames. The spatial analysis indicates that 35.8% of meteorological stations observed a notable increase in rainfall, while 28.3% experienced a significant shift, and 16% displayed considerable variation. Consequently, the study only partially identified the nonstationary nature of rainfall in the IMC. Moreover, the research highlights a substantial rise in rainfall in the central to eastern IMC region, whereas the central to western region predominantly shows a decrease. This nonstationary test helps avoid errors in climatic conditions and analytical methods, presenting recommendations for hydrological projects. Consequently, employing this nonstationary test helps prevent inaccuracies in understanding climatic conditions and analytical techniques, thereby offering valuable suggestions for hydrological projects.",

The heights were averaged over a region encompassing the block, and then compared with corresponding monthly mean values. If planetary‐scale or synoptic‐scale heights are greater than the monthly mean, the block is called single‐scale dominant. In the study, 79% of blocks were single‐scale dominant, whereas the remaining 21% of events were alternating‐scale prominent. This proportion varied by season with winter (summer) events being synoptic (planetary) scale dominant. The stability of blocks is also examined to determine if two stability indicators were useful in the assessment of the character of planetary and synoptic‐scale flows. These quantities are area integrated enstrophy, and the maximum value of stream function gradients within the block region. The analysis of a prolonged block occurring in the Gulf of Alaska during August 2004 shows the planetary‐scale is unstable during block onset and then stabilizes during the mature stage. The synoptic‐scale played a dominant role in destabilizing the planetary‐scale during the mature stage of the block initiating decay.",

This study aims to assess the performance of the Dust REgional Atmospheric Model (BSC‐DREAM8b) in the prediction of dust outbreaks near the surface in Eastern Mediterranean. For this purpose, model PM10 predictions covering a 7‐year period and PM10 observations at five surface monitoring sites in Greece are used. A quantitative criterion is set to select the significant dust outbreaks defined as those when the predicted PM10 surface concentration exceeds 12 μ g/m 3 . The analysis reveals that significant dust transport is usually observed for 1–3 consecutive days. Dust outbreak seasons are spring and summer, while some events are also forecasted in autumn. The seasonal variability of dust transport events is different at Finokalia, where the majority of events are observed in spring and winter. Dust contributes by 19–25% to the near surface observed PM10 levels, which can be increased to more than 50 μ g/m 3 during dust outbreaks, inducing violations of the air quality standards. Dust regional modeling can be regarded as a useful tool for air quality managers when assessing compliance with air quality limit values.",

I show using hindcast experiments that trend estimation gives more accurate predictions of minimum temperatures 1-2 years in advance compared to the previous 30 years' mean alone. I find that annual minimum temperature increased roughly 2.5 times faster than mean temperature (~2.0 K versus ~0.8 K since 1970), and is already an average of 1.2 0.5 K (regionally up to ~2 K) above the 1976–2005 mean, so that much of the country belongs to warmer hardiness zones compared to the current map.

An average annual temperature increase ranging from 2°C to 5°C in new urban area and an average annual temperature decrease ranging from 0.40°C to 1.20°C in the south of the megalopolis will be caused by future urban expansion. The average annual precipitation of the simulation area will decrease due to future urban expansion by 5.75 mm, 7.10 mm, and 8.35 mm in the periods of 2010–2020, 2040–2050, and 2090–2100, respectively. The warming effect of future urban expansion in original and new urban area and drought effects in nonurban area will be more serious in summer than in winter. A cooling effect will turn up in original urban area in winter. This research further shows that a study at the scale of megalopolis helps to understand the integrated effect of combination and interaction of multiple cities and their surrounding areas which may crucially determine regional climate pattern and should be highly valued in the future.",

Initialized from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) high-resolution data, the forecasting system is characterized by combining the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model and the Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS) 3DVAR package. Observations from Doppler radars, surface Automatic Weather Station (AWS) network, and radiosondes are used in the experiments to evaluate the impact of data assimilation on short-term quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF) skill. Results suggest that extrasurface AWS data assimilation has slight but general positive impact on rainfall location forecasts. Surface AWS data also improve model results of near-surface variables. Radiosonde data assimilation improves the QPF skill by improving rainfall position accuracy and reducing rainfall overprediction. Compared with radar data, the overall impact of additional surface and radiosonde data is smaller and is reflected primarily in reducing rainfall overestimation. The assimilation of all radar, surface, and radiosonde data has a more positive impact on the forecast skill than the assimilation of either type of data only for the two rainfall events.",

This work shows distinctly different patterns of change in winter, spring, and summer for cloud fraction and surface temperature. Satellite observations over 1982–2004 have shown that the Arctic has warmed up and become cloudier in spring and summer, but cooled down and become less cloudy in winter. The annual mean surface temperature has increased at a rate of 0.34°C per decade. The decadal rates of cloud fraction trends are −3.4%, 2.3%, and 0.5% in winter, spring, and summer, respectively. Correspondingly, annually averaged surface albedo has decreased at a decadal rate of −3.2%. On the annual average, the trend of cloud forcing at the surface is −2.11 W/m 2 per decade, indicating a damping effect on the surface warming by clouds. The decreasing sea ice albedo and surface warming tend to modulate cloud radiative cooling effect in spring and summer. Arctic sea ice has also declined substantially with decadal rates of −8%, −5%, and −15% in sea ice extent, thickness, and volume, respectively. Significant correlations between surface temperature anomalies and climate indices, especially the Arctic Oscillation (AO) index, exist over some areas, implying linkages between global climate change and Arctic climate change.",

    "abstract": "The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) is planning to implement a fine-resolution Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model for supporting the aviation weather applications at the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA). This new NWP model system, called Aviation Model (AVM), is configured at a horizontal grid spacing of 600 m and 200 m. It is based on the WRF-ARW (Advance Research WRF) model that can have sufficient computation efficiency in order to produce hourly updated forecasts up to 9 hours ahead on a future high performance computer system with theoretical peak performance of around 10 TFLOPS. AVM will be nested inside the operational mesoscale NWP model of HKO with horizontal resolution of 2 km. In this paper, initial numerical experiment results in forecast of windshear events due to seabreeze and terrain effect are discussed. The simulation of sea-breeze-related windshear is quite successful, and the headwind change observed from flight data could be reproduced in the model forecast. Some impacts of physical processes on generating the fine-scale wind circulation and development of significant convection are illustrated. The paper also discusses the limitations in the current model setup and proposes methods for the future development of AVM.",

    "abstract": "We performed bias correction in future climate change scenarios to provide better accuracy of models through adaptation to future climate change. The proposed combination of the change factor (CF) and quantile mapping (QM) methods combines the individual advantages of both methods for adjusting the bias in global circulation models (GCMs) and regional circulation models (RCMs). We selected a study site in Songwol-dong, Seoul, Republic of Korea, to test and assess our proposed method. Our results show that the combined CF + QM method delivers better performance in terms of correcting the bias in GCMs/RCMs than when both methods are applied individually. In particular, our proposed method considerably improved the bias-corrected precipitation by capturing both the high peaks and amounts of precipitation as compared to that from the CF-only and QM-only methods. Thus, our proposed method can provide high-accuracy bias-corrected precipitation data, which could prove to be highly useful in interdisciplinary studies across the world.",

The deposition fluxes of the sum of detected PAHs at the industrial area ranged from 92 to 2432 ng m −2 d −1 . In particular the deposition fluxes of BaP, BaA, and BkF were, on average, 10, 14, and 8 times higher than those detected at the urban background site, respectively. The same finding was for metals. The deposition fluxes of Ni (19.8 µ g m −2 d −1 ) and As (2.2 µ g m −2 d −1 ) at the industrial site were about 5 times higher than those at the urban background site, while the deposition fluxes of Fe (57 mg m −2 d −1 ) and Mn (1.02 mg m −2 d −1 ) about 31 times higher. Precipitation and wind speed played an important role in PAH deposition fluxes. Fe and Mn fluxes at the industrial site resulted high when wind direction favored the transport of air masses from the steel plant to the receptor site. The impact of the industrial area was also confirmed by IP/(IP + BgP), IP/BgP, and BaP/BgP diagnostic ratios.",

In general, the vertical wind profile below the canopy is strongly affected by the forest structure. From the forest floor to 0.65 h (where h = 35 m is the average height of the forest canopy for sites considered), the wind profile is approximately constant with height with speeds less than 1 ms −1 . Above 0.65 to 2.25 h , the wind speed increases with height. Testing these data with the Yi and Souza models showed that each was able to reproduce satisfactorily the vertical wind profile for different experimental sites in the Amazon.

    "abstract": "In July 2008, five people were killed by a tragic flash flood caused by a local torrential heavy rainfall in a short time in Toga River. From this tragic accident, we realized that a system which can detect hazardous rain-cells in the earlier stage is strongly needed and would provide an additional 5 to 10 min for evacuation. By analyzing this event, we verified that a first radar echo aloft, by volume scan observation, is a practical and important sign for early warning of flash flood, and we named a first echo as a “baby-rain-cell” of Guerrilla-heavy rainfall. Also, we found a vertical vorticity criterion for identifying hazardous rain-cells and developed a heavy rainfall prediction system that has the important feature of not missing any hazardous rain-cell. Being able to detect heavy rainfall by 23.6 min on average before it reaches the ground, this system is implemented in XRAIN in the Kinki area. Additionally, to resolve the relationship between baby-rain-cell growth and vorticity behavior, we carried out an analysis of vorticity inside baby-rain-cells and verified that a pair of positive and negative vertical vortex tubes as well as an updraft between them existed in a rain-cell in the early stage.",

Six experiments with various combinations of microphysics and boundary schemes indicated that a combination of WRF Single-Moment 6-class (WSM6) scheme and Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ) best fits to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) data. WSM6-MYJ also performs the best for the track and intensity of rainfall and obtains the best statistics skill scores in the range of maximum rainfall intensity for 48-h. Sensitivity experiments on different terrain settings with Normal Rakhine Mountain (NRM), with Half of Rakhine Mountain (HRM), and Without Rakhine Mountain (WoRM) are designed with the use of WSM6-MYJ scheme. The track of TC ROANU moved northwestward in WoRM and HRM. Due to the presence of Rakhine Mountain, TC track moved into Myanmar and the peak rainfall occurred on the leeward side of the Mountain. In the absence of Rakhine Mountain, a shift in peak rainfall was observed in north side of the Mountain.",

Fewer clouds are found over the Mongolian Plateau and northern Indian Peninsula, with more clouds apparent over tropical seas and southern China. Cloud cover at night is slightly higher than during the day. Single-layer clouds are more common than multilayer clouds in most areas. In most areas, high-level cloud accounts for the largest proportion of single-layer clouds. The occurrence of clouds in summer and autumn is generally greater than in spring and winter. Single-layer clouds over the Mongolian Plateau and northern Indian Peninsula occur less frequently than multilayer clouds, especially in winter. Furthermore, single-layer clouds are common over the eastern part of southwest China all year round. Over parts of the Tibetan Plateau in summer, high clouds account for the largest proportion (&gt;35%) of annual single-layer clouds, as a result of topography and enhanced summer convection.",

    "abstract": "Design storms are very useful in many hydrological and hydraulic practices and are obtained from statistical analysis of precipitation records. However considering design storms, which are often quite unlike the natural rainstorms, may result in designing oversized or undersized drainage facilities. For these reasons, in this study, a two-parameter double exponential function is proposed to parameterize historical storm events. The proposed function has been assessed against the storms selected from 5-year rainfall time series with a 1-minute resolution, measured by three meteorological stations located in Calabria, Italy. In particular, a nonlinear least square optimization has been used to identify parameters. In previous studies, several evaluation methods to measure the goodness of fit have been used with excellent performances. One parameter is related to the centroid of the rain distribution; the second one is related to high values of the standard deviation of the kurtosis for the selected events. Finally, considering the similarity between the proposed function and the Gumbel function, the two parameters have been computed with the method of moments; in this case, the correlation values were lower than those computed with nonlinear least squares optimization but sufficiently accurate for designing purposes.",

The calibrated model simulates a transition of the Cowichan River from mostly gaining within the valley, to losing stream near the coast where groundwater extraction is focused. Losing and gaining sections correlate with geological substrate. Recharge across the watershed accounts for 17% of precipitation. Climate change is projected to lessen snowpack accumulation in the high alpine and alter timing of snowmelt, resulting in higher spring and winter river discharge and lower summer flows.",

This paper first offers an overview of data sources and then methods of design and valuation of weather derivatives at the regional level. The accompanied case study focuses on cultivation of cereals (wheat and barley) in the Czech Republic. However, its generalizability is straightforward. The analysis of key growing phases of cereals is based on regression analysis using weather indices as the independent variables and crop yields as dependent variables. With the bootstrap tool, the burn analysis is considered as useful tool for estimating uncertainty about the payoff, option price, and statistics of probability distribution of revenues. The results show that the spatial and production basis risks reduce the efficiency of the weather derivatives. Finally, the potential for expansion of weather derivatives remains in the low income countries of Africa and Asia with systemic weather risk.",

A combined pluviothermal index is used to identify climate regions of West Africa. The interdecadal change of the climate is analyzed along with a discussion on the West African Monsoon (WAM) circulation. The impact of vegetation is also analyzed. It is shown that Lamto has mainly a subhumid climate but, in some particular years, this area has a humid climate. Two decades (1962–1971 and 2002–2011) exhibit rainfall excess and the last three ones (1972–1981, 1982–1991, and 1992–2001) show a rainfall deficit that affected West Africa in the early 1970s. The meridional wind field from 1000 hPa to 700 hPa is used to study the WAM variability. The level of the WAM is the lowest ( ~ 860–890 hPa) during the active period of the northern wind coming from the Sahara desert (November–February). During 1962–1971 and 2007–2009, the depth of the monsoon at Lamto reaches 300 hPa with an increase in the rainfall. A relationship between potential evapotranspiration and the climate highlights rainfall deficit in 1969 and rainfall excess in 2001–2011.",

Major conclusions were listed as follows. (1) Annual and seasonal temperature increased with different rates on the process of fluctuating changes during 1960~2012. The upward trend was 0.22°C 10a −1 for annual temperature, while it was very significant in winter (0.34°C 10a −1 ) and spring (0.31°C 10a −1 ), moderately significant in autumn (0.21°C 10a −1 ), and nonsignificant in summer (0.05°C 10a −1 ). (2) The spatial changes of annual and seasonal temperature were similar. The temperature increased significantly in Beijing and its adjacent regions, while it was nonsignificant in the central and southern regions. (3) The spring, autumn, winter, and annual temperature had warm abrupt change. The abrupt change time for winter temperature was in the late 1970s, while it was in the late 1980s and early 1990s for spring, autumn, and annual temperature.

It is of great significance to the grassland management to determine the changing trend of grassland productivity and its response to climate change. Firstly, the relationship between grassland productivity and climate change, geographical conditions, and human activities was analyzed with the panel data of the whole China during 1980–2010 in this study. The result indicated that the temperature and precipitation were very important to grassland productivity at the national scale. Secondly, the grassland in China was divided into 7 grassland ecological-economic zones according to the ecosystem service function and climate characteristics. The relationship between grassland productivity and climate change was further analyzed at the regional scale. The result indicated that the temperature is more beneficial to the increase of the grassland productivity in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Southwest Karst shrubland region. Thirdly, the increase of the temperature and precipitation can increase the grassland productivity and consequently relieve the pressure according to the climate factors of simulation with the community climate system model v4.0 (CCSM). However, the simulation result indicates that the human pressure on grasslands is still severe under the four RCPs scenarios and the grassland area would reduce sharply due to the conversion from the grassland to the cultivated land. What is more, there is still a great challenge to the increase of total grassland productivity in China.",

Results show that, under El Niño conditions, autumn rainfall in Central Vietnam is reduced by about 10 to 30%. This reduction seems to be caused by a weakening of the North East monsoon circulation, which appears to be linked to an anomalous anticyclonic vortex and a positive sea level pressure anomaly over the East Sea. In addition, the disappearance of a secondary moisture source over the southern region of the East Sea also favors the reduction in rainfall over this region. Conversely, during La Niña, the total autumn rainfall in the ECV region increases by about 9 to 19%. The strengthening of the North East monsoon, with a cyclonic wind anomaly over the East Sea, helps to increase the moisture supply to the area by about 10 to 20%, resulting in enhanced rainfall in the ECV. It is also found that the La Niña conditions do not only cause an increase in rainfall, but also change the temporal distribution of the monthly rainfall over the region, with more rainfall in the latter months of the year.",

Results indicated that (1) the spatial pattern of the annual precipitation, rainy days, extreme precipitation, and maximum daily precipitations shows a clear transitional change from the south (high) to the north (low) in the HR; it confirmed the conclusion that the HRB is located in the transitional zone of the 800 mm precipitation contour in China, where the 800 mm precipitation contour is considered as the geographical boundary of the south and the north. (2) Higher value of the extreme precipitation intensity mainly occurs in the middle of the east and the central part of the basin; it reveals a relatively distinct west-east spatial disparity, and this is not in line with the spatial pattern of the extreme precipitation total, the sum of the precipitation in 95th precipitation days. (3) Annual precipitation of 22 stations exhibits increasing trend, and these 22 stations are located from the central to the northern part. There is no significant trend detected for the seasonal precipitation. The summer precipitation exhibits a larger change range; this might cause the variation of the flood and drought in the HBR. However, the increasing trend in winter precipitation may be beneficial to the relief of winter agricultural drought. Rainy days in 12 stations, mostly located in and around the central northeastern part, experienced significant decreasing trend. Extreme precipitation days and precipitation intensity have increasing trends, but no station with significant change trend is detected for the maximum precipitation of the basin. (4) The spatiotemporal variability in the HRB is mainly caused by the geographic differences and is largely influenced by the interdecadal variations of East Asian Summer Monsoon in eastern China.

In this paper, we analyzed the runoff changes in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) including the spatiotemporal characteristics of intra-annual variation, the trend, the mutation point, and the period of annual runoff using various statistical methods. We also investigated how changes in the precipitation and temperature could impact on runoff. We found that the intra-annual runoff shows a decreasing trend from 1954 to 2008 and from upper stream to lower stream. On the annual runoff sequence, the upstream runoff has a high consistency and shows an increasing diversity from upper stream to lower stream. The mutation points of the annual runoff in the YRB are years 1961 and 2004. Annual runoff presents multitime scales for dry and abundance changes. Hurst values show that the runoffs at the main control stations all have Hurst phenomenon (the persistence of annual runoff). The sensitivity analyses of runoff variation to precipitation and temperature were also conducted. Our results show that the response of runoff to precipitation is more sensitive than that to temperature. The response of runoff to temperature is only one-third of the response to precipitation. A decrease in temperature may offset the impact of decreasing rainfall on runoff, while an increase in both rainfall and temperature leads to strongest runoff variations in the YRB.",

However, existing methods often fail to forecast high-polluting air conditions, which is precisely what should be highlighted. In this paper, a novel multiple kernel learning (MKL) model that embodies the characteristics of ensemble learning, kernel learning, and representative learning is proposed to forecast the near future air quality (AQ). The centered alignment approach is used for learning kernels, and a boosting approach is used to determine the proper number of kernels. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed MKL model, its performance is compared to that of classical autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model; widely used parametric models like random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM); popular neural network models like multiple layer perceptron (MLP); and long short-term memory neural network. Datasets acquired from a coastal city Hong Kong and an inland city Beijing are used to train and validate all the models. Experiments show that the MKL model outperforms the other models. Moreover, the MKL model has better forecast ability for high health risk category AQ.",

The new Z - R relationship is then applied to derive the RQPE over the middle and lower reaches of Yangtze River for two short-time intense rainfall cases in summer (2200 UTC 1 June 2016 and 2200 UTC 18 June 2016) and one stratiform rainfall case in winter (0000 UTC 15 December 2017), and then the comparative analyses between the RQPE and the RQPEs derived by the other two methods (the fixed Z - R relationship and the dynamical Z - R relationship based on radar reflectivity classification) are accomplished. The results show that the RQPE from the new Z - R relationship is much closer to the observation than those from the other two methods because the new method simultaneously considers the echo intensity (reflecting the size and concentration of hydrometers to a certain extent) and the echo-top height (reflecting the updraft to a certain extent). Two statistics of 720 rainfall events in summer (April to June 2017) and 50 rainfall events in winter (December 2017) over the same region show that the correlation coefficient (root-mean-squared error and relative error) between RQPE derived by the new Z-R relationship and observation is significantly increased (decreased) compared to the other two Z-R relationships. Besides, the new Z - R relationship is also good at estimating rainfall with different intensities as compared to the other two methods, especially for the intense rainfall.",

A quantitative estimation of the contribution of the river mouth reach to the sediment load of the Yangtze River was conducted before and after impoundment of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in 2003. The results showed that a net sediment load loss of 1.78 million ton/yr (Mt/yr) occurred from 1965 to 2002 in the study area. The contribution of this reach to the sediment discharge into the sea is not as high as what was expected before the TGD. With impoundment of the TGD, channel deposition (29.90 Mt/yr) and a net sediment loss of 30.89 Mt/yr occurred in the river mouth reach from 2003 to 2012. The river mouth reach has acted as a sink but not a source of sediment since impoundment of the TGD, which has exacerbated the decrease in sediment load. Technologies should be advanced to measure changes in river channel morphology, as well as in water and sediment discharges at the river mouth reach.",

One question to address is, how the impacts of observations on GFS forecasts differ when assimilated by the traditional GSI-three dimensional variational (3DVar) and the new 3DEnsVar. Experiments were conducted over a 6-week period during Northern Hemisphere winter season at a reduced resolution. For both the control and data denial experiments, the forecasts produced by 3DEnsVar were more accurate than GSI3DVar experiments. The results suggested that the observations were better and more effectively exploited to increment the background forecast in 3DEnsVar. On the other hand, in GSI3DVar, where the observation will be making mostly local, isotropic increments without proper flow dependent extrapolation is more sensitive to the number and types observations assimilated.",

Firstly, a scenario of forestation was designed with the actual land cover data in 1980. Then a scenario with simulated land cover data in 1980 was established, in which the forest area increases by 12%. Thereafter a hydrological simulation was carried out with the actual and simulated land cover maps and the climate observation data during 1980–2010. The results suggested that the total water yield increased by 12.57 mm under the scenario with land use change during 1980–2010 compared with the simulation with the actual land cover in 1980. However, the results also indicated that the surface runoff reduced by 22.17 mm during the same period, indicating the forest land has “sponge” effects on the water resource in the mountainous watershed. These results may provide important information that supports operational practices, such as forest regeneration programs and watershed restoration.",

A suite of sensitivity experiments was conducted for the selection of an optimal combination of physics options including cumulus, microphysics, and planetary boundary layer schemes for simulating precipitation over the LVB. The WRF-POM coupled system made a great performance on simulating the expected LST, which is featured with eastward temperature gradient as in the real bathymetry of the lake. Under thorough examination of diagnostic analysis, a distinguished diurnal phenomenon has been unveiled. The precipitation mainly occurs during the nocturnal peak between midnight and early in the morning, which is associated with the strong land breeze circulation, when the lake temperature is warmer than the adjacent land. Further exploration of vertical velocity, surface divergence pattern, and maximum radar reflectivity confirms such conjecture. The time-longitude analysis of maximum radar reflectivity over the entire lake also shows a noticeable pattern of dominating westward propagation.",

After analyzing PM 2.5 data at 12 cities in the region in 2006, we found that PM 2.5 concentrations were 30–40% higher in summer (7–15 μ g/m 3 ) than in winter (4–11 μ g/m 3 ). High PM 2.5 episodes occurred more frequently in warmer seasons. Analyses of surface meteorology, weather maps, and airflow trajectories suggest that these PM 2.5 episodes were often related to synoptic transport of pollutants from highly polluted areas in the United States. The southerly or southwesterly winds associated with midlatitude cyclones play an important role in such transport. A typical weather pattern favoring the transport is suggested. When it was hot, humid, and stagnant with southerly or southwesterly winds, the likelihood of high PM 2.5 occurrences was high. The Greater Golden Horseshoe and Southwestern Ontario regions had higher PM 2.5 (6–12 μ g/m 3 annually) than the northern region (4–6 μ g/m 3 ), reflecting combined effects of meteorology, regional transport, and local emissions. In the future, PM 2.5 transport from the United States will likely increase in abundance because of possible prolonged accumulation at the pollution sources as the frequency of the midlatitude cyclones may reduce under climate change.",

Three of three-dimensional variational (3DVar) data assimilation experiments were designed on running the advanced research weather research forecast (WRF) model. Two heavy rain events selected with different rainfall distribution in space and time are utilized to examine the improvement for rainfall forecast after data assimilation. For the spatial distribution, the improvement of rainfall accumulation and area is obvious for the both two events. But for the temporal variation, the improvement is more obvious for the event with even rainfall distribution in time, while the effect of data assimilation is not ideal for the rainfall event with uneven distribution in space and time. It is noteworthy that, for both the spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall, satellite radiances have greater effect on rainfall forecasts than surface and upper-air meteorological observations in this high-altitude region. Moreover, the data assimilation experiments provide more detail information to the initial fields.",

The results showed that, under different dust conditions, the instantaneous number concentrations of dust particles differed widely. For example, during blowing sand and dust storm conditions, instantaneous dust particles concentrations varied substantially, while, under floating dust conditions, concentration differences were relatively small. The average dust particles size distributions were unimodal under all dust conditions, but the average surface area and mass size distributions were all bimodal. These distributions had peaks in different locations under different dust conditions. Under different dust conditions, wind speed and humidity were very important factors for particles size distributions. With increasing wind speed and decreasing humidity, fine particles were dominant in the atmosphere and the number and mass distributions of the coarse particles were indicative of long-range transport from surrounding deserts. Different dust conditions had different influences on PM 1 , PM 2.5 , and PM 10 concentrations.",

Having developed a “good” water circulation model the authors sought to improve its forecasting ability through correcting wind shear stress boundary conditions. The differences in surface velocity components between HF radar measurements and model output were calculated and used to correct surface shear stresses. Moreover, data assimilation cycle lengths were examined to extend the improvements of surface current’s patterns during forecasting period, especially for north-south velocity component. The influence of data assimilation in model forecasting was assessed using a Data Assimilation Skill Score (DASS). Positive magnitude of DASS indicated that both velocity components were considerably improved during forecasting period.

Various forcing mechanisms for formation, development, and dissipation of fog were identified, confirming the influence of two small mountains that block the moist air from the Atlantic Ocean, preventing the fog from reaching innermost regions. The introduction of the Alqueva large reservoir induces changes in the landscape and environment. The effects of the water vapour addition and of the changes in mass and energy surface fluxes on fog formation and evolution were studied. It was found that the reservoir may have a direct impact on fog formation over the lake and its vicinity.

    "abstract": "Climate change may accelerate the water cycle at a global scale, resulting in more frequent extreme climate events. This study analyzed changes in extreme precipitation events employing climate projections statistically downscaled at a station-space scale in South Korea. Among the CMIP5 climate projections, based on spatial resolution, this study selected 26 climate projections that provide daily precipitation under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5. The results show that a 20-year return period of precipitation event during a reference period (1980∼2005) corresponds to a 16.6 yr for 2011 to 2040, 14.1 yr for 2041 to 2070, and 12.8 yr for 2071 to 2100, indicating more frequent extreme maximum daily precipitation may occur in the future. In addition, we found that the probability density functions of the future periods are located out of the 10% confidence interval of the PDF for the reference period. The result indicates that the design standard under the reference climate is not managed to cope with climate change, and accordingly the revision of the design standard is required to improve sustainability in infrastructures.",

    "abstract": "Agroecosystems are important for food production and conservation of biodiversity while continuing to provide several ecosystem services within the landscape. Despite their economic and ecological benefits, most agroecosystems in Tanzania are degraded at alarming rates. Rapid increase of human population and unprecedented impacts of climate change have influenced depletion of natural resource base within agroecosystem in recent decades compared to what communities have experienced before. Increased food demands owing to population increase have increased pressure on exploitation of land resources including water. Cultivation area and irrigation water demands have increased steadily in the last six decades. Nevertheless, approaches used for water supply have not been improved; thus, water use efficiency in most irrigation schemes is quite poor. Conversely, climate smart agricultural practices are practiced less in Tanzania. There is poor adoption of recommended adaptation among smallholder farmers due to several socioeconomic reasons. One of the key objectives of climate smart agriculture is to improve bio-geochemical interactions within landscape and decrease competition of natural resources between humans and other component of agroecosystems. This underscores the assumptions that most cropping systems in Tanzania are not managed sustainably. Moreover, comprehensive assessment of hydrological dynamics within smallholder farming in Tanzania is highly lacking. Therefore, actual causes and extent of water resources depletion are largely unknown among stakeholders. In most tropical landscapes, water resources degradation is influenced by interaction of both anthropogenic and biophysical factors operating at different times and space scales. As the capacity of water-supplying sources continues to decline, Tanzania needs profound changes in agricultural production systems in order to nourish the growing human population. This calls for strategic approaches that have wider adaptability. A literature survey study with the following objectives was conducted (i) to assess current state of agricultural water use and irrigation activities in Tanzania and (ii) to determine major constraints for sustainable water management and identify appropriate adaptation measures for their improvement across diverse cropping systems.",

Thermal comfort indices are required, as they combine meteorological and thermophysiological parameters. The Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) is easy to understand and interpret also for nonexperts like tourists or decision-makers. The Hungarian Meteorological Service and the University of Szeged run an urban and a rural weather station close to Szeged, which build the basis for the human biometeorological analysis for a twelve-year period between 2000 and 2011. The maximum, mean, and minimum air temperature of both stations were compared to detect the differences of thermal dynamics. Heat and cold stress are quantified by analyzing the PET frequencies at 14 CET. The air temperature of urban areas is on average 1.0°C warmer than rural areas (11.4°C). Heat stress is more frequent in urbanized areas (6.3%) during summer months at 14 CET, while thermal acceptance is more frequent for surrounding rural areas (5.9%) in the same period. The Climate-Tourism/Transfer-Information-Scheme is a possibility to present the meteorological and human biometeorological data which is interesting for decision-making and tourism in a well-arranged way.",

Spatiotemporal distribution of the deposited particulate fluxes and the exposure of each site to the main industrial plumes (i.e., phosphate treatment plant “SIAPE,” soap industry “SIOS-ZITEX,” and lead secondary melting industry “FP Sfax Sud”) indicated the concomitant effects of surrounding industrial sources. In addition, the highest particulate deposition seemed to be associated with predominant strong cyclonic situations. Those deposition rates exceeded the levels recorded in the case of strong stabilities, considered as responsible for pollutant accumulation.",

In particular, this study provides the first detailed analysis of GNIP data for Islamabad. Both dry (1999-2000) and wet years (1994, 1997, and 2000) were chosen to investigate the correlations between precipitation amount, vapor flux, and temperature. We observed obvious differences between the dry and wet years and among seasons as well. Long-term features in the isotope composition agreed with the global meteorological water line, whereas short-term values followed rainfall amounts; that is, a total of 72% of the precipitation’s isotopic signature was dependent on the rainfall amount, and temperature controlled 73% of the isotopic features during October to May. The lower d -excess values were attributed to conditions during the spring season and a secondary evaporation boost during dry years; precipitation originating from the Mediterranean Sea showed high d -excess values. Overall, the results of this study contribute to the understanding of precipitation variations and their association with water vapor transport over Islamabad, Pakistan.",

Despite the common assertion that NO 3 levels are negligible in the day as a consequence of photolysis, there are occasions where NO 3 reaches a few pptv. A seasonal pattern in NO 3 concentration was observed with higher levels in the spring with consistent peaks in April and May. A combination of temperature effects (the formation of NO 3 from the reaction of NO 2 with O 3 has a high activation energy barrier), a distinct pattern in O 3 concentration (peaking in spring), and loss via reaction with NO peaking in winter is responsible for this trend. Although reaction with OH is still the dominant loss process for VOCs during the day, there are VOCs (unsaturated) that will have an appreciable loss due to reaction with NO 3 in the daytime. Since the addition reaction of NO 3 with alkenes can lead directly to organic nitrate formation, there are implications for O 3 formation and secondary organic aerosol formation during daytime and these are discussed.",

The spatial variation of phenological trends was analyzed using the linear regression method. In Northeast China, SOS was delayed at the rate of &lt;1.5 days per year. The delay trend of EOS was well distributed in the entire region with almost the same rates. LOS increased slightly. The analysis of the relationship between forest phenology and meteorological variations shows that SOS was mainly affected by spring temperature, whereas SOS had a negative relationship with precipitation in the warm-temperate deciduous broadleaf forest region. The EOS in temperate steppe region was affected by temperature and precipitation in August, whereas the others were significantly affected by temperature. Because of the increased temperature in spring, the LOS of the temperate steppe region and temperate mixed forest region increased, and the LOS was positively correlated with the mean temperature of summer in the cool-temperate needleleaf forest region.",

In this paper, the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought were evaluated based on monthly precipitation data from 33 synoptic stations during the period of 1960–2010. The percent of normal precipitation was applied to illustrate the driest years in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan areas (BTHMA) (1965, 1997, and 2002). The modified Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI) was applied to capture the drought patterns and to estimate the drought severity at 33 meteorological stations. Agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis (AHCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to identify three different drought subregions R1, R2, and R3 based on the monthly precipitation values in BTHMA, which is located in southeast, north, and south of BTHMA, respectively. The year 1965 was the driest and 1964 was the wettest during the observed period. The characteristics of drought were analyzed in terms of the temporal evolution of the RDI-12 values and the frequency of drought for the three identified regions. The percentage of years characterized by drought was 13.73% for R1, 16.50% for R2, and 15.53% for R3. 66.91% of drought belongs to the near normal drought category. The obtained results can aid to improve water resources management in the area.",

This study combines ensemble quantitative precipitation forecasts and a hydrological model to provide a 3-day reservoir inflow in the Shihmen Reservoir, Taiwan. A total of six historical typhoons were used for model calibration, validation, and application. An understanding of cascaded uncertainties from the numerical weather model through the hydrological model is necessary for a better use for forecasting. This study thus conducted an assessment of forecast uncertainty on magnitude and timing of peak and cumulative inflows. It found that using the ensemble-mean had less uncertainty than randomly selecting individual member. The inflow forecasts with shorter length of cumulative time had a higher uncertainty. The results showed that using the ensemble precipitation forecasts with the hydrological model would have the advantage of extra lead time and serve as a valuable reference for operating reservoirs.",

The spatially averaged trends in convective precipitation are rising for indices of mean precipitation, and the increases are significant in all seasons except for winter. For extremes, the trends are spatially much more variable and insignificant, but increases tend to prevail as well. The trends in convective precipitation are larger in the western part of the country where Atlantic influences are stronger. For characteristics of stratiform precipitation, the trends are usually smaller compared to those of convective precipitation, but increases prevail too. They are significant in autumn, especially for extremes, and larger in the eastern part of the country where Mediterranean cyclones play more important role. The trends in convective precipitation tend to be more pronounced at lowland than higher-elevated stations while an opposite pattern prevails for stratiform precipitation. The results suggest that in spring and summer, when convective precipitation represents an important fraction of the total amounts in central Europe (around 30% and 50%, respectively), the observed increases in total precipitation are mainly due to increases in convective precipitation. In autumn, increases in both convective and stratiform precipitation are important, and the trends are weakest and least pronounced in winter.",

Case 1 was the phenomenon by complex of long range transport and following domestic stagnation. Case 2 was caused by the Asian dust event. During high PM episodes, atmospheric condition became more acidic. The equivalent concentration ratio of nitrate to sulfate decreased to 0.75 and 0.95 in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively, implying that sulfate concentration increase was greater than nitrate concentration increase in high PM episode possibly caused by long range transport. In high PM episodes, SOR and NOR increased with steeper rate for NOR. Considering correlation between temperature and SOR, it was suggested that the homogeneous formation of sulfate was not active in the Korean Peninsula, especially in high PM episodic periods. On the other hand, heterogeneous sulfate formation reaction was dominant for high PM episodes. Considering NOR and its correlation with temperature and humidity, it was suggested that NO 2 oxidation was mainly caused by homogeneous oxidation in Case 1. For Case 2, heterogeneous oxidation mainly contributed to forming the nitrate due to the extremely high particle concentrations in Asian dust.",

In this study, we investigated the long-term changes in precipitation and runoff, from 1961 to 2011, in the Yihe River basin by Mann-Kendall test. A new method of trend pattern was put forward and used to identify the trends of precipitation and runoff, which indicated that the basin had a decreasing trend in annual runoff. The change point occurred in the year 1985 dividing the long-term series into two periods. Precipitation elasticity and linear regression methods were used to quantify the impact of precipitation and land surface change on runoff and provided consistent results of the percentage change in an annual runoff for the postchange period. Use of these methods reveals that the reduction in annual runoff is mainly due to precipitation variability of 56.38–67.68% and land surface change of 43.62–32.32%, as estimated by precipitation elasticity and linear regression methods, respectively. Due to the rapid growth of urbanization, the land surface change increased from 1990 to 2010. The result of this study can provide a reference for the management of regional water resources.",

    "abstract": "The applicability of a new soil hydraulic property of frozen soil scheme applied in Community Land Model 4.5 (CLM4.5), in conjunction with an impedance factor for the presence of soil ice, was validated through two offline numerical simulations conducted at Madoi (GS) and Zoige (ZS) on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Sensitivity analysis was conducted via replacing the new soil hydraulic property scheme in CLM4.5 by the old one, using default CLM4.5 runs as reference. Results indicated that the new parameterization scheme ameliorated the surface dry biases at ZS but enlarged the wet biases which existed at GS site due to ignoring the gravel effect. The wetter surface condition in CLM4.5 also leads to a warmer surface soil temperature because of the greater heat capacity of liquid water. In addition, the combined impact of new soil hydraulic property schemes and the ice impedance function on the simulated soil moisture lead to the more reasonable simulation of the starting dates of freeze-thaw cycle, especially at the thawing stage. The improvements also lead to the more reasonable turbulent fluxes simulations. Meanwhile, the decreased snow cover fraction in CLM4.5 resulted in a lower albedo, which tended to increase net surface radiation compared to previous versions. Further optimizing is needed to take the gravel into account in the numerical description of thermal-hydrological interactions.",

The study used three different models to assess the changes in rainfall characteristics. The first method involves the use of the weather generator LARS-WG to quantify changes between historical and future daily rainfall maxima. The second approach consists of statistically downscaling general circulation model (GCM) output based on historical empirical relationships between GCM output and station rainfall. Lastly, the study employed recent statistically downscaled global gridded rainfall projections to characterize climate change impact rainfall structure. Both annual and seasonal rainfall extremes are studied. The results show significant changes in annual maximum daily rainfall, with an average increase as high as 20% in the 100-year return period daily rainfall. The uncertainty arising from the use of different GCMs was found to be much larger than the uncertainty from the emission scenarios. Furthermore, the annual and wet seasonal analyses exhibit similar behaviors with increased future rainfall, but the dry season is not consistent across the models. The GCM uncertainty is larger in the dry season compared to annual and wet season.",

In this study, the probabilistic relationship between precipitation and meteorological drought in Beijing, China, was calculated under three different precipitation conditions (precipitation equal to, greater than, or less than a threshold) based on copulas. The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was calculated based on monthly total precipitation and monthly mean temperature data. The trends and variations in the SPEI were analysed using Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) and Mann-Kendall (MK) trend tests with a running approach. The results of the HHT and MK test indicated a significant decreasing trend in the SPEI. The copula-based conditional probability indicated that the probability of meteorological drought decreased as monthly precipitation increased and that 10 mm can be regarded as the threshold for triggering extreme drought.

This is attributed partly to the considerable development of machine learning techniques that allow the scientific community to use these advanced tools for approximating the nonlinear processes affecting the variation of water vapor in terrestrial ecosystems. Three novel machine learning approaches, namely, group method of data handling, extreme learning machine (ELM), and adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS), were developed to simulate and forecast the daily evapotranspiration (ET) at four different grassland sites based on the flux tower data using the eddy covariance method. These models were compared with the extensively utilized data-driven models, including artificial neural network, generalized regression neural network, and support vector machine (SVM). Moreover, the influences of internal functions on their corresponding models (SVM, ELM, and ANFIS) were investigated together. It was demonstrated that most developed models did good job of simulating and forecasting daily ET at the four sites. In addition to strengths of robustness and simplicity, the newly proposed methods achieved the estimates comparable to those of the conventional approaches and accordingly can be used as promising alternatives to traditional methods. It was further discovered that the generalization performance of the ELM, ANFIS, and SVM models strongly depended on their respective internal functions, especially for SVM.",

In this study, the spatial and temporal characteristics of droughts are analyzed with the standard precipitation index (SPI), comprehensive meteorological drought index (CI), and reconnaissance drought index (RDI). Meanwhile, historical drought records are used to test the performance of each index at identifying droughts. All three indices show decreasing annual and autumn trends, with the latter particularly prominent. 29, 30, and 32 drought events were identified during 1960–2013 by the SPI, CI, and RDI, respectively. Continuous drought is more frequent in winter–spring and summer–autumn. There is a significant increasing trend in drought event frequency, peak, and strength since the start of the 21st century. Drought duration indicated by CI shows longer durations in the higher-elevation region of central and western Guizhou. The corresponding drought severity is high in these regions. SPI and RDI indicate longer drought durations in the lower elevation central and eastern regions of Guizhou Province, where the corresponding drought severity is also very strong. SPI shows an increasing trend in drought duration and drought severity across most of the regions of Guizhou. In general, SPI and RDI show an increasing trend in the western Guizhou Province and a decreasing trend in central and eastern Guizhou. Comparing these three drought indices with historical records, the RDI is found to be more objective and reliable than the SPI and CI when identifying the periods of drought in Guizhou.",

Here, an ensemble modeling approach is utilized with a wind farm parameterization to quantify the sensitivity of meteorological variables to the presence of wind farms. The results show that perturbations to nonlocal midlatitude cyclones caused by a wind farm are statistically significant, with magnitudes of roughly 1 hPa for mean sea-level pressure, 4 m/s for surface wind speed, and 15 mm for maximum 30-minute accumulated precipitation. Cyclone perturbation magnitude is also found to be dependent on wind farm size and location relative to the midlatitude cyclone genesis region and track.",

However, for skewed data, such as telemetric rain observations in a real-time flood forecasting system, the probability is significantly higher. To overcome this problem, a medcouple (MC) that is robust to resisting outliers and sensitive to detecting skewness was introduced to construct a new robust skewed boxplot fence. Three types of boxplot fences related to MC were analyzed and compared, and the exponential function boxplot fence was selected. Operating on uncontaminated as well as simulated contaminated data, the results showed that the proposed method could produce a lower swamping rate and higher accuracy than the standard boxplot and semi-interquartile range boxplot. The outcomes of this study demonstrated that it is reasonable to use the new robust skewed boxplot method to detect outliers in skewed rain distributions.",

For sunny days, the soil temperature and heat flux were underestimated significantly in the nighttime and overestimated in the daytime. The simulation results are very good in sand-dust weather. The simulation of heat flux and net radiation is very consistent with the observation during cloudy days.

According to the results of statistical analysis, the coefficient of determination for the TRMM product gave satisfactory results ( R 2 &gt; 0.88). However, R 2 for the CFSR data set ranges from 0.35 for the Eastern Black Sea basin to 0.93 for the West Mediterranean basin.

It deals with the analysis of observed historical (1960–2010) and arithmetic mean method in assembling precipitation from CMIP5 Global Climate Models (GCMs) datasets for a future period (2020–2099) under four emission scenarios. Daily precipitation data of 32 weather stations in the Xijiang River Basin were provided by National Meteorological Information Centre (NMIC) of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and Global Climate Models (GCMs) with all four emission scenarios statistically downscaled using Bias Correction Special Disaggregation (BCSD) and applied for bias correction via Climate Change Toolkit (CCT). Nonparametric Mann–Kendall test was applied for statistical significance trend analysis while the magnitude of the trends was determined by nonparametric Sen’s estimator method on a monthly scale to detect monotonic trends in annual and seasonal precipitation time series. The results showed a declined trend was observed for the past 50 years over the basin with negative values of MK test (Z) and Sen’s slope Q. Historical GCMs precipitation detected decreasing trends except for NoerESM1-M which observed slightly increasing trends. The results are further validated by historical precipitation recorded by the Climate Research Unit (CRU-TS-3.1). The future scenarios will likely be positive trends for annual rainfall. Significant positive trends were observed in monsoon and winter seasons while premonsoon and postmonsoon seasons will likely be slightly downward trends. The 2040s will likely observe the lowest increase of 6.6% while the 2050s will observe the highest increase of 11.5% over the 21 st century under future scenarios. However, due to the uncertainties in CMIP5, the future precipitation projections should be interpreted with caution. Thus, it could be concluded that the trend of change in precipitation around the Xijiang River Basin is on the increase under future scenarios. The results can be valuable to water resources and agriculture management policies, as well as the approach for managing floods and droughts under the perspective of global climate change.",

The accompanying strong winds and torrential rains make typhoons particularly damaging in Taiwan. Therefore, we aimed to establish an accurate wind speed prediction model for future typhoons, allowing for better preparation to mitigate a typhoon’s toll on life and property. For more accurate wind speed predictions during a typhoon episode, we used cutting-edge machine learning techniques to construct a wind speed prediction model. To ensure model accuracy, we used, as variable input, simulated values from the Weather Research and Forecasting model of the numerical weather prediction system in addition to adopting deeper neural networks that can deepen neural network structures in the construction of estimation models. Our deeper neural networks comprise multilayer perceptron (MLP), deep recurrent neural networks (DRNNs), and stacked long short-term memory (LSTM). These three model-structure types differ by their memory capacity: MLPs are model networks with no memory capacity, whereas DRNNs and stacked LSTM are model networks with memory capacity. A model structure with memory capacity can analyze time-series data and continue memorizing and learning along the time axis. The study area is northeastern Taiwan. Results showed that MLP, DRNN, and stacked LSTM prediction error rates increased with prediction time (1–6 hours). Comparing the three models revealed that model networks with memory capacity (DRNN and stacked LSTM) were more accurate than those without memory capacity. A further comparison of model networks with memory capacity revealed that stacked LSTM yielded slightly more accurate results than did DRNN. Additionally, we determined that in the construction of the wind speed prediction model, the use of numerically simulated values reduced the error rate approximately by 30%. These results indicate that the inclusion of numerically simulated values in wind speed prediction models enhanced their prediction accuracy.",

However, few previous researches have revealed the spatial variation of groundwater level within Beijing Plain. In this study, spatiotemporal variation of groundwater level from 2001 to 2010 in Beijing Plain has been investigated. Factor analysis has been conducted to identify the primary influencing factor. Results showed that the groundwater level decreased by 8.41 m from 2001 to 2010, with a linear decreasing rate of 0.954 m per year averagely. Significant spatial variation characteristics have been detected. The north area suffered more groundwater depletion than the south part in general. The lowest groundwater level has been identified downstream Miyun Reservoir, central part of the Plain. Nevertheless, the most of the south part witnessed a slight revival between 2001 and 2010. This may be due to the differences of socioeconomic circumstances in the Plain. Three influencing factors, that is, “demand factor,” “supply factor,” and “loss factor,” have been identified in the water balance model. Eigenvalues of these factors are 3.563, 2.910, and 1.632, respectively, indicating that these factors influenced the groundwater system to various extents, with the demand factor being the primary one.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization, industrialization, and regional economic integration have developed rapidly in China in recent years. Air pollution has attracted more and more attention. However, PM 2.5 is the main particulate matter in air pollution. Therefore, how to predict PM 2.5 accurately and effectively has become a concern of experts and scholars. For the problem, atmosphere PM 2.5 concentration prediction algorithm is proposed based on time series and interactive multiple model in this paper. PM 2.5 concentration is collected by using the monitor at different air quality levels. The time series models are established by historical PM 2.5 concentration data, which were given by the autoregressive model (AR). In the paper, three PM 2.5 time series models are established for three different air quality levels. Then, the three models are converted to state equation, respectively, by autoregressive integrated with Kalman filter (AR-Kalman) approaches. Besides, the proposed interactive multiple model (IMM) algorithm is, respectively, compared with autoregressive (AR) model algorithm and AR-Kalman prediction algorithm. It is turned out the proposed IMM algorithm is more accurate than the other two approaches for PM 2.5 prediction, and it is effective.",

    "abstract": "In this study, a convection nowcasting method based on machine learning was proposed. First, the historical data were back-calculated using the pyramid optical flow method. Next, the generated optical flow field information of each pixel and the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) image information were input into the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) algorithm for training purposes. During the extrapolation process, dynamic characteristics such as the rotation, convergence, and divergence in the optical flow field were also used as predictors to form an optimal nowcasting model. The test analysis demonstrated that the algorithm combined the image feature extraction ability of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the sequential learning ability of the long short-term memory network (LSTM) model to establish an end-to-end deep learning network, which could deeply extract high-order features of radar echoes such as structural texture, spatial correlation, and temporal evolution compared with the traditional algorithm. Based on learning through the above features, this algorithm can forecast the generation and dissipation trends of convective cells to some extent. The addition of the optical flow information can more accurately simulate nonlinear trends such as the rotation, or merging, or separation of radar echoes. The trajectories of radar echoes obtained through nowcasting are closer to their actual movements, which prolongs the valid forecasting period and improves forecast accuracy.",

Spatial-temporal variations analyses of evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration (PET) have remarkable theoretical and practical significances for understanding the interaction between climate changes and hydrological cycle and optimal allocation of water resources under global warming background. The MODIS-estimated ET agreed well with basin evapotranspiration from water balance principle methods in the study. The spatiotemporal variations results based on MOD16 ET data showed the following: (1) multiyear mean ET and PET were 464.2 mm and 1192.2 mm, and annual ET showed an upward trend at a rate of 3.48 mm/a, while PET decreased significantly at a rate of −8.18 mm/a. The annual ET trend showed a complemental relationship with PET; (2) at the seasonal scale, ET was highest in summer and least in winter, while PET was higher in spring and summer. The change of ET and PET in spring and summer had a great contribution to the annual variations; (3) ET and PET in the northern part were significantly stronger than those in the western and southern parts; (4) ET in cropland increased significantly, while PET decreased obviously in grass and forest; (5) changes of ET and PET were closely related to climatic factors. The rise in temperature caused the increase in ET and the decrease of wind speed contributed more to the decrease in PET. The results can provide a scientific basis for water resources planning and management.",

Sixteen precipitation datasets categorized under gauge-based, satellite-only, reanalysis, and gauge-adjusted datasets were compared statistically against the gridded Indian Meteorological Dataset (IMD) employing two categorical and three continuous statistical metrics. Further, the precipitation datasets’ performance in simulating streamflow was assessed by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model. Based on the statistical metrics, Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation (APHRODITE) furnished very good results in terms of detecting rainfall, followed by Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation (CHIRP), National Centres for Environmental Prediction-Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (NCEP CFSR), Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) 3B42 v7, Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation Gauge Reanalysis v6 (GSMaP_Gauge_RNL), and Multisource Weighted Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) datasets which had good-to-moderate performances at a monthly time step. From the hydrological simulations, TRMM 3B42 v7, CHIRP, CHIRPS 0.05°, and GSMaP_Gauge_RNL v6 produced very good results with a high degree of correlation to observed streamflow, while Soil Moisture 2 Rain-Climate Change Initiative (SM2RAIN-CCI) dataset exhibited poor performance. From the extreme flow event analysis, it was observed that CHIRP, TRMM 3B42 v7, Global Precipitation Climatology Centre v7 (GPCC), and APHRODITE datasets captured more peak flow events and hence can be further implemented for extreme event analysis. Overall, we found that TRMM 3B42 v7, CHIRP, and CHIRPS 0.05° datasets performed better than other datasets and can be used for hydrological modeling and climate change studies in similar topographic and climatic watersheds in India.",

    "abstract": "The growing demand for Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology has necessitated the establishment of a vast and ever-growing network of International GNSS Service (IGS) tracking stations worldwide. The IGS provides highly accurate and highly reliable daily time-series Zenith Tropospheric Delay (ZTD) products using data from the member sites towards the use of GNSS for precise geodetic, climatological, and meteorological applications. However, if for reasons like poor internet connectivity, equipment failure, and power outages, the IGS station is inaccessible or malfunctioning, and gaps are created in the data archive resulting in degrading the quality of the ZTD and precipitable water vapour (PWV) estimation. To address this challenge as a means of providing an alternative data source to improve the continuous availability of ZTD data and as a backup data in the event that the IGS site data are missing or unavailable in West Africa, this paper compares the sitewise operational Vienna Mapping Functions 3 (VMF3) ZTD product with the IGS final ZTD product over five IGS stations in West Africa. Eight different statistical evaluation metrics, such as the mean bias (MB), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient (r), coefficient of determination (r2), refined index of agreement (IAr), Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSE), and the fraction of prediction within a factor of two (FAC2), are employed to determine the degree of agreement between the VMF3 and IGS tropospheric products. The results show that the VMF3-ZTD product performed excellently and matches very well with the IGS final ZTD product with an average MB, MAE, RMSE, r, r2, NSE, IAr, and FAC2 of 0.38 cm, 0.87 cm, 1.11 cm, 0.988, 0.976, 0.967, 0.992, and 1.00 (100%), respectively. This result is an indication that the VMF3-ZTD product is accurate enough to be used as an alternative source of ZTD data to augment the IGS final ZTD product for positioning and meteorological applications in West Africa.",

    "abstract": "Many researchers have developed a variety of land surface temperature (LST) inversion algorithms based on satellite data. The main LST inversion algorithms include Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE), Single Channel (SC) algorithm, Mono Window (MW) algorithm, and Split Window (SW) algorithm. In this study, nine LST inversion algorithms were designed using Landsat-8 data and meteorological station data to test the inversion efficiency of different algorithms in different seasons and different locations. The results show that the error of various LST inversion algorithms will increase with the rise of LST. R2 of the inversion results of each LST algorithm and the measured data are all greater than 0.73°C in winter and about 0.5°C in the other seasons. By analyzing the stability of various algorithms inside and outside the city, it is found that the stability of each LST inversion algorithm inside the city is better than that outside the city. For the same surface features, the inversion temperature inside the city is 3–5°C higher than that outside the city. In addition, the sensitivity of various inversion algorithms to parameters was also analyzed. The influence of atmospheric transmittance on RTE, SC, and MW inversion algorithms is in logarithmic form. The effect of emissivity on each algorithm is linear. The influence of NDVI on the algorithms is mainly through the estimation of surface emissivity parameters to affect the inversion results. The effect of ascending radiation on SC (LST4 and LST5) is linear and on RTE (LST1 and LST2) is logarithmic. The effect of downslope radiation on SC and RTE is linear. The influence of atmospheric water vapor content on SW (LST7) is nonlinear.",

    "abstract": "The final approach phase of an aircraft accounts for nearly half of all aviation incidents worldwide due to low-level wind shear, heavy downpours, runway excursions, and unsteady approaches. Adopting the missed approach (MAP) procedures may prevent a risky landing, which is usually executed in those situations, but it is safety-critical and a rare occurrence. This study employed machine learning-ensemble imbalance learning to predict MAPs under low-level wind shear conditions based on environmental and situational parameters. The models were developed using the 2017–2021 Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) Pilot Reports (PIREPs). Initially, imbalance data were applied to machine learning models such as the random forest (RF), light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), but these were unable to accurately predict the occurrence of MAPs. Then, these models were used as base estimators for ensemble imbalance learning methods, including the self-paced ensemble (SPE) framework, the balance cascade model, and the easy ensemble model. The SPE framework utilizing XGboost as the base estimator performed better than other frameworks in terms of recall, F1-score, balanced accuracy, and geometric mean. Afterwards, SHAP was utilized to interpret the SPE framework with XGboost as the base estimator. Results showed that low-level wind shear magnitude, runway orientation, and vertical location of low-level wind shear contributed most to MAPs. Runways 07C and 07R had the most MAPs. Most MAPs were initiated when low-level wind shear was within 500 feet of the ground. Strong tailwind triggered MAPs more than headwind. For aviation safety researchers and airport authorities, the framework proposed in this study is a valuable tool.",

Predicting the impact of land cover change on urban heat island has become one of the research hotspots. Taking Wuhan, China, as an example, this study simulated the land type change in 2020 through the Cellular Automata-Markov-Chain (CA-Markov) model. The urban heat island in 2020 was simulated and analyzed in conjunction with the Weather Research &amp; Forecasting Model (WRF), and the simulation results of wind velocity and temperature were confirmed using weather station observation data. Based on this, the land cover and urban heat island of Wuhan in 2030 were predicted. The temperature was found to be well-fit by CA-Markov simulated land use data, with an average inaccuracy of about 2.5°C for weather stations. Wind speed had a poor fitting effect; the average error was roughly 2 m/s. The built-up area was the center of the high temperature area both before and after the prediction, the water was the low temperature area, and the peak heat island happened at night. According to the forecast results, there will be more built-up land in 2030, and there will be a greater intensity of heat islands than in 2020.",

The WRF configuration consists of a 10 km resolution domain nested in a coarser domain driven by European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis (ERA-Interim) data. The model simulated 2 m temperature and precipitation have been evaluated at daily and monthly scales with gridded observational dataset. The analysis shows that all experiments reproduce well the daily 2 m temperature, with overestimation particularly in the low-temperature range. Precipitation is less well simulated, with underestimation in all range, especially for intense rainfall. Comparing with ERA-Interim, WRF shows no clear benefit in simulating daily 2 m temperature while prominent improvement in simulating daily precipitation. WRF simulations capture the annual cycle of monthly 2 m temperature and precipitation with a warm bias and wet bias for most experiments in summer. Some reasonable configurations are identified. The “best” configuration depends on the criteria.",

The reported AOD versus wind speed (U) was a function of ~ U 2 . The open ocean MODIS‐derived AOD at 550 nm and 860 nm wavelengths, while in good agreement with the general magnitude of the Mulcahy parameterization, follows a power‐law with the exponent ranging from 0.72 to 2.47 for a wind speed range of 2–18 m s −1 . For the four cases examined, some MODIS cases underestimated AOD while other cases overestimated AOD relative to the Mulcahy scheme. Overall, the results from MODIS support the general power‐law relationship of Mulcahy, although some linear cases were also encountered in the MODIS dataset. Deviations also arise between MODIS and Mulcahy at higher wind speeds (&gt;15 m s −1 ), where MODIS‐derived AOD returns lower values as compared to Mulcahy. The results also support the suggestion than wind generated sea spray, under moderately high winds, can rival anthropogenic pollution plumes advecting out into marine environments with wind driven AOD contributing to AOD values approaching 0.3.",

Their past concentrations have been studied using environmental archives, but, additionally, historical trends of BC concentration and deposition can be estimated by modelling. These models are based on BC emission inventories, but actual measurements of BC concentration and deposition play an essential role in their evaluation and validation. We use the chemistry transport model OsloCTM2 to model historical time series of BC concentration and deposition from energy and industrial sources and compare these to sedimentary measurements of SCPs obtained from lake sediments in Northern Europe from 1850 to 2010. To determine the origin of SCPs we generated back trajectories of air masses to the study sites. Generally, trends of SCP deposition and modelled results agree reasonably well, showing rapidly increasing values from 1950, to a peak in 1980, and a decrease towards the present. Empirical SCP data show differences in deposition magnitude between the sites that are not captured by the model but which may be explained by different air mass transport patterns. The results highlight the need for numerous observational records to reliably validate model results.",

After remapping, the noise performance (NEΔT) of the tropospheric temperature sounding channels is evaluated to be approximately 0.1 K, comparing favourably with AMSU-A. However, the noise is not random, differences between observations and simulations based on short-range forecast fields show a spurious striping effect, due to 1/f noise in the receiver. The amplitude of this signal is several tenths of a Kelvin, potentially a concern for NWP applications. In preoperational tests, adding ATMS data to a full Met Office system already exploiting data from four microwave sounders improves southern hemisphere mean sea level pressure forecasts in the 2- to 5-day range by 1-2%. In operational use, where data from five other microwave sounders is assimilated, forecast impact is typically between −0.05 and −0.1 J/kg (3.4% of total mean impact per day over the period 1 April to 31 July 2013). This suggests benefits beyond redundancy, associated with reducing already small analysis errors.",

This research included a new assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on the GS of vegetables grown in the Elbe River lowland, one of the largest farmed vegetable regions in Central Europe. To accomplish this, a comprehensive analysis was conducted of the spatiotemporal variability of the date of the beginning of the growing season (BGS), the date of the end of the growing season (EGS), and the length of the growing season (GSL) for the period 1961–2011. In addition, an assessment was made of the potential changes in the dates of the BGS, EGS, and GSL for the Elbe River lowland, simulated using the regional climate models.

Generating SH cyclone tracks from global reanalysis datasets is problematic due to data reliability, especially prior to 1979. It is therefore prudent to compare the climatology and variability of SH cyclone tracks from different reanalysis datasets. We generate cyclone track frequency and intensity climatologies from three reanalysis datasets: The National Center for Environmental Prediction’s Reanalysis I and Reanalysis II datasets and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts ERA-40 dataset. Our results show that ERA-40 produces more intense cyclones in the SH active cyclone region compared to NCEP reanalyses. More intense storms are also found in the SH active cyclone region in NCEP reanalyses data post-1979 reflecting the positive trend in the AAO in the past few decades. When evaluating interannual variability, our results show Rossby wave trains including the Pacific South American (PSA) and the East Indian Ocean pattern in response to anomalous heating linked to El Niño and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), respectively. Response to the AAO shows a robust annular structure for cyclone track frequency, but not intensity suggesting a weak relationship between cyclone frequency and cyclone intensity.",

From a new point of view, the sensible heat flux (SHF) and latent heat flux (LHF), which have significant impacts on summer extreme rainfall in Yangtze River basin (YRB), have been quantified and then selections of the impact factors are conducted. Firstly, a regional extreme precipitation index was applied to determine Regions of Significant Correlation (RSC) by analyzing spatial distribution of correlation coefficients between this index and SHF, LHF, and sea surface temperature (SST) on global ocean scale; then the time series of SHF, LHF, and SST in RSCs during 1967–2010 were selected. Furthermore, other factors that significantly affect variations in precipitation extremes over YRB were also selected. The methods of multiple stepwise regression and leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) were utilized to analyze and test influencing factors and statistical prediction model. The correlation coefficient between observed regional extreme index and model simulation result is 0.85, with significant level at 99%. This suggested that the forecast skill was acceptable although many aspects of the prediction model should be improved.",

The study area is the Carpathian Basin (Central and Southeastern Europe) which has a complex topography and encompasses the whole territory of Slovakia and Hungary as well as major parts of Romania and western Ukraine. We focus on changes in mean seasonal maxima and high quantiles (50-year return values) projected for the late 21st century (time slice 2070–2099) in comparison to the control period (time slice 1961–1990), for summer and winter. The 50-year return values are estimated by means of a regional frequency analysis based on the region-of-influence method, which reduces random variability and leads to more reliable estimates of high quantiles. In winter, all examined characteristics of precipitation (seasonal totals, mean seasonal maxima, and 50-year return values for both short-term and multi-day aggregations) show similar patterns of projected increases for the late 21st century. In summer, by contrast, drying is projected for seasonal totals in all RCMs while increases clearly prevail for the 50-year return values. The projected increases are larger for short-term (hourly) extremes that are more directly related to convective activity than multiday extremes. This suggests that the probability of occurrence of flash floods may increase more than that of large-scale floods in a warmer climate. The within-ensemble variability (and associated uncertainty) is, nevertheless, much larger in summer than in winter.",

As part of RoMANS II, a mesoscale meteorological model was utilized to provide input for back trajectory and chemical transport models. Evaluation of the model's ability to capture important transport patterns in this region of complex terrain is discussed. Previous source-receptor studies of nitrogen in this region are also reviewed. Finally, results of several back trajectory analyses for RoMANS II are presented. The trajectory mass balance (TrMB) model, a receptor-based linear regression technique, was used to estimate mean source attributions of airborne ammonia concentrations during RoMANS II. Though ammonia concentrations are usually higher when there is transport from the east, the TrMB model estimates that, on average, areas to the west contribute a larger mean fraction of the ammonia. Possible reasons for this are discussed and include the greater frequency of westerly versus easterly winds, the possibility that ammonia is transported long distances as ammonium nitrate, and the difficulty of correctly modeling the transport winds in this area.",

Natural climate variations however remain poorly understood, although they remain important for discriminating between natural and anthropogenic influences on current climate change. Using the Svalbard (78°N) surface air temperature record 1912–2010 as an example, we here suggest a road ahead to identify and describe such natural climate variations. By means of Fourier and wavelet analysis the record is decomposed into time-frequency space, to extract information on periodic signals and their amplitude and variation over time. By this we identify several cyclic variations on the time scale investigated. These oscillations are present in the annual record, as well as in seasonal subsets of the record. Using only three oscillations it is possible to hindcast the Svalbard temperature record well. We suggest that such persistent oscillations may be used for forecasting the overall features of future temperature changes for a limited period, about 10–25% of the record length. Our main focus is on identifying the character of recurrent natural temperature variations, but we also comment briefly on possible physical explanations for some of the identified cyclic variations.",

The topographic changes significantly affect moisture divergence and spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation. A low level jet is created on windward side of big mountains, yielding enhanced moisture flux and instability. Eddy kinetic energy significantly changes with orographic height. Energy flux created further unstabilized atmosphere and deep convection, producing wide spread heavy rainfall in the area in Himalaya foothills.

The differences of the generalized Hurst exponents are very different for the AGST series of each site reflecting the different scaling behaviors of the fluctuation. Furthermore, the strengths of multifractal spectrum are different for different weather stations and indicate that the multifractal behaviors vary from station to station over China.",

A typhoon rainfall forecasting model is developed under this assumption. If rainfall patterns can be analyzed and recognized in terms of individual watershed topography, only the spatial rainfall distribution prior to a specific moment is needed to forecast the rainfall in the next coming hours. It does not need any other condition in meteorology and climatology. Besides, supplement techniques of missing rainfall gage data are also considered to build an all-purpose forecast model. By integrating techniques of cluster analysis and pattern recognition, present proposed rainfall forecasting model is tested using historical data of Tamsui River Basin in Northern Taiwan. Good performance is validated by checking on coefficient of correlation and coefficient of efficiency.",

Monitoring air pollution (aerosols) in near real-time is accomplished by using spaceborne and in situ platforms. The results of the development of a system for forecasting pollution levels in terms of particulate matter concentrations are presented. The aim of the present study is to utilize the recorded PM 10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μ m) ground measurements, Aerosol Optical Depth retrievals from satellite, and the prevailing synoptic conditions established by Artificial Neural Networks, in order to develop regression models that will be able to predict the spatial and temporal variability of PM 10 in Cyprus. The core of the forecasting system comprises an appropriately designed neural classification system which clusters synoptic maps, Aerosol Optical Depth data from the Aqua satellite, and ground measurements of particulate matter. By exploiting the above resources, statistical models for forecasting pollution levels were developed.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to improve the statistical spatial downscaling of coarse precipitation (TRMM 3B43 product) and also to explore its limitations in the Mediterranean area. It was carried out in Morocco and was based on an open dataset including four predictors (NDVI, NDWI, DEM, and distance from sea) that explain TRMM 3B43 product. For this purpose, four groups of models were established based on different combinations of the four predictors, in order to compare from one side NDVI and NDWI based models and the other side stepwise with multiple regression. The models that have given rise to the best approximations and best fits were used to downscale TRMM 3B43 product. The resulting downscaled and calibrated precipitations were validated by independent RGS. Aside from that, the limitations of the proposed approach were assessed in five bioclimatic stages. Furthermore, the influence of the sea was analyzed in five classes of distance. The findings showed that the models built using NDVI and NDWI have a high correlation and therefore can be used to downscale precipitation. The integration of elevation and distance improved the correlation models.

In addition, the analysis showed that the contribution of the variable (distance from sea) is evident around the coastal area and decreases progressively. Likewise, the study demonstrated that the approach performs well in humid and arid bioclimatic stages compared to others.",

In this study, the performance of a scale-aware PBL scheme newly implemented into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in simulating the CBL in the Taklimakan desert is evaluated based on a comparison with both the WRF-LES simulations and observations, with the focus on scale dependencies of the simulations compared to the conventional PBL scheme. A series of simulations are performed with a scale-aware PBL scheme (Shin-Hong) and the conventional PBL scheme (YSU) for a deep CBL observed at Tazhong station in the central Taklimakan on 1 July 2016. The CBL was over 5000 m deep with wider and deeper rolls than in a shallow boundary layer. The results showed that the vertical structure simulated with the Shin-Hong scheme was closer to that in both the WRF-LES (large-eddy-simulation) and observations than that simulated with the YSU. The simulation with the scale-aware scheme reproduced cellular rolls similar to those in the WRF-LES, while the conventional PBL scheme struggled to trigger intense convective cells rather than cellular rolls. The results strongly suggest that the scale-aware nonlocal PBL scheme can be used to adequately reproduce the scale and evolution of the observed rolls in the deep CBL in Taklimakan desert at subkilometer resolutions.",

Two typical typhoons, Nanmadol and Usagi that occurred in 2011 and 2013, respectively, were simulated in this study. The O 3 concentration variation patterns in the ambient air of both offshore and inland parts of southwestern Taiwan were collected and analyzed. The results indicated that the high O 3 concentration observed in southwestern Taiwan before typhoon arrived was mainly caused by the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) shrouding it. On the other hand, the latter increase in ambient O 3 concentration about 1 to 2 days before issuing sea warning was mainly due to both contributions of weakening WPSH and intensifying leeward side effects. For both cases, atmospheric subsidence occurred to result in low ambient air quality. The invasion of typhoons made ambient O 3 concentration enhanced up to 2-3-fold compared to its normal concentration in summer. Based on the simulated O 3 concentration variation results in this study, it is demonstrated that the space-fading patterns of O 3 before typhoon arrives also can be used as references for predicting typhoon moving tracks 1.0 to 2.0 days before landfall of typhoons.",

Dew is a crucial factor in the water and nutrient cycling of farmland ecosystems, and it exerts an important influence on fertilization and other agricultural activities. In order to reveal the effects of global warming on dew variation in a paddy ecosystem, an in situ experiment was conducted in paddy fields in the Sanjiang Plain during the growing seasons of 2011 to 2013. Dew was collected and measured with a poplar stick. The results of correlation analysis between meteorological factors and dew intensity in the paddy ecosystem indicate that the dew point temperature and relative humidity significantly influenced the dew intensity. Based on synchronous meteorological data, a stepwise linear multivariation regression model was established to predict dew amount. The model successfully interpreted the relationship between simulated and measured dew intensity. The results suggest that a warmer and drier climate would lead to a reduction in dew amount because water cannot condense when relative humidity falls below 71%.",

The modeling system is validated and calibrated using daily atmospheric forcing derived from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis dataset from 1951 to 2007. The potential impact of future anthropogenic global warming (AGW) in the Galápagos region is examined using the calibrated HYCOM with forcing derived from the IPCC-AR4 climate model. Results show that although the oceanic variability in the entire Galápagos region is significantly affected by global climate change, the degree of such effects is inhomogeneous across the region. The upwelling region to the west of the Isabella Island shows relatively slower warming trends compared to the eastern Galápagos region. Diagnostic analysis suggests that the variability in the western Galápagos upwelling region is affected mainly by equatorial undercurrent (EUC) and Panama currents, while the central/east Galápagos is predominantly affected by both Peru and EUC currents. The inhomogeneous responses in different regions of the Galápagos Archipelago to future AGW can be explained by the incoherent changes of the various current systems in the Galápagos region as a result of global climate change.",

Vegetation activity presents a distinctive uptrend during the study period, especially in Fengjie, Yunyang, Wushan, Wuxi, and Badong counties located in the midstream of the Three Gorges Reservoir. However, in the Chongqing major area (CMA) and its surrounding areas and Fuling, Yichang, and part of Wanzhou, vegetation activity shows a decreasing trend as a result of urban expansion. The NDVI has two fluctuation troughs in 2004 and 2006. The annual mean temperature presents a slight overall upward trend, but the annual total precipitation does not present a significant trend. And they almost have no significant correlations with the NDVI. Therefore, temperature and precipitation are not major influences on vegetation activity change.

In this study, daily PM 10 and visibility data in 2001–2012 were analyzed to investigate the air quality status as well as the twelve-year pollution trends in Hefei. The results reveal that Hefei has been suffering high PM 10 pollution and low visibility during the study period.

Motivated in part by the anomalous nature of climate variability during GRACE, the characteristics of both forced change and internal modes are quantified and their influences on observations are estimated. Trends during the GRACE era in the LE are dominated by internal variability rather than by the forced response, with TWS anomalies in much of the Americas, eastern Australia, Africa, and southwestern Eurasia largely attributable to the negative phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). While similarities between observed trends and the model-inferred forced response also exist, it is inappropriate to attribute such trends mainly to anthropogenic forcing. For several key river basins, trends in the mean state and interannual variability and the time at which the forced response exceeds background variability are also estimated while aspects of global mean TWS, including changes in its annual amplitude and decadal trends, are quantified. The findings highlight the challenge of detecting anthropogenic climate change in temporally finite satellite datasets and underscore the benefit of utilizing models in the interpretation of the observed record.",

Specifically, a reliable probabilistic forecast is crucial for the management of the movable barriers that are planned to become operational in 2018 for the protection of Venice and its lagoon. However, a probabilistic forecast requires multiple simulations and a considerable computational time, which makes it expensive in real-time applications. This paper describes the ensemble dressing method, a cheap operational flood prediction system that includes information about the uncertainty of the ensemble members by computing it directly from the meteorological input and the local spread distribution, without requiring multiple forecasts. Here, a sophisticated error distribution form is developed, which includes the superposition of the uncertainty caused by inaccuracies of the ensemble prediction system, which depends on surge level and lead time, and the uncertainty of the meteorological forcing, which is described using a combination of cross-basin pressure gradients. The ensemble dressing is validated over a 3-month-long period in the year 2010, during which an exceptional sequence of storm surges occurred. Results demonstrate that this computationally cheap method can provide an acceptably realistic estimate of the uncertainty.",

High-resolution reanalysis wind field data sets are employed to drive a spectral wave model WAVEWATCH III™ (WW3). The wave hindcast information is validated using altimeter wave information (Topex/Poseidon). The model performance is satisfactory. Subsequently, the trends in yearly/seasonal/monthly mean extreme SWH are analyzed. Results showed that trends greater than 0.05 m yr −1 are distributed over a large part of the central SCS. During winter, strong positive trends (0.07–0.08 m yr −1 ) are found in the extreme northeast SCS. Significant trends greater than 0.01 m yr −1 are distributed over most parts of the central SCS in spring. In summer, significant increasing trends (0.01–0.05 m yr −1 ) are distributed over most regions below latitude 16°N. During autumn, strong positive trends between 0.02 and 0.08 m yr −1 are found in small regions above latitude 12°N. Increasing positive trends are found to be generally significant in the central SCS in December, February, March, and July. Furthermore, temporal trend analysis showed that the extreme SWH exhibits a significant increasing trend of 0.011 m yr −1 . The extreme SWH exhibits the strongest increasing trend of 0.03 m yr −1 in winter and showed a decreasing trend of −0.0098 m yr −1 in autumn.",

Simulations of two months in 2014 (January and July) showed that land-use change increased the monthly averaged 2 m temperature by 0.24°C and 0.27°C in January and July, respectively. The relative humidity decreased by 2.02% and 2.23% in January and July, respectively. Due to the increase in ground roughness, the monthly averaged wind speed in January and July decreased by 0.19 m/s and 0.16 m/s. The planetary boundary layer height increased throughout the day and with larger relative increase during the nighttime. These subtle changes caused by land-use resulted in discernable changes in pollutant concentrations. Monthly averaged surface O 3 concentration increased by 0.93 µ g/m 3 and 1.61 µ g/m 3 in January and July, while PM 2.5 concentration decreased by 1.58 µ g/m 3 and 3.76 µ g/m 3 , and the changes in pollutant concentrations were more noticeable during the nighttime. Overall, the impacts of land-use change on the atmospheric environment are obvious throughout the PRD region, especially in the urbanized areas.",

A new drought index, standardized supply-demand water index (SSDI), has been proposed in this research. The SSDI describes drought from the view of water supply-demand relations using a simple water balance model. It was used to assess historical drought events in the middle and lower Jinsha river basin (MLJRB) located in the southwest China and applied to address the drought conditions in the MLJRB under current and future climates. The results showed the following: (1) The average drought area during 2001 to 2011 reached up to 9.9 × 10 3 km 2 , accounting for 35.4% of the whole farmland area in the MLJRB, which was about twice as the drought area during 1961 to 2000. The region for greater drought severity with more drought events and longer duration was mainly distributed in Dali, Chuxiong, Kunming, and Yuxi. (2) For the period 2021 to 2050, total drought area was projected to increase by 43.2%. The drought-prone regions could move further towards the northwest of the MLJRB.",

Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is the first C-band synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) satellite of China, offering broad land and ocean imaging applications, including soil moisture monitoring. This study developed an approach to estimate soil moisture in agricultural areas from GF-3 data. An inversion technique based on an artificial neural network (ANN) is introduced. The neural network was trained and tested on a training sample dataset generated from the Advanced Integral Equation Model. Incidence angle and HH or VV polarization data were used as input variables of the ANN, with soil moisture content (SMC) and surface roughness as the output variables. The backscattering contribution from the vegetation was eliminated using the water cloud model (WCM). The acquired soil backscattering coefficients of GF-3 and in situ measurement data were used to validate the SMC estimation algorithm, which achieved satisfactory results ( R 2 = 0.736; RMSE = 0.042). These results highlight the contribution of the combined use of the GF-3 synthetic-aperture radar and Landsat-8 images based on an ANN method for improving SMC estimates and supporting hydrological studies.",

Regardless of where, when, and how the event has happened, floods affect social security as well as environmental damages. Understanding floods dynamics, their impacts, and management is thus critical, especially in climate risk assessment. In the present study, a flash flood (a case of an episodic hydrological event) which happened on January 11, 2018, in Morogoro, Tanzania, is examined and synthesized. Data were courtesy of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Global Forecasting System (NOAA GFS) (forecast data), Tanzania Meteorological Agency (TMA), and Sokoine University of Agriculture (for the automatic weather data). With the help of ZyGRIB-grib file visualization software (version 8.01, under General Public License (GNU GPL v3)), the forecast data and patterns of the observation from the automatic weather station (temperatures, wind speed and directions, rainfall, humidity, and pressure) and the long-term rainfall data analysis in the study area made it possible. This study contributes to the knowledge of understanding the changing weather for planning and management purposes. Both forecasts and the observations captured the flash flood event. The rain was in the category of heavy rainfall (more than 50 mm per day) as per the regional guidelines. The synergy between the forecasts and the 30-minute weather observation interval captured the fundamental weather patterns that describe the event. For studying the nature and impacts of flash floods in the region, the integration of automatic weather observation into the systems of national meteorological centers is inevitable. Additionally, as part of an integrated disaster risk reduction effort, there is a need for a review on catchment management strategies.",

This paper proposes a method for retrieving path-averaged DSD parameters using joint dual-frequency and dual-polarization microwave links of the telecommunication system. Detailed analyses of the rain-induced attenuation calculation are performed based on the T-matrix method. A forward model is established for describing the relation between the DSD and the rain-induced attenuation. Then, the method is proposed to retrieve propagation path DSD parameters based on Levenberg–Marquardt optimization algorithm. The numerical simulation for path-averaged DSD retrieval shows that the RMSEs of three gamma DSD parameters are 0.34 mm −1 , 0.81, and 3.21×10 3 m −3 ·mm −1 , respectively, in rainfall intensity above 30 mm/h. Meanwhile, the method can retrieve the rainfall intensity without the influence of variational DSD. Theoretical analyses and numerical simulations confirm that the method for retrieving path-averaged DSD parameters is promising. The method can complement existing DSD monitoring systems such as the disdrometer and provide high-resolution rainfall measurements with widely distributed microwave links without additional cost.",

    "abstract": "Following the deepening of climate change and the increasing industrialization in recent years, the problem of air pollution in cities has become increasingly prominent. Based on the data of air pollutants and meteorological elements in Jiangsu Province, China (2013–2017), we analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of air pollution. The results show that the air-quality index (AQI) in Jiangsu Province decreased from 2013 to 2017 and the highest AQI is in winter and the lowest in the summer, while its values in coastal cities of Jiangsu are less than those of inland cities. For the temporal distribution of primary pollutants, PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 , NO 2 , and CO present the same trend under seasonal and monthly time scales, i.e., winter is higher and summer is lower; however, the other secondary pollutant, O 3 , presents opposite characteristics under the same time scale: it has higher concentration levels in summer and lower in winter. For the spatial distribution, PM 2.5 and PM 10 are in good concord: the higher values are found in the west of Jiangsu Province and lower in the east. For the spatial distribution of NO 2 , this presents higher concentrations in south and lower concentrations in north according to the position of Yangzi River, while the distribution of O 3 concentration is opposite to that of NO 2 . The meteorological elements selected are related to air pollution, the AQI is significantly negatively correlated with monthly temperature (including average, minimum, and maximum temperatures), monthly average water vapor pressure, monthly precipitation, and monthly sunshine duration; the correlation coefficients are –0.852, –0.846, –0.850, –0.797, –0.727, and –0.599, respectively. As far as the relationships between air pollutions are concerned, there is a significant positive correlation between AQI, PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 , and NO 2 , while O 3 is remarkably negatively correlated with other pollutants and AQI. The most prominent correlations are distinguished into two groups: one is AQI, PM 2.5 , and PM 10 , with correlation coefficients of 0.876 and 0.966, and the other is SO 2 , NO 2 , with correlation coefficient of about 0.9.",

This work analyzes specific trends observed in association with atmospheric blocking predominantly across the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. Such trends include the relationship between the size, duration, and onset position of atmospheric blocking events and the frequency, duration, and intensity of heavy rainfall events across the central United States. A strong focus is placed on examining the duration and spatial extent of atmospheric blocking which has been found to influence the intensity of heavy rainfall events. The goal is to further bridge the gap between the location and duration of blocking highs and the intensity, duration, and frequency of heavy rainfall events which occur downstream of such blocking events.",

On the contrary, the rainfall increases in summer and autumn but reduces in winter and spring in El Niño Modoki episode. Nevertheless, two types of La Niña cause similar effects on the rainfall over Taiwan. It increases in autumn only.

The effect of topography on ET was evaluated over an area with a complex terrain. After applying the topographic correction, the results indicate that the ET decreased with elevation and slope. The slope had a stronger impact on ET than the elevation, which caused the corrected ET to decrease by 90% from 6.8 mm day −1 to 0.6 mm day −1 for slopes over 50°. On average, the corrected ET decreased by 10.4% and 32.1% for north- and south-facing slopes, respectively. The ET corrected using the triangle method strongly depended on the evaporative fraction correction, which can mainly be attributed to the surface temperature correction.

The spatial distribution of glacier albedo in winter did not vary with altitude and was determined by terrain shield, whereas, in summer, albedo increased with altitude and was only influenced by terrain shield at accumulation zone. During 2000–2009, albedo in summer decreased at a rate of 0.0052 per year and was influenced by air temperature and precipitation levels, whereas albedo in winter increased at a rate of 0.0045 per year, influenced by the level and frequency of precipitation. The annual variation of albedo in summer during 2000–2012 has the high relative to that of glacier mass balance measurement, which indicates that glacier albedo in the ablation period can be considered as a proxy for glacier mass balance.",

Reliable and precise wind speed prediction is vital for wind power generation systems. Thus, a more effective and precise prediction model is essentially needed in the field of wind speed forecasting. Most previous forecasting models could adapt to various wind speed series data; however, these models ignored the importance of the data preprocessing and model parameter optimization. In view of its importance, a novel hybrid ensemble learning paradigm is proposed. In this model, the original wind speed data is firstly divided into a finite set of signal components by ensemble empirical mode decomposition, and then each signal is predicted by several artificial intelligence models with optimized parameters by using the fruit fly optimization algorithm and the final prediction values were obtained by reconstructing the refined series. To estimate the forecasting ability of the proposed model, 15 min wind speed data for wind farms in the coastal areas of China was performed to forecast as a case study. The empirical results show that the proposed hybrid model is superior to some existing traditional forecasting models regarding forecast performance.",

The land surface scheme of RegCM4 was modified to incorporate an East-West reforested zone (15°N and 20°N). Two runs were performed using the standard version of RegCM4 and the modified one of the same model taking into account the incorporated forest. The reforestation significantly modifies rainfall signal over West Africa by increasing it over the reforested zone and the Fouta Jallon highlands (FJH). This rainfall increase is associated with a strengthening of the atmospheric moisture over the reforested area. This atmospheric moisture content increase associated with the wind dynamic may explain the spatiotemporal change of the rainfall and extreme precipitation events. The analysis of the impacts of the reforestation on some rainfall indices shows an increase of the 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles over the reforested zone and off the FJH. This reforestation also causes an increase of the maximum length of the consecutive wet days over and off FJH and a decrease of the maximum length of the consecutive dry days over the northern Sahel and the reforested zone.",

The physical-based distributed model TOPKAPI is introduced for flood prediction in an ungauged basin by parameter transplant. Five main parameters are selected, and the sensitivity is analyzed by the GLUE method. The Xixian basin and Huangchuan basin in the upper Huaihe basin in China are chosen as study areas. The Xixian basin is regarded as a gauged basin for parameter calibration, and the Huangchuan basin is regarded as an ungauged basin by ignoring the historical discharge data. The model is calibrated in gauged Xixian basin, and then parameters are directly transplanted to adjacent “ungauged” Huangchuan basin to simulate flood forecast in an ungauged basin. The sensitivity analysis shows that soil thickness and soil saturated water content are the most sensitive parameters, and the Manning coefficient of main channel with high Strahler also significantly affects forecast results. According to the simulation results, the TOPKAPI model exhibits good performance in building and the prediction of the ungauged basin, in which the qualified rate of volume and peaks reaches 69.23%, and the average NSE criterion is over 0.67, which is acceptable forecast accuracy and has positive implication for the hydrological forecasting research.",

    "abstract": "Spatial distribution of meteorological stations has a significant role in hydrological research. The meteorological data play a significant role in drought monitoring; in this regard, accurate and suitable provision of meteorological stations is becoming crucial to improve and strengthen the skill of drought prediction. In this perspective, the choice of meteorological stations in a specific region has substantial importance for accurate estimation and continuous monitoring of drought hazards at the regional level. However, installation and data mining on a large number of meteorological stations require high cost and resources. Therefore, it is necessary to rank and find dependencies among existing meteorological stations in a particular region for further climatological analysis and reanalysis of databases. In this paper, the Monte Carlo feature selection and interdependency discovery (MCFS-ID) algorithm-based framework is proposed to identify the important meteorological station in a particular region. We applied the proposed framework on 12 meteorological stations situated in varying climatological regions of Punjab (Pakistan). We employed the drought index SPTI on 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-, 24-, and 48-month time-scale data to find the interdependencies among meteorological stations at various locations. We found that Sialkot has significance regional importance for studying SPTI-3, SPTI-6, and SPTI-48 indices. This regional importance is based on scores of relative importance (RI); for example, the RI values for SPTI-3, SPTI-6, and SPTI-48 indices are 0.1570, 0.1080, and 0.0270, respectively. Furthermore, the Jhelum station has more relative importance (RI = 0.1410 and 0.1030) for SPTI-1 and SPTI-9 indices, while varying concentration behaviour is observed in the remaining time scales.",

However, when extreme precipitation events occur, the consequences could be devastating for humans (droughts or floods). An accurate prediction of precipitation helps decision-makers to develop adequate mitigation plans. In this study, linear and nonlinear models with lagged predictors and the implementation of a nonlinear autoregressive model with exogenous variables (NARX) network were used to predict monthly rainfall in Labrado and Chirimachay meteorological stations. To define a suitable model, ridge regression, lasso, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and NARX network were used. Although the results were “unsatisfactory” with the linear models, the specific direct influences of variables such as Niño 1 + 2, Sahel rainfall, hurricane activity, North Pacific Oscillation, and the same delayed rainfall signal were identified. RF and SVM also demonstrated poor performance. However, RF had a better fit than linear models, and SVM has a better fit than RF models. Instead, the NARX model was trained using several architectures to identify an optimal one for the best prediction twelve months ahead. As an overall evaluation, the NARX model showed “good” results for Labrado and “satisfactory” results for Chirimachay. The predictions yielded by NARX models, for the first six months ahead, were entirely accurate. This study highlighted the strengths of NARX networks in the prediction of chaotic and nonlinear signals such as rainfall in regions that obey complex processes. The results would serve to make short-term plans and give support to decision-makers in the management of water resources.",

This deepening seems mainly due to the turbulent heat flux anomaly above the warm eddy inducing extensive deep and persistent changes in the atmospheric boundary layer thermodynamics. The loss of heat by turbulent processes suggests that this kind of oceanic feature is an important and persistent source of heat for the atmosphere.",

Incorrectly estimated model states will lead to discrepancies between the observed and estimated streamflow.

This study tests this concept in upper Huai River basin. We assimilate the streamflow observations sequentially into the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to update the model states.

The experiment shows that assimilating the streamflow observations at interior sites significantly improves the streamflow predictions for the whole basin. Assimilating the catchment outlet streamflow improves the streamflow predictions near the catchment outlet. In real data case, the estimated streamflow at the catchment outlet is significantly improved by assimilating the in situ streamflow measurements at interior gauges. Assimilating the in situ catchment outlet streamflow also improves the streamflow prediction of one interior location on the main reach. This may demonstrate that updating model states using streamflow observations can constrain the flux estimates in distributed hydrological modeling.",

To improve the S2S forecast skill, an S2S prediction project and an extensive database have been established. In this study, the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model hindcast, which participates in the S2S prediction project, is systematically assessed by focusing on the hindcast quality for the summer accumulated ten-day precipitation at lead times of 0–30 days during 1995–2014 in eastern China. Additionally, the hindcast error is corrected by utilizing the preceding sea surface temperature (SST). The metrics employed to measure the ECMWF hindcast performance indicate that the ECMWF model performance drops as the lead time increases and exhibits strong interannual differences among the five subregions of eastern China. In addition, the precipitation forecast skill of the ECMWF hindcast is best at approximately 15 days in some areas of Southeast China; after correcting the forecast error, the forecast skill is increased to 30 days. At lead times of 0–30 days, regardless of whether the forecast error is corrected, the root mean square errors are lowest in Northeast China. After correcting the forecast error, the performance of the ECMWF hindcast shows better improvement in depicting the quantity and temporal and spatial variation of precipitation at lead times of 0–30 days in eastern China. The false alarm ratio (FAR), probability of detection (POD), and equitable threat score (ETS) reveal that the ECMWF model has a preferable performance at forecasting accumulated ten-day precipitation rates of approximately 20∼50 mm and indicates an improved hindcast quality after the forecast error correction. In short, adopting the preceding SST to correct the summer subseasonal precipitation of the ECMWF hindcast is preferable.",

Understanding how climate conditions for tourism evolve is increasingly important for strategic tourism planning, particularly in rapidly developing tourism markets like China in a changing climate. Multidimensional climate indices are needed to evaluate climate for tourism, and previous studies in China have used the much criticized “climate index” with low resolution climate data. This study uses the Holiday Climate Index (HCI) and daily data from 775 weather stations to examine interregional differences in the tourist climate comfortable period (TCCP) across China and summarizes the spatiotemporal evolution of TCCP from 1981 to 2010 in a changing climate. Overall, most areas in China have an “excellent” climate for tourism, such that tourists may visit anytime with many choices available. The TCCP in most regions shows an increasing trend, and China benefits more from positive effects of climate change in climatic conditions for tourism, especially in spring and autumn. These results can provide some scientific evidence for understanding human settlement environmental constructions and further contribute in improving local or regional resilience responding to global climate change.",

The results show the following: (1) The SDF event has the characteristics of long duration, wide influence range, large intensity, and serious air pollution. During the study period, there are 531 stations with SDF events, covering an area of over 360,000 km 2 . There were five stations in Hebei province where the fog lasted for more than 77 hours, and even some stations did not dissipate during the day. (2) Radiation fog and advection fog alternate in this SDF event, namely, radiation fog (20:00 BT on December 30 to 14:00 on January 1), advection radiation fog (20:00 on January 1 to 08:00 on January 2), radiation fog (night on January 2 to daytime on January 3), and advection radiation fog (night on January 3 to January 5). The characteristic of radiation fog is that the central and eastern part of China was controlled by “L” type high pressure. In the stage of advection radiation fog, the combined effect of weak cold advection and radiation cooling leads to the occurrence of SDF. (3) Regarding the duration of the fog event, the inversion structure is continuously maintained at night and in the morning near the stratum, and when the fog intensity is strong, the inversion intensity is correspondingly large, the fog top is lower than the inversion layer top, and the top of the SDF is between 80 and 400 meters.",

The results illustrated that the rainstorm system was generated in the middle atmosphere of the western Aksu region near the Tianshan Mountains and gradually evolved into a multicell linear echo during system evolution. The cold air transported from the Tianshan Mountains partly reached the low altitudes during the downhill process, and the warm southwest air from Aksu was lifted, forming oblique updraft airflow. The other part of the cold air converged with the southeastern warm air in the middle atmosphere, and the transportation and convergence of the water vapor related to the southwestern, southeastern, and oblique updraft airflows provided good water vapor conditions for the storm system. Meanwhile, the inclined upward air transported cloud water and ice-phase particles to high altitudes, mixing the two and generating a large amount of supercooled cloud water, which was very beneficial for the development and maintenance of the storm system. These conditions were favorable for power, heat, water vapor, and water condensate particles, which enabled the development and maintenance of the rainstorm system on the convergence line, thus triggering this rare rainstorm process during the movement to the northeast.",

Understanding historical changes in extreme precipitation is critical for disaster prevention and risk assessment. The Mekong River Basin (MB) is vulnerable to natural disasters related to extreme precipitation. In the past ten years, the MB has experienced some destructive extreme precipitation events. Our concern is whether the historical extreme precipitation events in the MB have increased in a warming climate. This study investigates the spatiotemporal changes in extreme precipitation in the MB from 1951 to 2015 using a high-quality precipitation product and eight indices of extreme precipitation. These indices consistently indicate that the trend in extreme precipitation in the Upper Mekong Basin (UMB) is opposite to that in the Lower Mekong Basin (LMB). Extreme precipitation has generally decreased in the UMB but increased in the LMB. The areas with significant increasing extreme precipitation are mainly located in Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia. The areas with a statistically significant decline in extreme precipitation primarily occur in the Lancang (China’s section of the Mekong river) and Thailand. Also, the magnitude of changes in extreme precipitation is significantly larger in the LMB than that in the UMB, which potentially increases flooding risks in the LMB. The findings from this study are useful for guiding disaster-prevention efforts in the MB.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of various high-resolution satellite precipitation products (SPPs) solves the problem of precipitation data sources for areas with a lack of precipitation data and is recognized as a reliable supplement to rain gauge observations in hydrometeorological applications. However, there still exists a shortcoming of coarse spatial resolution when applying these products to small and microscale river basins. In this study, a typical karst watershed in Southwest China—the Pingtang River Basin (PTRB)—was selected, and based on the relationship between precipitation and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), aspect, slope, and elevation, we used the geographically weighted regression (GWR) to downscale three SPPs, namely, global precipitation measurement (GPM), global satellite mapping of precipitation (GSMAP), and multisource weighted-ensemble precipitation (MSWEP), to 1 km × 1 km, respectively. Combined with rain gauge stations, the geographical differential analysis (GDA) was used to carry out error corrections to obtain three downscaling correction satellite precipitation products (DC-SPPs) with a 1 km spatial resolution, including DC-GPM, DC -GSMAP, and DC-MSWEP. Several statistical indices were used to perform error evaluation and precipitation capture ability analysis on SPPs and DC-SPPs, and the Grid-Xin’anjiang (the Grid-XAJ) model was used to compare their hydrological utility. The results show the following: (1) The downscaling correction method is effective. GWR can effectively improve the spatial resolution of SPPs, while GDA can reduce errors and further improve the accuracy of precipitation estimation. In addition, (2) the precipitation event characterization capabilities of GPM and GSMAP have been improved after downscaling correction, while the ability to capture precipitation events before and after the MSWEP correction is poor, showing a high hit rate and a high false alarm rate, which is unreliable to monitor precipitation events in the PTRB. Finally, (3) compared with SPPs, the hydrological performances of the three kinds of DC-SPPs have been significantly improved, and the NSE are all above 0.75 with low error. In general, the overall performance of DC-GSMAP is satisfactory. The accuracy of different SPPs after downscaling correction is different, but the applicability has been improved to different degrees.",

    "abstract": "The monitoring of rainfall variability over recent decades has become a necessity due to its devastating effects such as floods and droughts, which render humans vulnerable across different parts of the West African region. The current study seeks to provide a good understanding of variability within the minor rainfall season over southern Ghana by employing statistical tools to quantify variability in rainfall. Daily rainfall data from 1981 to 2018 for seventeen (17) synoptic weather stations across southern Ghana are used for this analysis. We perform trend and descriptive statistics of rainfall amount and extreme indices intending to identify the areas with the greatest variability in rainfall. Further, for five recent years (2014–2018), we do an interpolation of the ground station rainfall data and compute anomalies. We find increasing trends of rainfall in the minor rainy season for 16 out of the 17 stations, with rainfall increasing between 0.10 mm and 4.30 mm each season. For extreme rainfall indices, the 17 stations show nonsignificant trends of very wet and extremely wet days. We also find that the middle parts of Ghana have the highest rainfall amounts (262.7 mm/season–400.2 mm/season), while the East Coast has the lowest (125.2 mm/season–181.8 mm/season). Over the whole of southern Ghana, we find high variability in rainfall amount with the coefficient of variations (CV) between 25.3% and 70.8% and moderate to high variability in rainfall frequency (CV = 14.0%–48.8%). The results of rainfall anomalies show that the middle parts had an above-normal rainfall amount. In the same period, the transition areas experienced below-normal rainfall. Our finding of high variability in the minor rainfall season has implications for agricultural productivity in Ghana and countries in the West African region, which rely heavily on rain-fed agriculture. Hence, this study recommends more research to understand the causes of variability in the West African monsoon and how this will change in the region.",

The datasets are compared against the observed daily rainfall at 133 stations using 13 statistical metrics that can be classified into three groups with different characteristics of measurements, namely distribution, time sequence, and extreme value representations. By applying summation of rank (SR), it is found that MSWEP and TMPA 3B42 are the top two datasets that outperformed based on distribution and time sequence performance metric groups. The extreme performances for all datasets are still good in 75th percentiles; however, the performances decrease at more than 75th percentiles indicating still a poorly representation of daily extreme rainfall for all gridded datasets. Results of this study suggest that MSWEP (v2) is presently the best gridded precipitation datasets available for climatological and hydrological applications in Indonesia.",

The Köppen–Geiger classification system is the most widely used climate classification scheme. In this study, we compared the climate zones objectively defined using data-driven methods with Köppen–Geiger rule-based classification. Cluster analysis was used to objectively delineate the world’s climatic regions. We applied three clustering algorithms—k-means, ISODATA, and unsupervised random forest classification—to a dataset comprising 10 climatic variables and elevation; we then compared the obtained results with those from the Köppen–Geiger classification system. Results from both the systems were similar for some climatic regions, especially extreme temperature ones such as the tropics, deserts, and polar regions. Data-driven classification identified novel climatic regions that the Köppen–Geiger classification could not. Refinements to the Köppen–Geiger classification, such as precipitation-based subdivisions to existing Köppen–Geiger climate classes like tropical rainforest (Af) and warm summer continental (Dfb), have been suggested based on clustering results. Climatic regions objectively defined by data-driven methods can further the current understanding of climate divisions. On the other hand, rule-based systems, such as the Köppen–Geiger classification, have an advantage in characterizing individual climates. In conclusion, these two approaches can complement each other to form a more objective climate classification system, wherein finer details can be provided by data-driven classification and supported by the intuitive structure of rule-based classification.",

The evaluation of different simulations against six Micronet stations shows that WRF-CFD numerical evaluation is a reliable method to understand the complicated wind flow within built-up areas. The comparison of wind distributions of simulations at different resolutions shows better description of wind variability and gusts generated by the urban flows.

Results are presented for a deposition scheme accounting for turbulent and chemical enhancement of oceanic ozone deposition and a second non‐chemical, parameterised gaseous dry deposition scheme. The first deposition scheme was constrained to account for sea‐surface ozone‐iodide reactions and the sensitivity of modelled ozone concentrations to oceanic iodide concentration was investigated. Simulations were also performed using nominal reaction rate derived from in-situ ozone deposition measurements and using a preliminary representation of organic chemistry. Results show insensitivity of ambient ozone concentrations modelled by the chemical‐enhanced scheme to oceanic iodide concentrations, and iodide reactions alone cannot account for observed deposition velocities. Consequently, we suggest a missing chemical sink due to reactions of ozone with organic matter at the air‐sea interface. Ozone loss rates are estimated to be in the range of 0.5–6 ppb per day. A potentially significant ozone‐driven flux of iodine to the atmosphere is estimated to be in the range of 2.5–500 M molec cm −2 s −1 , leading to a mixing‐layer enhancement of organo‐iodine concentrations of 0.1–22.0 ppt, with an average increase in the N.E.

    "abstract": "Dust intrusions from African desert regions have an impact on the Mediterranean Basin (MB), as they cause an anomalous increase of aerosol concentrations in the tropospheric column and often an increase of particulate matter at the ground level. To estimate the Saharan dust contribution to PM 10 , a significant dust intrusion event that occurred in June 2006 is investigated, joining numerical simulations and specific measurements. As a first step, a synoptic analysis of this episode is performed. Such analysis, based only on meteorological and aerosol optical thickness observations, does not allow the assessment of exhaustive informations. In fact, it is not possible to distinguish dust outbreaks transported above the boundary layer without any impact at the ground level from those causing deposition. The approach proposed in this work applies an ad hoc model chain to describe emission, transport and deposition dynamics. Furthermore, physical and chemical analyses (PIXE analysis and ion chromatography) were used to measure the concentration of all soil-related elements to quantify the contribution of dust particles to PM 10 . The comparison between simulation results and in-situ measurements show a satisfying agreement, and supports the effectiveness of the model chain to estimate the Saharan dust contribution at ground level.",

The model is driven at the lateral and lower boundaries by European reanalysis (ERA40) data for the period from 1958 to 2001. Simulations with a horizontal resolution of 50 km are carried out to analyze the regional monsoon patterns. The focus in this paper is on the validation of the long‐term summer monsoon climatology and its variability concerning circulation, temperature, and precipitation. Additionally, the monsoonal behavior in simulations for wet and dry years has been investigated and compared against several observational data sets. The results successfully reproduce the observations due to a realistic reproduction of topographic features. The simulated precipitation shows a better agreement with a high‐resolution gridded precipitation data set over the central land areas of India and in the higher elevated Tibetan and Himalayan regions than ERA40.",

The data about Spitsbergen fjords are from literature. Our results show that, on the bays of the Barents Sea islands, most SPM stays in the bays (fjords) and only small part of it reaches the open sea. This is due to the hydrodynamic conditions in the bays, the large size of the particles, flocculation, and often to the morphological barriers in the relief at the bay entrances. It is important for ecological purposes to map out migration pathways of the SPM with pollutants from bays to the open sea. Results of our investigation indicate that the western bays of the Novaya Zemlya act as traps for SPM derived from glaciers and coastal abrasion.",

The study examines different urban zones in Birobidzhan, the capital city of the Jewish Autonomous Region (JAR). The climate of this region can be characterized as continental monsoon climate. The difference of thermal values for three zones with different vegetation and build-up density shows the influence of urban planning on the local microclimate. The moderating effect of dense build-up and inner city vegetation on extreme thermal conditions becomes clear when comparing all zones. Through the analysis of daily and monthly timelines it was possible to determine preferable times of the day for inner city outdoor activities. From the results derived from PET with a total of 170 days per year with PET values below Birobidzhan can be considered a region of extreme cold stress. This means that an adaptation based solely on behaviour and clothing is not sufficient, but an adaptation of the urban surroundings and therefore the identification and choice of preferable urban structures is necessary.",

    "abstract": "In the context of global climate change, the extent of snow cover in Siberia has significantly decreased since the 1970s, especially in spring. The changes of snow cover at middle and high latitudes have significant impacts on the meteorological and hydrological processes because the snow cover can affect the surface energy, water balance, and the development of the atmospheric boundary layer. In this paper, the temporal and spatial changes in snow cover were firstly estimated based on a long time series of remote sensing snow cover data, both showing a decreased trend. Based on this, we estimated the radiative forcing caused by the snow cover changes from the 1970s to the 2010s and compared it with the radiative forcing caused by the vegetation cover changes over the same time period in Siberia, indicating that the snow cover changes in Siberia can accelerate climate warming and the vegetation cover changes here have the opposite effect. Furthermore, the snow cover changes may play a more important role than the vegetation cover changes in regulating the surface radiation balance in Siberia on the regional scale.",

In this study, the thermal index concept is used to determine the length of the growing period of short season, medium season, and medium-late season maize crop varieties for different sowing dates (1st dekad of October to 1st dekad of January). The results show high spatiotemporal variation in the median growing period for all three maize varieties. The length of the growing period for the short, medium, and medium-late season varieties is relatively short during October to early December with values in some areas of less than 100, 120, and 120 days, respectively. The duration of the planting period increases exponentially in most places starting from the 2nd dekad of November to 2nd dekad of December, depending on the region and crop variety. Long growing periods are likely to align maize growing period with dates of high frost risk and water shortages. Thus, appropriate choice of sowing date taking into consideration the thermal time requirements of the cultivar is crucial for proper growth and development of the maize crop.",

The integrated effects of both LUCC and climate change have led to an increase in the annual streamflow in the Yingluoxia catchment (YLC) region and a decline in the Minxian catchment (MXC) region by 3.2% and 4.3% of their total streamflow, respectively. Climate change has shown an increase in streamflow in YLC and a decline in MXC region, occupying 107.3% and 93.75% of the total streamflow changes, respectively, a reflection of climatic latitude effect on streamflow. It is thus construed that the climatic factors contribute to more significant influence than LUCC on the magnitude, variability, duration, and component of the flow regimes, implying that the climate certainly dominates the flow regime changes in northeastern Tibetan Plateau.",

Concentration levels of the 10 microns’ PM (i.e., PM 10 ) are determined using the gravimetric technique. Morphological and chemical characteristics of the PM collected from the sampling cities are studied using Field-Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX), and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF). Moreover, levels and types of hazardous materials related to these samples are assessed using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Results revealed that the average concentration levels of PM 10 were approximately 177, 380, and 126 μ g/m 3 in Dhahran, Khobar, and Dammam, respectively. The structure of PM collected in Dhahran was mainly platy and rod-like shaped with a size between 2 and 6 μ m, while PM collected in Khobar was mostly irregular in form, with a size range between 2 and 8 μ m, and Dammam’s PM was rounded and between 1 and 3 μ m in size. Both EDX and XRF results indicate relatively high weight % of C, O, Si, F, and Ca with lower weight % of Na, Mg, and K at the 3 cities. Finally, the study shows that Ba and Zn were the main trace metals associated with the collected PM in the 3 cities.",

By using the MASH method, this work examined and corrected the homogeneity of the daily data including average, minimum, and maximum temperature and precipitation during 1978–2015 from 404/397 national meteorological stations in North China. Based on the meteorological station metadata, the results are analyzed and the differences before and after homogenization are compared. The results show that breakpoints are present pervasively in these temperature data. Most of them appeared after 2000. The stations with a host of breakpoints are mainly located in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei Province, where meteorological stations are densely distributed. The numbers of breakpoints in the daily precipitation series in North China during 1978–2015 also culminated in 2000. The reason for these breakpoints, called inhomogeneity, may be the large-scale replacement of meteorological instruments after 2000. After correction by the MASH method, the annual average temperature and minimum temperature decrease by 0.04°C and 0.06°C, respectively, while the maximum temperature increases by 0.01°C. The annual precipitation declines by 0.96 mm. The overall trends of temperature change before and after the correction are largely consistent, while the homogeneity of individual stations is significantly improved. Besides, due to the correction, the majority series of the precipitation are reduced and the correction amplitude is relatively large. During 1978–2015, the temperature in North China shows a rise trend, while the precipitation tends to decrease.",

Previous investigators have developed numerous modeling and measurement techniques to quantify sublimation, illustrating high variability over short distances. The complexities of modeling and measuring sublimation limit investigations to smaller scales in complex terrain and therefore the effects that microscale controls on sublimation have at the macroscale are not well understood. A key component of microscale variability, vegetation cover, can change on short time scales relative to other components (e.g., slope, aspect, and elevation) in response to natural and anthropogenic influences such as land use practice, drought, wildfire, insect infestation, and climate change. Basic vegetation-sublimation relationships may vary within a given drainage basin, by climate type, seasonally, and interannually. It is therefore particularly important to advance understanding of vegetation effects on sublimation at the macroscale.",

Moreover, climate projections for Poland foresee further warming as well as changes in the spatial and seasonal distribution and quantity of precipitation. However, climate models do not agree on the sign of change of precipitation. In Poland precipitation is projected to decrease in summer (this finding is not robust, being model-dependent) and to increase in winter. Therefore, there is still considerable uncertainty regarding likely climate change impacts on water resources in Poland. However, there is no doubt that changes in the thermal characteristics as well as in precipitation will influence changes in the water balance of the country. In this study, the components of climatic water balance, that is, precipitation, evaporation, and runoff, are calculated for the average conditions in the control period of 1961–1990 and in the future (2071–2100) in Poland. The changes of the water balance components for the present and for the future are compared and analysed. Due to insufficient consistency between climate models a possible range of changes should be presented; hence the multimodel projections from ENSEMBLES Project of the European Union are used in this study.",

HIRHAM5 shows a general agreement in the spatial patterns and annual course of these variables, although distinct biases for specific regions and months are obvious. The most prominent biases occur for east Siberian deciduous forest albedo, which is overestimated in the simulation for snow covered conditions in spring. This may be caused by the simplified albedo parameterization (e.g., nonconsideration of different forest types and neglecting the effect of fallen leaves and branches on snow for deciduous tree forest). The land surface temperature biases mirror the albedo biases in their spatial and temporal structures. The snow cover fraction and albedo biases can explain the simulated land surface temperature bias of ca. −3°C over the Siberian forest area in spring.",

The simulated effects of annual average temperature showed a decreasing order: evergreen broadleaf &gt; evergreen needleleaf &gt; deciduous needleleaf &gt; deciduous broadleaf, and the effects of annual average precipitation of the evergreen forests would be bigger than those of the deciduous forests. The deciduous forests play a positive role in decreasing the annual average temperature, while the evergreen forests promote the annual average temperature rise. Besides, the expansion of deciduous forests may result in severe drought in the summer in Jiangxi Province.

Three types of fog have been distinguished, including radiation fog, advection fog, and frontal fog. When fog events happened, the average surface temperature ranged from near zero to 10°C and the relative humidity was around 90%. Fog events often happened immediately after haze episodes (i.e., fog-haze) and sometimes after light rain. Back trajectory analyses show that the air masses during the fog events mostly came from the local Shandong areas and moved in very slow speed (4–24 km h −1 ). During the fog events, the humidity along the air trajectories always gradually increased to saturation. The mixed layer depth was small, generally below 400 m at noon and around 100 m at midnight. However, the air temperature exhibited complex variations—sometimes decreased and sometimes kept stable or even increased.",

The skin temperature is much less correlated to the bulk surface water temperature in the summer (0.80), when the lake is thermally stratified, and uncorrelated in the winter, when the Dead Sea is vertically mixed. Low correlations were found between the skin temperature and the solar radiation and wind speed in all seasons. The skin, with its low thermal inertia, responds immediately to the atmospheric forcing. Heat fluxes across the sea surface are also presented. The high correlation of skin temperature to air temperature with minimal time lag is a result of the nearly immediate response of the thin skin layer to the surface heat fluxes, primarily the sensible heat flux.",

    "abstract": "We applied an integrated approach to investigate the impacts of land use and land cover (LULC) changes on hydrology at different scales in the Loess Plateau of China. Hydrological modeling was conducted for the LULC maps from remote sensing images at two times in the Upper Fenhe River watershed using the SWAT model. The main LULC changes in this watershed from 1995 to 2010 were the transformation of farmland into forests, grassland, and built-up land. The simulation results showed that forested land contributed more than any other LULC class to water yield, but built-up land had most impact due to small initial loss and infiltration. At basin scale, a comparison of the simulated hydrological components of two LULC maps showed that there were slight increases in average annual potential evapotranspiration, actual evapotranspiration, and water yield, but soil water decreased, between the two intervals. In subbasins, obvious LULC changes did not have clear impacts on hydrology, and the impacts may be affected by precipitation conditions. By linking a hydrological model to remote sensing image analysis, our approach of quantifying the impacts of LULC changes on hydrology at different scales provide quantitative information for stakeholders in making decisions for land and water resource management.",

    "abstract": "This study describes the development of a reservoir inflow forecasting model for typhoon events to improve short lead-time flood forecasting performance. To strengthen the forecasting ability of the original support vector machines (SVMs) model, the self-organizing map (SOM) is adopted to group inputs into different clusters in advance of the proposed SOM-SVM model. Two different input methods are proposed for the SVM-based forecasting method, namely, SOM-SVM1 and SOM-SVM2. The methods are applied to an actual reservoir watershed to determine the 1 to 3 h ahead inflow forecasts. For 1, 2, and 3 h ahead forecasts, improvements in mean coefficient of efficiency (MCE) due to the clusters obtained from SOM-SVM1 are 21.5%, 18.5%, and 23.0%, respectively. Furthermore, improvement in MCE for SOM-SVM2 is 20.9%, 21.2%, and 35.4%, respectively. Another SOM-SVM2 model increases the SOM-SVM1 model for 1, 2, and 3 h ahead forecasts obtained improvement increases of 0.33%, 2.25%, and 10.08%, respectively. These results show that the performance of the proposed model can provide improved forecasts of hourly inflow, especially in the proposed SOM-SVM2 model. In conclusion, the proposed model, which considers limit and higher related inputs instead of all inputs, can generate better forecasts in different clusters than are generated from the SOM process. The SOM-SVM2 model is recommended as an alternative to the original SVR (Support Vector Regression) model because of its accuracy and robustness.",

To identify the impacts of climate change in the runoff process in the Three-River Headwater Region (TRHR) on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, two artificial neural network (ANN) models, one with three input variables (previous runoff, air temperature, and precipitation) and another with two input variables (air temperature and precipitation only), were developed to simulate and predict the runoff variation in the TRHR. The results show that the three-input variable ANN model has a superior real-time prediction capability and performs well in the simulation and forecasting of the runoff variation in the TRHR. Under the different scenarios conditions, the forecasting results of ANN model indicated that climate change has a great effect on the runoff processes in the TRHR. The results of this study are of practical significance for water resources management and the evaluation of the impacts of climatic change on the hydrological regime in long-term considerations.",

We correlated vegetation health products derived from polar-orbiting radiometer observations with a meteorological drought indicator available at different aggregation timescales, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), to evaluate responses averaged globally and over latitude and biome. The remote sensing products are Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), which uses normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to identify plant stress, Temperature Condition Index (TCI), based on thermal emission as a measure of surface temperature, and Vegetation Health Index (VHI), the average of VCI and TCI. Globally, TCI correlated best with 2-month timescale SPEI, VCI correlated best with longer timescale droughts (peak mean correlation at 13 months), and VHI correlated best at an intermediate timescale of 4 months. Our results suggest that thermal emission (TCI) may better detect incipient drought than vegetation color (VCI). VHI had the highest correlations with SPEI at aggregation times greater than 3 months and hence may be the most suitable product for monitoring the effects of long droughts.",

The simulation of precipitation was sensitive to region and season. The model could, to a certain degree, simulate the seasonal migration of rainband in East China. The overall spatial distribution of the simulated soil moisture was better in winter than in summer. The simulation of latent heat flux was also better in winter. In summer, the latent heat flux bias mainly arose from surface evaporation bias in Northwest China, and it primarily arose from vegetation evapotranspiration bias in South China. In addition, the large latent heat flux bias in South China during summer was probably due to less precipitation generated in the model and poor representation of vegetation cover in this region.",

This shows that Dangila areas got more rainfall during this fundamental period than others increasing from Gondar to Dangila direction. Also, the variance in the first harmonic is smaller than the variances of other harmonics, and this means that the large variations of the precipitation originate from higher harmonics (short time periods). This shows that precipitation variations are governed mainly by monthly, seasonal, and semiannual variations. The analysis has shown that maximum precipitation for all stations occurred in July and August.",

The Noah LSM in current NCEP operational NWP models has been using static multiyear averages of monthly GVF derived from satellite observations of NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) normalized difference vegetation index. The multiyear averages of GVF are evidently not the representative of actual conditions of the land surface vegetation cover. This study used a near-real-time (NRT) GVF data set generated from the 8-day composite of the leaf area index product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to assess the impact of NRT GVF on off-line Noah LSM simulations and NWP forecast model. Simulations of the off-line Noah LSM in the Land Information System (LIS) and weather forecasts of the NASA-Unified Weather and Research Forecasting (NUWRF) were obtained using either the static multiyear average AVHRR GVF data set or the NRT MODIS GVF while meteorological forcing data and other settings were kept the same. The off-line simulations and WRF forecasts were then compared against in situ measurements or reanalysis products to assess the impact of using NRT GVF. Improvements of both soil moisture simulations as well as forecasts of 2-meter air temperature and humidity and precipitation from NUWRF were observed using the NRT GVF data products. The RMSE in SM estimates from the off-line Noah model is reduced by around 1.0% (1.41%) during the green-up phase and by 1.48% (2.24%) over the senescence phase for the surface (root zone) SM simulations. Around 82.3% validation sites (out of 1178 sites) showed positive impact on coupled WRF model with the insertion of NRT GVF.",

Results of 19 simulations were compared against observations over 1980–2005. Atmospheric circulation was represented by circulation types and supertypes derived from daily gridded mean sea level pressure. We examined observed and simulated characteristics of hot and cold days (defined using percentiles of temperature anomalies from the mean annual cycle) and heat waves and cold spells (periods of at least three hot/cold days in summer/winter). Although the ensemble of RCMs reproduces on average the frequency and the mean length of heat waves and cold spells relatively well, individual simulations suffer from biases. Most model runs have an enhanced tendency to group hot/cold days into sequences, with several simulations leading to extremely long heat waves or cold spells (the maximum length overestimated by up to 2-3 times). All simulations also produce an extreme winter season with (often considerably) higher number of cold days than in any observed winter. The RCMs reproduce in general the observed circulation significantly conducive to heat waves and cold spells. Zonal flow reduces the probability of temperature extremes in both seasons, while advection of warm/cold air from the south-easterly/north-easterly quadrant plays a dominant role in developing heat waves/cold spells. Because of these links, the simulation of temperature extremes in RCMs is strongly affected by biases in atmospheric circulation. For almost all simulations and all circulation supertypes, the persistence of supertypes is significantly overestimated (even if the frequency of a given supertype is underestimated), which may contribute to development of too-long heat waves/cold spells. We did not identify any substantial improvement in the EURO-CORDEX RCMs in comparison to previous ENSEMBLES RCMs, but the patterns of the biases are generally less conclusive as to general RCMs’ drawbacks.",

The ANN model was regularized and trained using a set of 19,923 data points, observed daily in South Korea between 1960 and 2016. Leave-one-out cross validation was performed to validate the model. When the input data were known at the gauged locations, the correlation coefficient between the observed MDFSA and the estimated one by the ANN model was 0.90. When the input data were spatially interpolated at ungauged locations using the ordinary kriging (OK) method, the correlation coefficient was 0.40. The difference in correlation coefficients between the two methods implies that, while the ANN model itself has good performance, a significant portion of the uncertainty of the estimated MDFSA at ungauged locations comes from high spatial variability of the input variables that cannot be captured by the network of in situ gauges. However, these correlation coefficients were significantly greater than the correlation coefficient obtained by spatially interpolating the MDFSA values with the OK method ( R = 0.20). These findings suggest that our ANN model significantly reduces the uncertainty of the estimated MDFSA caused by its high spatial variability.",

    "abstract": "Based on the daily temperature data from 26 meteorological stations in the Minjiang River Basin, for 1961 to 2016, the temporal trend and spatial distribution of extreme temperature in this region were analyzed using 16 extreme temperature indices. The results show that in terms of time variation, determined using linear trend analysis and a Mann–Kendall trend test, the warm and day indices mainly show an upward trend while the cold and night indices mainly show a downward trend in the entire basin. Among them, FD0, TN10, and CSDI significantly decrease at −1.3, −2.9, and −1.1 d/10a, respectively. TN90, TX90, SU25, and TR20 significantly increase at 3.0, 2.6, 2.1, and 2.2 d/10a, respectively. The crop growth period in the basin showed a significant increasing trend at 1.4 days/decade, while the diurnal temperature range showed a nonsignificant increasing trend at 0.03 days/decade. On comparing the change range of each index, it was found that the change range of the warm index is greater than that of the cold index, while the change range of the day index is smaller than that of the night index; thus, the change trends of the maximum and minimum temperatures in the whole basin are not obvious. Analysis of the changing trend at each station showed that the relative index of the extreme temperature in the basin has good climatic consistency in terms of spatial distribution. The distributions of the absolute and extreme indices are not uniform, which is consistent with the change in elevation in the basin. Further, the diurnal temperature range in the upper reaches of the basin is greater than that in the middle and lower reaches. However, because of the more obvious upward trends of the day and warm indices in the middle and lower reaches, and the more obvious downward trends of the night and cold indices in the upper reaches, the daily temperature differences in the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Minjiang River Basin tend to be consistent. Therefore, the precipitation in the Minjiang River Basin shows a significant decreasing trend; thus, the basin shows a trend of drying and warming.",

The results show that green total factor productivity takes the characteristic of cyclical fluctuation, and the magnitude and its growth rate in the eastern region are higher than those in the midwestern region. The degrees of the governmental and civil environmental regulation and green total factor productivity display single environmental awareness threshold and regulatory foundation threshold. It should be noted that the sign of governmental and civil environmental regulation on green total factor productivity will transform from negative to positive, if and only if threshold variables ascend and surpass the threshold value. Under the condition of metafrontier technology, governmental environmental awareness threshold value, based on the investigated corruption and malpractice cases by the procuratorates among every hundred thousand people, reaches 0.2158, and civil environmental awareness threshold value based on the per capita education level will attain 12.2330 years, and the corresponding regulatory foundation index threshold values are 0.0163 and 0.0154. These findings show clear policy implications: rather than continually promoting the level of governmental environmental regulation, civil performance, environmental awareness, and regulatory foundation should be considered.",

The Belt and Road Initiative has always received much attention due to its special geographical location and great potential for economic development. At the same time, the Belt and Road region is also deeply affected by drought, especially in some countries and regions, where the agricultural infrastructure is weak and the ecological environment is fragile. How to effectively monitor and evaluate drought has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this study, the ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis data were used, and the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index was combined with Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) to study the temporal and spatial distribution of the 1989–2017 monthly scale of drought in different climate regions of the Belt and Road region. The results show that the overall change trend of arid area shows a change of “up-down-up-down.” The winter drought area is larger than the summer drought area, and the drought center gradually moves from the Southeast Asia region in winter to the West–Central Asia region in summer. In the past five years, the drought area decreased gradually at the rate of approximately 0.38 million km 2 per year.",

WRF is used as a regional climate model (RCM) to dynamically downscale reanalysis fields to compare values of SPI over drought timescales that have implications for agriculture and water resources planning. The regional climate generated by WRF has the largest improvement over reanalysis for SPI correlation with observations as the drought timescale increases. This suggests that dynamically downscaled fields may be more reliable than larger-scale fields for water resource applications (e.g., water storage within reservoirs). WRF improves the timing and intensity of moderate to extreme wet and dry periods, even in regions with homogenous terrain. This study also examines changes in SPI from the extreme drought of 1988 and three “drought busting” tropical storms. Each of those events illustrates the importance of using downscaling to resolve the spatial extent of droughts. The analysis of the “drought busting” tropical storms demonstrates that while the impact of these storms on ending prolonged droughts is improved by the RCM relative to the reanalysis, it remains underestimated. These results illustrate the importance and some limitations of using RCMs to project drought.",

Accurate mapping of surface water dynamic is vital for both scientific research and policy-driven applications. MODIS provides twice observation per day, making it perfect for monitoring temporal water dynamic. Although MODIS provides two bands at 250 m resolution, accurately deriving water area always depends on observations from the spectral bands with 500 m resolution, which limits its discrimination ability over small lakes and rivers. The paper presents an automated method for downscaling the 500 m MODIS surface reflectance (SR) to 250 m to improve the spatial discrimination of water body extraction. The method has been tested at Co Ngoin and Co Bangkog in Qinghai-Tibet plateau. The downscaled SR and the derived water bodies were compared to SR and water body mapped from Landsat-7 ETM+ images were acquired on the same date. Consistency metrics were calculated to measure their agreement and disagreement. The comparisons indicated that the downscaled MODIS SR showed significant improvement over the original 500 m observations when compared with Landsat-7 ETM+ SR, and both commission and omission errors were reduced in the derived 250 m water bodies.",

The corresponding satellite datasets, namely, aerosol optical depth (AOD sat ), Ångström exponent, and fine mode fraction, collected from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) as well as the Aeronet ground aerosol optical depth (AOD aeronet ), have been analyzed. Pollutants’ seasonal effect has been inferred from the precipitation and temperature. The four pollutants under study show varying temporal characteristics with different annual mean concentration patterns. The monthly mean of mentioned pollutants all show similar low concentrations during the summer season and high concentrations during the winter season. We found that pollution is strongly linked to temperature and precipitation variability, especially during the fall season. Satellite data analysis provides information on the pollutants origin whether of natural or anthropogenic type. Our results indicate that the anthropogenic aerosol is dominant in the summer season even though the concentration was lower than the other seasons. AOD aeronet and Ångström exponent indicated high positive and negative correlation coefficients with PM 10 , 0.60, and −0.45, respectively.

Although UHIs are often visualized as single features, internal variations within urban landscapes create distinctive microclimates. Evaluating intraurban microclimate variability presents an opportunity to assess spatial dimensions of urban environments and identify locations that heat or cool faster than other locales. Our study employs mobile weather units and fixed weather stations to collect air temperatures across Roanoke, Virginia, USA, on selected dates over a two-year interval. Using this temperature data, together with six landscape variables, we interpolated (using Kriging and Random Forest) air temperatures across the city for each collection period. Our results estimated temperatures with small mean square errors (ranging from 0.03 to 0.14); landscape metrics explained between 60 and 91% of temperature variations (higher when the previous day’s average temperatures were included as a variable). For all days, similar spatial patterns appeared for cooler and warmer areas in mornings, with distinctive patterns as landscapes warmed during the day and over successive days. Our results revealed that the most potent landscape variables vary according to season and time of day. Our analysis contributes new dimensions and new levels of spatial and temporal detail to urban microclimate research.",

The heating of the urban surfaces during the daytime sets the initial temperature, and this overheating is dissipated during the night-time through mean convection motion over the urban surface. This may appear to be in contrast to the classical work by Oke (1973). However, in this work, we show that if the population density is used in converting the population data into urbanized area, then a good agreement with the current theory is found. An additional parameter is the “urban flow parameter,” which depends on the urban building characteristics and affects the horizontal convection of heat due to wind. This scaling can be used to estimate the UHI intensity in any cities and therefore predict the required energy consumption during summer months. In addition, all urbanized surfaces are expected to exhibit this scaling, so that increase in the surface temperature in large energy-consumption or energy-producing facilities (e.g., solar electric or thermal power plants) can be estimated.",

The RMP is forced by future climate scenario, namely, A1B of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The RMP satisfactorily reproduces the observed seasonal mean and variation of surface runoff for the current climate simulation. The distribution of monsoonal precipitation-related runoff is adequately captured by the RMP. In the future (2040–2070) simulation, it is shown that the increasing trend of temperature has significant impacts on the intra-annual runoff variation. The variability of runoff is increased in summer; moreover, the strengthened possibility of extreme occurrence is detected in the future climate. This study indicates that future climate projection, including surface runoff and its variability over Korea, can be adequately addressed on the RMP testbed. Furthermore, this study reflects that global warming affects local hydrological cycle by changing major water budget components. This study adduces that the importance of runoff should not be overlooked in regional climate studies, and more elaborate presentation of fresh-water cycle is needed to close hydrological circulation in RCMs.",

This event formed out of the strong ridge that was associated with the devastating drought in the Western United States during the winter season of 2013-2014. This blocking event had many outstanding dynamical characteristics, the chief of which was that it survived an abrupt change in the planetary-scale flow when the Pacific North American pattern index changed from positive to negative in early February. The block then reintensified and persisted into mid-February. Several diagnostic techniques are employed to investigate the change in the planetary-scale flow during early February 2014 that have been applied to blocking before but aren’t as well known in the blocking literature.",

The involved input parameters are surface net radiation, land surface temperature, near-surface air temperature, and soil heat flux, all of which are retrievals or products of the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Field observations are used as ground references, which were obtained from six eddy covariance (EC) sites with different land covers including desert, Gobi, village, orchard, vegetable field, and wetland. Our results show that the accuracy of LE retrievals varies with EC sites with a determination of coefficient from 0.02 to 0.76, a bias from −221.56 W/m 2 to 143.77 W/m 2 , a relative error from 8.82% to 48.35%, and a root mean square error from 67.97 W/m 2 to 239.55 W/m 2 . The error mainly resulted from the uncertainties from MODIS products or the retrieval of net radiation and soil heat flux in nonvegetated region. It highlights the importance of accurate retrieval of the input parameters from satellite data, which are the ongoing tasks of remote sensing community.",

Through the panel analysis, population growth, road construction, salary increment per capita, and secondary industry product increment were proven to be the major driving factors for national-scale urban expansion. According to Seventh Five-Year Plan, China had been divided into three regions, Eastern China, Middle China, and Western China, by their geographic position and economic development. We studied the relationship between urban expansion and the driving factors for the three regions between 1990 and 2010 in China. The driving factors of urban expansion were different for the different regions and periods. Population growth and road construction were identified as the two major factors driving urban expansion for Eastern China. Secondary industry and economic development had become the major driving factors for urban expansion over the last twenty years in Middle China. Over the same period, for Western China, economic growth had become the major driving factor for urban expansion. Our results have significant policy implications for China. The macrocontrol of the central government should utilize different policies to adjust urban expansion in the different regions.",

Regional trend analysis confirmed the province-wide decrease, which was detected by the site-specific analysis, but a greater number of significant declines were found for annual, summer, and autumn precipitation for Liaoning province and for three of its four subregions. Four significant cycles with alternation patterns were detected mainly at the time scales of 3–5, 10-11, 20–23, and 31.2 years for each of the four subregions (Liaodong Peninsula, Northeastern Mountain, Western Highland, and Central Plain) and the entire Liaoning province, with the dominant periodicities being 10-11 years. The 10-11-year periodic variation of Liaoning annual precipitation was negatively associated with sunspot activity and positively associated with the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) at the same time scale, while the 31.2-year periodic variation of Liaoning annual precipitation was positively correlated with both the EASM and ENSO activities at the 30–33-year time scale.",

The Egyptian code of practice for designing potable water and sewage networks gives two Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) equations to calculate the intensity of rainfall to be applied to all cities of Egypt. The purpose of this research is to study and assess the adequacy of the rainfall intensity equations suggested by the aforementioned Egyptian code. This is carried out taking into consideration the available rainfall ground station measurements and remote sensing Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) satellite rainfall estimates. This assessment leads to the following results. For the Mediterranean coastal cities, the code of practice equations significantly underestimates the rainfall intensities for all storm durations, which may lead to road networks damage and accidents due to hydroplaning and road flooding. On the contrary, for many other southern cities along the Nile Valley, the code equations significantly overestimate the rainfall intensities, which affects the economical aspect of the sewage network. Consequently, the current research suggests new rainfall intensity equations instead of the code equations.",

The results indicated that a steady trend in ET was detected over the past decade.

Case studies using the WRF model and in situ aircraft observations indicate that the streaks originate from boundary layer rolls generated over the convective air above Swedish mainland, also supported by visual satellite images showing the typical signature cloud streets. The simulations indicate that the rolls are advected and maintained at least 30–80 km off the coast, in agreement with the streaks observed by the SAR images. During evening when the convective conditions over land diminish, the streaky structures over the sea are still seen in the horizontal wind field; however, the vertical component is close to zero. Thus advected feature from a land surface can affect the wind field considerably for long times and over large areas in coastal regions. Although boundary layer rolls are a well-studied feature, no previous study has presented results concerning their persistence during situations with advection to a strongly stratified boundary layer. Such conditions are commonly encountered during spring in coastal regions at high latitudes.",

The stations with freezing rain over 100 station-hours are mainly concentrated at the southeast areas of Southwest China and high-elevation mountainous areas of Eastern China. There are mainly two types of freezing rain temperature profiles, including single-warm-layer profile and double-warm-layer profile. The freezing rain profiles of mountainous area and urban area in Southwest China are similar to each other, and the freezing rain in Central and East China shares the similar single-warm-layer profile. The profiles in South China show the characteristics of freezing rain’s profile in both Southwest China and Central/East China as the position of stations. PA of freezing rain’s profiles is negatively correlated with NA, with correlation coefficients ranging from −0.36 to −0.70. The configuration of weak cold/warm layer (both smaller than 150°C·hPa) is one of major reasons causing frequent freezing rain at mountainous areas of Southwest China. The more obvious the change of NA with the variations of PA is, the more the freezing rain is likely to occur.",

The duration of wet spells in the model data is compared with observations for the base period 1971–2000. The impact of climate change on the durations of wet and dry spells is obtained using three global climate models projections with RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios downscaled by RCM. The probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the climate model scenarios and the precipitation records for the base period prove that climate change has a clear impact on the durations of wet and dry spells over the study area. There is an increase in wet spells frequency in the far future (2070–2099) compared to the near future (2020–2049).

The effectiveness and the ability of SMAI to recognize drought events were analyzed, while the vegetation condition index (VCI) was used to characterize the vegetation status. Temporal and spatial variations of soil drought and vegetation condition as well as the impacts of drought on vegetation in North China during 2001–2015 were comprehensively examined. We firstly concluded that SMAI related well with standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), and drought events can be detected by SMAI. Next, the mean value of SMAI in North China showed a decreasing trend in recent 15 years. Finally, the SMAI positively correlated with VCI in most areas of North China, and the response of four types of vegetation to SMAI differed over time. The results of SMAI on vegetation would assist drought research and application in North China.",

During the study period (1961–2011), warming trends in extreme temperatures were generally manifested by statistically significant increases in cold temperature extremes rather than in the warm temperature extremes. As expected, warm days and nights became more frequent, while fewer cold days and nights occurred. The frequency of frost and icing days also decreased. Finland experienced more (less) frequent warm (cold) temperature extremes over the past few decades. Interestingly, significant lengthening in cold spells was observed over the upper part of northern Finland, while no clear changes are found in warm spells. Interannual variations in the temperature indices were significantly associated with a number of NHTPs. In general, warm temperature extremes show significant correlations with the East Atlantic and the Scandinavia patterns and cold temperature extremes with the Arctic Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation patterns.",

Most of these studies have used least squares regression models built from those variables and have demonstrated partial improvement in the downscaled SM. This study introduces a new downscaling method based on support vector regression (SVR) that includes the geophysical variables with locational weighting. Regarding the in situ SM, the SVR downscaling method exhibited a smaller root mean square error, from 0.09 to 0.07 m 3 ·m −3 , and a larger average correlation coefficient increased, from 0.62 to 0.68, compared to the conventional method. In addition, the SM downscaled using the SVR method had a greater statistical resemblance to that of the original advanced scatterometer SM. A residual magnitude analysis for each model with two independent variables was performed, which indicated that only the residuals from the SVR model were not well correlated, suggesting a more effective performance than regression models with a significant contribution of independent variables to residual magnitude. The spatial variations of the downscaled SM products were affected by the seasonal patterns in temperature-vegetation relationships, and the SVR downscaling method showed more consistent performance in terms of seasonal effect. Based on these results, the suggested SVR downscaling method is an effective approach to improve the spatial resolution of satellite SM measurements.",

Statistical analysis shows an important sensitivity of cocoa production to rainfall conditions in all regions. It is worth noting that only the major rainy season from April to July and the rainfall amount of the little dry season from August to September affect the cocoa production for an 80% confidence level. This influence varies from one cacao production area to another. Moreover, the effects related to temperature on the cocoa yield seem to represent a smaller contribution of climate impact than those related to precipitation during the studied period. The temperature change remains in the acceptable range of values, between 25°C and 29°C, which is a favorable condition for cocoa growing. These findings are obtained despite the significant contributions from nonclimatic factors, to year-to-year variability in cocoa production.",

Analyses of SPEI trends in individual months showed a decreasing trend of drought occurrences during the cold months of the year (i.e., October to March), while an increasing trend was indicated from April to August. The evaluation of the impact of drought on agricultural production based on the oilseed rape yield indicated that drought represents a significant natural risk for the agrarian sector of the region. In addition, August value of the SPEI for six months was evaluated as a good indicator of drought impacts on agriculture. The trend analyses revealed no significant increase of drought impacts on agricultural production within the studied period.",

In this paper, the results of FY-3C GPS RO atmospheric sounding are presented for the first time, including high-order ionospheric correction, atmospheric parameters estimation, and evaluation by COSMIC and radiosonde observations as well as applications in estimating gravity wave activities. It is found that the effect of the ionospheric correction residual on the phase delay is below 20 mm, which has minimal impact on bending angle estimation and generates differences of about 1 K in the average temperature profile. The difference between FY-3C and COSMIC temperatures at all heights is within 1°C, and the tropopause temperature and height have a good consistency. Deviations from Radiosonde measurements are within 2°C, and the tropopause temperature and height results also have a strong consistency. Furthermore, global gravity wave potential energy is estimated from FY-3C GPS RO, exhibiting similar behavior to results derived from COSMIC radio occultation measurements. The mean value of the gravity wave potential energy near the equator is 10 J/kg and decreases toward the two poles while in the northern hemisphere, it is stronger than that in the southern hemisphere.",

    "abstract": "Using almost 10 years of observations of clouds and aerosols from the US Southern Great Plains (SGP) atmospheric observatory and the Semi-Arid Climate and Environment Observatory of Lanzhou University (SACOL) in China, the impact of aerosols on single-layer overcast clouds over continental land for different regimes were investigated. Atmospheric conditions at the two sites were first compared in an attempt to isolate the influence of aerosols on cloud properties from dynamic and thermodynamic influences. Cloud types and amounts are similar at the two sites. The dominant aerosol types at the SGP and SACOL sites are sulphate and dust, respectively, with greater aerosol optical depths (AODs) and absorption at the SACOL site. Aerosol first indirect effect (FIE) ranges from 0.021 to 0.152 and from −0.078 to 0.047 at the SGP and SACOL sites, respectively, when using the AOD below cloud base as CCN proxy. Although differences exist, the influence of meteorological conditions on the FIE at the two sites is consistent. FIEs are easily detected under descending motion and dry condition. The FIE at the SGP site is larger than that at the SACOL site, which suggests that the cloud albedo effect is more sensitive under relatively cleaner atmospheric conditions and the dominating aerosol at the SACOL site has less hygroscopicity. The radiative forcing of the FIE over the SGP site is −3.2 W m −2 for each 0.05 increment in FIE. Cloud durations generally prolong as aerosol loading increases, which is consistent with the hypothesis of the aerosol second indirect effect. The negative relationship between cloud duration time and aerosol loading when aerosol loading reaches a large value further might suggest a semidirect effect.",

The results revealed the following features: (1) The temperature increased when the land-use intensity increased via a hierarchical transition owing to grass and forest land reductions of 26.25% and 11.74%, respectively; built-up land increased by 48.45%. (2) The temperature increase was driven more by the external environment than by land-use intensity changes.

Extending from previous studies, the background of the encounter and overlap of multitimescales of meteorological dry/wet episodes for several severe drought and flood events were discussed. In addition, the possible impacts of temperature changes on dry/wet variability were also examined by the comparison of SPEI and standardized precipitation index (SPI) variations at multitimescales during the study period. Major results show that the occurrence of dry/wet condition has become increasingly frequent in the recent two decades, especially the extreme wet episodes in 1990s and the extreme dry episodes in 2000s. Historically, the encounter and overlap of multitimescales of meteorological dry/wet episodes plays an important role in the occurrence of several severe drought and flood events. The study concluded that the impact of temperature anomaly to the dry/wet variability cannot be neglected.",

The SM increased from surface layer to deeper layer in general. The variation trends basically showed consistencies at all depths. The simulated SM of summer demonstrated different responses to the precipitation variation. The variation distribution of SM and measured precipitation had consistencies.

    "abstract": "Precipitation is one of the important water supplies in the arid and semiarid regions of northwestern China, playing a vital role in maintaining the fragile ecosystem. In remote mountainous area, it is difficult to obtain an accurate and reliable spatialization of the precipitation amount at the regional scale due to the inaccessibility, the sparsity of observation stations, and the complexity of relationships between precipitation and topography. Furthermore, accurate precipitation is important driven data for hydrological models to assess the water balance and water resource for hydrologists. Therefore, the use of satellite remote sensing becomes an important means over mountainous area. Precipitation datasets based on station data or pure satellite data have been increasingly available in spite of several weaknesses. This paper evaluates the usefulness of three precipitation datasets including TRMM 3B43_V6, 3B43_V7, and Asian Precipitation Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation with rain gauge data over Tianshan mountainous area where precipitation data is scarce. The results suggest that precipitation measurements only provided accurate information on a small scale, while the satellite remote sensing of precipitation had obvious advantages in basin scale or large scale especially over remote mountainous area.",

In this study, we simulated these processes with fine resolution at basin scale using MicroMet/SnowModel and SnowAssim. To assimilate snow water equivalent (SWE) data in SnowAssim, we used routine daily snow depth data and Sturm’s method. Following the verification of this method for SWE estimation in the basin, we evaluated the impact of snow data assimilation on basin-scale snow ablation. Through validation against MODIS snow coverage data and in situ snow survey observations, we found that SnowAssim could not improve on the original simulation by MicroMet/SnowModel because of estimation errors within the SWE data. Vegetation and accumulated snowfall control the spatial distribution of sublimation and we established that sublimation has an important effect on snow ablation. We found that the ratio of sublimation to snowfall in forests was around 26% and that interannual variation of sublimation modulated spring river runoff.",

The historical evidence points to the conclusion that the eruption was followed by an abrupt cooling period and epidemic outbreaks in 1601 AD within both China and the Korean Peninsula. These records manifested themselves in unseasonably cold weather resulting in severe killing frosts in northern China in the summer and autumn of 1601 AD. In southern China (Zhejiang and Anhui Provinces and Shanghai Municipality), July was abnormally cold with snow, with an autumn that saw anomalously hot weather. In addition, there was unseasonable snowfall that autumn within Yunnan Province. Widespread disease outbreaks occurred in August, September, and October in northern and southern China.

Results showed that increasing resolution evidently changes simulated SATs with regional characteristics. For example, simulated SATs are apparently better produced when horizontal resolution increases from 60 to 30 km under the 23 layers. Meanwhile, the SATs over the entire area are more sensitive to vertical resolution than horizontal resolution. The subareas present higher sensitivities than the total area, with larger horizontal resolution effects than those of vertical resolution. For precipitation, increasing resolution shows higher impact compared to SAT, with higher sensitivity induced by vertical resolution than by horizontal resolution, especially in rainy South China. The best SAT/precipitation can be produced only when the horizontal and vertical resolutions are reasonably configured. This indicates that different resolutions lead to different atmospheric thermodynamic states. Because of the dry climate and low soil heat capacity in Northern China, resolution changes easily modify surface energy fluxes, hence the SAT; due to the rainy and humid climate in South China, resolution changes likely strongly influence grid-scale structure of clouds and therefore precipitation.",

The mean AMDSL values increase from the west to the east of the WRB, suggesting a high dry risk in the east compared to the west in the WRB. To investigate the regional frequency more reasonably, the WRB is clustered into four homogenous subregions via the K -means method and some subjective adjustments. The goodness-of-fit test shows that the GEV, PE3, and GLO distribution can be accepted as the “best-fit” model for subregions 1 and 4, subregion 2, and subregion 3, respectively. The quantiles of AMDSL under various return levels figure out a similar spatial distribution with mean AMDSL. We also find that the dry risk in subregion 2 and subregion 4 might be higher than that in subregion 1. The relationship between ENSO events and extreme dry spell events in the rainy season with cross wavelet analysis method proves that ENSO events play a critical role in triggering extreme dry events during rainy season in the WRB.",

The focuses of this study were to investigate (1) the diurnal and seasonal variations of canopy resistance and fluxes of sensible heat and water vapor above this forest; and (2) the mechanism of why a fixed canopy resistance could work when implementing the Penman–Monteith equation for diurnal hourly evapotranspiration estimation. Our results showed distinct seasonal variations in canopy resistance and water vapor flux, but on the contrary, the sensible heat flux did not change as much as the water vapor flux did with seasons. The seasonal variation patterns of the canopy resistance and water vapor flux were highly coupled with the meteorological factors. Also, the results demonstrated that a constant (fixed) canopy resistance was good enough for estimating the diurnal variation of evapotranspiration using Penman–Monteith equation. We observed a canopy resistance around 190 (s/m) for both the two warm seasons; and canopy resistances were around 670 and 320 (s/m) for the two cool seasons, respectively. In addition, our analytical analyses demonstrated that when the average canopy resistance is higher than 200 (s/m), the Penman–Monteith equation is less sensitive to the change of canopy resistance; hence, a fixed canopy resistance is suitable for the diurnal hourly evapotranspiration estimation. However, this is not the case when the average canopy resistance is less than 100 (s/m), and variable canopy resistances are needed. These two constraints (200 and 100) were obtained based on purely analytical analyses under a moderate meteorological condition ( R n = 600 W·m −2 , RH = 60%, T a = 20°C, U = 2 m·s −1 ) and a measurement height around two times of the canopy height.",

    "abstract": "Global climate change is becoming an increasingly important issue that threatens the imperiled planet. Quantifying the impact of climate change on the streamflow has been an essential task for the proper management of water resources to mitigate this impact. This study aims to evaluate the skill of an artificial neural network (ANN) method in downscaling precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature and assess the potential impacts of climate change on the streamflow in the Wabash River Basin of the Midwestern United States (U.S.) using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). A statistical downscaling technique based on an ANN method was employed to estimate precipitation and temperature at a higher resolution. The downscaled climate projections from five general circulation models (GCMs) under the three representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (i.e., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) for the periods of 2026–2050 and 2075–2099 as well as the historical period were incorporated into the SWAT model to assess the potential impact of climate change on the Wabash River regime. Calibration and validation of the SWAT model indicated the streamflow simulations matched the observed results very well. The ANN method successfully reproduced the observed maximum/minimum temperature and precipitation; however, bias in precipitation was observed in regard to the frequency distribution. Compared with the simulated streamflow in the historical period, the predicted streamflow based on the RCP scenarios showed an obvious decreasing trend, where the annual streamflows will be decreased by 13.00%, 17.59%, and 6.91% in the midcentury periods and 25.29%, 27.61%, and 15.04% in the late-century periods under the RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. Climate warming dominated the streamflow decrease under the RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios. By contrast, under RCP8.5, the streamflow was affected by the joint actions of changes in temperature and precipitation.",

    "abstract": "Recognizing the importance and challenges inherent in the remote sensing of precipitation in typhoon monitoring, a study of the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) data from Feng-Yun 4A on typhoon precipitation was conducted. First, Typhoon Maria was selected to statistically analyze the AGRI infrared brightness temperature in the “precipitation” and “nonprecipitation” channels of the field of view. When there was precipitation, the brightness temperature of the AGRI channel changed significantly. Second, the shrunken locally linear embedding algorithm (SLLE) was adopted to carry out the retrieval of precipitation based on the brightness temperatures of AGRI infrared channels 8–14. The contribution rate of the brightness temperature at different channels to the objective function of precipitation retrieval model was obtained by the Bayesian model averaging (BMA). Based on the preliminary experimental “quantification” evaluation index, we concluded that the method adopted in this paper can be used to retrieve precipitation in infrared data and to retrieve the spiral cloud rain bands of a typhoon. Finally, based on the AGRI channel brightness temperature of a 10.8-micron window channel, we applied the membership degree information of a typhoon’s dominant cloud system from the fuzzy c -means (FCM) clustering method to modify precipitation retrieval results. The results were used to obtain the main morphological structure of typhoon precipitation. By further analyzing the temporal variation of dominant cloud system development using the FCM method, we concluded that the brightness temperature gradient can assist in the analysis of the variation of a typhoon’s intensity. This method can be applied to the continuous retrieval of large-scale precipitation. Precipitation retrieval via the AGRI can yield indicators for typhoon precipitation warnings and forecasts, thus providing a reliable reference tool for disaster prevention and mitigation.",

    "abstract": "Simulations with four land surface models (LSMs) (i.e., Noah, Noah-MP, Noah-MP with ground water GW option, and CLM4) using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at 12 km horizontal grid resolution were carried out as two sets for 3 months (December–February 2011/2012 and July–September 2012) over West Africa. The objective is to assess the performance of WRF LSMs in simulating meteorological parameters over West Africa. The model precipitation was assessed against TRMM while surface temperature was compared with the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset. Results show that the LSMs performed differently for different variables in different land-surface conditions. Based on precipitation and temperature, Noah-MP GW is overall the best for all the variables and seasons in combination, while Noah came last. Specifically, Noah-MP GW performed best for JAS temperature and precipitation; CLM4 was the best in simulating DJF precipitation, while Noah was the best in simulating DJF temperature. Noah-MP GW has the wettest Sahel while Noah has the driest one. The strength of the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) is strongest in Noah-MP GW and Noah-MP compared with that in CLM4 and Noah. The core of the African Easterly Jet (AEJ) lies around 12°N in Noah and 15°N for Noah-MP GW. Noah-MP GW and Noah-MP simulations have stronger influx of moisture advection from the southwesterly monsoonal wind than the CLM4 and Noah with Noah showing the least influx. Also, analysis of the evaporative fraction shows sharp gradient for Noah-MP GW and Noah-MP with wetter Sahel further to the north and further to the south for Noah. Noah-MP-GW has the highest amount of soil moisture, while the CLM4 has the least for both the JAS and DJF seasons. The CLM4 has the highest LH for both DJF and JAS seasons but however has the least SH for both DJF and JAS seasons. The principal difference between the LSMs is in the vegetation representation, description, and parameterization of the soil water column; hence, improvement is recommended in this regard.",

The potential for water harvesting in the Upper Blue Nile Basin was assessed using two GIS-based Multicriteria Evaluation methods: (1) a Boolean approach to locate suitable areas for in situ and ex situ systems and (2) a weighted overlay analysis to classify suitable areas into different water harvesting suitability levels. The sensitivity of the results was analyzed to the influence given to different constraining factors. A large part of the basin was suitable for water harvesting: the Boolean analysis showed that 36% of the basin was suitable for in situ and ex situ systems, while the weighted overlay analysis showed that 6–24% of the basin was highly suitable. Rainfall has the highest influence on suitability for water harvesting. Implementing water harvesting in nonagricultural land use types may further increase the benefit. Assessing water harvesting suitability at the larger catchment scale lays the foundation for modeling of water harvesting at mesoscale, which enables analysis of the potential and implications of upscaling of water harvesting practices for building resilience against climatic shocks. A complete water harvesting suitability study requires socioeconomic analysis and stakeholder consultation.",

    "abstract": "Remote sensing data for space-time characterization of wind fields in extensive oceanic areas have been shown to be increasingly useful. Orbital sensors, such as radar scatterometers, provide data on ocean surface wind speed and direction with spatial and temporal resolutions suitable for multiple applications and air-sea studies. Even considering the relevant role of orbital scatterometers to estimate ocean surface wind vectors on a regional and global scale, the products must be validated regionally. Six different ocean surface wind datasets, including advanced scatterometer (ASCAT-A and ASCAT-B products) estimates, numerical modelling simulations (BRAMS), reanalysis (ERA5), and a blended product (CCMP), were compared statistically with in situ measurements obtained by anemometers installed in fifteen moored buoys in the Brazilian margin (8 buoys in oceanic and 7 in shelf waters) to analyze which dataset best represents the wind field in this region. The operational ASCAT wind products presented the lowest differences in wind speed and direction from the in situ data (0.77 ms−1 &lt; RMSEspd &lt; 1.59 ms−1, 0.75 &lt; Rspd &lt; 0.96, −0.68 ms−1 &lt; biasspd &lt; 0.38 ms−1, and 12.7° &lt; RMSEdir &lt; 46.8°). CCMP and ERA5 products also performed well in the statistical comparison with the in situ data (0.81 ms−1 &lt; RMSEspd &lt; 1.87 ms−1, 0.76 &lt; Rspd &lt; 0.91, −1.21 ms−1 &lt; biasspd &lt; 0.19 ms−1, and 13.7° &lt; RMSEdir &lt; 46.3°). The BRAMS model was the one with the worst performance (RMSEspd &gt; 1.04 m·s−1, Rspd &lt; 0.87). For regions with a higher wind variability, as in the southern Brazilian continental margin, wind direction estimation by the wind products is more susceptible to errors (RMSEdir &gt; 42.4°). The results here presented can be used for climatological studies and for the estimation of the potential wind power generation in the Brazilian margin, especially considering the lack of availability or representativeness of regional data for this type of application.",

    "abstract": "The definition of drought is very controversial due to its multi-dimensional impact and slow propagation in onset and end. Predicting the accurate occurrence of drought remains a challenging task for researchers. The study focused on hydrological and meteorological drought monitoring and trend analysis in the Abbay river basin, using the streamflow drought index (SDI), standardized precipitation index (SPI), and reconnaissance drought index (RDI), respectively, to fill this research gap. The study also looked into the interrelationships between the two drought indicators. The SDI, SPI, and RDI were calculated using long-term streamflow, precipitation, and temperature data collected from 1973 to 2014. The data were collected from eight streamflow stations and fifteen meteorological gauge stations. DrinC software (Drought Indices Calculator) was used to calculate the SDI, SPI, and RDI values. The result from meteorological drought using SPI12 and RDI12 shows that 1975, 1981, 1984, 1986, 1991, 1994, and 2010 were extreme drought years, whereas 1983, 1984, 2001, and 2010 were the most extreme hydrological drought years based on the SDI12 result. Except for Bahir Dar and Gondar, a severe drought occurs at least once a decade in all stations considered in this study. In general, the SPI, RDI, and SDI results indicated that the study area was exposed to the most prolonged severe and extreme drought from 1981 to 1991. The findings of this study also demonstrated that the occurrence of hydrometeorological droughts in the Abbay river basin has a positive correlation at long time scales of 6 and 12 months. The trend analysis using the Mann–Kendall test implied that there was a significant meteorological drought trend in two stations (Debre Berhan and Fiche) at SPI12 and RDI12 time scale, but for the remaining thirteen stations, there is no trend in all time scales. The hydrological drought trend analysis in the basin on a seasonal (SDI3) and yearly (SDI12) time scale also revealed that three streamflow stations have a positive trend (Kessie, Gummera, and Border). This implies that water resource management is still a vital tool for the sustainable development of the Abbay river basin in the future.",

The possibility of exploiting the full resolution of MERIS data in retrieving AOD over a grid of a few hundreds metres was thereby investigated for the first time. MERIS‐based AOD, centred at 560 nm, showed strong positive correlation to ground‐based PM 10 data ( R 2 = 0.85), while MODIS AOD products were in agreement with both MERIS and PM 10 . Back trajectories were used to study the impact of atmospheric conditions prevailing during the examined days. Days associated with Saharan air masses corresponded to enhanced AOD and predominance of coarse‐mode particles. The results suggest that, at least for the case of Athens, AOD retrieved by MERIS images using the DTA code over cloud‐free areas can be related to PM 10 . The accuracy of retrieval mainly depends on the successful selection of the reference satellite data, namely, an image being least contaminated by tropospheric aerosols.",

Two sets of SCAM simulations were performed at the Xinghai station that is located near the center of the TP Sanjiang (three rivers) Nature Reserve where the downward LAI trend is largest. These simulations were forced with the high and low LAIs. The modeling results indicate that, when the LAI changes from high to low, the daytime temperature has a slight decrease, while the nighttime temperature increases significantly, which is consistent with the observations. The modeling results further show that the lower surface roughness length plays a significant role in affecting the nighttime temperature increase.",

The impact of Tropical Storm Bopha (2006, 10W) on Saomai is regarded as a binary tropical cyclone (TC) interaction. In order to quantify the influence of Bopha on the intensity of Saomai, a set of numerical experiments are performed by artificially modifying the intensity of Bopha in its initial conditions. It is shown that changing the intensity of Bopha has significant effects on simulating Saomai’s intensities, structures, and tracks. We find that moisture transport is a pivotal process of binary TC interaction. It is interesting that there are opposite effects by Bopha at different development stages of Saomai. The existence of Bopha and increasing its intensity would weaken Saomai at its intensifying stage while intensifying Saomai at its weakening stage. A possible explanation of these effects is the direction change of moisture transport from/to Saomai at its intensifying/weakening stages through the channel. It may suggest a significant relevance for operational intensity forecasts under active binary TC interaction.",

    "abstract": "We study the potential value to stakeholders of probabilistic long-term forecasts, as quantified by the mean information gain of the forecast compared to climatology. We use as a case study the USA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) forecasts of 3-month temperature and precipitation anomalies made at 0.5-month lead time since 1995. Mean information gain was positive but low (about 2% and 0.5% of the maximum possible for temperature and precipitation forecasts, resp.) and has not increased over time. Information-based skill scores showed similar patterns to other, non-information-based, skill scores commonly used for evaluating seasonal forecasts but tended to be smaller, suggesting that information gain is a particularly stringent measure of forecast quality. We also present a new decomposition of forecast information gain into Confidence, Forecast Miscalibration, and Climatology Miscalibration components. Based on this decomposition, the CPC forecasts for temperature are on average underconfident while the precipitation forecasts are overconfident. We apply a probabilistic trend extrapolation method to provide an improved reference seasonal forecast, compared to the current CPC procedure which uses climatology from a recent 30-year period. We show that combining the CPC forecast with the probabilistic trend extrapolation more than doubles the mean information gain, providing one simple avenue for increasing forecast skill.",

Satellite-based precipitation data have greatly improved their temporal and spatial resolution in recent years, but the short length of records limited their applications in some fields. This paper compared and evaluated the creditability of using a short period data series to estimate the statistics characteristics of long period data series and investigated the usefulness of TRMM rainfall data for monitoring the temporal and spatial distribution of flood/drought classes by the Z index method in Poyang Lake basin. The results show that (1) the 1998–2010 data series are sufficiently robust to depict the statistics characteristics of long period data; (2) the intra-annual distribution and interannual variability of flood/drought classes based on TRMM rainfall data matched well with the results from rain gauges data; (3) the spatial agreement between TRMM and interpolated gauges rainfall varied with the precipitation characteristics; and (4) TRMM rainfall data described the similar spatial pattern of flood/drought classes with the interpolated gauges rainfall. In conclusion, it is suitable and credible for flood/drought classes evaluation based on the TRMM rainfall data in Poyang Lake basin.",

Besides, the spatial pattern of land cover in China under the three scenarios is consistent on the whole, but with some regional differences. Built-up area will increase rapidly under the three scenarios, while most land cover types will show a decreasing trend to different degrees under different scenarios.

We also explored the relationship between vegetation change trends and climatic and anthropogenic factors. This paper indicated that a large portion of the study area (17%) had experienced a significant vegetation increase at the 0.05 level from 1982 to 2006. The significant vegetation increase showed no positive link with precipitation and was mainly caused by human activities. In or to the south of Horqin Sandy Land, in the Hetao Plain, and at the northern foothills of the YinshanMountain, the significant NDVI increase trends were mainly caused by the increase of the millet yield per unit of cropland. In the east of Ordos Plateau, the significant NDVI increase trends were mainly determined by the fencing and planting of grasses and trees on grassland.",

Relationship between lighting and cloud ice size shows similar features over both continental and oceanic regions. For the first time, we show that total lighting increases with increase in the cloud ice size; attends maximum at certain cloud ice size and then decreases with increase in cloud ice size. Maximum lightning occurred for the mean cloud ice size of around 23–25 µm over the continental region and mean cloud ice size of around 24–28 µm over the oceanic region.

The skill anomaly correlations showed that in some continents the forecasts do not have dependency with changes in the initial conditions. Also, in both seasons the model has a higher skill at the 0-month lead time with the largest spatial biases occurring over the North America, South America, and Oceania. Over the continents the largest biases in the nonlinearity of El Niño minus La Niña events are found over the eastern South Africa, part of Oceania, and central-southeastern parts of South America. During DJF the main biases are related to double-ITCZ, strengthening of SPCZ, and deepening of the Aleutian and Icelandic low pressures. The simulation of a warmer SST on the eastern of most austral oceans, the strengthening (weakening) of the Subtropical (Polar) Jet over the Southern Hemisphere, and the weakening of the zonal circulation near the Antarctic continent are also found in both seasons. Over the central-eastern Equatorial Pacific a cooler bias in SST is found during JJA. These biases are interpreted by analyses of the simulated global mean-state and their impact on the main patterns of variability.",

During this period solar activity has increased, as indicated by shorter solar cycles. The temperature at Svalbard is negatively correlated with the length of the solar cycle. The strongest negative correlation is found with lags 10–12 years. The relations between the length of a solar cycle and the mean temperature in the following cycle are used to model Svalbard annual mean temperature and seasonal temperature variations. Residuals from the annual and winter models show no autocorrelations on the 5 per cent level, which indicates that no additional parameters are needed to explain the temperature variations with 95 per cent significance. These models show that 60 per cent of the annual and winter temperature variations are explained by solar activity. For the spring, summer, and fall temperatures autocorrelations in the residuals exist, and additional variables may contribute to the variations. These models can be applied as forecasting models. We predict an annual mean temperature decrease for Svalbard of °C from solar cycle 23 to solar cycle 24 (2009–20) and a decrease in the winter temperature of °C.",

This paper evaluates Sahel precipitation using the paradigm of the atmospheric centers of action, that is, the extended semipermanent highs and lows that dominate regional circulations and are evident in sea level pressure patterns. We find that Sahel precipitation is significantly influenced by changes in the Azores High and the South Asia Low. Specifically, about 50 percent of the variance of July to September rainfall over the Sahel is explained by changes in the Azores High Longitude position and South Asia Low pressure. In contrast, the contribution of the Southern Oscillation to Sahel precipitation is smaller in comparison. Results presented in this paper suggest that a key test for a climate model in simulating variability of Sahel rainfall is the accuracy with which the model simulates the dynamics of South Asia Low and the Azores High.",

The LUCD model can be subdivided into three modules, namely, economic module, vegetation change module, and agent-based module. The economic module is capable of estimating the demand of land use changes in economic activities maximizing economic utility. A computable general equilibrium (CGE) modeling framework is introduced and an approach to introduce land as a production factor into the economic module is proposed. The vegetation change module provides the probability of vegetation change driven by climate change. The agroecological zone (AEZ) model is supposed to be the optimal option for constructing the vegetation change module. The agent-based module identifies whether the land use change demand and vegetation change can be realized and provides the land use change simulation results which are the underlying surfaces needed by RCM. By importing the RCMs' simulation results of climate change and providing the simulation results of land use change for RCMs, the LUCD model would be compatible with RCMs. The coupled simulation system composed of LUCD and RCMs can be very effective in simulating the land surface processes and their changing patterns.",

Extreme events are identified based on their persistent flow for seven days and more after taking retention time into consideration. The extremely high-streamflow events are associated with the La Niña years; 80% of the high-streamflow events have occurred during La Niña phases. Therefore, a very-significant 80% and above correspondence of the La Niña events and the seasonal streamflow anomalies are found in DJF. Although climate variations have direct relationship with the rainfall, streamflow variations are considered as the surrogates to rainfalls. However, apart from climate variations the anthropogenic and land-use changes also influence streamflow variations. In this study, we have applied multivelocity TOPMODEL approach and residual trend analysis to examine the impact of land-use to the streamflow at the Fazenda Santa Maria gauge stations. However, the model residual trend analysis of the TOPMODEL approach cannot quantify the extent of land-use impact.

    "abstract": "A model was developed for simulating the effects of airborne silver iodide (AgI) glaciogenic cloud seeding using the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model with a modified Morrison cloud microphysics scheme. This model was used to hindcast the weather conditions and effects of seeding for three airborne seeding experiments conducted in 2016. The spatial patterns of the simulated precipitation and liquid water path (LWP) qualitatively agreed with the observations. Considering the observed wind fields during the seeding, the simulated spatiotemporal distributions of the seeding materials, AgI, and snowfall enhancements were found to be reasonable. In the enhanced snowfall cases, the process by which cloud water and vapor were converted into ice particles after seeding was also reasonable. It was also noted that the AgI residence time (&gt;1 hr) above the optimum AgI concentration (10 5 m −3 ) and high LWP (&gt;100 g m −2 ) were important factors for snowfall enhancements. In the first experiment, timing of the simulated snowfall enhancement agreed with the observations, which supports the notion that the seeding of AgI resulted in enhanced snowfall in the experiment. The model developed in this study will be useful for verifying the effects of cloud seeding on precipitation.",

    "abstract": "Severe weather events occur more frequently due to climate change; therefore, accurate weather forecasts are necessary, in addition to the development of numerical weather prediction (NWP) of the past several decades. A method to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts based on NWP is the collection of more meteorological data by reducing the observation interval. However, in many areas, it is economically and locally difficult to collect observation data by installing automatic weather stations (AWSs). We developed a Mini-AWS, much smaller than AWSs, to complement the shortcomings of AWSs. The installation and maintenance costs of Mini-AWSs are lower than those of AWSs; Mini-AWSs have fewer spatial constraints with respect to the installation than AWSs. However, it is necessary to correct the data collected with Mini-AWSs because they might be affected by the external environment depending on the installation area. In this paper, we propose a novel error correction of atmospheric pressure data observed with a Mini-AWS based on machine learning. Using the proposed method, we obtained corrected atmospheric pressure data, reaching the standard of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO; ±0.1 hPa), and confirmed the potential of corrected atmospheric pressure data as an auxiliary resource for AWSs.",

As crops grow, the associated vegetation seriously affects the ability of satellites to retrieve SM data. Here, we collected such data at different growth stages of maize using Bragg and X-Bragg scattering models based on the Freeman–Durden polarization decomposition method. We used the H / A /Alpha polarization decomposition approach to extract accurate threshold values of decomposed scattering components. The results showed that the H and Alpha values of bare soil areas were lower and those of vegetated areas were higher. The threshold values of the three scattering components were 0.2–0.4 H and 7–24° Alpha for the surface scattering component, 0.6–0.9 H and 22–50° Alpha for the volume scattering component, and other values for the dihedral scattering component. The SM data retrieved (using the X-Bragg model) on June 27, 2014, were better than those retrieved at other maize growth stages and were thus associated with the minimum root-mean-square error value (0.028). The satellite-evaluated SM contents were in broad agreement with data measured in situ. Our algorithm thus improves the accuracy of SM data retrieval from synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images.",

    "abstract": "Watershed discharge (WD) in the alpine regions, such as the upper reach of Yarlung Zangbo River Basin (YZRB), China, could have changed severely in response to climate changes. Yet, how hydrometeorological variables varied at different time scales and how WD varied in response to hydrometeorological variables in the alpine regions remained questions to be answered. The ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) method was employed in this study to investigate the nonlinear climate change trends (averaged and extreme states) and the associated multiscale impacts on WD variations over the upper reach of the YZRB during 1961–2009. All investigated hydroclimatic variables, i.e., precipitation, temperature, and WD, were found to be varied nonlinearly with clear multiscale oscillations characterizing great differences in the oscillation periods, corresponding significance levels, and variance contribution rates, among which precipitation posed a weak impact on WD variations, while temperature played a significant role in WD fluctuations. Furthermore, among all temperature extremes, the dominant index affecting WD variations was TXm (annual mean of the daily maximum temperature) but not TXx (annual maximum of the daily maximum temperature) at both interannual and interdecadal scales, which might be caused by that TXx increased evapotranspiration and reduced WD. A significant correlation between temperature (both averaged and partial extreme states) and annual WD at both interannual and interdecadal scales indicated that a synchronous change existed between them. The present study provided first insight into how hydrometeorological variables varied at different time scales and how WD fluctuated in response to hydrometeorological variables over the upper reach of the YZRB, China.",

    "abstract": "Land-use and land cover changes may have important local, regional, and global climatic impacts by modifying the underlying land surface conditions, which in turn influence the exchange of energy and moisture between the land surface and atmosphere. Many studies have shown that urbanization has contributed to climate warming, and the amount of warming has varied. As the capital of China and one of the world’s megacities, Beijing has experienced rapid urbanization over the past 30 years. In this study, we quantitatively investigated the impacts of urbanization on regional temperatures based on observations from meteorological stations and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data and overestimating of the impacts were found. Comparing the temperature trends of land-use types, forest showed stronger inhibitory effects on temperature increase (−0.085°C/10a). Cropland also had a negative effect on climate warming yearly and seasonally, especially in winter (−1.133°C/10a) and spring (−0.299°C/10a). Conversely, the urban area showed strong warming effects (0.438°C/10a). The conversion of cropland to urban land appeared to show the highest warming trend (0.548°C/10a). However, the cooling effect of forest and grassland with high vegetation coverage inhibited climatic warming attributed to rapid urbanization. In addition, planting trees or grass along roadsides and increasing green parks and green roofs can also suppress surface warming. Therefore, the actual warming effects of urbanization on temperatures were overestimated in megacities or urban agglomeration regions. The results showed that the green space and landscape configuration should be considered in urban planning to increase green space and reduce the influence of urban heat island effect.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and complete global solar radiation ( H s ) data at a specific region are crucial for regional climate assessment, crop growth modeling, and all operations that use solar energy. However, in the Minas Gerais state, Southeastern Brazil (SEB), the number of weather stations that measure global solar radiation is scarce, and when it is available, it presents gaps in the time series. An attractive alternative to solve the data gap problem is to estimate global solar radiation using empirical models. In this study, thirteen models based on maximum and minimum air temperatures, precipitation, sunshine duration, and extraterrestrial solar radiation were compared in the daily estimation of H s. Data from 10 weather stations, from 1999 to 2017, located in Minas Gerais were used. Also, cluster analysis was used to group the localities (weather stations) with similar patterns of model performance, climatic classification (Köppen–Geiger and Thornthwaite), and seasonal data variability, considering minimum and maximum air temperatures, precipitation, sunshine duration, and global solar radiation. Although it is apparently simple, studies on this subject are scarce and the few existing ones in Minas Gerais have flaws, which justifies this study. The models were evaluated by root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean bias error (BIAS), Willmott’s index of agreement ( d ), and performance index ( c -index). Models based on sunshine duration, such as those proposed by Ertekin and Yaldiz and by Newland, showed the best performance (average c -index = 0.71). Models based on temperature and precipitation showed the worst results (average c -index = 0.41). Cluster analysis showed that there is a similar pattern between the performance of the models, climatic classification, and seasonal variability of data among the localities of Minas Gerais. In general, models that presented extremely poor performance were formed with weather stations located in the dry zone, but with different climate classification, and models that presented very good (and good) performance were composed by weather stations located in the humid zone (dry subhumid) with the same climate classification and similar seasonal variability. Furthermore, the models based on temperature have a tendency to overestimate radiation values below 10 MJ·m −2 day −1 and to underestimate values higher than 25 MJ·m −2 day −1 . This point is a limitation of the model for estimating global solar radiation below and above these levels, showing the influence of atmospheric systems and atmospheric attenuation mechanisms of global solar radiation.",

The observed particulate-bound PAHs concentrations ranged from 1.63 to 29.83 ng/m 3 , with a mean concentration of 6.03 ng/m 3 . BbF, FLA, and PYR were the predominant compounds. Good correlations were found between individual PAHs and meteorological parameters such as atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, and ambient temperature. The backward trajectory analysis suggested that particulate samples measured at the Mount Heng region were predominantly associated with the air masses from southern China, while the air masses transported over northern and northwestern China had relative higher PAHs concentrations. Based on the diagnostic ratios and factor analysis, vehicular emission, coal combustion, industry emission, and unburned fossil fuels were suggested to be the PAHs sources at Mount Heng site. However, the reactivity and degradation of individual PAHs could influence the results of PAH source profiles, which deserves further investigations in the future.",

To address this challenge, this study considered large-scale processes as RI indicators within tropical cyclone environments. The large-scale processes were identified by formulating composite map types of RI and non-RI storms using NASA MERRA data from 1979 to 2009. The composite fields were formulated by a blended RPCA and cluster analysis approach, yielding multiple map types of RI’s and non-RI’s. Additionally, statistical differences in the large-scale processes were identified by formulating permutation tests, based on the composite output, revealing variables that were statistically significantly distinct between RI and non-RI storms. These variables were used as input in two prediction schemes: logistic regression and support vector machine classification. Ultimately, the approach identified midlevel vorticity, pressure vertical velocity, 200–850 hPa vertical shear, low-level potential temperature, and specific humidity as the most significant in diagnosing RI, yielding modest skill in identifying RI storms.",

Thereafter, the ABM model was built to simulate the impacts of the climate changes on the regional land use changes and agents’ economic benefits. The results showed that the land use changes were mainly characterized by the increase of grassland and decrease of unused land area. Besides, the agents would get more wealth under the scenario without climate changes in the long term, even though the total income is lower than that under the scenario with climate changes. In addition, the sensitivity analysis indicated that the model is sensitive to the climatic conditions, market price of agricultural and animal husbandry products, government subsidies, and cost control.",

Integration of these 10-meter AGL wind data with Ground-Based Velocity Track (GBVTD) wind retrievals derived from LIDAR data provided a time history of the three-dimensional wind field of the tornado. These data indicate a progressive decrease in radial inflow with time and little to no radial inflow near the time the tornado crosses the surface weather station. Anemometer observations suggest that the tangential winds approximate a modified-Rankine vortex outside the radius of maximum winds, suggesting that frictionally induced radial inflow was confined below 10 m AGL.

A NHMM has been applied then to precipitation occurrence associated with the information about atmospheric circulation over Atlantic-European region. The atmospheric circulation is quantified by the first 10 components of the decomposition in the EOFs or MEOFs. The predictors taking into account CWTs for SLP and the first summary variable from a SVD have also been tested. The atmospheric predictors are derived from SLP, geopotential, temperature, and specific and relative humidity at 850 hPa. As a result of analyzing the multitude of the predictors, a statistical method of selection based on the informational content has been achieved. The test of the NHMM performances has revealed that SLP and geopotential at 850 hPa are the best predictors for precipitation.",

However, measurements are time-consuming and ultimately only provide a snapshot of road conditions at the time of the survey. As such, there is a need for surveys to be restricted to a series of specific climatic conditions during winter. Typically, five to six surveys are used, but it is questionable whether the full range of atmospheric conditions is adequately covered. This work investigates the role of statistics in adding value to thermal mapping data. Principal components analysis is used to interpolate between individual thermal mapping surveys to build a thermal map (or even a road surface temperature forecast), for a wider range of climatic conditions than that permitted by traditional surveys. The results indicate that when this approach is used, fewer thermal mapping surveys are actually required. Furthermore, comparisons with numerical models indicate that this approach could yield a suitable verification method for the spatial component of road weather forecasts—a key issue currently in winter road maintenance.",

However, severe low temperature events in winter frequently occurred in midlatitude Eurasia (MEA) in the last decade. Here, we define a new coldness intensity (CI) index for the near-surface based on the amplitude of daily anomalously cold temperatures in winter to demonstrate the CI of the variability of low temperature extremes. The results show that a sign-consistent mode dominates the CI variation in MEA, with a marked intensification during the last decade via empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. This leading mode is significantly related to the frequency of winter extreme events. The associated circulations are characterized by a remarkable anomalous anticyclone in Northwest Eurasia, which induced substantial cold advection in MEA. The widespread intensified CI in MEA is closely linked with strong surface anticyclones and synoptic blocking in the mid-high latitudes (25°E–85°E). Coincidently, positive phase shifts of the first two leading modes of the extratropical circulation, which feature similar blocking-like anomalies in the northwestern Eurasian subarctic, jointly play an important role in the recent frequency of severe winters.",

The proposed methodology was developed based on the landslide susceptibility maps that Korean Forest Service utilizes to identify landslide source areas. Frist, debris flows are propagated to urban areas from such source areas by Flow-R (flow path assessment of gravitational hazards at a regional scale), and then urban vulnerability is assessed by two categories: physical and socioeconomic aspect. The physical vulnerability is related to buildings that can be impacted by a landslide event. This study considered two popular building structure types, reinforced-concrete frame and nonreinforced-concrete frame, to assess the physical vulnerability. The socioeconomic vulnerability is considered a function of the resistant levels of the vulnerable people, trigger factor of secondary damage, and preparedness level of the local government. An index-based model is developed to evaluate the life and indirect damage under landslide as well as the resilience ability against disasters. To illustrate the validity of the proposed methodology, physical and socioeconomic vulnerability levels are analyzed for Seoul, Korea, using the suggested approach. The general trend found in this study indicates that the higher population density areas under a weaker fiscal condition that are located at the downstream of mountainous areas are more vulnerable than the areas in opposite conditions.",

The change points for annual mean and extreme temperature in 44 individual stations and their average were detected by the Mann-Kendall test, respectively. The annual mean temperature changed during 1980s in terms of increased mean value and relative stable standard deviation. The annual maximum temperature from 31 stations mostly located in the central and northwest basin changed significantly, and their change points occurred mainly in 1990s. For the annual minimum temperature, 32 stations mainly located in the central basin had significant changes. The generalized extreme value distribution was fitted to the postchange point subseries of annual extreme temperature and the parameters were estimated by the maximum likelihood method. The 10/50/100-year return levels were estimated by the method of profile likelihood.

In this study, precipitation ensemble forecast products from ECMWF, NCEP, and CMA are used to drive distributed hydrologic model TOPX.

The results show that the meteorologic-hydrologic coupled model can satisfactorily predict the flow-process of four flood events. The predicted occurrence time of peak discharges is close to the observations. However, the magnitude of the peak discharges is significantly different due to various performances of the ensemble prediction systems. The coupled forecasting model can accurately predict occurrence of the peak time and the corresponding risk probability of peak discharge based on the probability distribution of peak time and flood warning, which can provide users a strong theoretical foundation and valuable information as a promising new approach.",

The model was calibrated and validated against observed streamflow over 10 Texas river basins. The simulated soil moisture was also evaluated using in situ observations. Results suggest that there is a decreasing trend in precipitation and an increasing trend in temperature in most of the basins. Droughts and floods were reconstructed and analyzed. In particular, the spatially distributed severity and duration of major Texas droughts were compared to identify new characteristics. The modeled flood recurrence interval and the return period were also compared with observations. Results suggest the performance of extreme flood simulations needs further improvement. This dataset is expected to serve as a benchmark which may contribute to water resources management and to mitigating agricultural drought, especially in the context of understanding the effects of climate change on crop yield in Texas.",

The model is designed as a mean-reverting process driven by a Levy process to represent jumps and other features of temperature. Temperature indices are mainly measured as deviations from a base temperature, and, hence, the proposed model includes jumps because they may constitute an important part of this deviation for some locations. The estimated value of a temperature index and its distribution in this model apply an inversion formula to the temperature model. Second, this study develops a pricing process over calculated index values, which returns a customized price for temperature-based derivatives considering that temperature has unique effects on every economic entity. This personalized price is also used to reveal the trading behavior of a hypothesized entity in a temperature-based derivative trade with profit maximization as the objective. Thus, this study presents a new method that does not need to evaluate the risk-aversion behavior of any economic entity.",

Yi River Basin, a typical river basin characterized by intensive agricultural processes, significant population growth, and water management, has been undergoing grave water problems. In this paper, the long-term trend of precipitation and streamflow in Yi River Basin, from 1964 to 2010, was investigated via Mann-Kendall test. The change point occurred in the year 1965 dividing the long-term series into two periods. Climate elasticity method and linear regression method were implemented to quantify the impact of precipitation and human activities on runoff and presented basically consistent results of the percentage change in an annual runoff for the postchange period. The results reveal that the decline of annual runoff in postchange period is mainly attributed to precipitation variability of 53.66–58.25% and human activities of 46.34–41.74%, as estimated by climate elasticity method and linear regression method, respectively. This study detected the changes in the precipitation-streamflow relationship and investigated the possible causes in the Yi River, which will be helpful for providing a reference for the management of regional water resources.",

Its climate consists of two distinct seasons: the dry season, extending from April to September, the precipitation is significantly reduced in comparison to that of the wet season, which extends from October to March. However, during nine days of the 2016 dry season, successive convective systems were associated with atypical precipitation events, tornadoes and at least one microburst over the southern part of this region. These events led to flooding, damages to buildings, shortages of electricity and water in several places, many injuries, and two documented deaths. The present study investigates the synoptic and dynamical features related to these anomalous events. The convective systems were embedded in an unstable environment with intense low-level jet flow and strong wind shear and were supported by a sequence of extratropical cyclones occurring over the Southwest Atlantic Ocean. These features were intensified by the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO) in its phase 8 and by intense negative values of the Pacific South America (PSA) 2 mode.",

The RSL data are analyzed at different time scales by using long short-term memory (LSTM) network techniques, and then the method for distinguishing parts of the precipitation period by using the RSL from low-frequency MLs is proposed and validated. The results show that wet-dry classification is ideal. The accuracy on each day was higher than 60%, and some days had accuracies that were even higher than 98%.

The driver analysis was carried out in the hot ( Z ≥ 1.64) and cold ( Z ≤ −1.64) spots of AOD in 2010 and 2017.

The average growth rate of biomass densities of bamboo, coniferous forest, and mixed forest were higher than that of the shrub and broad-leaved forest. These findings provided the guidance for the rational allocation of tree species to increase the biomass and improve the ecosystem service values of forest parks.",

    "abstract": "Climate change has emerged as a significant man-made global environmental challenge marked by rising temperature. The global rising temperature is supposed to alter climatic patterns like floods and droughts, thereby affecting human life supporting system and global food production. In order to clarify the impact of weather events on agricultural production in karst landforms, this study selected the indices of the growth period of crops (start time and duration), growing season precipitation, intense precipitation, number of consecutive rainless days, and number of drought-flood abrupt alternation events to evaluate the variation trend of future weather events and their impact on crop growth in Guizhou Province, China. The results show that (1) the climate is generally getting warmer. From 2019 to 2050, the sowing period of winter wheat and rice tends to be postponed. The duration of maize and rice’s growth period will be shortened, and the life cycle of wheat also emerges as having a decreasing tendency except for those from the southern region. Comparing with the mean value during 1961 to 2018, the average crop cycle length of winter wheat, summer maize, and rice was shortened. The rate of shortening of crop cycle length is faster than the value during 1961 to 2018. (2) In the next 30 years, extreme precipitation concentrates in June and mainly falls in the central and southeast parts of Guizhou Province. In addition, summer is the outbreak period of drought events and drought-flood abrupt alternation events, which has a great impact on crop’s growth. This study can provide references for the planting system, structure, layout, and management of crops in the karst region.",

    "abstract": "The Northwest Pacific tropical cyclone (TC) intensification is classified into rapid intensification (RI), normal intensification (NI), and slow intensification (SI) categories. The initial location and intensity, the preceding intensity change, the motion direction, the occurrence month, and the intensification duration time are all found to differ for RI cases compared with NI and SI cases. The dependence of RI, NI, and SI on environmental conditions is further examined statistically by using the intensification rates of named TCs, for the 21-year period 1995–2015, obtained from JTWC best track data, and the environmental conditions derived from the ERA-Interim reanalysis data and GODAS high-resolution global ocean analysis data. It was found that deep-layer and upper-mid vertical wind shear (VWS), upper-level outflow, sea surface temperature (SST), and ocean heat content (OHC) are statistically different among RI, NI, and SI both before and during intensification. RI is enhanced by weaker and decreasing VWS, warmer oceans, and stronger and increasing outflow. In contrast, SI typically occurs with larger and increasing VWS, cooler oceans, and weaker, static outflow. The impacts of low-level VWS and net moisture inflow are only significantly different between RI and SI and between NI and SI, but not between RI and NI. Another key finding is that increased upper-level outflow and decreased VWS are important precursors and hence are possible predictors, of RI onset. The direction of upper-level outflow affects TC intensification, with NW and NE outflow being more favorable for TC RI than SE and SW outflow.",

The one that is known to provide the best fit to the nature of the wind is the Weibull distribution function. It is relatively straightforward to parameterize wind resources with the Weibull function if the distribution fits what the function represents but the estimation process gets complicated if the distribution of the wind is diverse in terms of speed and direction. In this study, data from a 101 m meteorological mast were used to test several estimation methods. The available data display seasonal variations, with low wind speeds in different seasons and effects of a moderately complex surrounding. The results show that the maximum likelihood method is much more successful than industry standard WAsP method when the diverse winds with high percentile of low wind speed occur.",

Significant trends of HCSA intensification and poleward expansion are found during the period analyzed. To evaluate the effects of these changes over SA, two composites, representing the intensification and poleward expansion cases, are examined separately. Significant correlations are seen between the temperature, zonal wind, and the HCSA intensity over the northern, central, and southern regions of SA and South Atlantic. Results show that, in both composites, regions with anomalous easterly (westerly) winds coming from (towards) the Atlantic Ocean have negative (positive) correlations with the HCSA intensity and poleward edge. The model performance varies regionally and the southern SA region exhibits better agreement with the observations. The role of the sea surface temperatures in driving the changes in the HCSA is examined. Notable similarity is found in the results for the two cases analyzed, which could indicate that, in most cases, the changes in the intensity and poleward edge of the HCSA are occurring simultaneously.",

The paper documents the initialization procedures for the decadal prediction experiments and summarizes the predictive skills of the experiments, which are assessed through indicators adopted by the IPCC AR5. The observational anomalies of surface and subsurface ocean temperature and salinity are assimilated through a modified incremental analysis update (IAU) scheme. Three sets of 10-year-long hindcast and forecast runs were started every five years in the period of 1960–2005, with the initial conditions taken from the assimilation runs. The decadal prediction experiment by FGOALS-s2 shows significant high predictive skills in the Indian Ocean, tropical western Pacific, and Atlantic, similar to the results of the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble. The predictive skills in the Indian Ocean and tropical western Pacific are primarily attributed to the model response to the external radiative forcing associated with the change of atmospheric compositions. In contrast, the high skills in the Atlantic are attributed, at least partly, to the improvements in the prediction of the Atlantic multidecadal variability coming from the initialization.",

Under the background of the rapid urbanization, understanding the impacts of land use change on the regional climate change is vital and significant. In this study, we investigated the relationships between land use change and regional climate change through a structural equation model. Southern China was selected as the study area for its rapid urbanization and different structure of land use among its counties. The results indicate that the path coefficients of “vegetation,” “Urban and surrounding area,” and “other” to “climate” are −0.42, 0.20, and 0.46, respectively. Adding vegetation area is the main method to mitigate regional climate change. Urban and surrounding area and other areas influence regional climate by increasing temperature and precipitation to a certain extent. Adding grassland and forestry, restraining sprawl of built-up area, and making the most use of unused land are efficient ways to mitigate the regional climate change in Southern China. The results can provide feasible recommendations to land use policy maker.",

Using available information on documented wildfires and a data set of satellite detected hot spots, total yearly emissions of CO 2 in Mexico were estimated for the period 1999–2010. A map of the main vegetation groups was used to calculate total areas for every vegetation type. The yearly number of hot spots per vegetation type was calculated. Estimates of emitted CO 2 in a wildfire were then accomplished by considering parameters such as: forest fuel load, vegetation type, burning efficiency, and mean burned area. The number of wildfires and total affected areas showed an annual variability. The yearly mean of affected area by a single wildfire varied between 0.2 and 0.3 km 2 . The total affected area during the period 1999 to 2010 was 86800 km 2 which corresponds to 4.3% of the Mexican territory. Total CO 2 emissions were approximately 112 Tg. The most affected vegetation types were forest and rainforest.",

To address this topic, we employ two commonly used EASM indices that can represent zonal and meridional land-sea thermal contrast, respectively. The results reveal that the notion of a weakened EASM in response to increased anthropogenic aerosols is a robust one, as well as decreased precipitation in East China. The ensemble mean of decreased precipitation in the aerosol run was about 6.6% in comparison to the CTL run and could be enlarged to 8.3% by excluding the experiments with the aerosol direct effect only. Convective precipitation was found to be the primary contributor (&gt;80%) to the reduction of total precipitation. The combination of direct and indirect effects of aerosols can decrease solar radiation reaching the Earth’s surface and eventually modulate large-scale EASM circulation and suppress summer precipitation in East China. The uncertainties and discrepancies among the models highlight the complexity of interaction in aerosol-precipitation processes when investigating present and future changes of the EASM.",

The performance is evaluated for a whole year for the surface parameters: temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. The verification has been performed against SYNOP stations over southern Italy. A dense non-GTS network over Calabria is used for precipitation. Results show that RMSE is about 2-3 K for temperature, 12–16% for relative humidity, 2.0–2.8 m/s for wind speed, and 55–75° for wind direction, the performance varying with the season and with the forecasting time. The error increases between the first and third forecast days. The verification of the rainfall forecast shows that the model underestimates the area of the precipitation. The model output statistics (MOS) is applied to all parameters but precipitation.

The potential climate change hotspots in China throughout the 21st century are identified in this study by using a multimodel, multiscenario climate model ensemble that includes Phase Five of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. Both high (RCP8.5) and low (RCP4.5) greenhouse gas emission trajectories are tested, and both the mean and extreme seasonal temperature and precipitation are considered in identifying regional climate change hotspots. Tarim basin and Tibetan Plateau in West China are identified as persistent regional climate change hotspots in both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. The aggregate impacts of climate change increase throughout the 21st century and are more significant in RCP8.5 than in RCP4.5. Extreme hot event and mean temperature are two climate variables that greatly contribute to the hotspots calculation in all regions. The contribution of other climate variables exhibits a notable subregional variability. South China is identified as another hotspot based on the change of extreme dry event, especially in SON and DJF, which indicates that such event will frequently occur in the future. Our results can contribute to the designing of national and cross-national adaptation and mitigation policies.",

The obtained results show that the development of blocking was accompanied by the development of a positive anomaly of total column water vapor (TCWV) content over the northern part of EE. Local TCWV content from 28 July to 6 August 2010 reached 3.35 cm, a value that exceeded by 3.3 times its content before the block. The surplus of WV was mainly conditioned by the advection of WV due to transfer of moist air from the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea into northern EE and also due to increased evaporation from the surface enriched with water due to increased temperature and wind. We hypothesize that the influx of latent heat in the block area can contribute to the energy supply of the blocking anticyclone and prolong the existence of block. Strong humidification of the troposphere and some dehumidification of the lower stratosphere during the block were accompanied by warming of the troposphere and cooling of the lower stratosphere.",

Vegetation was found to have experienced five successions from cold-temperate mixed coniferous and broadleaved forest to forest-steppe, steppe-woodland, steppe, and finally meadow-woodland. From 7800 to 7300 cal yr BP, the study area was warmer than present, and Betula, Larix , and Picea -dominated mixed coniferous and broadleaved forests thrived. Two cooling events at 7300 cal yr BP and 4500 cal yr BP led to a decrease in Betula and other broadleaved forests, whereas herbs of Poaceae expanded, leading to forest-steppe and then steppe-woodland environments. After 2500 cal yr BP, reduced temperatures and a decrease in evaporation rates are likely to have resulted in permafrost expansion and surface ponding, with meadow and isolated coniferous forests developing a resistance to the cold-wet environment. The Holocene warm period in NE China (7800–7300 cal yr BP) could have resulted in a strengthening of precipitation in northernmost NE China and encouraged the development of broadleaved forests.",

The larger disparity of intensity histograms and rainfall fluctuation caused by different model configurations from their mean and/or control run indicates that heavier precipitation forecasts have larger uncertainty. A cross-verification exercise is used to quantify the impacts of different model parameters on heavy precipitation. The dispersion of skill scores with control run used as “truth” shows that the impacts of the model resolution and domain size on the quantitative precipitation forecast are not less than those of perturbed physics and initial field uncertainties in these not intentionally selected heavy precipitation cases . The result indicates that model resolution and domain size should be considered as part of probabilistic precipitation forecasts and ensemble prediction system design besides the model initial field uncertainty.",

Daily maximum air temperature and daily maximum WBGT were used as heat stress indices in each region. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to examine the regional difference in the relationship between the heat disorder incidence rate and heat stress indices in each region. The heat disorder incidence rate was correlated with both indices of heat stress in all regions. However, the more appropriate heat stress index for heat disorder prevention differed among regions. The distributions of heat stress indices, such as the slope of regression curve and the temperature threshold, differed in each region, irrespective of the index used. Therefore, the criteria for thermal conditions for heat disorder prevention need to be determined for each region, considering the regional characteristics of the relationship between the heat disorder incidence rate and heat stress indices.",

Temporal evolution of the spatial mean value shows a very marked annual cycle and a weak warming tendency (0.03437°C/year). Spatial distribution of the long-term mean value shows some more fine spatial structure of SST compared to previous studies. Over 90% of the temporal variability can be explained by the annual harmonic whose amplitude is one order larger than that of the semiannual harmonic. In addition, the annual harmonic amplitude distribution is consistent with that of the value of standard deviation. In order to investigate the interannual variation of SST, the EMSC SST interannual index was constructed. Based on wavelet analysis, a significant peak around 3.3 years was found in the EMSC SST interannual index. Further analysis demonstrated that the interannual variability of SST is linked with El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnection, through which anomalous surface heat flux warms or cools the EMSC during El Niño or La Niña events.",

From the Clausius-Clapeyron relation (CC) it follows that the maximum moisture content of the atmosphere increases by approximately 7% per degree as temperature rises. However, the increases in observed hourly precipitation extremes of approximately two times the CC relation were described recently. This super CC scaling is attributed to the increased prevalence of convective rainfall and decreased prevalence of stratiform rainfall as temperatures increase. We carried out the disaggregation of precipitation into prevailing stratiform and convective component on the observational data from the Czech Republic for 1966–2006. Then, we analyzed trends in characteristics of disaggregated events and assessed correlation of precipitation intensities with daily mean temperature. The results suggest the increasing trend of convective precipitation in summer. The scaling for total rain events is steeper than for the events with prevailing convective component and for the events with prevailing stratiform component. It is a result of mixing of the two storm types. At higher temperature the events with prevailing convective component prevail and vice versa.",

We calculated the correlated coefficient and the root mean square error (RMSE) between phenophases and the beginning of meteorological seasons to determine the beginning date of phenological season. By comparing new phenological calendars with the old ones, we discussed the variation of phenophases and their responses to temperature. The conclusions are as follows. (1) The beginning dates of spring and summer advanced, while those of autumn and winter delayed. Thus, summers got longer and winters got shorter. (2) The beginning time of the four phenological seasons was advancing during 1987–1996, while it was delaying during 2003–2012. (3) Most spring and summer phenophases occur earlier and most autumn and winter phenophases occur later in 2003–2012 than in 1987–1996. (4) The beginning time of phenological seasons was significantly correlated with temperature. The phenological sensitivities to temperature ranged from −6.49 to −6.55 days/°C in spring, −3.65 to −5.02 days/°C in summer, 8.13 to 10.27 days/°C in autumn, and 4.76 to 10.00 days/°C in winter.",

The five sets of assimilated rainfall data were then used as input to the Xinanjiang model. The effect of precipitation data input error on runoff simulation was analyzed quantitatively by disturbing the input data using the Breeding of Growing Modes method. The results of practical application demonstrated that the statistical weight integration and variational assimilation methods were superior. The corresponding performance in flood hydrograph prediction was also better using the statistical weight integration and variational methods compared to the others. It was found that the errors of radar rainfall data disturbed by the Breeding of Growing Modes had a tendency to accumulate through the hydrological model.",

Through the consideration of a novel lodging model representing the motion of an oat plant due to the interaction of wind and rain and integrating future predictions of wind and rainfall due to climate change, appropriate conclusions have been made. In order to provide meteorological data for the lodging model, wind and rainfall inputs are analysed using 30 years’ time series corresponding to peak lodging months (June and July) from 38 meteorological stations in the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic, which enables the relevant probability density functions (PDFs) to be established. Moreover, climate data for the next six decades in the British Isles produced by UK climate change projections (UKCP18) are analysed, and future wind and rainfall PDFs are obtained. It is observed that the predicted changes likely to occur during the key growing period (June to July) in the next 30 years are in keeping with variations, which can occur due to different husbandry treatments/plant varieties. In addition, the utility of a double exponential function for representing the rainfall probability has been observed with appropriate values for the constants given.",

    "abstract": "Soil temperature reflects the impact of local factors, such as the vegetation, soil, and atmosphere of a region. Therefore, it is important to understand the regional variation of soil temperature. However, given the lack of observations with adequate spatial and/or temporal coverage, it is often difficult to use observational data to study the regional variation. Based on the observational data from Nanchang and Ganzhou stations and ERA-Interim/Land reanalysis data, this study analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of soil temperature over Poyang Lake Basin. Four soil depths were examined, 0–7, 7–28, 28–100, and 100–289 cm, recorded as ST1, ST2, ST3, and ST4, respectively. The results showed close correlations between observation data and reanalysis data at different depths. Reanalysis data could reproduce the main spatiotemporal distributions of soil temperature over the Poyang Lake Basin but generally underestimated their magnitudes. Temporally, there was a clear warming trend in the basin. Seasonally, the temperature increase was the most rapid in spring and the slowest in summer, except for ST4, which increased the fastest in spring and the slowest in winter. The temperature increase was faster for ST1 than the other depths. The warming trend was almost the same for ST2, ST3, and ST4. An abrupt change of annual soil temperature at all depths occurred in 1997, and annual soil temperatures at all depths were abnormally low in 1984. Spatially, annual soil temperature decreased with latitude, except for the summer ST1. Because of the high temperature and precipitation in summer, the ST1 values were higher around the lake and the river. The climatic trend of soil temperature generally increased from south to north, which was opposite to the distribution of soil temperature. These findings provide a basis for understanding and assessing the variation of soil temperature in the Poyang Lake Basin.",

Therefore, this study investigates the effects of shading caused by buildings and trees via exhaustive field measurement research on urban outdoor 3D radiant environment and human thermal comfort. We analyzed the characteristics of micrometeorology and human thermal comfort at shaded areas, and compared the difference between building and tree shading effects as well as that between shaded and sunlit sites. The results demonstrate that mean radiant temperature T mrt (mean reduction values of 28.1°C for tree shading and 28.8°C for building shading) decreased considerably more than air temperature T a (mean reduction values of 1.9°C for tree shading and 1.2°C for building shading) owing to shading; furthermore, the reduction effect of shading on UTCI synthesized the variation in the above two parameters. Within the shaded areas, short-wave radiant components (mean standardized values of 0.104 for tree shading and 0.087 for building shading) decreased considerably more than long-wave radiant components (mean standardized values of 0.848 for tree shading and 0.851 for building shading) owing to shading; the proportion of long-wave radiant flux densities absorbed by the reference standing person was high, leading to a relatively high long-wave mean radiant temperature, and R 2 between long-wave mean radiant temperature and air temperature exceeded 0.8. Moreover, the directional sky view factor (SVF) was utilized in this study, and it showed significant positive correlation with short-wave radiant flux densities, but no statistically evident correlation with long-wave radiant flux densities. Meanwhile, T mrt was most relevant with SVF S⟶ with R 2 of 0.9756. Furthermore, UTCI rose two categories at the sunlit areas compared with that at the shaded areas. In contrast, T a and T mrt played the first positive role in UTCI at shaded and sunlit areas, respectively.",

Based on the analyses of the impact of assimilating in situ and Advanced Tiros Operational Vertical Sounder (ATOVS) satellite radiance data on the simulation of near-surface wind during a severe wind event, using the new generation mesoscale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and its three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) data assimilation system, the dynamic downscaling of near-surface wind is further investigated by coupling the microscale California Meteorological (CALMET) model with the WRF and its 3DVAR system. Results indicate that assimilating in situ and ATOVS radiance observations strengthens the airflow across the Alataw valley and triggers the downward transport of momentum from the upper atmosphere in the downstream area of the valley in the initial conditions, thus improving near-surface wind simulations. Further investigations indicate that the CALMET model provides more refined microtopographic structures than the WRF model in the vicinity of the wind towers. Although using the CALMET model achieves the best simulation of near-surface wind through dynamic downscaling of the output from the WRF and its 3DVAR assimilation, the simulation improvements of near-surface wind speed are mainly within 1 m s−1. Specifically, the mean improvement proportions of near-surface wind speed are 64.8% for the whole simulation period, 58.7% for the severe wind period, 68.3% for the severe wind decay period, and 75.4% for the weak wind period. The observed near-surface wind directions in the weak wind conditions are better simulated in the coupled model with CALMET downscaling than in the WRF and its 3DVAR system. It is concluded that the simulation improvements of CALMET downscaling are distinct when near-surface winds are weak, and the downscaling effects are mainly manifested in the simulation of near-surface wind directions.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluated three satellite precipitation products, namely, TRMM, CMORPH, and PERSIANN, over the Three Gorges Reservoir area in China at multiple timescales. The assessment covered the following aspects: the rainfall amount, extreme precipitation, and the rainy-day detection ability. Results indicated that the CMORPH and TRMM estimates of rainfall amount were reasonably good, but the PERSIANN showed a larger bias than the other two satellite products. The data precision of CMORPH was slightly better than TRMM. All three satellite products could reproduce the diurnal cycle of rainfall, i.e., more precipitation in the morning than in the evening. The CMORPH estimates were closest to the gauge observation at 3-hourly and 12-hourly timescales. The data accuracy of CMORPH data was better during the night than in the daytime. At daily timescale, the quality of TRMM data was slightly inferior to the CMORPH, whereas the PERSIANN still differed much from the ground observation. At monthly, seasonally, and yearly timescales, the performance of TRMM was comparable to CMORPH, and both of them were obviously superior to PERSIANN. The rainy-day detection ability of CMORPH and TRMM was much better than PERSIANN. The PERSIANN data tended to overestimate the light rainy days but underestimate the heavy and torrential rainy days. The CMORPH data overestimated mainly the moderate rainy days. The TRMM data overestimated the occurrence frequency of heavy rain during the winter half year (from October to the next March). Both the CMORPH and the TRMM provided good estimates of the regional average rainy days. The data accuracy of CMORPH was slightly better than TRMM, and both were far better than the PERSIANN with respect to the rainfall amount and rainy-day detection. Nevertheless, all satellite estimates showed large biases of extreme precipitation. The CMORPH estimate of the maximum 5-day precipitation was the best of all. Both the CMORPH and TRMM data overestimated the 95th percentile of precipitation, but the PERSIANN data severely underestimated it. The PERSIANN estimates of extreme precipitation amount were the best of all during the daytime, nighttime, and the whole day. The above evaluation results could facilitate the application of satellite rainfall products and provide a reference to precipitation-related studies.",

    "abstract": "The aviation industry has a global economic impact of $2.7 trillion (including direct, indirect, induced, and tourism catalytic effects) and contributes 3.6 percent of global GDP. Weather is one of the most essential elements impacting how an aircraft runs and how safely it can fly. The correlation coefficient is the most significant index explaining the relationship between variables and can result in teleconnection patterns of climate indices. El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and India Ocean Dipole (IOD) were used in this study based on the ERA5 reanalysis dataset for 30 years (1991–2020). Myanmar’s Yangon International Airport has recorded more than 119874 times of observation data from 2009 to 2019. The mean percentage of occurrences of weather elements is calculated for each month and each season. Analysis of flight delay and accident data was obtained statistically from the Aviation Safety Network (ASN). According to the monthly delay index, July, August, and March are the maximum delay index months, and the correlation value between aircraft movement and delays is maximum in July and August and minimum in January and February. After examining numerous characteristics of Yangon International Airport, we identified which elements had a big impact on operations through vital interviews with operators, the accident case study section, and climatology analysis. As a result, we identified two meteorological occurrences: thunderstorm rain (TSRA) and fog (FG) are of high frequency and TSRA poses a larger risk than FG for aviation operation. The maximum frequency (%) of thunderstorm occurrences was 22% in July and the minimum was 1% in January. Annual frequency analysis revealed that TSRA days are becoming more common year after year as a result of global climate change. According to a spatial gridded analysis by ERA5 reanalysis data (1991–2020), the annual convective available potential energy (CAPE) values over local airport regions, the Bay of Bengal (BOB), the western equatorial Pacific, and the South China Sea show a positive correlation with convective rainfall. In contrast, negative convective inhibition (CIN) anomalies have been observed over the same areas as above, except for the western part of BOB along the Indian Coast. The primary innovation is that we look at the effects of thunderstorms on airport operations before determining their link with ENSO and the IOD individually and then combining them during their full phases. This raises a new question and a new possibility for viewing climatology from a new perspective.",

Future changes in temperature, precipitation, and runoff from 2021 to 2050 in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River were analyzed using a distributed hydrological model, the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), under a future climate scenario. Simultaneously, future variation characteristics of extreme climate hydrological elements in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River were analyzed using extreme climate and runoff indicators. The research shows that the frequency and intensity of the extreme temperature warming index will increase, while those of the extreme temperature cooling index will increase and then weaken in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River under a future climate scenario. The duration of precipitation, the intensity of continuous heavy precipitation, and the frequency of heavy precipitation will increase, whereas the intensity of short-term heavy precipitation and the frequency of heavy precipitation will decrease. However, spatial distribution of flood in the upper reaches is different, and thus flood risk in the upstream source area will still tend to increase. Particular attention should be given to the increase in autumn flood risk in the upper reaches of the Minjiang River.",

Three high-resolution SPPs, i.e., Integrated Multi-satellite Retrieval for GPM (IMERG), Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), and Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), data were assessed statistically and hydrologically in the sparsely gauged Chenab River basin of Pakistan. The consistency of rain gauge data was assessed by the double mass curve (DMC). The statistical metrics applied were probability of detection (POD), critical success index (CSI), false alarm ratio (FAR), correlation coefficient (CC), root mean square error (RMSE), and bias (B). The hydrologic evaluation was conducted with calibration and validation scenarios for the monsoon flooding season using the Integrated Flood Analysis System (IFAS) and flow duration curve (FDC). Sensitivity analysis was conducted using ±20% calibrating parameters. The rain gauge data have been found to be consistent with the higher coefficient of determination (R2). The mean skill scores of GSMaP were superior to those of CHIRPS and IMERG. More bias was observed during the monsoon than during western disturbances. The most sensitive parameter was the base flow coefficient (AGD), with a high mean absolute sensitivity index value. During model calibration, good values of performance indicators, i.e., R2, Nash−Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and percentage bias (PBIAS), were found for the used SPPs. For validation, GSMaP performed better with comparatively higher values of R2 and NSE and a lower value of PBIAS. The FDC exhibited SPPs’ excellent performance during 20% to 40% exceedance time.",

The southern part’s moisture sources, however, were not investigated. The primary objective of this study is to trace the source of atmospheric moisture in the Abaya-Chamo sub-basin of southern Ethiopia using numerical water vapor tracers like Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Exploring the possible regions of atmospheric vapor roots and the path of moist air initiating rainfall that reaches the basin was feasible for the year 2018–2020. The anticyclone from the Arabian High, which is positioned in the Arabian and Mediterranean seas, was the primary source of moisture supply in the study area during the Belg (March to May) season, according to the back trajectory cluster analysis results. Additionally, the Indian Ocean adds moisture resulting from Mascarene highs brought by equatorial easterlies. Furthermore, during Kiremt (June to September), air masses from the Congo basin were the potential moisture source region for the study areas in combination with air masses originating from the Mascarene highs, located in the South Indian Ocean, and the St. Helena high, centered in the subtropical southern Atlantic Ocean. This study primarily focuses on the complex dynamics of atmospheric moisture sources around Abaya-Chamo sub-basin of southern Ethiopia, offering insight into seasonal fluctuations and contributing various components. These findings contribute to basin-specific water balance research by filling gaps in the previous studies.",

Significant diurnal variations (02–07, 08–13, 14–19, and 20-01 local standard time (LST)) of precipitation and RSD in Zhaosu are revealed during the rainy seasons. Precipitation mainly occurs in the late afternoon and early evening. A higher concentration of small raindrops is observed in the morning, whereas more mid-size and large raindrops are observed in the afternoon. The RSD exhibits diurnal differences between different rainfall rate classes; the diurnal difference of RSD is more pronounced in the case of high rainfall rates. Stratiform precipitation can occur at any time of the day, yet convective precipitation mainly occurs during the late afternoon and early evening. The RSD of stratiform rainfall shows a similar distribution over the four time periods. For convective rainfall, the concentration of small raindrops is the highest (lowest) over 02–07 (14–19) LST, while the highest (lowest) concentration of medium and large drops is observed over 14–19 (02–07) LST. Convective rain in the Ili River Valley over 14–19 LST can be characterized as the continental convective cluster, while in the rest time of the day, it is neither in the maritime cluster nor in the continental cluster. The empirical relationships between the radar reflectivity factor and rainfall rate (Z-R) for stratiform and convective rain types are also derived. The purpose of this study is to advance our understanding of precipitation microphysics in arid mountainous region.",

    "abstract": "A challenge in many Sub‐Saharan African (SSA) cities is the absence of air quality monitoring due to the high expense and technical expertise needed. Air pollution around the world is becoming a societal problem, and developed countries have all the necessary information about the levels of most air pollutants; however, underdeveloped countries have inadequate information on air quality. The problem of poor air quality in many SSA countries is due to lack of information about the hazards of poor air quality, lack of monitoring equipment, and lack of measuring stations: this is the case in Cameroon. We are avoiding these problems by using portable, low‐cost, low‐maintenance air quality monitoring equipment, including the OC 300 dust particle laser, to observe pollution levels of particle matter levels in the PK17 Douala‐Cameroon, a locality in the Central African region where no air quality data previously existed. The air quality index is very poor on the measurement days, and the color code is red. It has maximum values of about 199 for PM 10 and 192 for PM 2.5 . The average concentration values obtained were of the order of 200.54 µ g·m −3 , 155.54 µ g·m −3 , 194.90 µ g·m −3 , and 194.03 µ g·m −3 for PM 10 , respectively, on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. Regarding PM 2.5 , the average concentrations are 99.84 µ g·m −3 , 82.30 µ g·m −3 , 108.23 µ g·m −3 , and 112.97 µ g·m −3 , respectively, on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. A two‐dimensional Gaussian model was used to estimate the particle matter concentration along each road. The nRMSE was 9% for PM 10 and 12 for PM 2.5 , and the index-d for both particle sizes was close to 1 (0.74 for PM 10 and 0.98 for PM 2.5 ), which allows us to conclude that the calculated concentrations are the closest to the measured concentrations. The assessment reveals that most of the particulate matter during the measurement period was generated by road traffic. The concentration measured values of the pollutants are three times for PM 2.5 and four times for PM 10 above the recent WHO limits for daily exposure. In addition, it provides essential information on the pollution in Douala, which can be a major source of illness in the city and must be addressed.",

Parameter estimates reveal varied distribution characteristics, with the location parameter μ ranging from 28.98 to 33.44, and shape parameter ξ indicating both bounded and heavy‐tailed distributions. These results highlight the potential for extreme temperature conditions, such as heatwaves and droughts, particularly in regions with heavy‐tailed distributions. Return level estimates show increasing temperature extremes, with 100‐year return levels reaching 33.95 °C in Ruvuma. Nonstationary models that incorporate time‐varying location and scale parameters significantly improve model fit, particularly in Mbeya, where such a model outperforms the stationary model ( p value = 0.0092). Trend analyses identify significant temperature trends in Mbeya ( p value = 0.0123) and Ruvuma ( p value = 0.0015), emphasizing the need for adaptive climate strategies. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for nonstationarity in climate models to better understand and predict temperature extremes.",

First, radar radial‐velocity observations from three consecutive volume scans are analyzed on the model grid. The analyzed radial‐velocity fields are then used in step 2 to produce incremental analyses for the vector velocity fields at two time levels between the three volume scans. The analyzed vector velocity fields are used in step 3 to produce incremental analyses for the thermodynamic fields at the central time level accompanied by the adjustments in water vapor and hydrometeor mixing ratios based on radar reflectivity observations. The finite element B‐spline representations and recursive filter are used to reduce the dimension of the analysis space and enhance the computational efficiency. The method is applied to a squall line case observed by the phased‐array radar with rapid volume scans at the National Weather Radar Testbed and is shown to be effective in assimilating the phased‐array radar observations and improve the prediction of the subsequent evolution of the squall line.",

The focus was on SOA formation taking place over the North‐East Atlantic during a period of high biological activity. Isoprene SOA concentrations were up to ~5 ng m −3 over North Atlantic in the base case model runs, and isoprene oxidation made a negligible contribution to the marine organic aerosol (OA) mass. In particular, isoprene SOA did not account for the observed water‐soluble organic carbon (WSOC) concentrations over North Atlantic.

    "abstract": "This paper describes the implementation of the orographic gravity wave drag (GWDO) processes induced by subgrid‐scale orography in the global version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The sensitivity of the model simulated climatology to the representation of shortwave radiation and the addition of the GWDO processes is investigated using the Kim‐Arakawa GWDO parameterization and the Goddard, RRTMG (Rapid Radiative Transfer Model for GCMs), and Dudhia shortwave radiation schemes. This sensitivity study is a part of efforts of selecting the physics package that can be useful in applying the WRF model to global and seasonal configuration. The climatology is relatively well simulated by the global WRF; the zonal mean zonal wind and temperature structures are reasonably represented with the Kim‐Arakawa GWDO scheme using the Goddard and RRTMG shortwave schemes. It is found that the impact of the shortwave radiation scheme on the modeled atmosphere is pronounced in the upper atmospheric circulations above the tropopause mainly due to the ozone heating. The scheme that excludes the ozone process suffers from a distinct cold bias in the stratosphere. Moreover, given the improper thermodynamic environment conditions by the shortwave scheme, the role of the GWDO process is found to be limited.",

    "abstract": "The main objects of study in this paper are the synoptic scale atmospheric circulation systems associated with the rather frequent phenomenon of coloured rain and the very rare phenomenon of dust or sand deposits from a Saharan sandstorm triggered by a developing strong depression. Analysis of two such cases revealed that two days before the occurrence of the coloured rain or the dust deposits over Greece a sand storm appeared over the north‐western Sahara desert. The flow in the entire troposphere is southerly/south‐westerly with an upward vertical motion regime. If the atmospheric conditions over Greece favour rain then this rain contains a part of the dust cloud while the rest is drawn away downstream adopting a light yellow colour. In cases where the atmospheric circulation on the route of the dust cloud trajectories is not intensively anticyclonic dust deposits can occur on the surface long far from the region of the dust origin. Such was the case on 4th April, 1988, when significant synoptic‐scale subsidence occurred over Italy and towards Greece. The upper air data, in the form of synoptic maps, illustrate in detail the synoptic‐scale atmospheric circulations associated with the emission‐transport‐deposition and confirm the transportation of dust particles.",

Variations in oceanic preexisting conditions caused variation in predicted central pressure of nearly 18 hPa at 72 h, whereas sea‐surface cooling (SSC) induced by Hai‐Tang caused a predicted central pressure difference of about 40 hPa. Warm‐core oceanic eddies up to a few hundred kilometers across and a deep mixed layer climatologically distributed in the western North Pacific led to high mixed‐layer heat potential, which increased latent heat flux, water vapor, and liquid water contents around Hai‐Tang′s center. These increases were closely associated with Hai‐Tang′s intensification. SSC negatively affected the eyewall, whereas variations in oceanic preexisting conditions remarkably affected spiral rainbands and the magnitude of SSC.",

Radiogenic isotope signatures and backward trajectories analyses indicate that major dust sources are situated in the north-central to north-western part of the Saharan desert. Less radiogenic Sr isotopic compositions of PM10 aerosols and of mineral particles deposited during periods of low dust transfer likely result from the enhancement of the background chemically-weathered Saharan source. Saharan dust mobilization and transport were relatively reduced during the second part of the Little Ice Age (ca. 1690&#x2013;1870) except within the greatest Saharan dust event deposited around 1770. After ca. 1870, sustained dust deposition suggests that increased mineral dust transport over the Alps during the last century could be due to stronger spring/summer North Atlantic southwesterlies and drier winters in North Africa. On the other hand, increasing carbonaceous particle emissions from fossil fuel combustion combined to a higher lead enrichment factor point to concomitant anthropogenic sources of particulate pollutants reaching high-altitude European glaciers during the last century.",

For this purpose, artificial neural networks (ANNs) modelling techniques are applied in order to predict the maximum and the minimum value of the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) one day ahead as well as the persistence of the hours with extreme human biometeorological conditions. The findings of the analysis showed that extreme heat stress appears to be 10.0&#x25; of the examined hours within the warm period of the year, against extreme cold stress for 22.8&#x25; of the hours during the cold period of the year. Finally, human thermal comfort sensation accounts for 81.8&#x25; of the hours during the year.

It is significant to select a reasonable urban expansion pattern to mitigate the impact of urban land expansion on the regional climate in the rapid urbanization process. In this paper, taking Wuhan metropolitan as the case study area, and three urbanization patterns scenarios are designed to simulate spatial patterns of urban land expansion in the future using the Partitioned and Asynchronous Cellular Automata Model. Then, simulation results of land use are adjusted and inputted into WRF (Weather Research and Forecast) model to simulate regional climate change. The results show that: (1) warming effect is strongest under centralized urbanization while it is on the opposite under decentralized scenario; (2) the warming effect is stronger and wider in centralized urbanization scenario than in decentralized urbanization scenario; (3) the impact trends of urban land use expansion on precipitation are basically the same under different scenarios; (4) and spatial distribution of rainfall was more concentrated under centralized urbanization scenario, and there is a rainfall center of wider scope, greater intensity. Accordingly, it can be concluded that decentralized urbanization is a reasonable urbanization pattern to mitigate climate change in rapid urbanization period.",

The variation trend of evaporation of Dongping Lake was analyzed, and the influences that caused changes in lake evaporation were also discussed. The results show that (1) the total annual evaporation in Dongping Lake increased at 18.24 mm/a during 2003–2010.

Dust particles from these regions are transported over the Atlantic Ocean to the Eastern American Coasts. This transportation shows temporal and spatial variability and often reaches its peak during the boreal summer (June-July-August). The regional climate model (RegCM 4.0), containing a module of dust emission, transport, and deposition processes, is used in this study. Saharan and Sahelian dusts emissions, transports, and climatic impact on precipitations during the spring (March-April-May) and summer (June-July-August) were studied using this model. The results showed that the simulation were coherent with observations made by the MISR satellite and the AERONET ground stations, within the domain of Africa (Banizoumba, Cinzana, and M’Bour) and Ragged-point (Barbados Islands). The transport of dust particles was predominantly from North-East to South-West over the studied period (2005–2010). The seasonality of dust plumes’ trajectories was influenced by the altitudes reached by dusts in the troposphere. The impact of dusts on climate consisted of a cooling effect both during the boreal summer and spring over West Africa (except Southern-Guinea and Northern-Liberia), Central Africa, South-America, and Caribbean where increased precipitations were observed.",

For a convenient understanding, the vertical velocities of 5 levels ranging from 700 hPa to 500 hPa within the area of 15.625°N–24.375°N and 90.625°E–100.625°E are multiplied by −1 and summed up into a time series involving each year from 1979 to 2012. The standardized value of the time series is defined as the index of India-Burma trough (IIBT). IIBT can reflect the characteristics of the annual strength and the interdecadal variation of the India-Burma trough. IIBT can also well reveal the relationship between the India-Burma trough and its upstream teleconnection. What is more, through a correlation analysis on the grid point precipitation field, respectively, with the IIBT and the India-Burma trough indices defined with vorticity and geopotential height, over southern Asia the correlation pattern between the IIBT and the precipitation field is found to nearly be the sum of the correlation patterns of the latter 2 indices with the precipitation. To the south of the TP, the correlation field between the IIBT and the grid point precipitation shows dipolar distribution, which is consistent with the correlation patterns of the IIBT with the vertical velocity, specific humidity, and the mid-level geopotential height in the same spatial location. IIBT is beneficial for more accurate study of the impact of the India-Burma trough on the associated weather and climate.",

Based on the sunspot number series, which has been replaced by a new improved version since 2015, we confirm that the sunspot number has significant variations at 11-year and 112-year periods. The sunspot number has also increased from 1700 to 2016 with 0.08 annual increments on the basis of wavelet analysis and least-square fitting. We further confirm that global temperatures are remarkable in 22-year and 64-year cycles. The result of wavelet transform coherence (WTC) analysis suggests that solar activity has a positive lag effect on global temperatures in the period band of 22 years with a 3-year lag. However, the linearly increasing global temperature has hampered WTC analysis since 1960. Aiming to solve this problem, we apply wavelet decomposition and cross correlation to determine whether the aforementioned lag effect in the period band of 22 years has a 2-year lag rather than a 3-year lag. We find that the 22-year magnetic field solar cycle plays a greater role in global climate change than the 11-year sunspot cycle. In addition, we notice that the solar activity is not a representation of the driving force of the upward trend of global temperature after the industrial age. The Granger causality test results demonstrate that the phenomenon of the global warming is caused by excessive CO 2 emissions.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the use of the numerical rainfall forecast has become a common approach to improve the lead time of streamflow forecasts for flood control and reservoir regulation. The control forecasts of five operational global prediction systems from different centers were evaluated against the observed data by a series of area-weighted verification and classification metrics during May to September 2015–2017 in six subcatchments of the Xixian Catchment in the Huaihe River Basin. According to the demand of flood control safety, four different ensemble methods were adopted to reduce the forecast errors of the datasets, especially the errors of missing alarm (MA), which may be detrimental to reservoir regulation and flood control. The results indicate that the raw forecast datasets have large missing alarm errors (MEs) and cannot be directly applied to the extension of flood forecasting lead time. Although the ensemble methods can improve the performance of rainfall forecasts, the missing alarm error is still large, leading to a huge hazard in flood control. To improve the lead time of the flood forecast, as well as avert the risk from rainfall prediction, a new ensemble method was proposed on the basis of support vector regression (SVR). Compared to the other methods, the new method has a better ability in reducing the ME of the forecasts. More specifically, with the use of the new method, the lead time of flood forecasts can be prolonged to at least 3 d without great risk in flood control, which corresponds to the aim of flood prevention and disaster reduction.",

    "abstract": "During the Meiyu period, floods are prone to occur in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River because of the highly concentrated and heavy rainfall, which caused huge life and economic losses. Based on numerical simulation by assimilating Doppler radar, radiosonde, and surface meteorological observations, the evolution mechanism for the initiation, development, and decaying of a Meiyu frontal rainstorm that occurred from 4th to 5th July 2014 is analyzed. Results show that the numerical experiment can well reproduce the temporal variability of heavy precipitation and successfully simulate accumulative precipitation and its evolution over the key rainstorm area. The simulated “rainbelt training” is consistent with observed “echo training” on both spatial structure and temporal evolution. The convective cells in the mesoscale convective belt propagated from southwest to northeast across the key rainstorm area, leading to large accumulative precipitation in this area. There existed convective instability in lower levels above the key rainstorm area, while strong ascending motion developed during the rainstorm process. Combined with abundant water vapor supply, the above condition was favorable for the formation and development of heavy rainstorm. The low-level jet (LLJ) provided sufficient energy for the rainstorm system, and the low-level convergence intensified, which was important for the maintenance of precipitation system and its eventual intensification to rainstorm. At its mature stage, the rainstorm system demonstrated vertically tilted structure with strong ascending motion in the key rainstorm area, which was favorable for the occurrence of rainstorm. In the decaying stage, unstable energy decreased and the rainstorm no longer had sufficient energy to sustain. The rapid weakening of LLJ resulted in smaller energy supply to the convective system, and the stratification tended to be stable in the middle and lower levels. The ascending motion weakened correspondingly, which made it hard for the convective system to maintain.",

The comparisons with the global moored buoys show that the OSCAT wind vectors are consistent with buoys’ wind measurements. The average errors of the OSCAT wind vectors are 1.20 m/s and 17.7°. The analysis of the OSCAT wind vector errors at different buoy wind speeds in bins of 1 m/s indicates that the accuracy of the OSCAT wind speed first increases and then decreases with the increasing wind speed. The comparisons of OSCAT wind vectors and ASCAT wind vectors show that the average RMSEs of their differences are 1.27 m/s and 20.17°. In general, the accuracies of the OSCAT wind vectors satisfy the general scatterometer’s mission requirement and are consistent with ASCAT wind data. OSCAT wind vectors can be used in the global change study by the combination with other scatterometer data.",

Nevertheless, some research fields remain blank or have conflicting findings, which need to be further addressed. Particularly, few studies focus on drivers of SUHIs in massive cities with different sizes under various contexts at large scales. Using multisource data, we explored 11 determinants of surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) for 1449 cities in different ecological contexts throughout China in 2010, adopting the Spearman and partial correlation analysis and machine learning method. The main results were as follows: (1) Significant positive partial correlations existed between daytime SUHII and the differences in nighttime light intensity and built-up intensity between cities and their corresponding villages except in arid or semiarid western China. The differences in the enhanced vegetation index were generally partially negatively correlated with daytime and nighttime SUHII. The differences in white sky albedo were usually partially negatively correlated with nighttime SUHII. The mean air temperature was partially positively correlated with nighttime SUHII in 40% of cases. Only a few significant partial relationships existed between SUHII and urban area, total population, and differences in aerosol optical depth. The explanation rates during daytime were larger than during nighttime in 72% of cases. The largest and smallest rates occurred during summer days in humid cold northeastern China (63.84%) and in southern China (10.44%), respectively. (2) Both the daytime and nighttime SUHII could be well determined by drivers using the machine learning method. The RMSE ranged from 0.49°C to 1.54°C at a national scale. The simulation SUHII values were always significantly correlated with the actual SUHII values. The simulation accuracies were always higher during nighttime than daytime. The highest accuracies occurred in central-northern China and were lowest in western China during both daytime and nighttime.",

This paper proposed an efficient sandstorm prediction method that considered both the effect of atmospheric movement and ground factors on sandstorm occurrence, called improved naive Bayesian-CNN classification algorithm (INB-CNN classification algorithm). Firstly, we established a sandstorm prediction model based on the convolutional neural network algorithm, which considered atmospheric movement factors. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a deep neural network with convolution structure, which can automatically learn features from massive data. Then, we established a sandstorm prediction model based on the Naive Bayesian algorithm, which considered ground factors. Finally, we established a sandstorm prediction model based on the improved naive Bayesian-CNN classification algorithm. Experimental results showed that the prediction accuracy of the sandstorm prediction model based on INB-CNN classification algorithm is higher than that of others and the model can better reflect the law of sandstorm occurrence. This paper used two algorithms, naive Bayesian algorithm and CNN algorithm, to identify and diagnose the strength of sandstorm in Inner Mongolia and found that combining the two algorithms, INB-CNN classification algorithm had the greatest success in predicting the occurrence of sandstorms.",

In this paper, a surface albedo parameterization scheme was introduced and a solar radiation partitioning method was developed to improve the simulation of the upward solar radiation. The simulation results were validated in a hinterland site of the Taklimakan Desert. The surface albedo is not only associated with the soil moisture, but associated with the solar zenith angle. The solar radiation partitioning method considers the joint influences of cloud cover, near-surface air pressure, and solar zenith angle and was compared with the method using the Simple Biosphere Model version 3 (SiB3). The total albedo depends on the partitioning of the total visible and near-infrared radiations. The results indicate the surface albedo parameterization scheme is important to parameterize the upward solar radiation. The new solar radiation partitioning method could improve the simulation result.",

This study reports on ten years of eddy covariance measurements over groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) in New Mexico, USA, to compare the role of drought and flooding on radiation, water, and energy budgets of forests differing in species composition (native cottonwood versus nonnative saltcedar) and flooding regime. After net radiation (700–800 W m −2 ), latent heat flux was the largest energy flux, with annual values of evapotranspiration exceeding annual precipitation by 250–600%. Evaporative cooling dominated the energy fluxes of both forest types, although cottonwood generated much lower daily values of sensible heat flux (&lt;−5 MJ m −2 d −1 ). Drought caused a reduction in evaporative cooling, especially in the saltcedar sites where evapotranspiration was also reduced, but without a substantial decline in depth-to-groundwater. Our findings have broad implications on water security and the management of native and nonnative vegetation within semiarid southwestern North America. Specifically, consideration of the energy budgets of GDEs as they respond to fluctuations in climatic conditions can inform the management options for reducing evapotranspiration and maintaining in-stream flow, which is legally mandated as part of interstate and international water resources agreements.",

Tokyo metropolitan area is selected as a test case. Three urban planning scenarios are considered: status quo, dispersed city, and compact city. Their impact on the moist thermal environment is assessed using wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT). Future projections for the 2070s show a 2–4°C increase in daytime mean WBGT relative to the current climate. The urban scenario impacts are shown to be small, with a −0.4 to +0.4°C range. Relative changes in temperature and humidity as the result of a given urban scenario are shown to be critical in determining the sign of the WBGT changes; however, such changes are not necessarily determined by local changes in urban land surface parameters. These findings indicate that urban land surface changes may improve or worsen the local moist thermal environment and that metropolitan-scale urban planning is inefficient in mitigating heat-related health risks for mature cities like Tokyo.",

This anomalous monsoon trough was extended eastward to 145°E. Middle-latitude region in East Asia is affected by the anomalous southeasterlies due to these anomalous anticyclonic circulations and anomalous monsoon trough. These anomalous southeasterlies play a role of anomalous steering flows that make the TCs heading toward region in East Asia middle latitude. As a result, TCs during 1999–2013 had higher latitude of the maximum intensity compared to the TCs during 1977–1998.",

Results show that farm ponds have decreased by 10.55 million m 2 from 1993 to 2010, and the existing farm ponds were 18.80 million m 2 in 2010, equivalent to the irrigation water of 21.10~31.65 million m 3 (tons) and 37.61~56.41 million m 3 (tons), respectively.

Therefore, we employed five methods to estimate SOS from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)/normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) dataset. Subsequently, we compared the SOS with the ground-based first leaf date (FLD) of 12 deciduous broadleaved plant species at 12 sites of the Chinese Phenological Observation Network (CPON). The results show that the latitudinal patterns of five satellite-derived SOS measures are similar to each other but different from the pattern of ground phenology. For individual methods, the variability of SOS time series is significantly different from ground phenology except for HANTS, Polyfit, and Midpoint methods. The SOS calculated using the Midpoint method showed significant correlations with ground phenophases most frequently (in 47.1% of cases). Using the SOS derived from the Midpoint method, significantly earlier trends in SOS were detected in 50.7% of the natural vegetation area from 1982 to 2006.",

Measurements of soil pore-water pressure data are challenging, expensive, time consuming, and difficult task. This paper evaluates the applicability of artificial neural network (ANN) technique for modeling soil pore-water pressure variations at multiple soil depths from the knowledge of rainfall patterns. A multilayer perceptron neural network model was constructed using Levenberg-Marquardt training algorithm for prediction of soil pore-water pressure variations. Time series records of rainfall and pore-water pressures at soil depth of 0.5 m were used to develop the ANN model. To investigate applicability of the model for prediction of spatial and temporal variations of pore-water pressure, the model was tested for the time series data of pore-water pressure at multiple soil depths (i.e., 0.5 m, 1.1 m, 1.7 m, 2.3 m, and 2.9 m). The performance of the ANN model was evaluated by root mean square error, mean absolute error, coefficient of correlation, and coefficient of efficiency. The results revealed that the ANN performed satisfactorily implying that the model can be used to examine the spatial and temporal behavior of time series of pore-water pressures with respect to multiple soil depths from knowledge of rainfall patterns and pore-water pressure with some antecedent conditions.",

The magnitude of maximum daily spring flows is also higher in the first watershed as compared with the second, owing to substantial runoff, given that the amount of snow that gives rise to these flows is not significantly different in the two watersheds. These flows occur early in the season in the agricultural watershed because of the relatively high temperatures. With regard to temporal variability, minimum temperatures increased over time in both watersheds. Maximum temperatures in the fall only increased in the agricultural watershed. The amount of spring rain increased over time in both watersheds, whereas total precipitation increased significantly in the agricultural watershed only.

Assuming that the mechanism of daily rainfall occurrences follows the first-order Markov chain model, the possible changes in the transition probabilities are estimated by considering the climate change scenarios. Also, the change of the stationary probabilities of wet and dry day occurrences and finally the change in the number of wet days are derived for the comparison of current (1x CO 2 ) and 2x CO 2 conditions. As a result of this study, the increase or decrease in the mean number of wet days was found to be not enough to explain all of the change in monthly rainfall amounts, so rainfall intensity should also be modified. The application to the Seoul weather station in Korea shows that about 30% of the total change in monthly rainfall amount can be explained by the change in the number of wet days and the remaining 70% by the change in the rainfall intensity. That is, as an effect of climate change, the increase in the rainfall intensity could be more significant than the increase in the wet days and, thus, the risk of flood will be much highly increased.",

To this end, drought and wet periods (1982–2011) were calculated in central Iran. The results of PCA indicated that 42% of variance in geopotential height data at 500 HPa level was associated with the extension of subpolar lows elevation towards lower latitudes, which transmitted high elevation areas like Siberian highs to the south and formed high atmospheric stability in the study area. Therefore, the dominance of high elevation cores on the area was characterized by cold air descent and cloudlessness, which led to low precipitation and drought events. Moreover, the eight components in wet periods could explain 94% of data variation in geopotential height data. The results of PCA in wet period suggested that the first component with the highest frequency played a key role among circulation patterns, determining the dominant pattern in cold period of the year. Further, its negative phase indicated polar and Siberian highs with the remaining components, given the negative and positive phases of the centers, revealing atmospheric instability that entered the region from Mediterranean, Black, and Red sea, thereby marking the transition of the area from drought to the wet period.",

The model performance is evaluated by comparing model output against observations of precipitation, wind speed, and temperature at 168 weather stations, with daily data from 2010 to 2014. In general, the global models provide more accurate forecasts than the regional models, probably due to the low horizontal resolution in the regional model. Also, the model performance is poorer for stations with altitudes greater than 500 meters above sea level (masl). For tropical cyclone performance validations, the maximum wind surface forecast from global and regional models is also verified against the best track of Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Finally, the model forecast skill during a recent extreme rain event in northeast Vietnam is evaluated.",

Existing wind power forecasting methods are mostly types of deterministic point forecasting. Deterministic point forecasting is vulnerable to forecasting errors and cannot effectively deal with the random nature of wind power. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a short-term wind power interval forecasting model based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), runs test (RT), and relevance vector machine (RVM). First, in order to reduce the complexity of data, the original wind power sequence is decomposed into a plurality of intrinsic mode function (IMF) components and residual (RES) component by using EEMD. Next, we use the RT method to reconstruct the components and obtain three new components characterized by the fine-to-coarse order. Finally, we obtain the overall forecasting results (with preestablished confidence levels) by superimposing the forecasting results of each new component. Our results show that, compared with existing methods, our proposed short-term interval forecasting method has less forecasting errors, narrower interval widths, and larger interval coverage percentages. Ultimately, our forecasting model is more suitable for engineering applications and other forecasting methods for new energy.",

Rotating airflow associated with the tornado is well captured by the Doppler velocity from a Terminal Doppler Weather Radar (TDWR) in Hong Kong. The Doppler velocity patterns show the typical signature of a velocity couplet associated with a meso/microcyclone, and for most part of its lifetime, it captures clearly the evolution with time. Weather radar echoes of those thunderstorms inducing the current tornado, as well as the meso/microcyclone itself, are also successfully reproduced in a real-time simulation by a fine-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) model initialised 3 hours earlier, albeit with a time lag of about 15 minutes when compared to the actual event. The model simulation displays some interesting features of the cyclone, including the vertical structure of horizontal and vertical velocities and cloud liquid water content, which are consistent with literature that accounts in other parts of the world. The vertical profile of maximum radial velocity associated with the velocity couplet also compares well between the actual weather radar observation and numerical simulation. The results in this paper could serve as an interesting reference for both meteorologists and wind engineers, also demonstrating the power of very high-resolution NWP in predicting such events in a real-time fashion.",

Based on a dataset of daily maximum temperatures from meteorological stations on the North China Plain, including ordinary and national basic/reference surface stations, the intensity-area-duration method was used to analyze the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of heatwave events on the North China Plain (1961–2017). Moreover, based on demographic data from the Statistical Yearbook and Greenhouse Gas Initiative (GGI) Population Scenario Database of the Austrian Institute for International Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), population exposure to heatwave events was also studied. The results showed that the frequency, intensity, and area of impact of heatwave events on the North China Plain initially decreased (becoming weaker and less extensive) and then increased (becoming stronger and more extensive). Similarly, the trend of population exposure to heatwave events initially decreased and then increased, and the central position of exposure initially moved southward and then returned northward. Population exposure in the eastern Taihang Mountains was found significantly higher than in the western Taihang Mountains. In relation to the change of population exposure to heatwave events on the North China Plain, the influence of climatic factors was found dominant with an absolute contribution rate of &gt;75%. Except for 2011–2017, increase in population also increased the exposure to heatwaves, particularly in the first half of the study period. Interaction between climatic and population factors generally had less impact on population exposure than either climatic factors or population factors alone. This study demonstrated a method for assessing the impact of heatwave events on population exposure, which could form a scientific basis for the development of government policy regarding adaption to climate change.",

MIRS uses physically based retrievals of atmospheric and surface state parameters to provide daily global maps of snow cover and snow water equivalent at 50 km resolution. The older MSPPS delivers daily global maps at the spatial resolution of 45 km and utilizes mostly simple empirical algorithms to retrieve information. IMS daily maps of snow and sea ice cover for the Northern Hemisphere are produced interactively through the analysis of satellite imagery in the visible, infrared, and microwave spectral bands. We compare the performances of these products across the Northern Hemisphere for 2014–2017, using IMS as the standard. In this intercomparison, the daily overall agreement of the automated snow products with IMS ranges between 88% and 99% for MIRS and 87% and 99% for MSPPS. However, daily snow sensitivity is lower, ranging between 36% and 90% for MIRS and 26% and 91% for MSPPS. We analyze this disagreement rate as a function of terrain and land cover type, finding that, relative to IMS, MIRS shows fewer false positives but more false negatives than MSPPS over high elevation and grassland areas.",

Results showcased comparable findings among three trend identification methods. Even though the graphical method is easier, it is advised to use it with a proper statistical method due to its identification difficulties when the data scatter has some outliers. Nevertheless, it was found herein that Colombo is under a downward rainfall trend in the month of July where the area receives its major rainfall events. In addition, the area has several upward rainfall trends over the minor seasons and in the annual scale. Therefore, the water management activities in the area have to be revisited for a sustainable use of water resources.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the anomalous signals near the tropopause before the overshooting convective system (OCS) onset over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). It is found that the tropopause height is stable at the maximum height for the 7th day and the 5th day before the OCS onset. It then decreases significantly one day before and on the day of the OCS onset. The upward motion in the troposphere is the strongest for the 5th day before the OCS onset. From one day before and after the OCS onset, there are strong ascending motions at 500–300 hPa but weak descending motions near the tropopause. It is proposed that the descending of the tropopause height on the day of the OCS onset is caused by frequent tropopause fold events over the eastern TP associated with frequent cold trough intrusion from the north and the southeastward movement of upper-level westerly jet stream. The decrease of the tropopause height is accompanied by the intrusion of stratospheric air with higher potential vorticity (PV). Positive potential vorticity anomalies on 350 K isentropic surface can be noted in the region where the tropopause height decreases one day before and on the day of the OCS onset. With the deepening of the tropopause fold on the day of the OCS onset, there is not only downward motion near the tropopause in the area behind of the fold but also upward motion in the troposphere beneath the folding region. In addition, the upward displacement of isentropic surfaces leads to an upper-level cold pool, which causes a reduction in static stability beneath the PV anomaly on the day of the OCS onset. The upper-level PV anomalies and their associated strong instability in the middle troposphere can trigger convective activities by the release of potential instability on the day of the OCS onset. The overshooting convection is more likely to occur due to lower tropopause height, although upward motion in the troposphere is not the strongest.",

In the highly populated areas of Western-Central Europe a large population will be exposed to these changes. In particular Luxembourg—with its dense population and the large cross-border commuter flows—is vulnerable to changing thermal stress. Based on climate change projections we assessed the impact of climate change on human thermal comfort over the next century using two common human-biometeorological indices, the Physiological Equivalent Temperature and the Universal Thermal Climate Index. To account for uncertainties, we used a multimodel ensemble of 12 transient simulations (1971–2098) with a spatial resolution of 25 km. In addition, the regional differences were analysed by a single regional climate model run with a spatial resolution of 1.3 km. For the future, trends in air temperature, vapour pressure, and both human-biometeorological indices could be determined. Cold stress levels will decrease significantly in the near future up to 2050, while the increase in heat stress turns statistically significant in the far future up to 2100. This results in a temporarily reduced overall thermal stress level but further increasing air temperatures will shift the thermal comfort towards heat stress.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the impact of Tropospheric Airborne Meteorological Data Reporting (TAMDAR) observations on regional 24-hour forecast error reduction over the Continental United States (CONUS) domain using adjoint-based forecast sensitivity to observation (FSO) method as the diagnostic tool. The relative impact of TAMDAR observations on reducing the forecast error was assessed by conducting the WRFDA FSO experiments for two two-week-long periods, one in January and one in June 2010. These experiments assimilated operational TAMDAR data and other conventional observations, as well as GPS refractivity (GPSREF). FSO results show that rawinsonde soundings (SOUND) and TAMDAR exhibit the largest observation impact on 24 h WRF forecast, followed by GeoAMV, aviation routine weather reports (METAR), GPSREF, and synoptic observations (SYNOP). At 0000 and 1200 UTC, TAMDAR has an equivalent impact to SOUND in reducing the 24-hour forecast error. However, at 1800 UTC, TAMDAR has a distinct advantage over SOUND, which has the sparse observation report at these times. In addition, TAMDAR humidity observations at lower levels of the atmosphere (700 and 850 hPa) have a significant impact on 24 h forecast error reductions. TAMDAR and SOUND observations present a qualitatively similar observation impact between FSO and Observation System Experiments (OSEs).",

    "abstract": "Both the “urban minus rural” (UMR) and the “observation minus reanalysis” (OMR) methods were used to quantify the potential impacts of urbanization on regional temperature changes in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan area in China. DMSP/OLS nighttime light imagery and population census data were used to classify stations into four classes: rural, small city, medium city, and large city groups. The regional average annual mean temperature was estimated to increase by 0.12°C decade −1 derived from urban warming, accounting for 40% of total climate warming from 1960 to 2009 using the UMR method. The OMR method also indicates that rapid urbanization has a significant influence on surface warming trend although the urban warming intensity is dependent on reanalysis dataset. The seasonal cycle patterns from all three datasets are consistent with each other, which is contrary to the UMR result owing to the cooling effect of agriculture activity in the rural stations confusing the UMR result. So in this paper we found a deficiency of the UMR method where it would underestimate the effects of urbanization in summer. In this regard, the results from the OMR method are relatively more convincing although we admit it still has many other problems.",

The literature survey and field data were acquired to confirm the export coefficients of the ECM, and the loads of TN and TP were statistically analyzed in the study area. Based on hydrological similarity, runoff data from nearby gauged sites were pooled to compensate for the lack of at-site data and the water quality submodel of BTOPMC was then applied to simulate the monthly pollutant fluxes in the two sections from 2010 to 2012. The results showed agricultural fertilizer, rural sewage, and livestock and poultry sewage were the main pollution sources, and under the consideration of self-purification capacity of river, the outputs of the two models were almost identical. The proposed method with a main thought of combining and comparing an empirical model and a mechanistic model can assess the water quality conditions in the study area scientifically, which indicated it has a good potential for popularization in other regions.",

This new model with complex and detailed surface conditions, called TEB-RAMS, is from Colorado State University (CSU) and the ASTER division of Mission Research Corporation. The spatial-temporal distributions of daily mean 2 m air temperature are simulated by TEB-RAMS during the period from 0000 UTC 01 to 0000 UTC 02 July 2003 over the area of 116°E~116.8°E, 39.6°N~40.2°N in Beijing. The TEB-RAMS was run with four levels of two-way nested grids, and the finest grid is at 1 km grid increment. An Anthropogenic Heat (AH) source is introduced into TEB-RAMS. A comparison between the Land Ecosystem-Atmosphere Feedback model (LEAF) and the detailed TEB parameterization scheme is presented. The daily variations and spatial distribution of the 2 m air temperature agree well with the observations of the Beijing area. The daily mean 2 m air temperature simulated by TEB-RAMS with the AH source is 0.6 K higher than that without specifying TEB and AH over the metropolitan area of Beijing. The presence of urban underlying surfaces plays an important role in the UHI formation. The geometric morphology of an urban area characterized by road, roof, and wall also seems to have notable effects on the UHI intensity. Furthermore, the land-use dataset from USGS is replaced in the model by a new land-use map for the year 2010 which is produced by the Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth (RADI), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The simulated regional mean 2 m air temperature is 0.68 K higher from 01 to 02 July 2003 with the new land cover map.",

The region is characterized by regular oscillations, but episodic El Niño-events introduce strong disturbances. Conceptual models based on observations, remote sensing data, and output of regional climate models are compared with data from a new station network. The results show regular oscillations of all climate variables on the annual and daily time scale. The daily cycle is probably associated with thermotidal forcings, causing gravity waves to emanate from the Andes Cordillera. Main factors are the interaction of large scale pressure systems like the Southeast Pacific High and the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). Also, there are regional factors: an extended sea-breeze system, the barrier-effect of the Andes, additional energy input by elevated radiation absorption at the mountain slopes, local wind systems, and the variations of the sea surface temperature. At the coast, a low-level jet works as a thermodynamic energy sink, suppressing deep convection and supporting the aridity. Those patterns are found in most of the station data and the processes of this climate can generally be confirmed. The overturning of this stable system with the onset of El Niño-conditions is possibly caused by disruptions of the regional circulation.",

Poyang Lake is the largest body of water downstream of the TGP, and it is not immune to these changes. TRMM and GRACE data were introduced in this study to estimate river-lake water exchange, from which the hydrological responses of Poyang Lake could be identified. A significant decreasing trend of the runoff coefficient has been observed since 2003, resulting in 6.02 km 3 more water discharge from the lake into the Yangtze River than under normal conditions. No significant interannual changes occurred in the water level or local precipitation, and GRACE observations revealed that groundwater discharge appeared to be the most likely compensation for the water loss. A novel approach, namely, the groundwater abnormality index (GAI), was developed to depict the water exchange using GRACE and surface water observations. Lower than normal GAIs were found between 2003 and 2005, reaching a minimum of −29.26 in October 2003, corresponding to ten times of the mean GAI during 2006–2012, clearly indicating a significant water exchange in Poyang Lake Basin from groundwater to surface water after the TGP impoundment.",

The lower sublayer is a few tens of centimeters thick and formed by the flowing water, in which there is no advection; the upper sublayer is over the lower sublayer and formed by the surface wind. The results were compared to those obtained by the heat balance method; field experiments were conducted in the middle reaches of the Heihe River in northwestern China. Results showed that cumulative evaporation instances estimated by the DSAL model were equal in order of magnitude to those by the heat balance method on observed days during the daytime (0700~1900 BST). We infer from these experimental results that the evaporation loss in transport in this region is of the order of one percent at most.",

Small convective available potential energy (CAPE) represents relatively shallow convection, which is beneficial to the generation of positive lightning. Large vertical wind shear results in the displacement of upper-level positive ice crystals and promotes the initiation of +CG lightning from positive ice crystals. The dry low- to midlevel troposphere and the high cloud base in the plateau region favor +CG lightning, while the strong thermodynamic conditions in the basin region offset the influence of these moisture factors. In the plateau region, due to the limited cloud thickness, high total column liquid water may mean high cloud water content in the warm cloud region rather than high liquid water content in the mixed-phase region, which is unfavorable for the middle-level positive graupel and thus is unfavorable for the initiation of +CG lightning. In the basin region, the cloud thickness is relatively thicker, the high total column liquid water means that the liquid water content in the warm cloud and the mixed-phase region is both high, which is conducive to the middle-level positive graupel and the +CG lightning.",

    "abstract": "Evapotranspiration estimations are not common in developing countries though most of them have water scarcities for agricultural purposes. Therefore, it is essential to estimate the rates of evapotranspiration based on the available climatic parameters. Proper estimations of evapotranspiration are unavailable to Sri Lanka, even though the country has a significant agricultural contribution to its economy. Therefore, the Shuttleworth–Wallace (S-W) model, a process-based two-source potential evapotranspiration (PET) model, is implemented to simulate the spatiotemporal distribution of PET, evaporation from soil (ETs), and transpiration from vegetation canopy (ETc) across the total landmass of Sri Lanka. The country was divided into a grid with <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mn>6</mn> <mi>k</mi> <mi>m</mi> <mo>×</mo> <mn>6</mn> <mi>k</mi> <mi>m</mi> </math> cells. The meteorological data, including rainfall, temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, net solar radiation, and pan evaporation, for 14 meteorological stations were used in this analysis. They were interpolated using Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW), Universal kriging, and Thiessen polygon methods as appropriate so that the generated thematic layers were fairly closer to reality. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and soil moisture data were retrieved from publicly available online domains, while the threshold values of vegetation parameters were taken from the literature. Notwithstanding many approximations and uncertainties associated with the input data, the implemented model displayed an adequate ability to capture the spatiotemporal distribution of PET and its components. A comparison between predicted PET and recorded pan evaporations resulted in a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.75 mm/day. The model showed high sensitivity to Leaf Area Index (LAI). The model revealed that both spatial and temporal distribution of PET is highly correlated with the incoming solar radiation fluxes and affected by the rainfall seasons and cultivation patterns. The model predicted PET values accounted for 80–90% and 40–60% loss of annual mean rainfall, respectively, in the drier and wetter parts of the country. The model predicted a 0.65 ratio of annual transpiration to annual evapotranspiration.",

    "abstract": "Heavy rainfall occurs frequently in Northern Vietnam and causes severe floods and landslides. Heavy rainfall not only appears in rainy seasons (May–October) but also regularly occurs in spring (February–April). This study is devoted to identifying the climatic factors that influence the variation of rainfall, particularly heavy rainfall in Northern Vietnam in the dry season. Analysis based on the observed rainfall, PERSIANN satellite rainfall data, and ERA5 reanalysis reveals that spring should not be considered a dry season, but the first period of a rainy season in Northern Vietnam. Spring rainfall is caused by collaborative effects of cold surge, subtropical high, and the deepening of the low pressure over the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau and Bay of Bengal (BOB). Based on the composite analysis of heavy rainfall events in Northern Vietnam in the transitional season, two heavy rainfall patterns are recognized. The first is related to the southward movement of a meso-scale vortex and the cold surge, while the second one is induced by the interaction of cold surge and the deepening of an upper-level trough.",

    "abstract": "Climate changes significantly cause the precipitation deficiency and in turn reduce the inflow amount in reservoir affecting hydroelectric power generation. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate hydropower generation and reservoir operation under climate change from Kesem reservoir. Recent Representative Pathway (RCP) scenarios were used to evaluate the impact of climate change on power generation. Power transformation equation and variance scaling approach were amalgamated to adjust the bias correction of precipitation and temperature, respectively. Bias, root mean square error, and coefficient of variation were used to check the accuracy of projected rainfall. The base and future precipitation, temperature, and evaporation trend was analysed using the Mann–Kendall test. The flow calibration and validation were carried out by the Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modelling System (HEC-HMS), and hydropower generation was evaluated with reservoir simulation model (MODSIM 8.1) under climate scenarios. The performance of the model was found good with Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE) of 0.72 and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.73 for calibration and NSE of 0.74 and R2 of 0.75 for validation. Projected future climate scenarios predicted increasing and decreasing trend of temperature and precipitation, respectively. For RCP4.5 climate scenario, the average energy generation is likely to decrease by 0.64% and 0.82% in both short-term (2021–2050) and long-term (2051–2080), respectively. In case of RCP8.5 climate scenario, the average energy generation will be decreased by 1.06% and 1.35% for short-term and long-term, respectively. Remarkable reduction of energy generation was revealed in RCP8.5 with relation to RCP4.5 scenario. This indicates that there will be high energy fluctuation and decreasing trend in the future energy generation. The research finding is crucial for decision-makers, power authorities, governmental and nongovernmental organizations, and watershed management agencies to take care for sustainability in the future hydropower generation in the Kesem reservoir.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has achieved significant success in many statistical application scenarios, but has yet to be fully successful in monthly and seasonal predictions. We identified three statistical challenges in climate prediction: instability of statistical models, complexity of feature factors, and the nonlinearity of the relationship between predictors and predictands. These characteristics limit both traditional empirical forecasting and machine learning methods. This paper proposes a novel method called dynamically modeled machine learning to predict monthly temperature anomalies over China. The core idea of dynamic modeling is that the machine learning model is trained using a sliding time window, so that the relationship between predictors and predictands is optimized for a specific and recent period rather than for the entire time span. One hundred thirty indices related to atmospheric and oceanic circulation and other climatic events from the Beijing Climate Center are used as the feature set. After feature engineering, including feature selection and dimensionality reduction, the predictors are generated and input into a regressor. Five machine learning algorithms are employed as regressors one by one: linear regression (LR), ridge regression (RR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs). The method performs reforecasting for 2012–2021 and compares the results with the output of operational climate models from ECMWF, NCEP, and the Beijing Climate Center. Three quantitative evaluation metrics—predictive score (PS), anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC), and anomaly sign agreement rate—were used to assess the prediction performance of each machine learning regressor, the ensemble model, and three dynamic models. The results demonstrate that the method using GBDTs as the regressor achieves the best predictive performance compared to other methods and operational models, with a monthly average PS score of 84, an ACC value of 0.27, and an anomaly sign agreement rate of 74%.",

    "abstract": "This study thoroughly examined the impact of coal burning on the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their subsequent long‐lasting presence in different environmental matrices, including road dust. The aim was to identify the origin, extent, spatial arrangement, and cancer‐causing potential associated with PAHs in road dust in Changchun City, Northeast China. The levels of Σ16 PAHs in the road dust samples ranged from 0.314 to 17.418 mg/kg, with an average concentration of 1.4452 mg/kg, exhibiting lower values than cities worldwide. In Changchun City, PAH levels in various regions follow the order of Chaoyang (CY) &gt; Lvyuan (LY) &gt; Kuancheng (KC) &gt; Jingyue (JY) &gt; Nanguan (NG) &gt; Er’dao (ErD). Road dust primarily comprised PAHs containing 4–5 rings among these substances. The incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR) analysis indicated that adults faced potential risk (&gt;10 −6 ) at 97.7% of the sampling sites, while children faced potential risk (&gt;10 −6 ) at 48.8%. The principal component analysis (PCA) model identified five potential origins of PAHs, including petroleum (22.2%), coal burning (19.1%), biomass burning (30.5%), fossil fuel burning (15.8%), and transportation (12.4%). Further investigations are required to scientifically and systematically determine the carcinogenic risks associated with PAHs in the total environment, despite estimating only potential risks from PAHs in road dust and human exposure to various environmental matrices.",

    "abstract": "Echo training represents the primary mechanism through which rain bands precipitate extreme rainfall events. This study employed a combination of observational data and ERA5 reanalysis data to examine two instances of “echo training” that occurred following the landfall of typhoons Soudelor (2015, Process 1) and Fitow (2013, Process 2) in China. The findings indicate notable differences in the environmental background, characteristics, and the organization of convective rainbands between these two “echo training” processes. During Process 1, a well‐developed convective system accompanied by a deeper boundary layer convergence between the cold pool and the easterly flow is observed. The presence of baroclinic structures permits the uplift of warm and humid air from the ocean that facilitated by the solenoidal term. During this period, the dispersion queues on both sides of the rainband contributed to the strengthening of convection and enabled convective cells to traverse the length of the rainband for an extended duration. In Process 2, the comparative wind between the easterly flow and the weak cold pool resulted in relatively shallow convergence, while the warm rain process dominated. The continuous generation of new cells occurred at the eastern boundary of the rainband, while dissipation occurred at the western boundary, resulting in persistent heavy rainfall for the covered area.",

    "abstract": "Based on observational data, ERA5 hourly reanalysis data, and s‐band dual‐polarization radar data, the extremely severe convective weather happening in Shandong Peninsula on 1 October 2021 is analyzed. The results show that the process was affected by the upper‐level cold vortex, and extremely severe convective weather happened from west to east in the northern area of Shandong Peninsula. Extra‐large hail occurred in this process. The upper‐level cold vortex provided the synoptic‐scale dynamic forcing and unstable thermal stratification conditions, which were conducive to the occurrence of severe convective weather. About 2400 J · kg −1 sufficient convective available potential energy (CAPE) and 30.2 m · s −1 strong vertical wind shear between 0 and 6 km altitude prompted this severe convective weather to arise in October. Due to the special coastal geographical environment of Shandong Peninsula, the surface sea‐breeze front triggered this severe convection process, and the movement of the surface convergence line stimulated the occurrence and development of convection nearby upstream and downstream. The three‐body scatter spike (TBSS) and bounded weak echo region (BWER) of the storm were very significant. The value of Z DR is lower below 0°C layer than that above 0°C layer; meanwhile, the values of CC and K DP are higher below 0°C layer than that above 0°C layer. There were two Z DR columns on the east and west sides in the supercell storm, and the height (HT) of the east Z DR column top exceeds that of the −20°C layer. The thickness of the east Z DR column (about 3.2 km) was thicker than that of the west Z DR column (about 2.2 km). These all indicate that the storm had a deep updraft, which was conducive to the formation and growth of hail. There were also two K DP columns on the east and west sides of the BWER, which had almost the same thickness about 3.2 km, and both extended beyond the HT of the −20°C layer. The thickness of the strong reflectivity above 65 dBZ reaches 7 km, and the thickness of the Z DR column and K DP column reaches 2–3 km can be used as a reference for predicting extra‐large hail in autumn short‐term forecasting.",

This study aimed to investigate the inter‐ and intra‐annual variation of ET in the data‐sparse Guder River watershed using the appropriate ET estimation model. We have evaluated the performance of two widely used remote sensing ETs and three temperature and radiation‐based ET models and selected the best‐performing data. We have used innovative trend analysis (ITA) and harmonic analysis to find the general trends and periodic variations in ET. The long‐term mean ET of the Guder River watershed ranged from 701.7 to 841 mm per year. Over the past two decades, there has been a general declining trend in annual ET. The analysis of seasonal variation showed considerable fluctuations in ET, with the lowest value of 26.7 mm in winter and the highest value of 159 mm in autumn. The seasonal data analysis revealed that the declining trend was mainly observed in the wet season, particularly in spring. The harmonic analysis of ET between 1980 and 2000 showed variances of the semiannual cycle of two and four cycles dominating the first harmonic variance, which indicates low interannual variation. However, from 2001 to 2021, the variance of the first harmonic contributed more than the seasonal variances, indicating an increase in the interannual variation of ET. Future research has to emphasize the deriving factor to the observed variability and the effect on streamflow by considering complete watershed variables.",

It addresses the insufficient understanding of rainfall variability within Narok County due to generalizations in previous research and a lack of detailed statistical analysis and data gaps from inadequate stations. The study aims to provide a precise analysis of spatial and temporal rainfall variations to better inform climate adaptation strategies and local planning. The analysis covered the period 1981–2021 and utilized gridded precipitation reanalysis data version two of Modern‐Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA‐2) project and monthly rainfall data (mm) from the Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD) for Narok Meteorological Station (NMS). Various statistical techniques, including Kruskal–Wallis (H) test, Rainfall Anomaly Index (RAI), and trend analysis, were employed to assess rainfall patterns across three ecoclimatic zones within the county. The coefficient of variation (CV) was applied in determining the magnitude of precipitation variation across space and time. Results indicate significant temporal variability in rainfall, with distinct seasonal patterns observed. The study identifies a bimodal distribution of rainfall, with wetter months typically occurring in April and November. Spatially, differences in rainfall intensity and variability were observed across the ecozones, with higher variability in arid zones compared to more humid areas. Additionally, interannual rainfall anomalies revealed fluctuations between extreme dry and wet years. Furthermore, trend analysis suggests a gradual increase in annual rainfall over the study period, particularly in more arid regions, highlighting potential shifts in local climate dynamics. These findings underscore the importance of understanding localized rainfall patterns for effective agricultural planning, resources management and climate adaptation strategies in Narok County and similar agroecological contexts.",

Standardized anomaly, coefficient of variation (CV), monotonic trends of rainfall and dry days, and the onset and retreat of the cropping season, Maha were computed for the last four decades, and the impacts of climate change were evaluated by checking the differences in the variables before and after the year 2000 using the Wilcoxon signed‐rank test. The annual rainfall of the Malwathu Oya river basin shows a significant increase, primarily contributed by the upstream region. The study identified the higher variability of the onset of the Maha seasonal rainfall, showing an early onset of the season. Total annual rainfall showed a significant increase after the year 2000, probably due to climate change, and the overall temporal patterns of rainfall events remain consistent with those of before 2000. This trend toward more intense but less frequent rainfall events highlights the need for adaptive water resource management plans to mitigate potential challenges related to flood risks in the basin, and the early onset of Maha rain is to be taken as an opportunity for the farmers in the basin.",

    "abstract": "The high vulnerability of regions that predominantly rely on rain‐fed agriculture to climate change and variability underscores the importance of understanding adaptation responses as a foundation for designing targeted interventions. This study investigates microlevel climate change adaptation strategies and factors determining such choices of smallholder farmers in the Kembata Tembaro Zone, southern Ethiopia. It employed a convergent parallel mixed‐method research design, incorporating quantitative data collected through household surveys of 364 randomly selected smallholder farmers across diverse agro‐ecological zones. This was complemented by qualitative data obtained through interviews and focus group discussions (FGDs). A multinomial logit (MNL) regression model was used to analyze the determinants of the farmers’ adaptation decisions. Nearly all respondents perceived an increase in temperature, consistent with observed trends. However, the farmers’ perception of declining rainfall corresponded only with trends during the short rainfall season (Belg). Farmers in lowland areas demonstrated greater experience with adaptation strategies and are more resilient than those in midland and highland regions. On average, 88.2% of the farmers reported implementing adaptation measures, such as adjusting planting dates, crop diversification, soil and water conservation, adopting improved livestock breeds, engagement in off‐farm activities, and agroforestry practice. The regression analysis identified several significant factors influencing adaptation decisions, including age, education level, farm size, farm income, access to credit, participation in climate change training, availability of climate information, market access, and agro‐ecological context. This study offers unique, context‐specific insights through inter‐agroecological comparisons of smallholder farmers’ adaptation choices, highlighting the complex interplay between socioeconomic and environmental variables in determining adaptation to climate change. The findings can inform policymakers when designing development policies tailored to specific local contexts.",

Climate Explorer was used to obtain annual maximum and minimum temperatures, and average monthly precipitation data for the period 1960–2019. The Mann Kendall (MK), innovative trend analysis (ITA) Test, and Sen’s estimate were employed to determine the nature of the trends and their significance, while a questionnaire survey was conducted to determine the perceptions of local communities about climate trends in the region. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was computed for the October to December (OND) and January to March (JFM) sub seasons and for the ONDJFM in R‐Studio 1.1.1717 software using monthly precipitation data for the 1961–2019 period. The results indicate a significant rise in the long‐term annual mean maximum and mean minimum temperatures, which have increased by 0.034 and 0.011°C/annum, respectively. Consistent with the perceptions of surveyed households, the results of the analysis revealed an increase in maximum temperatures, a decrease in precipitation, and consecutive dry years during this period. Most respondents cited an increase in Tmax, a decrease in Tmin, changes in precipitation patterns during the OND and JFM seasons, and increasing drought episodes. The SPI data indicated severe droughts during the JFM subseason in 1973 (−1.21), 1983 (−1.755), 1992 (−1.55), and 2016 (−1.10), and severe droughts in the OND seasons in 1994, 1990, and 2019 (all with SPI −1.645). The study concludes that if appropriate adaptation strategies are not adopted, these changes may contribute to food insecurity and water scarcity in the region, with negative implications for the livelihoods of local communities in the region. The findings underscore the need for context‐specific adaptation measures to address the varied impacts of climate change across different altitudinal zones in the EFSR.",

The study utilizes meteorological data, including monthly maximum and minimum temperatures, rainfall, humidity, wind speed, sunshine duration, and cloud cover, obtained from the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council (BARC). This data is employed to compute the standardized precipitation index (SPI), the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), and the Z ‐score index (ZSI). The focus of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of machine learning (ML) algorithms in predicting meteorological droughts in central region of Bangladesh from 1990 to 2022, using data from seven meteorological stations. SPI and SPEI were mapped within a GIS environment to assess drought hazards and identify key social and physical vulnerability factors. The random forest (RF) model demonstrated high performance in predicting SPI and SPEI, achieving an accuracy of 93.8%–94.0%, precision of 90.9%–92.7%, recall of 89.5%–92.0%, and F1‐scores of 90.3%–92.0%. Its error metrics included MAE (0.055–0.068), MSE (0.0032–0.0052), RMSE (0.056–0.072), and R 2 (0.914–0.965) across an 80% training and 20% testing split. Additionally, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model was used to predict future SPI and SPEI values for 2023–2030, helping to identify the timing of both short‐term and long‐term droughts. The study revealed that integrating ARIMA with ML algorithms improved forecasting accuracy, achieving over 92.0% accuracy in predicting SPI and SPEI, thereby significantly enhancing drought prediction capabilities.",

The current study aims to investigate the long‐term variability, trends, and change points in monthly, monsoon, and annual rainfall data from 1901 to 2020 in the Upper Krishna Basin (UKB). The analysis of the coefficient of variation (CV) revealed a 23% variation in monsoon rainfall and a 22% variation in annual rainfall, suggesting a moderate level of rainfall variability at the basin scale. The analysis of rainfall trends has incorporated the Mann–Kendall (MK) test, Sen’s slope estimator (SSE), percentage change techniques, and Pettitt’s test for the detection of change points. The MK‐test indicated a notable reduction in monsoon ( Z = −2.75) and annual ( Z = −2.43) rainfall in the UKB. This downward trend was linked to a significant decline in rainfall observed during June ( Z = −1.70) and July ( Z = −3.54). A reduction of about 41% in rainfall was recorded for July, which is typically regarded as the wettest month. Consequently, the monsoon (annual) rainfall exhibited a decrease of about 22% (18%) across the UKB from 1901 to 2020.

    "abstract": "The Tarim basin located in the western northwest China is the largest inland basin in the world and the core component of the arid region of the Central Asia. In recent years, the frequency of heavy rain and extreme precipitation events in the Tarim basin has increased substantially. It is imperative to enhance the understanding of the triggering and development mechanisms of heavy rain in this region. This study analyzes the atmospheric instability and triggering mechanisms of a short‐duration local heavy rainstorm event in the Tarim basin based on the moist potential vorticity (MPV) criterion. The results show that convective instability positively contributes to precipitation generation, while conditional symmetric instability assumes a pivotal role in its intensification. The cold air from northern short‐wave trough with moist air from southern short‐wave trough converge with the warm and dry air in the low layer of the Tarim basin, triggering the rapid release of convective available potential energy and the initiation of precipitation. Subsequently, the release of condensation latent heat and moist baroclinicity amplify the conditional symmetric instability in the lower atmosphere. The westerly wind over the mountains and the easterly wind in lower layers of the basin form intense vertical shear of horizontal wind. This vertical shear triggers the release of conditional symmetric instability energy, which stimulates further development of vertical motion and causes a sudden increase of precipitation. Although there are no obvious convective cloud systems, the rapid and intensive release of instability energy results in strong negative temperature variation, humidification, and wind shear, and their centers are overlapped. Such synoptic configurations are responsible for the local heavy rainstorm. The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding on the causes of short‐duration local rainstorms in arid areas and offer valuable insights for improving rainstorms predictability in the region.",

    "abstract": "The planting date, plant population, and variety are crucial factors that interact with the physical environment and hence, meticulously influence crop output and performance. To determine the impacts of planting time, spacing, and varietal effects on field pea crop phenology, growth and yield at the Indo‐Gangetic plains, the present experiment was designed for three rabi seasons. The treatments included four sowing dates from the first week of November to mid‐December, with 10‐day intervals, as the main plots; two varieties, that is, VL‐42 and Rachana,and two spacing treatments (S1: 30 cm × 10 cm and S2: 45 cm × 10 cm), were included as subsubplots. A gradual delay in field pea sowing from early November to mid‐December resulted in a 27% reduction in grain yield and VL‐42 (1256.2 kg ha −1 ) prominently outperformed Rachana by 26% in terms of grain yield (920.5 kg ha −1 ). Narrow‐spaced field pea crops presented significantly greater grain yields (1136.5 kg ha −1 ) than did wider crops (1040.2 kg ha −1 ). Microclimatic interactions of the treatments led to differences in the performance of the treatments. The field pea variety, VL‐42 accumulated relatively higher growing degree day (GDD) of 1883.4°C days and heliothermal unit (HTU) of 11,949.2°C day‐h compared to Rachana variety’s 1694.2°C days and 10,475.8°C day‐h, respectively. Variation in crop phenophase duration was also observed, as a delay in sowing leads to exposure to a relatively high thermal regime, significantly shortening the length of the growing period by nearly 10 days. Agroecological indices (i.e., GDD and HTU) are also affected by phenology resulting higher values in within mid‐November sown field pea crop compared to crops sown in mid December. Closely spaced (30 cm × 10 cm) field pea plants performed better in terms of grain yield, typically because of the greater plant population. Micrometeorological studies have indicated that in mid‐November, field pea plants that are exposed to approximately 20 to 25°C mean air temperatures during their growth stages perform best in this region. VL‐42 was found to be more climate resilient than Rachana and hence, can be adapted in the lower Gangetic plains of India for better yield potential.",

This study evaluates the impact of suspending activities at the La Oroya Metallurgical Complex (CMLO, by its Spanish acronym), one of the most relevant historical sources of SO 2 pollution in the Central Andes of Peru. Using remote sensing data (MODIS and Ozone Monitoring Instrument [OMI]), temporal and spatial trends in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and SO 2 concentrations were analyzed from 2000 to 2019. The results show an average reduction of 82.18% in SO 2 after the CMLO was stopped, accompanied by a significant positive increase in the NDVI trend ( p &lt; 0.05), which shows a recovery of the vegetation in surrounding areas. Vegetation regeneration showed marked spatial patterns to the southwest and southeast of the CMLO, influenced by the dispersion of pollutants through prevailing winds. However, the moderate relationship between the decrease in SO 2 and NDVI ( R 2 = 0.10) suggests the influence of additional factors, such as the historical accumulation of heavy metals, water scarcity, and the specific characteristics of high Andean soils and vegetation.",

The study results revealed that the average PM10 level in Al Muruj and Al Ghurabi was 75.73–346.00 μg/m 3 . There was a negative correlation ( r = −0.56) between temperature and wind speed (WS) and a positive correlation ( r = 0.46) between relative humidity (RH) and temperature. Polar plots over the winter months showed that winds coming from the west and southwest had the highest value at low WSs (&lt; 2 m s −1 ) and the lowest value at high WSs (&gt;3 m s −1 ). The relationship between various weather variables and PM10 levels was successfully illustrated using polar plots. Additional research on PM source distribution and modeling is necessary to support the establishment of an air quality index (AQI) and the development of a successful Riyadh air quality plan.",

    "abstract": "Thermodynamic profiles measured from the ground‐based microwave radiometer (MWR) have been widely utilized to enrich the atmospheric vertical observations, which however, are characterized by certain retrieval errors. Temperature and humidity retrievals from an in‐situ MWR are assessed against the corresponding radiosonde observations. Calibration experiments are conducted using methods of Kalman filter (KF), random forest (RF), neural network (NN), and time‐involved NN (TiNN), which are subsequently examined across various metrics. The significant errors of MWR retrievals vary with heights and are reduced to certain extents, via these calibration models. KF and RF both offer considerable calibrations on the MWR retrievals but perform inconsistently across different atmospheric layers. The TiNN model is demonstrated with the optimal performance, producing stable and accurate retrievals with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of no greater than 2.0 K and 20% across all heights for temperature and humidity, respectively. Corresponding improving magnitudes reach upto 60% relative to the raw MWR. Such superiority of the TiNN model demonstrates potential advantages of integrating associated auxiliary features, such as time tags into calibration models. The challenges in retrieving relative humidity compared to temperature might be linked to the lower signal‐to‐noise ratios in the moisture retrievals and greater sensitivity to environmental conditions due to indirect and complex nature of the measurements.",

    "abstract": "The weather prediction model system of Korea Air Force (KAF), based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, has been operated since 2007. This study incorporates recent physics parameterizations into the KAF‐WRF system and evaluates their impacts on the performance of the system in simulating winter precipitation, fog, and low‐level cloud events, as well as a real‐time winter precipitation forecast during 1‐month. Notably, the new physics suite simulates significantly reduced precipitation over mountainous regions, demonstrating greater agreement with actual observations for the winter precipitation case. The new physics suite considerably reduces cloud ice mixing ratios across all atmospheric layers while increasing cloud water and snow mixing ratios in the lower and upper layers, respectively. Higher cloud water mixing ratios in the new physics suite, compared to its old counterpart, result in simulations of greater amounts of low‐level clouds and broader regions of fog. Additional sensitivity experiments indicate that the revised WRF Double‐Moment 6‐class (WDM6) scheme is primarily responsible for the simulation of increased cloud water and decreased cloud ice mixing ratios. Meanwhile, the real‐time winter precipitation simulation conducted for January 2023, a period marked by significant temperature fluctuations and unusually heavy rainfall, reveals that the new physics suite enhances the ability of the KAF‐WRF system to predict heavy precipitation events while maintaining adequate performance for light precipitation events. Overall, these findings suggest that the KAF‐WRF system equipped with the new physics suite demonstrates better predictive capability for winter weather phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Accurate numerical weather prediction (NWP) is the foundation of high‐quality meteorological services. Although European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) products are widely used, they still exhibit systematic forecast errors. Multisource data fusion, as one of the correction methods, can significantly reduce forecast errors. Given the heterogeneity of geographical data, ground truth data, and satellite data, it is essential to establish a mechanism to effectively extract useful information from these multisource datasets while avoiding interference from noise and redundant information. Therefore, this article proposes a multisource data numerical forecast correction network (MSD‐NFCNet), which corrects the ECMWF 10‐m wind speed forecast by integrating FY4A satellite data, digital elevation models (DEMs), and ERA5 data. The MSD‐NFCNet incorporates a spatial resolution alignment module that uses the correction upsampling network (CUPS‐Net) and multiscale residual network (MSR‐Net) submodules to match the spatial grids of multisource heterogeneous data. Additionally, a multisource feature fusion module is designed to fuse the spatiotemporal features of the heterogeneous data. In this article, the MSD‐NFCNet is used to correct the 10‐m wind speed in the ECMWF product, and the results are compared with the original ECMWF forecast, ERA5 ground truth, and other correction methods. Experimental results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the corrected 10‐m wind speed using MSD‐NFCNet decreases by 61.03% compared to the ECMWF forecast, demonstrating that the proposed model significantly improves forecast accuracy.",

Numerical experiments have been performed in 3D by using the same domain size, with a different spatial and temporal resolution of the model. High‐resolution cloud model has been shown to represent convective processing quite well. Running the model in a high‐resolution mode gives a more realistic view of the life cycle of convective storm, internal structure, and storm behavior. The storm structure and evolutionary properties are evaluated by comparing the modeled radar reflectivity to the observed radar reflectivity. The comparative analysis between physical parameters shows good agreement among both model runs and compares well with observations, especially using a fine spatial resolution. The lack of measurements of these species in the convective outflow region does not allow us to evaluate the model results with observations. A three‐dimensional simulation using higher grid resolution mode exhibits interesting features which include a double vortex circulation, cell splitting, and secondary cell formation.",

Based on both AOD 550 and FM values three main aerosol types have been discriminated corresponding to urban/industrial aerosols, clean maritime conditions, and coarse‐mode, probably desert dust, particles. Five main sectors were identified for the classification of the air‐mass trajectories, which were further used in the analysis of the (AOD 550 and FM data for the three aerosol types). The HYSPLIT model was used to compute back trajectories at three altitudes to investigate the relation between AOD 550 ‐FM and wind sector depending on the altitude. The accumulation of local pollution is favored in spring and corresponds to air masses at lower altitudes originating from Eastern Europe and the Balkan. Clean maritime conditions are rare over Athens, limited in the winter season and associated with air masses from the Western or Northwestern sector. The coarse‐mode particles origin seems to be more complicated proportionally to the season. Thus, in summer the Northern sector dominates, while in the other seasons, and especially in spring, the air masses belong to the Southern sector enriched with Saharan dust aerosols.",

The El Niño-Southern Oscillation phenomenon affects summer and spring rainfall and the Southern Annular Mode involves spring precipitation but both only in the east of the study region.

A review of the first case study from the eastern Pacific Ocean shows that simultaneous aircraft and space‐borne observations are valuable in detecting links between ocean biota emissions and marine aerosols, but that the effect of the former on cloud microphysics is less clear owing to interference from background anthropogenic pollution and the difficulty with field experiments in obtaining a wide range of aerosol conditions to robustly quantify ocean effects on aerosol‐cloud interactions. To address these limitations, a second case was investigated using remote sensing data over the less polluted Southern Ocean region. The results indicate that cloud drop size is reduced more for a fixed increase in aerosol particles during periods of higher ocean chlorophyll A. Potential biases in the results owing to statistical issues in the data analysis are discussed.",

While the ACM2 is a valid model option for WRF, it has not yet been implemented for the chemical portion of the WRF/Chem model. Hence, the reported air quality modeling results using ACM2 are invalid. Furthermore, publication of these results gives the erroneous impression that the ACM2 model is not well suited for air quality applications when, in fact, it is the default boundary layer model in the community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model.",

Dust is varied from 3 to 10 times in the experiments, and the response is found to be nonmonotonic and depends on various environmental factors. The sensitivity studies show that adding dust in a wet system increases precipitation when IN effects are dominant. For a relatively dry system high concentrations of dust can result in overseeding the clouds and reductions in precipitation. However, when adding dust to a system with warmer cloud bases where drizzle formation is active, the response is nonmonotonic.",

    "abstract": "Actual evapotranspiration (ET A ) is a major term of site water balance whose knowledge is essential for numerous purposes. The classical ET A estimation approach based on the use of multitemporal crop coefficients (Kc) cannot be applied in water-limited environments without proper correction. Such correction can be theoretically obtained by means of soil water content (SWC) measurements, which, however, are affected by several drawbacks, due to both their technical and operational characteristics. The current paper proposes a method to normalize annual SWC datasets and integrate them in an ET A estimation procedure suitable for monitoring both agricultural and natural Mediterranean ecosystems. Differently from previous approaches, the SWC normalization is obtained using data-specific information, which renders the new method mostly insensitive to the mentioned problems. The method is first described and then applied in three case studies representative of different Mediterranean ecosystems (i.e., grassland, coniferous, and deciduous forests). The results are evaluated versus latent heat measurements taken by eddy covariance flux towers. Satisfactory accuracy is obtained in all three case studies, with advantages and limitations which are discussed in the final concluding sections.",

We show that climate change only marginally affects air quality over the 20-year period studied. An exposure assessment reveals that the population of Stockholm can expect considerably lower NO 2 exposure in the future, mainly due to reduced local NOx emissions. Ozone exposure will decrease only slightly, due to a combination of increased concentrations in the city centre and decreasing concentrations in the suburban areas. The increase in ozone concentration is a consequence of decreased local NOx emissions, which reduces the titration of the long-range transported ozone. Finally, we evaluate the consequences of a planned road transit project on future air quality in Stockholm. The construction of a very large bypass road (including one of the largest motorway road tunnels in Europe) will only marginally influence total population exposure, this since the improved air quality in the city centre will be complemented by deteriorated air quality in suburban, residential areas.",

The simulations suggest that introducing low-sulfur fuel would decrease the monthly mean 24 h-averaged concentrations over the city’s nonattainment area by 4%, 9%, 8%, 6%, 5%, and 7% in October, November, December, January, February, and March, respectively. The quarterly mean relative response factors for of 0.96 indicate that with a design value of 44.7 μ g/m 3 introducing low-sulfur fuel would lead to a new design value of 42.9 μ g/m 3 that still exceeds the US National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 35 μ g/m 3 . The magnitude of the relation between the relative response of sulfate and nitrate changes differs with temperature.

We found that agricultural development resulted in warming and rainy effects. In the middle to lower reaches of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, the warming effects were approximately 0.6°C and resulted from increased surface net radiation and sensible heat fluxes. In Northeast China, the warming effects were very small due to increases in latent heat fluxes which resulted from the extensive conversion from grassland to cropland. The rainy effect resulted from increases in convective rainfall, which was associated with a warming surface in certain areas of the Yellow River and Yangtze River and a large increase in the surface moisture flux in Northeast China. Conversely, in the middle to lower reaches of the Yellow River and the Yangtze River, the grid-scale rainfall decreased because the climatological northward wind, which is moist and warm, was partially offset by a southward wind anomaly. These findings suggest that the agricultural development left footprints not only on the present climate but also on the historical climate changes before the industrial revolution.",

The results show that dust aerosols in sandstorms can change the radiation heating rate of the atmosphere, heating the air in the middle and low troposphere and cooling Earth’s surface. The climate effects of continuous and intense sandstorms in April in NWC can reach downstream areas such as Southeast and Northeast China and can persist for months. The dust aerosols in sandstorms can enhance diabatic heating and moisture loss. Therefore, dust storms lead to the environment in NWC becoming warmer and dryer. Through analysis of the dust tracer total burden, we identified that the enhancement of the dust total burden in the arid region illustrated that the DRE of dust aerosol in sandstorm process can react with the dust emission, thus forming a self-feedback loop.

In particular, a small spike in the actual evapotranspiration distribution occurred during the soil ablation period due to the higher temperature and sufficient soil moisture associated with soil thawing. This period is accompanied by a series of physical processes, such as moisture transfer and heat exchange.",

Here, we use an innovative network of highly portable, low-cost thermometers to report on high -frequency (1-min time resolution) surface air temperature fluctuations and lapse rates (LR) in a ~800-m elevational range (from 3,675 to 4,492 m a.s.l.) across the glacier Olivares Gamma in the central Andes, Chile. Temperatures were measured during an intense field campaign in late Southern summer, 19–27 March 2015, under varying weather conditions. We found a complex dependence of high-frequency LR on time of day, topography, and wider meteorological conditions, with hourly temperature variations during this week that were probably mainly associated with short- and long-wave radiation changes and not with wind speed/direction changes. Using various pairs of sites within our station network, we also analyze spatial variations in LR. Uniquely in this study, we compare temperatures measured at heights of 1-m and 2-m above the glacier surface for the network of five sites and found that temperatures at these two heights occasionally differed by more than ±4°C during the early afternoons, although the mean temperature difference is much smaller (~0.3°C). An implication of our results is that daily, hourly, or even monthly averaged LR may be insufficient for feeding into accurate melt models of glacier change, with the adoption of subhourly (ideally 1–10-min) resolution LR likely to prove fruitful in developing new innovative high-time-resolution melt modelling. Our results are potentially useful as input LR for local glacier melt models and for improving the understanding of lapse rate fluctuations and glacier response to climate change.",

The six National Multimodel Ensemble (NMME) models and the ECMWF seasonal model were used to calculate an International Multimodel Ensemble (IMME). The study presents the performance of both monthly and seasonal predictions of precipitation accumulated over three months, with respect to different lead times for the ensemble mean values, one per individual model. Additionally, we analyzed the performance of different combinations of models. We present verification of seasonal forecasting using real forecasts, focusing on a small domain characterized by complex terrain, high annual precipitation variability, and a sharp precipitation gradient from west to east as well as from south to north. The results in this study show that, in general, the monthly analysis does not provide very accurate results, even when using the IMME for one-month lead time. We found that the IMME outperformed any single model prediction. Our analysis indicates that the optimal combinations with the high correlation values contain at least three models. Moreover, prediction with larger number of models in the ensemble produces more robust predictions. The results obtained in this study highlight the advantages of using an ensemble of global models over single models for small domain.",

The ENSO phases are identified based on the 0.5°C sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly over Nino 3 region. The study has brought out few stations showing increasing and a few decreasing seasonal rainfall trends for JJAS season, while there is no change in the annual rainfall for the catchment. Monthly and seasonal rainfall of all the selected stations showed negative correlation with the sea surface temperature (SST) over the Nino-3 region index during JJAS season with varying magnitudes. During the warm phase of ENSO, below average rainfall is prominent for JJAS season over many stations. The rainfall especially during early September showed a significant below average rainfall during the warm ENSO phase. The seasonal rainfall during neutral and cold ENSO phases does not experience similar significant changes as seen during warm ENSO phase.

The results show that there is long-term memory for the OLR time series over the TP and IMR. The long-range memory behaviors of OLR over TP are stronger than those over IMR. The averaged values of the scaling exponents over TP and IMR are 0.71 and 0.64; the maximum values in the two regions are 0.81 and 0.75; the minimum values are 0.59 and 0.58. The maximum frequency counts for scaling exponents occur in the range of 0.625 and 0.675 both in TP and in IMR. The spatial distribution of the scaling exponents of the OLR sequence is closely related to the conditions of climatic high cloud cover in the two areas. The high cloud cover over TP is obviously less than that of IMR. In addition, the scaling behaviors of OLR over TP and IMR are caused by the fractal characteristics of time series, which is further proved by randomly disrupting the time series to remove trends and correlation.",

A 95% significance test is also applied to verify LRCs by resampling the temperature and precipitation records 10000 times in Beijing. The values of scaling exponent from original temperature and precipitation records are larger than the upper range value of the interval threshold after shuffling the data records, which implies there are positive LRCs. For temperature records, the value of scaling exponent calculated by FA is greater than those by DFA1–3 at all four stations. This indicates that the FA curve overestimates the scaling behavior due to the effect of trends. By contrast, the values of scaling exponent in precipitation are almost the same by using FA and DFA1–3 for all time scales, respectively. Furthermore, there are crossovers on short time scales in different orders DFA1–3 for the temperature records, while the slopes keep almost consistent on all time scales for the precipitation records.",

The spatial distribution characteristics of built-up area and amount of annual average runoff interception in sponge cities were explored in five different zonal scale levels. Assuming that the sponge cities have been built at the national-level construction land and the volume capture ratio of annual runoff is taken as 85%, the amount of annual average runoff interception in sponge cities is 988.58 × 10 8 m 3 during 1961 to 2011 in China, where the annual precipitation is greater than or equal to 400 mm. The cities with more amount of annual average runoff interception are mostly distributed in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta. As to the Haihe River Basin, the annual average amount of surface water resources is 135.69 × 10 8 m 3 between 2005 and 2014, and the amount of annual average runoff interception is 219.58 × 10 8 m 3 from 1961 to 2011. The construction of sponge cities has the greatest impact on the surface water resources in the Haihe River Basin. Taking 80%–85% as the volume capture ratio of annual runoff in sponge cities is not reasonable, which may lead to the irrational exploitation and utilization of regional water and soil resources.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the vertical differentiation of water vapor over Europe on a seasonal basis and also to evaluate the role of atmospheric circulation in changes therein. Daily values of specific humidity (SHUM) for the time period 1981–2015 were obtained from pressure levels available from ECMWF Era-Interim reanalysis data and used in the study. Eight grid points were analyzed in detail. Each point is representative of a region with different moisture conditions. SHUM profiles were then used to identify cases of moisture inversion. Horizontal flux of specific humidity (SHUMF) was analyzed for principal pressure levels that occur in both inversion-type and inversion-free situations. In addition, SHUM and SHUMF anomalies were identified for advection directions. The research results showed the existence of differences in the vertical structure of water vapor content in the troposphere over Europe, and the Northeastern Atlantic and the presence of moisture inversions not only in areas north of 60°N but also in temperate and subtropical zones. Inversions can occur in two different forms—surface-based and elevated. The occurrence of inversions varies with the seasons. The role of atmospheric circulation is observable in the winter and triggers both surpluses and shortages of moisture via the effect of specific pressure system types (significant role of seasonal pressure high) and via advection directions. In addition, there exists a clear difference between the structure of moisture in the atmospheric boundary layer and in the free atmosphere.",

    "abstract": "Trend and an abrupt regime shift of temperature extremes were investigated based on diurnal data at 116 meteorological stations in the Northeast China region during 1957–2015. A total of 10 temperature indices divided into two categories: extremely cold and warm indices, were used in this study. The Mann–Kendall (MK) test was employed to evaluate the trend in temperature while changepoint, an R package for changepoint analysis, was used to detect changes in the mean levels of temperature extreme data series. The results of this study reveal that occurrence frequencies of the extreme cold night (TN10p) and extreme warm night (TN90p) have decreased and increased by −1.67 and 1.79 days/decade, respectively. Moreover, variations in temperature extremes have not been uniform with warming trends in minimum temperature being rapidly compared to maximum temperature extremes. The diurnal temperature range (DTR) depicted a remarkable decrease as a result of rapid warming in the minimum temperature. Warming in the region led to a reduction in the number of frost days (FD) and icing days (ID) and an increase in the number of growing season length (GSL) and tropical nights (Tr). Seasonally, TN10p largely decreased in winter and spring, while TNn and TN90p largely increased in winter and summer, respectively. Spatially, most of the stations with a significant warming trend in minimum temperatures were located in the Changbai Mountain, Greater Khingan Range, and Lesser Khingan Range. This implies that the mountainous regions are more sensitive and vulnerable to warming than the plain regions. On the contrary, most stations located in the Songnen Plain, Sanjiang Plain, and Liao River Plain displayed significant positive trend GSL and Tr. These climate extreme trends show that the region is experiencing warming which may have an impact on the hydrological process, ecological process, and agricultural production capacity.",

Three stair steps are identified to represent the upper, middle, and lower reaches of the YRB due to complex topography elevations over the different subregions of the YRB. The summer diurnal precipitation over the YRB shows significant spatial and temporal variations. The diurnal peaks in precipitation over the upper and middle reaches of the YRB occur in the evening and late afternoon, respectively. By contrast, double peaks in diurnal precipitation occur in the early morning and late afternoon over the lower reaches of the YRB. The diurnal peaks in summer precipitation along the YRB have an eastward transition, suggested to be associated with the westerlies transporting water vapor. Differing from the increasing tendency of summer hourly precipitation from west to east across the YRB with topography elevations decreased, a distinct reduction in hourly precipitation is observed over the transition region between the first and second stair steps in the YRB. Further analysis attributes this phenomenon to the regional descending airflow induced by the steep terrain along the slope of the Tibetan Plateau (TP).",

    "abstract": "Precipitation pattern has changed over many regions in recent decades, which may cause the risk of flood or drought. In this study, the main objective is to evaluate the spatiotemporal variability of precipitation in Beijing from 1960 to 2012. First, the mean monthly, seasonal, and annual precipitation series were used to analyze the temporal variation using regression, Mann–Kendall (M-K) test, Sen’s slope, and Pettitt tests. The results showed that the annual mean precipitation had a clear decreasing trend, with the statistically significant decrease in summer (especially in July and August) and significant increase in spring (especially in May). Although the decreasing trend is shown in the precipitation concentration indicators, the temporal uneven distribution of precipitation has unchanged. Subsequently, the precipitation time series at 30 stations over Beijing were used to evaluate the changes in precipitation pattern. The results showed that the annual series for the most rain gauges had decreasing trends with gradual changes. The spatial distribution of precipitation and other indices is geographically consistent, reflecting the principal physiographic and climatic conditions. At the same time, the effects of the terrain and urban development on the precipitation spatial distribution were detected. Generally, the large and heavy precipitations frequently occur in the plain areas, while the precipitation in the mountain areas is dominated by the small and medium precipitation. As a whole, the total precipitation in the plain areas (558.8 mm) was slightly higher than that in the mountainous areas (533.0 mm), while the precipitation in the urban areas (575.9 mm) was much higher than in the surrounding suburb areas (538.9 mm) during 1960–2012. The differences between the plain and mountainous areas during the period of 1960–1979, 1980–1999, and 2000–2012 were 24.2 mm, 32.6 mm, and 17.7 mm, respectively. The differences in precipitation between the urban and suburb areas for the three periods were 32.9 mm, 45.2 mm, and 31.0 mm, respectively, with the amount accounting for 5.51%, 7.66%, and 5.94% of the mean precipitation in the urban areas for the corresponding periods.",

Temperature and rainfall changes in three periods including 2011–2030, 2046–2065, and 2080–2099 were downscaled and studied using 15 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, Phase 3 (CMIP3) climatic models, under three scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions A2, B1, and A1B, from the database of the LARS-WG model. The difference in the amount of changes in temperature and rainfall in these three periods and the observational amounts under the 15 models indicated the uncertainty of the changes values. To reduce this uncertainty and limit the results to the management and planning of water resources, ensemble approach was considered. For the preparation of the ensemble approach, the parameters from the files of the 15-model scenarios were averaged so that a climatic ensemble model could be obtained for each period. Then, the runoffs of the next three periods, under the second approach and three emission scenarios, were produced using the feedforwad neural network. The results indicated an increase in the average monthly maximum temperature and the minimum temperature in all three periods under the three scenarios. The results also showed a decrease in the rainfall in the early months of the year as well as an increase in the rainfall in the spring in most scenarios. Generally, the average annual rainfall in all these three periods under the climatic ensemble model, and three emission scenarios showed a reduction in the average annual rainfall in the three periods. The maximum amount of reduction was in 2080–2099 (101 mm) under the scenario B1. Besides, a reduction occurred in the average runoff of the catchment under three ensemble models and the emission scenario in all three periods, as compared to the average of the long-term observational values in most years.",

Wind data at 10 m above the ground and the radiosonde data in the lower 60 m of the surface boundary layer were used over the period from January 2013 to December 2016. Based on Monin–Obukhov theory, the logarithmic and power laws have allowed characterizing the wind profile. The error estimators of the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were, respectively, evaluated at 0.025; 0.016 (RMSE; MAE) and 0.018; 0.015. At the site of Cotonou, the atmosphere is generally unstable from 09:00 to 18:00 MST and stable for the remainder of the time. The annual mean value of the wind shear coefficient is estimated at 0.20 and that of the ground surface roughness length and friction velocity are, respectively, of 0.007 m, 0.38 m·s −1 . A comparative study between the wind extrapolation models and the data was carried out in order to test their reliability on our study site. The result of this is that whatever the time of the year is, only the models proposed (best fitting equation) are always in good agreement with the data unlike the other models evaluated. Finally, from the models suitable for our site, the profile of wind convective diurnal cycle was obtained by extrapolation of the wind data measured at 10 m from the ground. The average wind speed during this cycle is therefore evaluated to 8.07 m·s −1 for August which is the windiest month and to 4.98 m·s −1 for the least windy month (November) at 60 m of the ground. Considering these results, we can so consider that the site of Cotonou coastal could be suitable for the installation of wind turbines.",

    "abstract": "The main objective of this study was to analyze the perception of the influence of various weather conditions on patients with rheumatic pathology. A group of 394 patients, aged between 39 and 87 years and diagnosed with degenerative rheumatic diseases, were interviewed individually by using a questionnaire created specifically for this study. Further on, to assess the relationship between pain intensity and weather conditions, a frequency analysis based on Pearson’s correlation matrix was employed. The most important results are as follows: the great majority of the participants (more than 75%) believe that their rheumatic pain is definitely or to a great extent influenced by different weather conditions; most of the patients reported intensification of their pain with weather worsening, especially when cloudiness and humidity suddenly increase (83.8% and 82.0%, respectively), air temperature suddenly decreases (81.5%), and in fog or rain conditions (81.2%). In our research, alongside simple meteorological variables, we established that complex weather variables such as atmospheric fronts, in particular, the cold ones and winter anticyclonic conditions, greatly intensify the rheumatic pain, whereas summer anticyclonic conditions usually lead to a decrease in pain severity. In terms of relationships between pain intensity and weather conditions, we found the strongest correlations (ranging between 0.725 and 0.830) when temperature, relative humidity, and cloudiness are constantly high.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the impacts of different physical parameterization schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting model with the ARW dynamical core (WRF-ARW model) on the forecasts of heavy rainfall over the northern part of Vietnam (Bac Bo area). Various physical model configurations generated from different typical cumulus, shortwave radiation, and boundary layer and from simple to complex cloud microphysics schemes are examined and verified for the cases of extreme heavy rainfall during 2012–2016. It is found that the most skilled forecasts come from the Kain–Fritsch (KF) scheme. However, relating to the different causes of the heavy rainfall events, the forecast cycles using the Betts–Miller–Janjic (BMJ) scheme show better skills for tropical cyclones or slowly moving surface low-pressure system situations compared to KF scheme experiments. Most of the sensitivities to KF scheme experiments are related to boundary layer schemes. Both configurations using KF or BMJ schemes show that more complex cloud microphysics schemes can also improve the heavy rain forecast with the WRF-ARW model for the Bac Bo area of Vietnam.",

    "abstract": "Climate models provide information that resource managers, policy makers, and researchers can use when planning for the future. While this information is valuable in the broad sense, the low spatial-resolution often lacks local details that resource managers and decision makers need to plan for their communities. Therefore, statistically downscaled climate projections provide a high-resolution output and offer local information that is more beneficial than coarse-resolution global climate model output. In the Red River Basin, located in the south-central U.S., this detailed information is used to develop long-term water plans. This area is prone to drought conditions and heavy precipitation events, and studies have consistently estimated that this will continue in the future. This paper introduces a dataset of statistically downscaled climate projections of daily minimum and maximum temperature and daily precipitation that is a useful tool for studies regarding climatological and hydrological aspects in the region. The dataset was created using two quantile mapping techniques to downscale the CCSM4, MPI-ESM-LR, and MIROC5 model outputs to a 0.1-degree spatial resolution. Furthermore, we describe the added value of coproduction of knowledge between climate scientists and end users, or in this case impacts modelers and decision makers, for creating climate projections that can be used for climate risk assessments. A case study of the data’s development and application is provided, detecting the mean daily changes in temperature and precipitation through the end of the century in the Red River Basin for two representative concentration pathways. After applying the users’ inputs to develop the datasets, results for this example estimate an increase in mean daily precipitation in the eastern portion of the basin and as much as a 15% decline in the west by the end of the century. Furthermore, mean daily temperature is expected to rise across the entire basin in all scenarios by up to 6–7°C.",

    "abstract": "Precipitation efficiency (PE) is a crucial physical quantity in convective processes, describing the efficiency of rainfall generation from cloud detrainment. Although the importance of PE in extreme precipitation events is widely accepted, the evolution of PE in the warming climate and the associated moisture processes in East Asia are still not well understood. To address these issues, the interdecadal variability of PE in East Asia during summer in 1979–2016 is investigated in this study. Two major modes of summertime precipitation efficiency are identified using Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis. The leading EOF mode (EOF1) has a dipole pattern that reveals the variations of mean precipitation efficiency. The second EOF mode (EOF2) presents a quadrupole pattern that shows changes in the variability of precipitation efficiency. Both EOF modes exhibit significant interdecadal variability (IDV). The IDV of EOF1 is closely associated with the phase change of the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). The Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies associated with the PDO can excite wind anomalies that significantly modulate moisture transport and further alter the mean precipitation efficiency in East Asia. The IDV of EOF2 can be attributed to the interdecadal change of occurrence frequency of Eastern Pacific El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, which affect water vapor transport by inducing an East Asia-Pacific teleconnection-like wave train anomaly pattern. The IDV patterns of precipitation efficiency for both the mean value and variability will improve the ability to predict precipitation in East Asia.",

To clarify the influence of the underlying surface change on the near-surface atmospheric boundary layer, gradient tower data and Eddy covariance data in 2017 were analyzed. The results were as follows: the wind profile can be divided into the nocturnal stable boundary layer and the daytime unstable boundary in spring, summer, and autumn, while the wind profile dominating nighttime stability in winter. During the study period, the four-season temperature profiles can be divided into four types: night radiation type, morning transition type, daylight solar radiation type, and evening transition type, and the temperature difference between spring and summer is more than that of autumn and winter. The vertical temperature lapse rate can reach 4.5°C/100 m in spring and summer, while the vertical temperature lapse rate is 0.5°C/100 m in winter. The special humidity value in summer and spring is greater than autumn and winter. The profile is almost in the inverse humidity state at almost all periods in winter. The inverse humidity phenomenon occurred on the autumn night. Besides, the specific humidity is closely related to the temperature and the near-surface wind speed. The “rapid change” of the underlying surface of the spring desert region affects the surface energy budget, which affects the turbulent energy and the stability of the near-surface layer, thus affecting the changes in temperature, humidity, and wind profile.",

Therefore, it is necessary to determine the particle size distribution. However, the particle size distribution determined by the particle extinction efficiency factor according to the Mie scattering theory is an ill-conditioned integral equation, namely, the Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, which is very difficult to solve. To avoid solving such an integral equation, the BP neural network prediction model was established. In the model, the aerosol optical depth obtained by sun photometer CE-318 and kernel functions obtained by Mie scattering theory were used as the inputs of the neural network, particle size distributions collected by the aerodynamic particle sizer APS 3321 were used as the output, and the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm with the fastest descending speed was adopted to train the model. For verifying the feasibility of the prediction model, some experiments were carried out. The results show that BP neural network has a better prediction effect than that of the RBF neural network and is an effective method to obtain the aerosol particle size distribution of the whole atmosphere column using the data of CE-318 and APS 3321.",

Those that could descent to the troposphere were composited to investigate their impacts on the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM). It reveals that when the SSW occurs, the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) are both in the negative phase and that the tropospheric circulation is quite wave-like. The Siberian high and the Aleutian low are both strengthened, leading to an increased gradient between the Asian continent and the North Pacific. Hence, a strong EAWM is observed with widespread cooling over inland and coastal East Asia. After the peak of the SSW, in contrast, the tropospheric circulation is quite zonally symmetric with negative phases of AO and NPO. The mid-tropospheric East Asian trough deepens and shifts eastward. This configuration facilitates warming over the East Asian inland and cooling over the coastal East Asia centered over Japan. The activities of planetary waves during the lifecycle of the SSW were analyzed. The anomalous propagation and the attendant altered amplitude of the planetary waves can well explain the observed circulation and the EAWM.",

The basin has a marked continental monsoon climate and its water resources are especially vulnerable to climate change. Projected runoff in the basin for the period from 2001 to 2030 was simulated using the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrology model. VIC was first calibrated using observations and then was driven by the precipitation and temperature projected by the RegCM3 high-resolution regional climate model under the IPCC scenario A2. Results show that, under the scenario A2, the mean annual temperature of the basin could increase by 1.6°C, while mean annual precipitation could decrease by 2.6%. There could be an 11.6% reduction in annual runoff in the basin according to the VIC projection. However, there are marked regional variations in these climate change impacts. Reductions of 13.6%, 25.7%, and 24.6% could be expected in the regions of Hekouzhen to Longmen, Longmen to Sanmenxia, and Sanmenxia to Huayuankou, respectively. Our study suggests that the condition of water resources in the YRB could become more severe in the period from 2001 to 2030 under the scenario A2.",

First, a seeded region growing (SRG) algorithm is used with artificial neural network (ANN) cloud classification as preprocessing to identify consistent homogeneous Cb patches from infrared images. Second, a cross-correlation-based approach is used to track Cb patches within an image sequence. Third, 7 pixel parameters and 19 cloud patch parameters of Cb are derived. To assess the performance of the proposed method, 8 cases exhibiting different life stages and the temporal evolution of a single case are analyzed. The results show that (1) the proposed method is capable of locating and tracking Cb until dissipation and can account for the eventual splitting or merging of clouds; (2) compared to traditional brightness temperature (TB) thresholds-based cloud tracking methods, the proposed method reduces the uncertainty stemming from TB thresholds by classifying clouds with multichannel data in an advanced manner; and (3) the configuration and developmental stages of Cb that the method identifies are close to reality, suggesting that the characterization of Cb can provide detailed insight into the study of the motion and development of thunderstorms.",

    "abstract": "Various methods are used to locate cloud-to-ground lightning flashes. Even though a higher cost is incurred, a network of sensor stations is preferable to a single station due to the improved accuracy. For a single station measuring system, the accuracy of its analyses is mostly based on the chosen mathematical equations which can be solved in either linear or nonlinear mode. The sensitivity of the measuring equipment used is also particularly significant. This paper concentrates on the modelling of time of arrival (TOA) technique for locating a lightning flash by utilizing three broadband antennas. Consequently, by employing the developed model, the influences of geometric parameters on the accuracy of the model are evaluated. Therefore, a Matlab based simulation of the measuring system is developed. In the developed codes, randomly located lightning flash with its corresponding electromagnetic radiation was modelled. Results show that parameters such as lightning path shape, distance of the leader, and leader location can directly affect the accuracy of the TOA technique for extracting the azimuth and elevation.",

For each location, the prominent midtropospheric pattern, mesoscale feature, and predetermined thermodynamic variables were used to classify each 1% rainfall event. Individual events were then compared with other cases throughout the basin. The most profound results were that the magnitudes of the thermodynamic variables such as convective available potential energy and precipitable water values were poor predictors of the amount of rainfall produced in these extreme events. Further, the mesoscale forcings had more of an impact during the warm season and for the westernmost locations, whereas synoptic forcings were extremely prevalent during the cold season at the easternmost locations in the basin. The implications of this research are aimed at improving the forecasting of heavy precipitation at individual weather forecasts offices within the basin through the identified patterns at various scales.",

Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in hydrological processes and is important for plant growth and ecosystem stability. To investigate the relationship between climatic factors (air temperature and precipitation) and SM during the growing season in various climate zones on the QTP, data from three observational stations were analyzed. The results showed that the daily average (T ave ) and minimum air temperatures (T min ) significantly influenced SM levels at all depths analyzed (i.e., 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 cm deep) at the three stations, and T min had a stronger effect on SM than did T ave . However, the daily maximum air temperature (T max ) generally had little effect on SM, although it had showed some effects on SM in the middle and deeper layers at the Jiali station. Precipitation was an important factor that significantly influenced the SM at all depths at the three stations, but the influence on SM in the middle and deep layers lagged the direct effect on near-surface SM by 5–7 days. These results suggest that environment characterized by lower temperatures and higher precipitation may promote SM conservation during the growing season and in turn support ecosystem stability on the QTP.",

To comparatively analyze variations in PM2.5 pollution, hourly monitoring data and 24 h meteorological data were collected. Air quality observations revealed large spatiotemporal variation in PM2.5 concentrations in Handan, Zhengzhou, Xi’an, Yuncheng, Chengdu, Xiangyang, and Jinan. The daily mean PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 111.35 to 227.23 μg·m−³, with concentration being highest in Zhengzhou. Hourly mean PM2.5 concentration presented multiple U-shaped curves, with higher values at night and lower values during the day. The ratios of PM2.5 to PM10 were large in target cities and the results of multiscale geographic weighted regression model (MGWR) and Pearson correlation coefficients showed that PM2.5 had a significant positive or negative correlation with PM10, CO, NO2, and SO2. The concentration of PM2.5 was closely related to the combustion of fossil fuels and other organic compounds, indicating the large contribution of secondary aerosols to PM2.5 concentrations. The analysis of meteorological conditions showed that low temperature, low wind speed, and high relative humidity could aggravate the accumulation of regional pollutants in winter. Northwestern trajectory clusters were predominant contributions except in Jinan, and the highest PM2.5 concentrations in target cities were associated with short trajectory clusters in winter. The potential sources calculated by Weight Potential Source Contribution Function (WPSCF) and Weight Concentration-Weighted Trajectory (WCWT) models were similar and the highest values of the WPSCF (&gt;0.5) and the WCWT (&gt;100 μg·m−³) were mainly distributed in densely populated, industrial, arid, and semiarid regions.",

The empirical results are as follows. (1) From 2010 to 2019, carbon dioxide emissions from Heilongjiang Province’s tourism industry and its subsector increased steadily, of which the tourism industry accounted for a relatively large amount of carbon dioxide emissions in “Transport, Storage, and Post.” (2) Time series analysis reveals that the carbon dioxide emissions of tourism basically show an increasing trend and there are still multiple decoupling relationships with economic growth. Expansive decoupling and weak decoupling have occurred more frequently. (3) Spatial analysis reveals that the carbon dioxide emissions of the regional tourism industry show a fluctuating upward trend. The tourism industry in Harbin has significantly higher carbon dioxide emissions than in other regions. In addition, this study provides feasible suggestions and countermeasures for low-carbon tourism development in Heilongjiang Province. The findings are considered useful in future planning of energy conservation and emission reduction in Heilongjiang Province and the regional tourism industry.",

To account for the spatiotemporal autocorrelation structures of monitoring data and to model the uncertainties attached to the prediction, conventional multi-Gaussian kriging is extended to the space-time domain. Multi-Gaussian space-time kriging presented in this paper is based on decomposition of the PM 10 concentrations into deterministic trend and stochastic residual components. The deterministic trend component is modelled and regionalized using the temporal elementary functions. For the residual component which is the main target for space-time kriging, spatiotemporal autocorrelation information is modeled and used for space-time mapping of the residual. The conditional cumulative distribution functions (ccdfs) are constructed by using the trend and residual components and space-time kriging variance. Then, the PM 10 concentration estimate and conditional variance are empirically obtained from the ccdfs at all locations in the study area. A case study using the monthly PM 10 concentrations from 2007 to 2011 in the Seoul metropolitan area, Korea, illustrates the applicability of the presented method. The presented method generated time-series PM 10 concentration mapping results as well as supporting information for interpretations, and led to better prediction performance, compared to conventional spatial kriging.",

The analysis shows an increase of African air masses with height, presenting a different spatial impact over Spain, with a decreasing occurrence and a decrease in the simultaneous occurrence percentage from south to north. On average, the 7 Be activity concentrations during these events show an increase of concentrations in central (21%) and southern (18%) areas and a decrease in northern (13%) Spain.

Mesoscale accuracy was assessed for the total rainfall accumulated during the 24-hour event, using the Météo France operational rain-gauge network. Local scale accuracy was assessed for both total event rainfall and hourly rainfall accumulations, using the recently developed HydraVitis high-resolution rain gauge network Evaluation shows that (1) PANTHERE radar-based QPE underestimates rainfall fields at mesoscale and local scale; (2) both PANTHERE and ANTILOPE successfully reproduced the spatial variability of rainfall at local scale; (3) PANTHERE underestimates can be significantly improved at local scale by merging these data with rain gauge data interpolation (i.e., ANTILOPE). This study provides a preliminary evaluation of radar-based QPE at local scale, suggesting that merged products are invaluable for applications at very high resolution.

    "abstract": "Meteorological disasters have brought a great negative impact on people’s lives. With the rapid development of modern science and technology, the detection technology of meteorological disasters has been continuously improved. At present, satellite remote sensing detection technology has made gratifying achievements, and it has a good application in meteorological disaster prediction. In this paper, the application of satellite remote sensing technology in the process of meteorological disaster monitoring is discussed in depth. In traditional work, the accuracy and timeliness of meteorological disaster monitoring is the key and difficult point of meteorological disaster prevention. Using satellite telemetry to monitor meteorological disasters can effectively improve the accuracy and timeliness of meteorological disaster monitoring, provide reasonable solutions and decision-making basis for meteorological disaster prevention, and achieve the purpose of disaster prevention and mitigation. This paper introduces the basic principle, technical system, and important role of satellite remote sensing technology, expounds on the application of satellite remote sensing technology in the monitoring of agricultural meteorological disasters such as water, drought, freezing, and hail, and provides a scientific reference for farmers, agricultural sustainability, and agricultural decision-making. The continuous development of our country’s modern social economy has put forward higher requirements for agricultural production. Traditional monitoring technology can no longer meet the needs of agricultural meteorological disaster monitoring. The scientific application of remote sensing monitoring technology has important value, which can effectively improve the detection level and make it have higher accuracy and real-time performance, thereby promoting modern agricultural production in China. Based on the analysis of the application value of remote sensing monitoring technology, this paper comprehensively discusses the specific conditions of different disasters monitored by remote sensing monitoring technology in agricultural production.",

    "abstract": "Air pollution is one of humanity's most critical environmental issues and is considered contentious in several countries worldwide. As a result, accurate prediction is critical in human health management and government decision-making for environmental management. In this study, three artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, namely group method of data handling neural network (GMDHNN), extreme learning machine (ELM), and gradient boosting regression (GBR) tree, are used to predict the hourly concentration of PM2.5 over a Dorset station located in Canada. The investigation has been performed to quantify the effect of data length on the AI modeling performance. Accordingly, nine different ratios (50/50, 55/45, 60/40, 65/35, 70/30, 75/25, 80/20, 85/15, and 90/10) are employed to split the data into training and testing datasets for assessing the performance of applied models. The results showed that the data division significantly impacted the model's capacity, and the 60/40 ratio was found more suitable for developing predictive models. Furthermore, the results showed that the ELM model provides more precise predictions of PM2.5 concentrations than the other models. Also, a vital feature of the ELM model is its ability to adapt to the potential changes in training and testing data ratio. To summarize, the results reported in this study demonstrated an efficient method for selecting the optimal dataset ratios and the best AI model to predict properly which would be helpful in the design of an accurate model for solving different environmental issues.",

Data on numerical simulations, radar-derived rainfall, rain gauge-derived rainfall, and weather conditions were applied. Areas with seeding and nonseeding effects were classified according to the numerical simulation results and wind system, and enhanced rainfall was determined by comparing the changes in rainfall between the two areas. The amount of water resources was determined by considering the area of the seeding effect and rainfall density. As a result, 1.74 mm (4.75 million tons) of rainfall increased from the experiment on forest fire prevention, 0.84 mm (1.30 million tons) on drought mitigation, and 2.78 mm (24.44 million tons) on dust reduction. Thus, an average rainfall of 1.0 mm could be achieved through the experiment. These results helped verify the pure seeding effect and achieve the experimental purpose.",

However, for the design of hydrological and hydraulic systems, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of flood event characteristics, including volumes, peaks, time of occurrence, and duration. This study utilizes copula functions for bivariate modeling of flood peak and volume characteristics, examining the performance of four Archimedean copulas in the Guder basin located in Ethiopia from 1987 to 2017. Flood peak and volume were extracted using the theory of runs for analysis of their joint characteristics with the truncation level chosen as equal to the lowest annual maximum event. Univariate distributions with the best fitness on both variables were determined, and results showed that gamma and GEV-fitted flood peaks and lognormal-fitted flood volumes are the most suitable. Four Archimedean copulas were evaluated, and the Gumbel-Hougaard copula was found to be the best fit for the data based on graphical and measurable tests. Bivariate probability and return period were computed in “AND” and “OR” states. The joint return period for flood peak (97.49 m3/s) and volume (77.35 m3/s) was found to be 15 years in the “AND” state and approximately 4 years in the “OR” state. The study also evaluates univariate and conditional return periods, comparing them with the primary one. The copula method was an effective method for distributing marginal variables, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool in flood management.",

The visibility prediction model was established by using the neural network method, and the effect of introducing the PM 2.5 concentration factor on low visibility prediction was analyzed and compared. Findings: Low visibility in Chongqing is dominated by precipitation low visibility (PLV), followed by fog low visibility (FLV), with the least proportion of fog‐haze mixed low visibility (FHLV). However, as visibility decreases further, the proportion of fog with low visibility increases significantly. The average visibility when fog occurs is lower than that when precipitation occurs and also much lower than that of fog‐haze mixed, indicating that low visibility is more affected by atmospheric water vapor. Over the past decade, as air pollutants have decreased each year, the proportion of fog and FHLV has also trended downward. The proportion of fog increases significantly in winter, and the low visibility below 200 m is mainly caused by fog in winter, while the increase of precipitation in June is the main cause of low visibility in this month. The diurnal variation of mean visibility under precipitation is relatively small. In contrast, the mean visibility during fog and fog‐haze mixed conditions is lower at night than during the day. The higher occurrence rate of these two types of low visibility conditions at night is a significant factor contributing to reduced visibility during nighttime. Atmospheric humidity, temperature, and particulate matter concentration are important factors affecting visibility, and visibility decreases significantly with the increase of PM 2.5 when relative humidity (RH) is less than 70%, and PM 2.5 has a lower effect on visibility when RH is greater than 70%. The forecast effect of introducing the PM 2.5 concentration factor into the objective forecast model of visibility is better than that of not introducing the factor. The effect of introducing this factor is better than that of not introducing it, especially in the fall.",

The results indicated the following: Synoptic circulation was classified into four categories for the 71 SHR selected based on the criteria: vortex (14 cases), low‐pressure trough (29 cases), subtropical high (26 cases), and other categories (2 cases). The average precipitation amount (PA) and precipitation frequency (PF) increased from 00:00 on the day of the SHR to 00:00 the next day, peaking at night, with the largest values in the vortex category and peaking earlier than the other two. The average precipitation intensity (PI) was largest in the subtropical high (9.3 mm/h), smallest in the low‐pressure trough (6.8 mm/h), and closed in the daytime and nighttime in the vortex. For the four thresholds of ≥0.1, ≥10, ≥20, and ≥50 mm/h, the average PA and PF of nighttime were larger than the daytime, the vortex was the largest, and the peak time was shifted forward between the thresholds, while shifted backward in the low‐pressure trough. Under the three synoptic categories, the increase in PA was mainly due to the contribution of increased PF, whereas the impact of PI was relatively small. Before the SHR, the vortex category had better moisture and dynamic uplift conditions than the low‐pressure trough and subtropical high categories, reflecting the dynamic nature of the vortex. Atmospheric conditions were the greatest at the subtropical high, indicating the thermal nature of the subtropical high. A K index greater than 31 was necessary for an SHR event at the CAFUC airports.",

The corrected forecasts are subsequently evaluated against the original model outputs. The key findings include: (1) Zhejiang Province is optimally divided into four regions characterized by similar precipitation patterns, which exhibit distinct regional features closely linked to the province’s topography and geomorphology. The correction has the most significant impact in northwestern Zhejiang, while its effects are less pronounced in the northeastern coastal areas. (2) Both overall correction and regional correction improve forecast accuracy across various precipitation thresholds. Regional correction consistently outperforms overall correction, with the greatest improvements observed in the accuracy of spring rainstorm forecasts, where the TS score increases from 0.157 to 0.280. (3) For both systematic and convective precipitation events, regional correction enhances the accuracy of intensity and spatial predictions for rainfall exceeding the rainstorm threshold. This improvement is particularly evident in systematic precipitation, where regional correction increases the hit rate for rainfall above the rainstorm threshold from 0.336 to 0.519 and enables the prediction of extremely torrential rain events.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effects of urban land use changes on land surface temperature (LST) in Ramsar utilizing a comprehensive methodology that employed Landsat imagery. The results indicated that the built‐up index (BI) and built‐up area (BU) indices experienced significant growth, increasing by ~157.5% and 38.91%, respectively. In contrast, the normalized difference water index (NDWI) exhibited a negative trend, decreasing by ~61.2%. In the base year, man‐made land use accounted for ~20% of the city’s area. By 2022, this proportion had risen to ~76%, reflecting an impressive growth rate of 230.4%. This increase in man‐made land use demonstrated a strong and positive correlation with the BI and BU indices at confidence levels of 0.01 and 0.05. Furthermore, the urban LST rose from ~35.55°C in the base year to ~38.91°C in 2022. This trend exhibited a significant relationship with the urban hot season temperature, yielding a correlation coefficient of 0.760 at an error level of 0.05. The temperature trends were consistent across various urban areas. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis of LST and urban land use yielded an R 2 value of 0.7835 and an adjusted R 2 value of 0.7712. The multivariate regression results indicated that the four indices—temperature station, NDWI, BI, and urban—were associated with urban LST at a 95% confidence level. Additionally, the findings from logistic regression involving six indices—normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), BU, BI, temperature station, gardens, and urban human‐made areas—showed significant relationships with LST at error levels of 0.05 and 0.01. Synoptic analysis during the study period revealed that three types of high‐pressure systems originating from the subtropical high over Iran influence the surface temperature in Ramsar. These systems include the Saudi Arabian high‐pressure system, the Iranian high‐pressure pattern, and a weak ridge pattern over Iran. While these systems share the common characteristic of being high‐altitude patterns, their origins differ. Heat islands tend to form under stable atmospheric conditions with lower airflow speeds, enhancing their likelihood of occurrence. The results indicated that climate changes in the region, combined with the expansion of urban areas and climate subsidence during the warmer season, have contributed to the intensity and spread of surface temperature in Ramsar City. This trend underscores the necessity for innovative and effective multifaceted approaches to predict and understand this phenomenon, which can assist in urban planning efforts in Ramsar City.",

    "abstract": "Solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation plays a crucial role in various environmental, atmospheric, and industrial applications, despite covering only a small portion of the electromagnetic solar radiation. The distribution of UV radiation reaching the Earth’s surface is influenced by multiple environmental, atmospheric, and astronomical factors, some of which require further investigation. The aim of this study is to explore the potential impact of cosmic rays and space weather parameters on solar UV radiation. To achieve this, the study utilized solar UV data collected from the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) radiometric station, situated in central Saudi Arabia (latitude 24 43, longitude 46 40, altitude 613 m) for the period 2015–2021, along with space weather parameters. These parameters include solar radio flux at 10.7 cm (F10.7 cm) and sunspot number (SSN), as well as cosmic ray data from the Oulu neutron monitor for the same period as the UV data. The study conducted correlation analyses between the time series UV data and the considered parameters, revealing mutual relationships between these variables. UV radiation demonstrated a positive correlation with the SSN and F10.7 cm radio flux while showing a significant anticorrelation with the CR data. Furthermore, the mean daily time series of the variables underwent power spectral analyses to identify potential common periodicities. The spectral analyses showed several common periodicities in all the variables considered, such as ~410, 172, 165, and 66 days. Based on the correlations and spectral results, the study suggests that solar signals could have a direct or indirect impact on the observed solar UV radiation at a specific site. This finding has significant implications for our understanding of the factors that affect UV radiation.",

    "abstract": "The primary objective of irrigated agriculture is to produce crops with the help of irrigation. This field study was conducted during the 2017 and 2018 cropping seasons at the experimental farmland of Melkassa Agricultural Research Center, Ethiopia. The actual crop evapotranspiration and crop coefficient for the haricot bean were determined from nonweighing lysimeter studies. The soil–water balance approach was applied to compute the actual crop evapotranspiration of the haricot bean, whereas the reference evapotranspiration was computed with the help of the Penman–Monteith method. The crop coefficient was obtained from the ratio between the measured crop evapotranspiration and the reference evapotranspiration. The seasonal crop evapotranspiration for the haricot bean was 493.0 and 410.1mm during the experimental period of 2017 and 2018, respectively. The mean crop evapotranspiration for the haricot bean over the two experimental years was 451.6 mm. The mean locally produced actual crop coefficient values were 0.5 at the initial stage, 1.16 during the mid‐season stage, and 0.67 at the end‐season stage. The average FAO‐adjusted Kc value over the two experimental years was 0.41 at the initial stage and 1.14 during the mid‐season. The FAO‐adjusted crop coefficient Kc values slightly differed from the crop coefficient Kc values developed. The findings provide valuable insights for enhancing the design and management of irrigated haricot bean production in the region. The specific crop coefficient Kc values determined for different growth stages are crucial for optimizing irrigation scheduling and improving water‐use efficiency, contributing to sustainable haricot bean production in the semiarid environment.",

    "abstract": "In terms of socioeconomic damage, floods are one of the most destructive natural disasters. However, by conducting flood modeling prior to an event, their impacts can be mitigated and better managed. This study aims to assess flood risk areas in the Gumara River using HEC‐RAS and HEC‐HMS. Data on rainfall, stream flow, and spatial information were collected, including digital elevation models (DEMs), land use, and soil maps. Flood levels before and after dyke construction were examined using the HEC‐RAS model. The impact of flood before construction of dyke for each return periods 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 years were 6232.64, 6262.51, 6375.04, 6495.62, 6639.55, and 6804.26 ha, respectively, and after dyke construction also 5912.18, 5966.47, 6027.13, 6108.04, and 6483.49 ha at the same return periods. The construction of dyke reduced impact of flooding for each return periods were 5.14%, 4.73%, 5.46%, 5.97%, 7.73%, and 4.71%, respectively. However, the dyke did not fully eliminate flood risks. Particularly during the summer months of July and August, the research area is still quite vulnerable. Based on these findings, the study recommends prioritizing the construction of a storage dam upstream of the Gumara Bridge, as it would offer more effective flood routing and protection for downstream settlements. River channelization and the addition of a silt excluder may provide supplementary benefits, particularly in maintaining flow capacity and reducing sediment buildup. Additional dykes and barriers along key tributaries could further mitigate localized flooding. However, these should be considered secondary measures following comprehensive upstream flood control through dam storage.",

    "abstract": "In the face of climate change, extreme weather events (EWEs) pose significant challenges on a global scale. This study assesses the long‐term climate trends and extreme precipitation indices across Ethiopia using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) datasets under medium emission (SSP2‐4.5) and high emission (SSP5‐8.5) scenarios. We applied indices from the World Meteorological Organization, Expert Team on Sector‐Specific Climate Indices (ET‐SCI) to analyze both national averages and regional variations. Projected climate trends across Ethiopia show substantial warming and increased precipitation under both SSP2‐4.5 and SSP5‐8.5 scenarios. Compared to the 1991–2010 baseline, mean annual precipitation is projected to increase by about 18% (SSP2‐4.5) and 41% (SSP5‐8.5) by the late 21st century, with the greatest intensification during the main rainy season (June–September). However, dry‐season rainfall remains low, sustaining strong seasonality and heightening the risk of both floods and droughts. Spatially, rainfall increases are concentrated in the already wetter southwestern highlands, while arid lowlands see limited gains, potentially widening hydrological disparities. Mean maximum and minimum temperatures are also projected to rise by up to 3.6 and 4.6°C under SSP5‐8.5, respectively, with high‐temperature zones expanding into formerly cooler regions. Drought projections, based on Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), suggest a notable decrease in drought occurrences, especially under SSP5‐8.5 scenario. Regional disparities highlight varying rainfall and temperature patterns, with increased risks of severe flooding in central, western, and southwestern Ethiopia under SSP5‐8.5 scenario. The study indicates no significant historical trends in extreme precipitation indices but notes substantial increases under both emission scenarios, particularly SSP5‐8.5. These findings highlight the need for targeted adaptation strategies, including improved water management, early warning systems, and sustainable land use planning, to enhance climate resilience and support vulnerable communities in Ethiopia.",

    "abstract": "A rare short‐term winter graupel event occurred at Mianyang Airport in the Sichuan Basin on January 10, 2025, with graupel particles less than 5 mm in diameter and lasting approximately 3 min. Based on surface observations, dual‐polarization radar data, and reanalysis data, this study reveals the triggering mechanism, microphysical characteristics, and early warning applications of the process. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) dynamic triggering mechanism: this process was jointly driven by the southward movement of cold air and the low‐level shear line. The northwest airflow at 500 hPa guided the intrusion of cold advection, and the shear line at 850 hPa formed low‐level convergence. Combined with weak symmetric instability below the inversion layer at 600 hPa, shallow convection was formed, which could support the formation of graupel without significant energy accumulation. This is significantly different from the mechanism of summer severe convection that relies on deep thermal instability. (2) Microphysical and environmental characteristics: the 0°C layer was located at 850 hPa, and the high‐humidity area at 700 hPa provided supercooled water vapor. Dual‐polarization radar showed that the graupel particles had a nearly spherical shape, characterized by low differential reflectivity and a high correlation coefficient. (3) Radar early warning indicators: bow echo, a 50 dBZ strong echo center, an echo top (ET) height of 4 km, relatively fast echo movement speed, and low‐level northeast wind shear can be used as key early warning signals. Combined with parameters such as water vapor flux, an early warning was issued 30 min in advance, providing technical support for low‐altitude meteorological guarantee at the airport.",

    "abstract": "The West African climate system is highly sensitive to oceanic conditions in the Gulf of Guinea (GG), where rising sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and marine heatwaves (MHWs) are emerging as key indicators of regional climate change. This study analyses the relationship between MHW during the monsoon period and rainfall in West Africa using 30‐year data (May–October) of daily SST and precipitation. Based on the SST dataset. MHW intensities allowed to delineate the oceanic zones of their occurrences. The results show that these events have enhanced over the last decade along the northern coast of the GG and at the equator. Different classes are defined in each oceanic area defined. The high intensities of the MHWs of the different classes are located in the upwelling zone along the northern coast of GG. The analysis of the cumulative annual rainfall shows that the wettest regions are situated in the western and eastern parts of the Guinean zone of West Africa. It’s interannual trend is not significant, even if there is a break in 2018. The first modes of the relationships between each class of MHWs and rainfall show significant correlations between MHWs and rainfall of the coastal area and in the Sahelian zone. Most of the MHWs at the northern coast of the GG and in the tropical Atlantic cold tongue area have a positive influence on rainfall. All MHW events associated with rainfall represent about half of the MHW events that occur at the northern coast of the GG. For the Atlantic cold tongue area, the percentage of MHW concomitant with rainfall is about two‐third. A rainfall deficit is observed in the Sahelian zone during MHW events. This indicates that the onset of a rainfall deficit north of 10°N and an excess to the south coincides with the warming of the surface waters of the GG. This study is a first step to understand the impact of MHWs on climate, and their relationships with weather catastrophic extreme events.",

These contamination sources produce antenna brightness temperature anomalies of around 2 K at SSMIS sounding channels which are obviously inappropriate for assimilation into numerical weather prediction models and remote sensing retrievals of atmospheric and surface parameters. In this study, antenna brightness temperature anomalies at several lower atmospheric sounding (LAS) channels are assessed, and the algorithm is developed for corrections of these antenna temperature anomalies. When compared against radiative transfer model simulations and simultaneous observations from AMSU-A aboard NOAA-16, the SSMIS antenna temperatures at 52.8, 53.6, 54.4, 55.5, 57.3, and 59.4 GHz after the anomaly correction exhibit small residual errors (&lt;0.5 K). After such SSMIS antenna temperatures are applied to the National Center for Environmental Prediction Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model, more satellite data is used and the analysis field of the geopotential height is significantly improved throughout troposphere and lower stratosphere. Therefore, the SSMIS antenna temperatures after the anomaly correction have demonstrated their potentials in NWP models.",

Comparison of the model derived area averaged daily mean temperatures at 2m height from different zones over the central Europe with observations indicates that the model is able to simulate the occurrence of the cold wave with the observed time lag of 1 to 3days but with lesser intensity. The temperature, winds, surface pressure and the geopential heights at 500 hPa reveal that the cold wave development associates with the southward progression of a high pressure system and cold air advection.

Simulations over 4 decades, carried out with a horizontal resolution of 50 km, deliver a realistic simulation of the Antarctic atmospheric circulation, synoptic‐scale pressure systems, and the spatial distribution of precipitation minus sublimation (P‐E) structures. The simulated P‐E pattern is in qualitative agreement with glaciological estimates. The estimated (P‐E) trends demonstrate surfacemass accumulation increase at the West Antarctic coasts and reductions in parts of East Antarctica. The influence of the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) on the near‐surface climate and the surface mass accumulation over Antarctica have been investigated on the basis of ERA‐40 data and HIRHAM simulations. It is shown that the regional accumulation changes are largely driven by changes in the transient activity around the Antarctic coasts due to the varying AAO phases. During positive AAO, more transient pressure systems travelling towards the continent, and Western Antarctica and parts of South‐Eastern Antarctica gain more precipitation and mass. Over central Antarctica the prevailing anticyclone causes a strengthening of polar desertification connected with a reduced surface mass balance in the northern part of East Antarctica.",

    "abstract": "Based on the crop water stress index (CWSI) concept, a new model was proposed to account for advection to estimate evapotranspiration. Both local scale evaluation with sites observations and regional scale evaluation with a remote dataset from Landsat 7 ETM+ were carried out to assess the performance of this model. Local scale evaluation indicates that this newly developed model can effectively characterize the daily variations of evapotranspiration and the predicted results show good agreement with the site observations.

Regional scale evaluation shows that the model can capture the spatial variations of evapotranspiration at the Landsat-based scale. Clear spatial patterns were observed at the Landsat-based scale and are closely related to the dominant land covers, corn and soybean. Furthermore, the surface resistance derived from instantaneous CWSI was applied to the Penman-Monteith equation to estimate daily evapotranspiration. Overall, results indicate that this newly developed model is capable of estimating reliable surface heat fluxes using remotely sensed data.",

    "abstract": "Accurate soil moisture information is very important for real-time flood forecasting. Although satellite soil moisture observations are useful information, their validations are generally hindered by the large spatial difference with the point-based measurements, and hence they cannot be directly applied in hydrological modelling. This study adopts a widely applied operational hydrological model Xinanjiang (XAJ) as a hydrological validation tool. Two widely used microwave sensors (SMOS and AMSR-E) are evaluated, over two basins (French Broad and Pontiac) with different climate types and vegetation covers. The results demonstrate SMOS outperforms AMSR-E in the Pontiac basin (cropland), while both products perform poorly in the French Broad basin (forest). The MODIS NDVI thresholds of 0.81 and 0.64 (for cropland and forest basins, resp.) are very effective in dividing soil moisture datasets into “denser” and “thinner” vegetation periods. As a result, in the cropland, the statistical performance is further improved for both satellites (i.e., improved to NSE = 0.74, RMSE = 0.0059 m and NSE = 0.58, RMSE = 0.0066 m for SMOS and AMER-E, resp.). The overall assessment suggests that SMOS is of reasonable quality in estimating basin-scale soil moisture at moderate-vegetated areas, and NDVI is a useful indicator for further improving the performance.",

In this study, numerical simulations of hail processes in the Zhejiang Province were conducted using a mesoscale numerical model (WRF v3.4). The effects of six ice nuclei parameterization schemes on the macroscopic and microscopic structures of hail clouds were compared. The effect of the ice nuclei concentration on ground hailfall is stronger than that on ground rainfall. There were significant spatiotemporal, intensity, and distribution differences in hailfall. Changes in the ice nuclei concentration caused different changes in hydrometeors and directly affected the ice crystals, and, hence, the spatiotemporal distribution of other hydrometeors and the thermodynamic structure of clouds. An increased ice nuclei concentration raises the initial concentration of ice crystals with higher mixing ratio. In the developing and early maturation stages of hail cloud, a larger number of ice crystals competed for water vapor with increasing ice nuclei concentration. This effect prevents ice crystals from maturing into snow particles and inhibits the formation and growth of hail embryos. During later maturation stages, updraft in the cloud intensified and more supercooled water was transported above the 0°C level, benefitting the production and growth of hail particles. An increased ice nuclei concentration therefore favors the formation of hail.",

A tropical cyclone (TC) track is defined as a sequence of successive points, and several different types of analyses are performed to explore the temporal and spatial patterns of the TCs in the Northwest Pacific and along the coastline of China during 1949–2014. Results show that (1) the number of TCs is getting more frequent from April to August and less frequent from August to October with the peak occurring in August almost every year; (2) the mean of the sizes of the annual temporal clusters during 1949–2014 is 52.5 (days), the standard deviation is 17.0 (days), and the average starting point is the 210.5th day; (3) the spatial clusters are located in two areas: the boundary of Guangxi and Guangdong provinces and the boundary of Fujian and Zhejiang provinces; and (4) the within-strata variance is less than the between-strata variance, which implies the locational and seasonal factors are the potential determinants of the heterogeneity of the TCs. Furthermore, several maps representing the hazards of TCs are produced. According to the resultant maps, 12 coastal prefectures (Zhanjiang, Maoming, Fuzhou, Huizhou, Yangjiang, Qinzhou, Ningde, Quanzhou, Jiangmen, Nanning, Zhangzhou, and Hangzhou) have return periods of less than two years, and the two island provinces of Hainan and Taiwan are visited by TCs the most. Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang provinces in particular suffered severely from the destructive TCs.",

The V2F model has been used in the past to predict low-speed and wall-bounded flows, but it has never been used to simulate airflows in urban street canyons. The numerical results are validated against experimental data collected in the water channel and compared with other turbulence models incorporated in Ansys Fluent (i.e., variations of both k - ε and k - ω models and the Reynolds stress model). The results show that the V2F model provides the best prediction of the flow field for two flow regimes commonly found in urban canopies. The V2F model is also employed to quantify the air-exchange rate (ACH) for a series of two-dimensional building arrangements, such as step-up and step-down configurations, having different aspect ratios and relative heights of the buildings. The results show a clear dependence of the ACH on the latter two parameters and highlight the role played by the turbulence in the exchange of air mass, particularly important for the step-down configurations, when the ventilation associated with the mean flow is generally poor.",

Severe storms occasionally lead to the formation of mesocyclones, whose direction or sense of rotation is often determined by the Coriolis force, among other factors. In the Northern Hemisphere, more than 99% of all tornadoes rotate anticlockwise. The present research shows that, in topographically complex regions, tornadoes have a different probability of rotating clockwise or anticlockwise. Our ongoing research programme on tornadoes in Mexico has shown that the number of tornadoes is significantly higher than previously thought. About 40% of all tornadoes occur in the complex topographic region of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Data collected (from Internet videos) on the rotation of tornadoes formed in this region showed that about 50% of them rotated in a clockwise direction, contradicting tornado statistics for most of North America. Time series of the helicity parameter showed that tornadoes formed in topographically complex areas exhibited different behaviours compared to those formed in plains that are related with supercell systems.",

Based on the numerically reproduced Typhoon Maemi, this study tried to maximize the typhoon-induced rainfall by increasing the amount of saturated water vapour in the atmosphere and the amount of water vapour entering the typhoon. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which is one of the regional climate models (RCMs), the rainfall simulated by WRF while increasing the SAT and SST to various sizes at initial conditions and boundary conditions of the model was analysed. As a result of the simulated typhoon rainfall, the spatial distribution of total rainfall depth on the land due to the increase combination of SAT and SST showed a wide variety without showing a certain pattern. This is attributed to the geographical location of the Korean peninsula, which is a peninsula between the continent and the ocean. In other words, under certain conditions, typhoons may drop most of the rainfall on the southern sea of the peninsula before landing on the peninsula. For instance, the 6-hour duration maximum precipitation (MP) in Busan Metropolitan City was 472.1 mm when the SST increased by 2.0°C. However, when the SST increased by 4.0°C, the MP was found to be 395.3 mm, despite the further increase in SST. This indicates that the MP at a particular area and the increase in temperature do not have a linear relationship. Therefore, in order to maximize typhoon rainfall, it is necessary to repeat the numerical experiment on various conditions and search for the combination of SAT and SST increase which is most suitable for the target typhoon.",

Atmospheric columns of ammonia were mapped over South Asia by using TES observations on board NASA’s Aura satellite. Monthly mean data were used to identify emission sources of atmospheric ammonia across the South Asian region. Data were analysed to explore temporal trends, seasonal cycles, and hot spots of atmospheric ammonia within the study area. The results show that the IGP region has the most ammonia concentrations in terms of column densities, and hence this region has been identified as an ammonia hot spot. This is attributed majorly to extensive agricultural activity. Time series showed a slight increase in ammonia column densities over the study area from 2004 to 2011. Different seasonal cycles were identified across the IGP region with maximum NH 3 columns observed during the month of July in most of the subregions. Seasonality in an ammonia column is driven by different cropping patterns and meteorological conditions in the IGP subregions. Global emission inventories of atmospheric ammonia were largely overestimating as compared to satellite observations.",

We quantitatively analyzed the transport and sources of water vapor in the rainstorms using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT_4.9) model. All 20 Mei-yu front precipitation cases occurred in a wide region from the Tibetan Plateau to the Yangtze-Huai River. The South Asian high and upper level jet stream both had strong intensities during the Mei-yu front rainstorm periods. Heavy rainfall mainly occurred in the divergence zone to the right of the high-level jet and in the convergence zone of the low-level jet, where strong vertical upward flows provided the dynamic conditions required for heavy rainfall. The water vapor mainly originated from the Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal, and South China Sea. 52% of the air masses over the western Tibetan Plateau originated from Central Asia, which were rich in water vapor. The water vapor contribution at the initial position was only 41.5% due to the dry, cold air mass over Eurasia, but increased to 47.6% at the final position. Over the eastern Tibetan Plateau to the Sichuan Basin region, 40% of the air parcels came from the Indian Ocean, which was the main channel for water vapor transport. For the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, 37% of the air parcels originated from the warm and humid Indian Ocean. The water vapor contribution at the initial position was 38.6%, but increased to 40.2% after long-distance transportation.",

    "abstract": "The Abbay River Basin, which originates in Ethiopia, is a major tributary and main source of the Nile River Basin. Land cover and vegetation in the Abbay River Basin is highly susceptible to climate change. This study was conducted to investigate the trends of climate change for a period of thirty-six years (1980–2016) within selected stations of the basin by using the innovative trend analysis method, Mann–Kendall test, and Sen’s slope estimator test to investigate the mean annual precipitation and temperature variables. Changes in land cover and vegetation in the Abbay River Basin were studied for a period of thirteen years (2001–2013) by using remote sensing, GIS analysis, land cover classification, and vegetation detection methods to assess the land cover and vegetation in the basin. In addition, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and Transformation Matrix were employed to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of land cover and vegetation impacted by changes in climate. The result reflects that the trend of average annual temperature was remarkably increased (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mi>Φ</mml:mi></mml:math> = 0.12, Z = 0.75) in the 36-year period, and the temperature was increased by 0.5°C, although precipitation had slightly decreased during the same period. In the thirteen years’ period, forest land and water resource decreased by 3429.62 km 2 and 81.45 km 2 , respectively. In contrast, an increment was observed in grassland (2779.33 km 2 ), cultivated land (535.34 km 2 ), bare land (43.08 km 2 ), urban land (0.65 km 2 ), and wetland (152.66 km 2 ) in the same period. In the study, it was also observed a decrease of an NDVI value by 0.1 was observed in 2013 in the southern part of the basin. The findings of the present study illustrate a significant change in eco-hydrological conditions in the ARB with an adverse impact on the environment. Hydroclimatic changes caused the increase in temperature and decreasing trend in precipitation which significantly impacted the land cover and vegetation in the basin. The changes in land cover were mostly caused by global and local climate influence which mainly affects the hydroclimate and eco-hydrology systems of the basin. The result is consistent with that of the previous studies conducted elsewhere. The findings of this paper could help researchers to understand the eco-hydrological condition of the study basin and become a foundation for further studies.",

    "abstract": "The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM), which is an important influencing summer climate of East Asia, is associated with large-scale change of the land-sea thermal contrast. The Asian-Pacific Oscillation (APO) can modulate the EASM because it not only represents the upper-tropospheric zonal land-sea thermal contrast over Asia and the Pacific region, but it also affects the sea surface temperature (SST) over the North Pacific, which can tune the land-sea thermal contrast for the EASM. This study revealed weakening of the APO-EASM relationship since the 1990s. It was found that the relationship between the APO and the EASM during 1948–1990 (1991–2016) was statistically significant (insignificant). Further study indicated that the APO was concurrent with significant positive SST in the central North Pacific and subtropical central-western Pacific during 1948–1990, which contributed to the shift of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) from its cold to warm phase and led to a weakened EASM. The APO-related SST and atmospheric circulation anomalies were found statistically to be insignificant during 1991–2016, which indicates a weakening of influence of the APO on shift of the PDO, and even a weaker link to the EASM.",

    "abstract": "Variational data assimilation (VDA) remains one of the key issues arising in many fields of geosciences including the numerical weather prediction. While the theory of VDA is well established, there are a number of issues with practical implementation that require additional consideration and study. However, the exploration of VDA requires considerable computational resources. For simple enough low-order models, the computational cost is minor and therefore models of this class are used as simple test instruments to emulate more complex systems. In this paper, the sensitivity with respect to variations in the parameters of one of the main components of VDA, the nonlinear forecasting model, is considered. For chaotic atmospheric dynamics, conventional methods of sensitivity analysis provide uninformative results since the envelopes of sensitivity functions grow with time and sensitivity functions themselves demonstrate the oscillating behaviour. The use of sensitivity analysis method, developed on the basis of the theory of shadowing pseudoorbits in dynamical systems, allows us to calculate sensitivity functions correctly. Sensitivity estimates for a simple coupled dynamical system are calculated and presented in the paper. To estimate the influence of model parameter uncertainties on the forecast, the relative error in the energy norm is applied.",

Both statistical and numerical prediction schemes for Indian monsoon have been widely studied in literature. Statistical schemes are mainly based on regression or neural networks. However, the variability of monsoon is significant over the years and a single model is often inadequate. Meteorologists revise their models on different years based on prevailing global climatic incidents like El-Niño. These indices often have degree of severity associated with them. In this paper, we cluster the monsoon years based on their fuzzy degree of associativity to these climatic event patterns. Next, we develop individual prediction models for the year clusters. A weighted ensemble of these individual models is used to obtain the final forecast. The proposed method performs competitively with existing forecast models.",

The quality of the results is then determined in the context of the governing variables used in crop science, forestry, and aerobiological models. We use the results to simulate the peak of the birch pollen season (aerobiology), growth of barley (crop science), and development of the invasive plant pathogen Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus (the cause of ash-dieback). The results show that the crop and aerobiological models are particularly sensitive to grid resolution and much higher quality is obtained from the 12 km simulations compared to 36 km. The results also show that the summer months have a bias, in particular for maximum and minimum temperatures, and that the low/high bias is clustered in two areas: continental and coastal influenced areas. It is suggested that the use of results from meteorological models as an input into biological models needs particular attention in the quality of the modelled surface data as well as the applied land surface modules.",

Through the vortex removal technique in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, the vortex associated with Hurricane Floyd (1999) was mostly removed in the model initial conditions and subsequent integration. Results show that the environment-induced precipitation can account for as much as 22% of total precipitation in the innermost model domain covering North Carolina coastal area and 7% in the focused hydrological study area. The high-resolution precipitation data from the WRF model was then used for input in a hydrological model to simulate river runoff. Hydrological simulation results demonstrate that without the tropical systems and their interactions with the large-scale synoptic environment the synoptic environment would only contribute 10% to the total discharge at the Tarboro gauge station. This suggests that Hurricane Floyd and Hurricane Dennis preceding it, along with the interactions between these tropical systems and the large-scale environment, have contributed to the bulk (90%) of the record amount of flood water in the Tar-Pamlico River Basin.",

By using horizontal observations at selected altitudes, the distributions of ice water content (IWC), particle habits, and particle size spectrum parameters were investigated. The cloud cases were characterized by high IWC values due to the existence of embedded convective cells. Liquid water contents were rather low with the maxima of less than 0.3 g m −3 and the general values of less than 0.1 g m −3 . The occurrence of large dendritic crystals as well as rimed capped columns and branched crystals indicated that ice seeding from the above cloud layer (6 km altitude or above) contributed significantly to both high ice crystal number concentrations and IWCs. Horizontal observations at selected levels suggested the general decreasing trend of IWC with decreasing temperature only in part of the cloud layers but not throughout the cold layer of the multilayered stratiform clouds. Both exponential and gamma functions were used to characterize the particle size spectrum parameters. The slope parameter values of exponential distributions were primarily in the range of 10 3 –10 4 m −1 . In comparison, slope values of the gamma distribution fits spanned more and a relationship was found between the dispersion and slope values.",

The trend of average annual temperature and precipitation observed by meteorological stations were approximately increased. Compared before and after 2004, the area of grassland degradation was increased slightly. However, nearly one-third of degraded grassland showed improvement, and the grassland vegetation coverage showed significant increase. Comparing current grassland vegetation coverage with healthy vegetation cover with the same grass type, nearly half of the area still needs to further restore vegetation cover. The grassland degradation resulted in significant carbon emissions, but the restoration to its healthy status has been estimated to be technical mitigation potential.",

Its primarily urban environmental setting characterized by high-density urban areas, semienclosed tunnels, and suspension bridges, together with the herds of runners, has an influence on the microclimate along the marathon course. This study focused on assessing and comparing variations in temperature and vapour pressure (vis-à-vis relative humidity) against the crowd of runners, or the herd effects, in two different environmental settings along the marathon course: semienclosed (a tunnel) versus open space (a suspension bridge). A series of small iButtons were deployed at strategic locations along the course to undertake minute-by-minute measurements of temperature and relative humidity. It was found that herd effects of varying degrees were present in both semienclosed and open settings. Various environmental differences also played a role in ameliorating or amplifying the climatological effects of the herd of runners. Our study suggests that microclimate variations in different environmental settings and crowd conditions could have an impact on runners. This new knowledge can inform the design of marathon routes.

We generate cyclone tracks from the National Center for Environmental Prediction’s Reanalysis I and the European Centre for Medium Range Prediction ERA-40 reanalysis datasets. To investigate the interannual variability of cyclone tracks, we compare the effects of El Niño, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), and the Pacific North American Pattern (PNA) on cyclone tracks. Composite analysis shows similar results for the impacts of El Niño, NAO, and the PNA on NH storm tracks. Although it is encouraging, we also found regional differences when comparing reanalysis datasets. The results for the IOD suggested a wave-like alteration of cyclone frequency across the northern US/Canada possibly related to Rossby wave propagation. Partial correlation demonstrates that although El Niño affects cyclone frequency in the North Pacific and along the US east coast, its impact on the North Pacific is accomplished via the PNA. Similarly, the PNA’s impact on US east coast storms is modulated via El Niño. In contrast, the impacts of the NAO extend as far west as the North Pacific and are not influenced by either the PNA or El Niño.",

The aim of the paper was to propose a multiscale composited drought index (CDI) which could be widely used for drought monitoring and early warning in China. In the study, the upper Huaihe River basin above the Xixian gauge station, which has been hit by severe droughts frequently in recent decades, was selected as the case study site. The newly built short-term/long-term CDI comprehensively considered three natural forms of drought (meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural) by selection of different variables that are related to each drought type. The short-term/long-term CDI was developed using the Principle Component Analysis of related drought components. The thresholds of the short-term/long-term CDI were determined according to frequency statistics of different drought indices. Finally, the feasibility of the two CDI was investigated against the self-calibrating Palmer drought severity index, the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, and the historical drought records. The results revealed that the short-term/long-term CDI could capture the onset, severity, and persistence of drought events very well with the former being better at identifying the dynamic evolution of drought condition and the latter better at judging the changing trend of drought over a long time period.",

The simulated surface air temperatures (SATs) are sensitive to the LSSs and simulation lengths. Specifically, all of the LSSs except PX generally reproduce the observed high temperatures, with CLM4 SATs at 06 UTC (SAT06) the most consistent with measurements whereas the short-range (medium-range) results from NOAH_MP (NOAH) are the worst. Detailed explanations were given in terms of surface fluxes and physical processes. RUC soil moisture initialization appears poor and the LSS reflects too strong gravity drainage. When the LSSs with increased numbers of soil layers are used, the simulated high temperatures are found more consistent with measurements. Additionally, regional sensible heat flux (SHF) does not show high consistency with SAT. The results that differ from the previous studies are partly due to the complex geography and the LSS deficiencies.",

Using satellite data observed by AURA/MLS and ERA-Interim reanalysis datasets, the spatial distributions and temporal variations of WV were analyzed. It was found that high WV content in the UTLS over the southern Tibetan Plateau is more apparent in summer, due to monsoon-induced strong upward motions. The WV content showed the opposite distribution at 100 hPa, though, during spring and winter. And a different distribution at 121 hPa indicated that the difference in WV content between the northern and southern plateau occurs between 121 and 100 hPa in spring and between 147 and 121 hPa in winter. In the UTLS, it diminishes rapidly with increase in altitude in these two seasons, and it shows a “V” structure in winter. There has been a weak increasing trend in WV at 100 hPa, but a downtrend at 147 and 215 hPa, during the past 12 years. At the latter two heights, the WV content in summer has been much higher than in other seasons. Furthermore, WV variation showed a rough wave structure in spring and autumn at 215 hPa. The variation of WV over the Tibetan Plateau is helpful in understanding the stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) and climate change.",

It is demonstrated using autocorrelation and Fourier transforms that there may be a degree of predictability in this time frame using the PNA, another teleconnection index, or some variation of them. Neither the BSR nor EAR based forecasts showed skill over climatology in the traditional sense, but using signal detection techniques these indexes were skillful at predicting the onset of anomalous temperature conditions (greater than two standard deviations) in the central USA. The BSR generally produced better results that the EAR and formulae for each index are proposed. Three case studies demonstrate the efficacy of these indexes for forecasting temperatures in the central USA.

A monotonically increasing PWV trend was detected throughout North China between 1979 and 1999, with the maximum trend occurring in summer and the minimum occurring in winter. For the period of 1979–2007, a slightly but less marked decreasing trend was found at most stations in North China in all four seasons.",

Based on the obtained results, the PPM provides better interpolation quality by employing much fewer independent points.

In twin experiments, two prescribed parameters, including the initial condition (IC) and the source and sink (SS), are successfully estimated by the PPM with lower interpolation errors than the Cressman interpolation.

Results reveal the existence of positive long-term memory characteristic in rainfall field. DFA exponent values are different regarding the concerned synoptic stations, reflecting the effect of geographical position and climate on the LTM. These values were related to the type of climate. The best DFA1-4 method depends on the geographical position of the studied station. However, DFA2 is generally the best in terms of spatial average from DFA1 to DFA4. In Bénin synoptic stations, except the Parakou station, the long-term temporal correlations are systematically the source of multifractality in rainfall. Except Natitingou, the strength of long-term memory characteristic decreases each twenty years in the study period. Considering the fractal approach, our results show that the subperiod 1991–2010 is not really a transition period as shown before. Thus, the drought is prolonging until 2010. So, fractal theory reveals more Bénin climatic characteristics.",

    "abstract": "The binary interaction is one of the most challenging factors to improve the forecast accuracy of multiple tropical cyclones (TCs) in close vicinity. The effect of binary interaction usually results in anomalous track and variable intensity of TCs. A typical interaction type, one-way influence mode, has been investigated by many studies which mainly focused on the anomalous track and record-breaking precipitation, such as typhoons Morakot and Goni. In this paper, a typical case of this type, typhoons Tembin and Bolaven, occurred in the western North Pacific in August 2012, was selected to study how one typhoon impacts the track and intensity of the other one. The vortex of Tembin or Bolaven and the monsoon circulation were removed by a TC bogus scheme and a low-pass Lanczos filter, respectively, to carry out the numerical experiments. The results show that the presence of monsoon made the binary interaction more complex by affecting the tracks and the translation speeds of the TCs. The influence of Bolaven on the track of Tembin was more significant than the influence of Tembin on the track of Bolaven, and the looping track of Tembin was also affected by the external surrounding circulation associated with Bolaven. The absence of Tembin was not conducive to the development of Bolaven due to stronger vertical wind shear condition and the less kinetic energy being transported to upper troposphere. Note that the above analysis demonstrates the interacting processes between TCs and sheds some light on the prediction of binary TCs.",

    "abstract": "Although tropical cyclone (TC) rain fields assume varying spatial configurations, many studies only use areal coverage to compare TCs. To provide additional spatial information, this study calculates metrics of closure, or the tangential completeness of reflectivity regions surrounding the circulation center, and dispersion, or the spread of reflectivity outwards from the storm center. Two hurricanes that encountered different conditions after landfall are compared. Humberto (2007) experienced rapid intensification (RI), stronger vertical wind shear, and more moisture than Jeanne (2004), which was more intense, weakened gradually, and became extratropical. A GIS framework was used to convert radar reflectivity regions into polygons and measure their area, closure, and dispersion. Closure corresponded most closely to storm intensity, as the eye became exposed when both TCs weakened to tropical storm intensity. Dispersion increased by 10 km·hr −1 as both TCs developed precipitation along frontal boundaries. As closure tended to change earlier than dispersion and area, closure may be most sensitive to subtle changes in environmental conditions, particularly as the storm’s core experiences the entrainment of dry air and erodes. Displacement provided a combined radial and tangential component to the location of the rainfall regions to confirm placement along the frontal boundaries. Examining area alone cannot reveal these patterns. The spatial metrics reveal changes in TC structure, such as the lag between onset of RI and maximum closure, which should be generalizable to TCs experiencing similar conditions. Future work will calculate these metrics for additional TCs to quantify structural changes in response to their surrounding environment.",

However, the same method applied to the humidity measurements produces a larger mean square deviation. A strong stochastical connection is found between the T-temperature matrix and the U-humidity matrix.

The physical meaning of these constants is given only in the case m = M = 1.

This study of climate change scenarios from 13 global climate models (GCMs) assesses the impacts of future climate change. Unlike South Korea, North Korea lacks studies using climate change scenarios of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and only recently did the country start the projection of extreme precipitation episodes. As such, one of the main purposes of this study is to predict changes in the average climatic conditions of North Korea in the future. The result of comparing downscaled climate change scenarios with observation data for a reference period indicates the high applicability of the MME. Furthermore, this study classifies climatic zones by applying the Köppen–Geiger climatic zones classification to the MME, which is validated for future precipitation and temperature. The result suggests that the continental climate that covers the inland area for the reference climate is expected to shift into the temperate climate. Moreover, the coefficient of variation (CV) in the temperature ensemble is particularly low for the southern coast of the Korean Peninsula, and, accordingly, a high possibility of the shifting climatic zone of the coast is predicted.",

Several statistical indices characterising the abilities of the NTHF and climatology and persistence model for rainfalls (R-CLIPER) for forecasting rain as measured by the TRMM are calculated at 24, 48, and 72 h forecasts for each TC and averaged. The model under consideration presents better forecasting skills than the R-CLIPER for all the attributes evaluated and demonstrates similar performances compared with models reported in the literature.

Model simulations are validated using both in situ and remote sensing observations. It is found that all three schemes capture the overall spatial distribution of precipitation and the average rainfall intensity changes more rapidly with time in the simulation than in the observation. Further insights are gained through an examination of the budget terms of raindrop and ice-phase hydrometeors in the model. Accretion of cloud droplets by raindrops and melting of ice-phase hydrometeors are the major source of rainwater. Bergeron and riming processes are found to play a prevailing role in the growth of ice-phase hydrometeors in Meiyu rainfall. Large differences in the parameterization of riming process in different schemes lead to significant differences in the simulated growth of ice-phase hydrometeors.",

    "abstract": "The dynamic emissivity retrieved from window channels of the microwave humidity sounder II (MWHS-2) onboard the China Meteorological Administration’s FengYun (FY)-3C polar orbiting satellite can provide more realistic emissivity over lands and potentially improve the numerical weather prediction (NWP) forecasts. However, whether the assimilation with the dynamic emissivity works for the precipitation forecasts over the complex geography is less investigated. In this paper, a typical precipitating case generated by the Southwest Vortex is selected and the Weather Research and Forecasting data assimilation (WRFDA) system is applied to examine the impacts of assimilating MWHS-2/FY-3C with the uses of the emissivity atlas and the dynamic emissivity on the forecasts. The results indicate that the use of the dynamic emissivity retrieved from the 89 GHz channel of MWHS-2/FY-3C apparently increases the used data number for assimilation and does improve the initial fields and the 24-hour forecasts (from 0000 UTC 24 June 2016 to 0000 UTC 25 June 2016) of precipitation distribution and intensity except for the rainfall over 100 mm. But these positive impacts are not evidently better than those with the emissivity atlas. In general, these results still suggest that the future use of the dynamic emissivity in the assimilation over the complex terrain is promising.",

    "abstract": "Reactive gases (O3, CO, NO2, and SO2) were collected hourly at the Akedala regional background station in northwestern China during September 2017 to August 2018. Wind rose, cluster analysis, potential source contribution function (PSCF), and concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) methods were adopted for identifying the transport pathways and potential source regions of these atmosphere components at Akedala. The average O3, CO, NO2, and SO2 mixing ratios detected were 29.65 ± 11.44 ppb, 123.78 ± 73.35 ppb, 3.79 ± 0.98 ppb, and 4.59 ± 0.88 ppb during the observation period, and the statistical results of the monthly mean values revealed that there were differences during the highest pollution period, with O3 and CO mainly peaking in February, with mixing ratios of 38.03 ± 7.10 ppb and 208.50 ± 106.50 ppb, respectively. Meanwhile, NO2 peaked in March (4.51 ± 0.54 ppb) and SO2 in January (5.70 ± 1.92 ppb). The most obvious diurnal variation of CO and SO2 was observed in the winter, with maximum levels reaching between 13 : 00 and 14 : 00. The diurnal variations of O3 exhibited low values during the night and maximum values in the afternoon (16 : 00–18 : 00). Diurnal variation was not significant in the case of NO2. Cluster analysis showed that six main paths affected the Akedala atmosphere. In turn, the PSCF and CWT analysis results indicated that the Akedala reactive gas was affected by both local and foreign sources. The high PSCF value of the reactive gas potential source areas appeared in eastern Kazakhstan, northern Xinjiang, Western Mongolia, and Southern Russia. The WCWT (weighted concentration-weight trajectory) values of CO and SO2 in winter were the highest, totaling 180–240 ppb and 5–6.5 ppb, respectively. The WCWT value of O3 in the spring and summer was higher than that in the autumn and winter. The main source area of O3 was about 32–36 ppb in the spring and summer, and the main source area of NO2 in the summer had a low WCWT value of 3–3.5 ppb, whereas the NO2 WCWT value was concentrated at 4–4.5 ppb in the other seasons.",

However, it is very challenging to accurately evaluate the error covariance between such variables due to the different characteristic time scales at which flows vary in different media. With a simple Lorenz-atmosphere and slab ocean coupled system that characterizes the interaction of two-timescale media in a coupled “climate” system, this study explores feasibility of the CPE with four-dimensional variational analysis and ensemble Kalman filter within a perfect observing system simulation experiment framework. It is found that both algorithms can improve the representation of air-sea coupling processes through CPE compared to state estimation only. These simple model studies provide some insights when parameter estimation is implemented with a coupled general circulation model for improving climate estimation and prediction initialization.",

The levels of some metals did not always drop to background level one day after the firework event. The contribution of fireworks to trace metal concentration levels (and emissions) for 2011 event was negligible compared to 2012 and 2013 events due to different meteorological conditions (precipitation). In addition, the impact of firework events on the ambient concentration levels of trace metals was likely to be different depending on their chemical speciation. The impact of firework events in Busan on urban air quality (trace metal) was less intense compared to other similar festivals worldwide. The largest emission of trace metals and elements from firework burning was represented by K (128–164 kg), followed by Pb, Cd, Cu, Mg, Ba, As, Al, Ga, Co, and Na.",

Public forecasts and warnings are a primary public health strategy for dealing with such extreme weather events; however, temperatures can vary widely within the administrative units used to issue warnings, particularly across urban landscapes. The emergence of more frequent and widely distributed sources of urban temperature data provide the opportunity to investigate the specificity of the current National Weather Service (NWS) warnings and to improve their accuracy and precision. In this work, temperatures from distributed public weather stations, NWS heat advisories and warnings, and land surface temperature imagery throughout two large metropolitan areas, Atlanta and Chicago, during the 2006–2012 summers are considered. We investigate the spatial variability of hazardous temperatures and their agreement against NWS advisories. Second, we examine the potential for thermal imagery to replicate National Weather Service heat warnings. Observations from weather stations exhibit varying degrees of agreement with NWS advisories. The level of agreement varied by station and was not found to be associated with the station’s proximate land cover. Air temperatures estimated from satellite imagery correspond with NWS Advisory status regionally and may enable creating more refined public warnings regarding hazardous temperatures and protective actions",

Voluntary forest carbon offset project which has the potential to boost forest carbon storage and mitigate global warming has aroused the global concern. The objective of this paper is to model the game situation and analyze the game behaviors of stakeholders of voluntary forest carbon offset projects in China. A stakeholder model and a Power-Benefit Matrix are constructed to analyze the roles, behaviors, and conflicts of stakeholders including farmers, planting entities, communities, government, and China Green Carbon Foundation. The empirical analysis results show that although the stakeholders have diverse interests and different goals, a win-win solution is still possible through their joint participation and compromise in the voluntary forest carbon offset project. A wide governance structure laying emphasis on benefit balance, equality, and information exchanges and being regulated by all stakeholders has been constructed. It facilitates the agreement among the stakeholders with conflicting or different interests. The joint participation of stakeholders in voluntary forest carbon offset projects might change the government-dominated afforestation/reforestation into a market, where all participators including government are encouraged to cooperate with each other to improve the condition of fund shortage and low efficiency.",

Observations and WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model are used to study the effect of MCS (mesoscale convective system) and topography on the rainfall. In this high-impact event, a quasi-stationary MCS developed in a favorable moist environment. The numerical simulation successfully reproduced the amount, location, and time evolution of the rainfall despite 4–6 h delay. In particular, the model reproduced the repeat passage of convective cells at the leading convergence line region along Taihang Mountains and the trailing stratiform region, producing the rainfall at nearly the right position. Results indicate the important roles of mesolow and low-level jet in maintaining the conditional instability that lifted the moist air to trigger deep convection and the repeated initiation and movement of the line shaped convective cells that produced the rainfall. The sensitive experiment was then further carried out to examine the effect of topography on this heavy rainfall. The reduction in model elevation field significantly influenced the above mesoscale systems, which lead to convective cells becoming less organized, and the peak rainfall amount in Beijing decreased by roughly 50%.",

Based on multivariable empirical orthogonal function technique for extreme precipitation processes (EPP) in WSB in 2013, this study reveals the dominant circulation patterns. Results indicate that the leading modes are characterized by “Saddle” and “Sandwich” structures, respectively. In one mode, a TC from the South China Sea (SCS) converts into the inverted trough and steers warm moist airflow northward into the WSB. At the same time, WPSH extends westward over the Yangtze River and conveys a southeasterly warm humid flow. In the other case, WPSH is pushed westward by TC in the Western Pacific and then merges with an anomalous anticyclone over SCS. The anomalous anticyclone and WPSH form a conjunction belt and convey the warm moist southwesterly airflow to meet with the cold flow over the WSB. The configurations of WPSH and TC in the tropic and the blocking and trough in the midhigh latitudes play important roles during the EPPs over the WSB. The persistence of EPPs depends on the long-lived large-scale circulation configuration steady over the suitable positions.",

However, the requirements for regional economic development and ecological balance cannot be fully met due to water resource shortage and overexploitation induced by an extremely dry climate and population growth, especially in the middle and lower basins. Thus, environmental conservation projects that reallocate water resources have been planned and implemented step by step since 2001. The aim of this study is to evaluate ecosystem restoration benefits by identifying vegetation dynamics and sensitivities. The MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its derivative indices, coupled with Geographic Information System (GIS), are introduced to explore ecosystem evolution at the pixel level, based on the hydrological and meteorological data in the whole region at varying temporal and spatial scales. Results indicate there are slight vegetation restoration trends in the upper, middle, and lower basin; the results of correlation analyses between vegetation and runoff into the lower basin suggest that the impact of a water supplement lasts at most three years, and engineering or nonengineering measures should be maintained for permanent ecosystem recovery.",

    "abstract": "In the atmospheric boundary layer, under high pressure conditions and negligible geostrophic winds, problems associated with pollution are the most critical. In this situation local winds play a major role in the evaluation of the atmospheric dynamics at small scales and in dispersion processes. These winds originate as a result of nonuniform heating of the soil, either when it is homogeneous or in discontinuous terrain in the presence of sea and/or slopes. Depending on the source of the thermal gradient, local winds are classified into convective boundary layer, sea and land breezes, urban heat islands, and slope currents. Local winds have been analyzed by (i) simple analytical models; (ii) numerical models; (iii) field measurements; (iv) laboratory measurements through which it is impossible to completely create the necessary similarities, but the parameters that determine the phenomenon can be controlled and each single wind can be separately analyzed. The present paper presents a summary of laboratory simulations of local winds neglecting synoptic winds and the effects of Coriolis force. Image analysis techniques appear suitable to fully describe both the individual phenomenon and the superposition of more than one local wind. Results do agree with other laboratory studies and numerical experiments.",

The litterfall in on-years was significantly lower than in off-years. Ice storm caused total litterfall increasing from 16.68% to 35.60% and greatly disturbed the litterfall peak rhythm especially in the on-year. The litter leaf nutrient concentrations at two latitudes significantly fluctuated after ice-snow disaster in 2008, litter leaf stoichiometric traits indicated that litter leaf chemistry showed more easily decomposition with higher C/P ratio, N/P ratio, and lower C/N ratio. It is clear from this study that litterfall restoration dynamic would result in long-term changes in litter nutrient cycling and may help predicting below ground carbon dynamic in future research as well as subtropical forest inventories following extreme disturbance.",

Compared to the CES scenario, the rate of increase in grassland cover is lower, while the rate of increase in urban land cover will be higher under the rapid economic growth (REG) scenario. Although the conversion from cropland to grassland will reduce the energy flux, the expansion of urban area and decreasing of forestry area will bring about more energy flux. As a whole, the energy flux of near surface will obviously not change under the CES scenario, and the climate therefore will not be possible to be influenced greatly by land cover change. The energy flux under the REG scenario is higher than that under the CES scenario.

The phenological data on first leaf date (FLD) and first flowering date (FFD) for five broad-leaved woody plants from 1963 to 2009 were analyzed. Since most phenological time series are discontinuous because of observation interruptions at certain period, we first interpolated phenological time series by using the optimal model between the spring warming (SW) model and the UniChill model to form continuous time series. Subsequently, by using regression analysis, we found that the spring phenophases of woody plants in China advanced at a mean rate of 0.18 days/year over the past 50 years. Changes of spring phenophases exhibited strong regional difference. The linear trends in spring phenophases were −0.18, −0.28, −0.21, −0.04, and −0.14 days/year for the Northeast China Plain, the North China Plain, the Middle-Lower Yangtze Plain, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, and South China, respectively.

In order to rapidly, automatically, and accurately retrieve the optimal parameters and structures of the ANFIS-based precipitation forecast model, a tabu search was applied to identify the adjacent radius in subtractive clustering when constructing the ANFIS structure. The coupled structure was also employed to establish a precipitation forecast model across short and long lead-times in order to improve the accuracy of long-term precipitation forecasts. The study area is the Shimen Reservoir, and the analyzed period is from 2001 to 2009. Results showed that the optimal initial ANFIS parameters selected by the tabu search, combined with the dual-model hybrid method and the coupled structure, provided the favors in computation efficiency and high-reliability predictions in typhoon precipitation forecasts regarding short to long lead-time forecasting horizons.",

The consistency between the historic GISS simulation and the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) precipitation suggests that the model can qualitatively capture the temporal trends of precipitation over the wet and dry areas. However, the precipitation trends are weaker in the model than in the observation. The observed trends of precipitation do not appear in the control simulation with the fixed concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols, which suggests that the global warming due to anthropogenic forcing can influence the temporal variations of precipitation over the wet and dry areas. Diagnostic studies of other variables from the model further suggest that enhanced rising air can increase the precipitation over the wet area.",

Based on the B-SHADE model, the best linear unbiased estimation of AMR could be obtained. A case study was conducted for the Three-River Headwaters region in the Tibetan Plateau of China, and its performance was compared with traditional methods. The results indicated that B-SHADE obtained the least estimation biases, with a mean error and root mean square error of −0.63 and 3.48 mm, respectively. For the traditional methods including arithmetic average, Thiessen polygon, and ordinary kriging, the mean errors were 7.11, −1.43, and 2.89 mm, which were up to 1027.1%, 127.0%, and 358.3%, respectively, greater than for the B-SHADE model. The root mean square errors were 10.31, 4.02, and 6.27 mm, which were up to 196.1%, 15.5%, and 80.0%, respectively, higher than for the B-SHADE model. The proposed technique can be used to extend the AMR record to the presatellite observation period, when only the gauge data are available.",

The results show that dust greatly increases in the Taklamakan Desert accompanied with the uplift of the northern TP, and the increase exceeds 150 µ g kg −1 in spring. A strong cyclone in the Tarim Basin produced by the uplifted northern TP enhances dust emissions in the Taklamakan Desert in summer. Meanwhile, the dust loading over the TP also increases induced by the uplift of the northern TP, causing the heat source over the TP decreased. Under the condition of the northern TP uplift to present altitude, dust delays the East Asia summer monsoon onset by two pentads and one pentad, respectively, in the southern and northern monsoon regions and greatly suppresses precipitation in East Asia compared with results in the low terrain experiments.",

We firstly describe hydrometeorology changing patterns (rainfall-runoff-soil erosion response) at different time scales (daily, monthly, and yearly) in perspective of river basins and then further investigate hydrometeorology impacts on erosive landform through combined analysis of statistical quantification and proposed conceptual model of rainfall-runoff-soil erosion landform. Through the above investigations, the following findings are achieved. Firstly, it shows that annual runoff and sediment discharges decreased obviously although precipitation remained at the same level in the past 50 years (1960–2010). Discharges of annual runoff and sediment decreased by 30%–80% and 60%–90%, respectively. Secondly, contributors of soil erosion are determined by integrated factors such as precipitation, river network, and topography characteristics of river basins. The strong soil erosion area existed in the middle hilly-gully region, while the high precipitation was in southern mountains. Thirdly, erosion landform development was largely shaped by hydrometeorology characteristics in comparison with other contributors. It shows that there is strong positive relationship between precipitation and erosion.",

Several sensitivity studies are completed to quantify the percentage contributions of local emissions versus regional emissions to the PM 2.5 concentrations under different weather conditions. The results indicate that the contributions from local emission is higher than those of the emissions from regional transport when there is no intrusion of cold front (i.e., 58% contribution from local emission versus 42% contribution from the regional transport).

Furthermore, the sensitivity study demonstrates that PM 2.5 concentrations on the first, second, and third days are reduced by 47%, 52%, and 58%, respectively, after the local emissions are turned off when there is no intrusion of cold front.

To fill this gap, the Standardized Water Budget Index (SWBI) is constructed based on the difference between areal precipitation and actual evapotranspiration (AET), which can describe the actual water budget but also assess the drought at multiple time scales. Then, sc-PDSI was taken as the reference drought index to compare with multiscalar drought indices at different time scale in Haihe River basin. The result shows that SWBI correlates better with sc-PDSI and the RMSE of SWBI is less than other multiscalar drought indices. In addition, all of drought indices show a decreasing trend in Haihe River Basin, possibly due to the decreasing precipitation from 1961 to 2010. The decreasing trends of SWBI were significant and consistent at all the time scales, while the decreasing trends of other multiscalar drought indices are insignificant at time scale less than 3 months.",

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate and correct precipitation forecasts of a storm-scale NWP model called the advanced regional prediction system (ARPS). The evaluation and correction consider five heavy precipitation events that occurred in the summer of 2015 in Jiangsu, China. The performances of the original and corrected ARPS precipitation forecasts are evaluated as a function of lead time using standard measurements and a spatial verification method called Structure-Amplitude-Location (SAL). In general, the ARPS could not produce optimal forecasts for very short lead times, and the forecast accuracy improves with increasing lead time. The ARPS overestimates precipitation for all lead times, which is confirmed by large bias in many forecasts in the first and second quadrant of the diagram of SAL, especially at the 1 h lead time. The amplitude correction is performed by matching percentile values of the ARPS precipitation forecasts and observations for each lead time. Amplitude correction significantly improved the ARPS precipitation forecasts in terms of the considered performance indices of standard measures and A-component and S-component of SAL.",

Analyzing 31 years of annual maximum rainfall data spanning from 1990 to 2020, the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) model proved to be the best for modeling extreme rainfall in all stations. Three estimation methods–L-moments, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)–were employed to estimate GEV parameters and future return levels. The Bayesian MCMC approach demonstrated superior performance by incorporating noninformative priors to ensure that the prior information had minimal influence on the analysis, allowing the observed data to play a dominant role in shaping the posterior distribution. Furthermore, return levels for various future periods were estimated, providing guidance for flood protection measures and infrastructure design. Trend analysis using <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mi>p</mi></math> value, Kendall’s tau, and Sen’s slope indicated no statistically significant trends in rainfall patterns, although a weak positive trend in extreme rainfall events was observed, suggesting a gradual and modest increase over time. Overall, the study contributes valuable insights into extreme rainfall patterns and underscores the importance of L-moments in identifying the best fit distribution and Bayesian MCMC methodology for accurate parameter estimation and prediction, enabling effective measures and infrastructure planning in the region.",

In this study, four popularly used single models were selected to forecast ET0 values, including support vector regression, Bayesian linear regression, ridge regression, and lasso regression models, respectively. They all had advantages of low requirement of data input and good capability of data fitting. However, forecast errors inevitably existed in those forecasting models due to data noise or overfitting. In order to improve the forecast accuracy of models, hybrid models were proposed to integrate the advantages of the single models. Before the construction of hybrid models, each single model’s weight was determined based on two weight determination methods, namely, the variance reciprocal and information entropy weighting methods. To validate the accuracy of the proposed hybrid models, 1–30 d forecast data from January 2 to February 1, 2022, were used as a test set in Xinxiang, North China Plain. The results confirmed the feasibility of the information entropy-based hybrid model. In detail, the information entropy model generated the mean absolute percentage errors of 11.9% or a decrease by 48.9% compared to the single and variance reciprocal hybrid models. Moreover, the model generated a correlation coefficient of 0.90 for 1–30 d ET0 forecasting or an increase by 13.6% compared to other models. The standard deviation and the root mean square error of the information entropy model were 1.65 mm·d−1 and 0.61 mm·d−1 or had a decrease by 16.4% and 23.7%. The maximum precision and the F1 score were 0.9618 and 0.9742 for the information entropy model. It was concluded that the information entropy-based hybrid model had the best midterm (1–30 d) ET0 forecasting performance in the North China Plain.",

The power spectrum density analysis revealed several local peaks that exceeded the 95% confidence interval. These peaks included periodicities of 483–490 days, 272 days, 157−162 days, 103−110 days, 64–72 days, 27 days, and 13 days. To investigate the potential influence of space weather parameters on UV radiation, data on cosmic rays, solar radio flux at 10.7 cm (F10.7 cm), the Kp index, and solar wind speed for the same time period were examined. The aim was to identify periodicities in these variables that aligned with those found in the UV radiation data. The analysis reveals that several periodicities observed in the UV radiation spectrum are also present in the spectra of the considered parameters. Prominent periodicities include a 270-day cycle in UV radiation and cosmic rays, as well as periodicities of 72 days, 27 days, and 13 days in all considered variables. Furthermore, 110-day peaks are observed in spectrum of the UV radiation, the Kp index, solar radio flux F10.7, and solar wind speed. Notably, consistent peaks at 157-day periodicity are identified in the UV spectrum, also present in the spectra of all the considered variables (cosmic rays ∼162 days, Kp index ∼162 days, solar radio flux ∼156 days, and solar wind speed ∼163 days). The identification of common periodicities between UV radiation and space weather parameters in this study provides compelling evidence of a potential direct or indirect influence of solar variations on UV radiation. This finding significantly enhances our understanding of the impact of extraterrestrial factors, particularly solar activity, on the Earth’s environment.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to address an assessment of climate change’s impact on agricultural water management in mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA). We used several agroclimatic indices, such as consecutive dry days (CDDs), maximum number of consecutive wet days (CWDs), consecutive summer days (CSUs), cold spell duration index (CDSIs), and warm and wet days (WWs), based on the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model to characterize the effect of climate on crop water need (CWN) in MSEA. The climate model shows monthly precipitation and temperature patterns with acceptable accuracy but with an underestimation of precipitation and a warm bias in temperature. CDDs show a significant increase in aridity and drought occurrences, particularly in northern Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, and northern Thailand, across different representative concentration pathways. CSUs have been seen to have a substantial influence on the region’s agricultural economy. The CDSIs, on the other hand, show a decrease in the duration of cold spells, indicating the existence of milder climatic conditions that could potentially affect crop growth. The CWDs show a decreasing trend in most of the multiple regions in Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Malaysia. Though the WW index shows more wet days, this does not immediately imply improved crop growth; rather, it highlights possible changes in water availability that could affect agricultural practices. While negative CWNs in the dry season months like March and November suggest possible water shortages, which pose risks to agriculture and food security in Myanmar, northern and eastern Thailand, and Cambodia, especially at the end of the century, increases in CWNs during the rainy season correspond with anticipated higher water demands for agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Thunderstorms are known to have the potential to cause damage to the population. In Mexico, these weather events can bring threats such as lightning, hail, damaging winds, and even tornadoes. Various parameters and indices have been developed for mid‐latitude regions to improve forecasting and reduce the potential damage from thunderstorms; however, they do not consider the specific conditions of tropical and subtropical environments. This research used a comprehensive set of thunderstorm reports and the proximity‐sounding approach using ERA5 reanalysis data to examine five important instability indices commonly used for thunderstorm forecasting regarding their spatial and temporal characteristics. The results reveal significant variations in the values of the instability indices during thunderstorm events associated with different atmospheric systems in both the high‐activity and low‐activity seasons. The above suggests that no single index can reliably predict thunderstorms throughout Mexico and during all seasons. Analyses provide forecasters with a more comprehensive understanding of the various atmospheric conditions under which thunderstorms develop in the country, which can lead to more accurate forecasting and better disaster risk management for these natural phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Drought is a recurring natural hazard impacting agriculture, water resources, and various socioeconomic sectors. This study evaluated the performances of multiple meteorological and hydrological drought index estimation methods in the Tekeze River basin, northwestern Ethiopia. Monthly rainfall and temperature data from 15 meteorological stations with varying record lengths (28–59 years) and streamflow data from nine functional stations (1991–2018) were used to compute hydrometeorological drought indices. Standardized precipitation index (SPI), standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), reconnaissance drought index (RDI), rainfall anomaly index (RAI), decile index (DI), and streamflow drought index (SDI) were calculated using DrinC software, R programming, and empirical formulas at 1, 3, 6, and 12‐month timescales. Results from the analysis revealed a basin‐wide prevalence of mild drought, with SPI indicating severity and negative values over longer timescales. The RDI analyses showed lower drought severity but also decreased its frequency over longer timescales. The DI calculation using basin station averages indicated 48.4%, 10.7%, and 8.0% incidence rates for severe, moderate, and mild droughts, respectively. RAI had generally lower positive and negative values compared to SPI. SPEI‐1 analysis classified almost all stations as experiencing mild drought. Conversely, SDI6 analysis at a 6‐month timescale revealed diverse impacts, with the Tekeze River basin experiencing sustained severe drought (SDI6 &lt; −2.0) for three consecutive years (2004–2006). Spearman’s rank correlation coefficients of the indices were positive, with RAI showing particularly strong and statistically significant positive correlations with other indices. This study provides valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and water resource managers in the Tekeze River basin, aiding in the development of effective drought mitigation and preparedness strategies.",

Data on daily temperature and rainfall were collected from the Ethiopian Meteorological Institute. The study utilized the Mann–Kendall test, Sen’s slope estimator, and descriptive statistical methods to analyze data and identify trends. The analysis revealed a significant increase in mean annual temperature ( p &lt; 0.001) with 0.045°C per annum. The lowland and midland experienced significant increases in mean annual temperature ( p &lt; 0.001) by 0.063°C and 0.094°C per year, respectively, while insignificant increase was found in the highland AEZ. Analysis of rainfall revealed high interannual and seasonal variability, with the highest rainfall variability observed in the lowland. The analysis also revealed the study area experienced a significant decrease in annual average rainfall ( p &lt; 0.01) by 3.704 mm and Belg rainfall, short rainy season from mid‐February to May ( p &lt; 0.05) by 22.46 mm per year. The annual number of rainy days (RDs &gt;1 mm) shows a significant decreasing trend ( p &lt; 0.001). The analysis further revealed decreasing trends of rainfall in all AEZs where the midland experienced a significant decrease in annual rainfall ( p &lt; 0.01) by 8.72 mm and Belg rainfall ( p &lt; 0.05) by 4.734 mm. In the Kiremt rainfall pattern, there was a decreasing wet spell and an increasing dry spell, and the annual rainfall coefficient of variation (CV) was 17.22% in the highland, 26% in the midland, and 32.36% in the lowland. Overall, the detected alterations in rainfall patterns, coupled with their considerable variability, are expected to negatively affect rain‐fed agriculture and the environment. The results of this study are anticipated to offer crucial insights into the spatiotemporal variability and climate trends, aiding decision‐makers and development planners in crafting tailored strategies to enhance climate resilience.",

It points out atmospheric conditions over West Africa before hurricane formation. The analysis was performed for two periods, June–November in 2004 and 2005, during which 12 hurricanes (seven in 2004, five in 2005) were selected. Using the AEW signature in the 700 hPa vorticity, a backward trajectory was performed to the African coast, starting from the date and position of each hurricane, when and where it was catalogued as a tropical depression. At this step, using the Meteosat‐7 satellite dataset, we selected all the MCSs around this time and region, and tracked them from their initiation until their dissipation. This procedure allowed us to relate each of the selected Hs with AEWs and a succession of MCSs that occurred a few times over West Africa before initiation of the hurricane. Finally, a dipole in sea surface temperature (SST) was observed with a positive SST anomaly within the region of H generation and a negative SST anomaly within the Gulf of Guinea. This SST anomaly dipole could contribute to enhance the continental convergence associated with the monsoon that impacts on the West African MCSs formation.",

This study focuses on the evaluation of a new land surface hydrology within the Noah-WRF land-atmosphere-coupled mesoscale model over the Sahel. This new hydrology explicitly takes account for the Dunne runoff using topographic information, the Horton runoff using a Green-Ampt approximation, and land surface heterogeneities. The previous and new versions of Noah-WRF are compared against a unique observation dataset located over the Dantiandou Kori (Niger). This dataset includes dense rain gauge network, surfaces temperatures estimated from MSG/SEVIRI data, surface soil moisture mapping based on ASAR/ENVISAT C-band radar data and in situ observations of surface atmospheric and land surface energy budget variables. Generally, the WAM is reasonably reproduced by Noah-WRF even if some limitations appear throughout the comparison between simulations and observations. An appreciable improvement of the model results is also found when the new hydrology is used. This fact seems to emphasize the relative importance of the representation of the land surface hydrological processes on the WAM simulated by Noah-WRF over the Sahel.",

Analysis showed that peak snow accumulation, snow-free day, and snowmelt slope all had strong correlation with peak streamflow, particularly in inland basins. Further analysis revealed that the variation of snow accumulation anomaly had strong lead correlation with the variation of streamflow anomaly. Over the entire Western United States, inner mountain areas had lead times of 4–10 pentads. However, in coastal areas, nearly all sites had lead times of less than one pentad. The relative contributions of rainfall and snowmelt to streamflow in different watersheds were calculated based on the snow lead time. The geographic distribution of annual relative contributions revealed that interior areas were dominated by snowmelt contribution, whereas the rainfall contribution dominated coastal areas. In the wet season, the snowmelt contribution increased in the western Pacific Northwest, whereas the rainfall contribution increased in the southeastern Pacific Northwest, southern Upper Colorado, and northern Rio Grande regions. The derived results demonstrated the predictive contributions of snowmelt and rainfall to streamflow. These findings could be considered a reference both for seasonal predictions of streamflow and for prevention of hydrological disasters. Furthermore, they will be helpful in the evaluation and improvement of hydrological and climate models.",

To gain insight into such anomalous seasons, the two La Niña winters and springs with the fewest tornadoes and the two El Niño winters and springs with the most tornadoes between 1979 and 2016 are identified and analyzed in this study. The relationships between daily tornado count and the Global Wind Oscillation and Madden-Julian Oscillation in these anomalous seasons are also explored. Lastly, seasonal and daily composites of upper-level flow, low-level flow and humidity, and atmospheric instability are generated to describe the environmental conditions in the anomalous seasons. The results of this study highlight the potential for large numbers of tornadoes to occur in a season if favorable conditions emerge in association with individual synoptic-scale events, even during phases of the El Niño/Southern Oscillation, Global Wind Oscillation, and Madden-Julian Oscillation that seem to be unfavorable for tornadoes. They also highlight the potential for anomalously few tornadoes in a season even when the oscillations are in favorable phases.",

    "abstract": "This is the first study in assessing the impact of climate change on Japanese ski fields with ensemble dynamical downscaling simulations. We target three ski fields in Ehime Prefecture, a southern border area for skiing in Japan. Our field survey revealed that a field located above 1200 m altitudes currently operates on natural snow supply, but those located at lower altitudes depend solely or partially on artificial snow supply. Fields are currently open for 82∼105 days. We analyzed ensemble high-resolution (5 km) dynamical downscaling simulations for future ski season durations with natural and artificial snow supplies. The future projection results for the end of the twenty-first century suggested that there would be virtually no natural snow accumulation in the study area for skiing. With artificial snow supply, a field located above 1200 m would be able to retain more than two months of ski season duration. Fields located at lower altitudes would only be able to open for 37∼43 days even with artificial snow supply. While the above projections suggest a severe outlook for the targeted ski fields, it is important to note that there is a strong demand from local skiers at beginner/intermediate levels for these ski fields. Thus, as long as these demands remain in the future, and if a business model to maximize profit during short opening periods is established, it may be possible to offset profit loss due to climate change.",

    "abstract": "A multicriteria score-based method was developed to assess the performances of 18 general circulation models (GCMs) in the study region from 1970 to 2005. The results indicate the following. (1) GCMs simulate temperature better than rainfall. The temporal and spatial distributions of simulated temperature performed well compared with those from the observations. In comparison to temperature, the spatial distribution of simulated precipitation performed poorly. Most of the GCMs underestimated temperature and overestimated precipitation. (2) The Grubbs test was used to detect anomalous moving changes in the rank score (RS) results; the inm-cm4 and ipsl-cm5b-lr models were rejected when simulating temperature, while the bnu-esm and canesm2 models performed poorly when simulating precipitation. (3) Adding or removing any criterion does not significantly influence the RS result, which indicates that the multicriteria score-based method is robust. The advantages of using multicriteria score-based method to assess GCMs performance were demonstrated, and this method also provides a more comprehensive assessment when compared with the single-criterion method. The multicriteria method could replace other criteria as the research requirements and could be easily extended to different study regions; the results could be used for better informed regional climate change impact analyses.",

Normal period as baseline between 1961 and 1990 (1990s) and recent period between 1991 and 2015 (2010s) were adopted in this study to analyse the possible effect of climate change on water availability during long-term period. Based on monthly and annual temperature (TT), precipitation (PP), and potential (ET0), the actual evapotranspiration (AET0) and water availability (WA) were computed at high spatial resolution. Between the two analysed periods, during the 2010s, it was found an increase in the maximum mean annual temperature by 1.08°C while the maximum mean annual precipitation saw a slight decrease (from 2222 mm to 2086 mm). The precipitation decrease is more intense in the South and West sectors of area (8%) and mainly depends on negative changes taking place during the winter and the beginning of spring (from December to March). The maximum mean annual ET0 and AET0 reached values of 663 mm and 565 mm during the 1990s, while during the 2010s, the found values were 668 mm and 572 mm, respectively. Because of the decrease in precipitation and increase in the ET0 and AET0, the WA (the proportion of precipitation that is available at the soil surface for subsequent infiltration and runoff processes) shows a reduction (about 10–20%) in the whole region, with exception of the North-East part of the Emilia-Romagna region. The decrease in the mean annual water availability induces severe issues concerning the water resources management across the whole Emilia-Romagna region.",

ESI tendency is the algebraic difference between April-ESI and January-ESI and it represents the simultaneous evolution of NAO and SO from winter to spring. During positive (negative) phase of ESI tendency, NAO restores positive (negative) phase and SO restores negative (positive) phase before the beginning of summer season. Thus during contrasting phases (positive and negative) of ESI tendency, the evolution of NAO and SO is out of phase. In this paper we have studied the spatial and temporal variability of winter-time temperature field over Europe, Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal during contrasting phases of ESI tendency. The study reveals that during positive (negative) ESI tendency, smaller (larger) region of Europe is showing significant winter-time cooling (warming) at surface. The relationship between winter-time surface temperature over above regions and Indian summer monsoon rainfall (ISMR) also shows spatial and temporal variability. The probable explanation for this change in the relationship is discussed in the paper. Two sets of temperature parameters for two different phases of ESI tendency are found out. Multiple regression equations are developed for the prediction of ISMR in each phase of ESI tendency. The performance of these equations is also discussed in this paper.",

In this paper, based on the baseline underlying surface data of 1993, the predicted underlying surface data which can be derived through overlaying the grassland degradation information to the map of baseline underlying surface, and the atmospheric forcing data of RCP 6.0 from CMIP5, climatological changes caused by future grassland changes for the years 2010–2020 and 2040–2050 with the Weather Research Forecast model (WRF) are simulated. The model-based analysis shows that future grassland degradation will significantly result in regional climate change. The grassland degradation in future could lead to an increasing trend of temperature in most areas and corresponding change range of the annual average temperature of −0.1°C–0.4°C, and it will cause a decreasing trend of precipitation and corresponding change range of the annual average precipitation of 10 mm–50 mm. This study identifies lines of evidence for effects of future grassland degradation on regional climate in Mongolia which provides meaningful decision-making information for the development and strategy plan making in Mongolia.",

Preexisting oceanic conditions affected the simulated central pressure and the inner-core axisymmetric structure of the simulated typhoon differently during the intensification, mature, and decaying phases, but they had little impact on the simulated track. Among the simulations, the simulated central pressure range during the mature phase was ~10 hPa. Simulated central pressure was highly correlated with the axisymmetric mean horizontal specific humidity flux between radii of 50 and 150 km and altitudes of 20 to ~2000 m, suggesting that this flux has potential as a new metric for predicting tropical cyclone intensity. Variations in preexisting oceanic conditions in the Kuroshio Extension region on the simulated atmospheric and oceanic horizontal fields affected the typhoon and a nearby stationary front differently. Around the stationary front, the impact on hourly precipitation was closely related to that on surface wind speed, whereas the impact on surface temperature was greatly affected by that on sea surface temperature through the latent heat flux.",

The simulation results indicate that the WRF model is appropriate for the simulation of the impact of grassland degradation on climate change. The grassland degradation during the next 30 years will result in the decrease of latent heat flux, which will further lead to the increase of temperature in summer, with an increment of 0.4–1.2°C, and the decrease of temperature in winter, with a decrement of 0.2°C.

    "abstract": "Aeolian dust modelling has improved significantly over the last ten years and many institutions now consistently model dust uplift, transport and deposition in general circulation models (GCMs). However, the representation of dust in GCMs is highly variable between modelling communities due to differences in the uplift schemes employed and the representation of the global circulation that subsequently leads to dust deflation. In this study two different uplift schemes are incorporated in the same GCM. This approach enables a clearer comparison of the dust uplift schemes themselves, without the added complexity of several different transport and deposition models. The global annual mean dust aerosol optical depths (at 550 nm) using two different dust uplift schemes were found to be 0.014 and 0.023—both lying within the estimates from the AeroCom project. However, the models also have appreciably different representations of the dust size distribution adjacent to the West African coast and very different deposition at various sites throughout the globe. The different dust uplift schemes were also capable of influencing the modelled circulation, surface air temperature, and precipitation despite the use of prescribed sea surface temperatures. This has important implications for the use of dust models in AMIP-style (Atmospheric Modelling Intercomparison Project) simulations and Earth-system modelling.",

Since it has been understood that the ice phase generally enhances the eyewall circulation in strong TCs because of additional heat release and insignificant effect of rainwater evaporation, this study focuses on the development of relatively weak vortices and TCs. Some past studies showed that the development is slower by the effects of the ice phase through cooling due to the melting of snow and graupel, whereas this study indicates that cooling due to evaporation of rainwater in the subcloud layer plays a much more important role in the slower development, and much more solid substances in the mid-troposphere, which are produced through the ice phase processes, contribute to more rainwater evaporation in the subcloud layer. The relative importance of many processes of the ice microphysics is also examined as a basis for future improvements of parameterization of the microphysical processes.",

Until recently, the best methods for evaluating regional climate variability were via observation networks and coarse-gridded reanalysis datasets. However, the recent development of high-resolution reanalysis datasets offers an opportunity to better evaluate the climatologically diverse continent of South America. This study compares NCEP’s CFS reanalysis dataset with NCEP’s coarser-resolution reanalysis II dataset to determine if CFS reanalysis improves our ability to represent the regional climate of South America. Our results show several regional differences between the CFSR and Re2 data, especially in areas of large topographical gradients. A comparison with the University of Delaware and TRMM precipitation datasets lends credence to some of these differences, such as heavier precipitation associated with anomalous 925 hPa westerlies over northwestern Peru and Ecuador during El Niño. However, our results also stress that caution is advised when using reanalysis data to assess regional climate variability, especially in areas of large topographical gradient such as the Andes. Our results establish a baseline to better study climate change, especially given the release of IPCC AR5 model simulations.",

A conceptual model was developed to determine water transfer patterns, and a one-dimensional heat diffusion-advection equation was employed to estimate vertical fluxes of ten different segments in the hyporheic zone in various ten segments of the catchment. The amount of water exchange varied from 78.47 mm/d to 23.66 mm/d and a decreasing trend from the upstream to downstream of catchment was observed. The spatial correlation of variability between the water exchange and distance is 0.62.

It is found that there is a strong rate of increase in tropical cold-point tropopause temperature (CPTT) in June 1999, with negative CPTT anomalies before June (March-April-May) and large positive anomalies after June (July-August-September). Multiple linear regression analysis shows that deep convection, the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), and tropical upwelling associated with the Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC) largely explain the variations of CPTT in 1999. Before June, enhanced deep convection resulting from increased sea surface temperature (SST) over the western Pacific and enhanced tropical upwelling of the BDC lead to a higher and colder tropopause. Those two factors explain 22% and 17% of the variance in CPTT, respectively. In June, the transformation of the east phase of QBO to the west phase contributes up to more than 50% of the variance in CPTT changes. After June, reduced tropical upwelling induced by weakened wave activity results in the warmer tropical tropopause temperatures to a large extent.",

The PSCPRS exhibits a significant monsoonal precipitation pattern. Using singular value decomposition (SVD) and composite analysis, the anomalous characteristics of SH atmospheric circulations and their impacts on the PSCPRS are studied. The results reveal that eastward movements or extensions of the Mascarene high (MH) and Australian high (AH), which have quasi-baroclinic geopotential height structures in the lower and middle troposphere, are the most significant factors affecting the PSCPRS. Their impacts on the PSCPRS anomalies are further studied using the index east of the MH (IEMH) and index east of the AH (IEAH). The IEMH and IEAH have notable significant positive correlations with the PSCPRS.

Asymptotic contraction rate analysis revealed the relationship between the primary and secondary rear-flank gust fronts (RFGF and SRFGFs) and the rear-flank downdraft (RFD) and occlusion downdrafts. This is thought to be the first radar-based analysis where the relationship between the near-surface gust fronts and their parent downdrafts has been explored for sequential mesocyclones. Changes in the SRFGFs were associated with surges in the RFD. During part of the mesocyclone lifecycle, the SRFGF produced a band of low-level convergence and associated deep updraft along the southwestern side of the hook echo region that ingested the RFD outflow and limited both entrainment into the RFD and reinforcement of low-level convergence along the leading edge of the primary RFGF. The second mesocyclone intensified from stretching in an occlusion updraft rather than in the primary updraft. This low-level mesocyclone remained well separated from the updraft shear region vorticity that was associated with a more traditional midlevel mesocyclone. However, the third mesocyclone initiated in the vorticity-rich region of the primary updraft zone and was amplified by stretching in the primary updraft.",

    "abstract": "Redundant observations impose a computational burden on an operational data assimilation system, and assimilation using high-resolution satellite observation data sets at full resolution leads to poorer analyses and forecasts than lower resolution data sets, since high-resolution data may introduce correlated error in the assimilation. Thus, it is essential to thin the observations to alleviate these problems. Superobbing like other data thinning methods lowers the effect of correlated error by reducing the data density. Besides, it has the added advantage of reducing the uncorrelated error through averaging. However, thinning method using averaging could lead to the loss of some meteorological features, especially in extreme weather conditions. In this paper, we offer a new superobbing method which takes into consideration the meteorological features. The new method shows very good error characteristic, and the numerical simulation experiment of typhoon “Lionrock” (2016) shows that it has a positive impact on the analysis and forecast compared to the traditional superobbing.",

The results showed that the root mean square innovations (RMSIs) of EnSRF were lower than 3DVar for radar reflectivity and radial velocity and that the spread of EnSRF was generally consistent with its RMSIs. EnSRF substantially improved the analysis of the MCS compared with an experiment without radar data assimilation, and it produced a slight but noticeable improvement over 3DVar in terms of both coverage and intensity. Forecast results initiated from the final analysis revealed that EnSRF generally produced the best prediction of the MCS, with improved quantitative reflectivity and precipitation forecast skills. EnSRF also demonstrated better performance than 3DVar in the prediction of neighborhood probability for reflectivity at thresholds of 20 and 35 dBZ, which better matched the observed radar reflectivity in terms of both shape and extension. Additionally, the humidity, temperature, and wind fields were also improved by EnSRF; the largest error reduction was found in the water vapor field near the surface and at upper levels.",

The proposed approach was developed in order to monitor and identify odor-active compounds responsible for odor annoyance coming from different industrial activities such as landfills, wastewater treatment plants, and petroleum plants. The methodology’s strengths are as follows: (1) the tailored approach for each typology of industrial areas/sites; (2) integration of technologies able to provide real-time information about the emissive sources; (3) mapping of air pollutants on the territory aimed to identify and discriminate among different fugitive emissions responsible for odor annoyance; (4) collection of more representative air samples only during the nuisance events, thanks to the implementation of innovative sampling systems and citizens’ involvement; and (5) increased analytical sensitivity in odor-active VOCs detection. This methodology reveals to be a useful tool to collect real-time information about the emission sources and their impacts on the surrounding area giving credit to citizens’ complaints. Moreover, it allows to overcome the limitations of the conventional approaches related to the lack of instrumental sensitivity and to identify the chemical compounds contributing to the odor annoyance.",

The aim of this study is to assess the effect of industrial transfer policy on the air quality in WCB. Firstly, we used the surface in situ NO 2 concentrations to compare with the OMI-retrieved tropospheric NO 2 columns in order to verify the accuracy of the satellite data over the WCB area. Although it is difficult to compare the two datasets directly, the comparison results prove the accuracy of the OMI-retrieved tropospheric NO 2 columns in cities of WCB. Then, the spatial distributions of the annual averaged tropospheric NO 2 total columns over Anhui Province show that NO 2 columns were considerably higher in WCB than those in other areas of Anhui. Also, we compared the spatial distributions of the total NO 2 columns in 2005 through 2010 and in 2011 through 2016 and found that the total NO 2 columns in WCB increased by 19.9%, while the corresponding value increased only 13.9% in other Anhui areas except the WCB area. Furthermore, the temporal variations of NO 2 columns show that although the NO 2 columns over WCB and Anhui increased significantly from 2005 to 2011, they decreased sharply from 2011 to 2016 due to the strict emission reduction measures in China. Finally, the HYSPLIT model was used to analyze the origins of NO 2 and transport pathways of air masses in a typical city, Ma’anshan city.",

Firstly, the tree ring width of cypress during 1700 to 1955 beside the Huangdi Tomb and the long-term sunspot number during 1700 to 1955, respectively, are decomposed by VMD into a series of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Secondly, Hilbert transformation on the decomposed IMF component is performed. Then, the marginal spectra are given and analyzed. Finally, their quasiperiodic properties are obtained as follows: the tree ring width has the quasiperiodicity of 2 to 7a, 10.8a, and 25a; the sunspot number has the quasiperiodicity of 8.3a, 9.9a, 11.1a, 52.2a, and 101.2a. The result obtained by analyzing that quasiperiodicity shows that the main periods of tree ring width and the sunspot number in the same period are basically consistent, and tree ring width has other cycles. This shows that sunspot activity is an important factor affecting tree ring growth, and tree ring width is influenced by other external environments.",

In this analysis, 50-year periods (1961–2010) of thunderstorm codes have been collected from 283 synoptic stations of Meteorological Organization of Iran. The study period has been divided into five different decades (1961–1970, 1971–1980, 1981–1990, 1991–2000, and 2001–2010). Spectral analysis and Moran’s I were used to analyze cycles and the spatial autocorrelation pattern, respectively. Furthermore, in order to conduct the calculations, programming facilities of MATLAB have been explored. Finally, Surfer and GIS were employed to come up with the graphical depiction of the maps. The results showed that the maximum of positive anomalies mainly occurred in the northwestern and western parts of Iran due to their special topography, during all the five studied periods. On the other hand, the minimum of negative anomalies took place in central regions of the country because of lack of appropriate conditions (e.g., enough humidity). Moran’s I spatial analysis further confirmed these findings as Moran’s I depicts the positive and negative spatial autocorrelation patterns in line with negative and positive anomalies, respectively. However, in recent decades, this pattern has experienced a declining trend, especially in southern areas of Iran. The results of harmonic analysis indicated that mainly short-term and midterm cycles dominated Iran’s thunderstorms.",

    "abstract": "An abnormal heavy rainfall that occurred on 27 October 2014 in the Sichuan Basin (SB), China, is analyzed. An inverted trough at 850 hPa evolved into a Southwest China Vortex (SWCV), and strong upward motion caused by interaction between the low-level jet (LLJ) at 850 hPa and the upper-level jet (ULJ) at 200 hPa triggered the rainstorm process. Under a large-scale circulation system featuring a westerly trough and subtropical high, there were two cloud bands over the northeast side and south side of the Tibetan Plateau, respectively. Influenced by the eastward-moving trough, the inverted trough, LLJ, and the SWCV, a Mesoscale Convective System (MCS) was generated near the intersection of the two cloud bands, and it was the direct rainstorm system. The MCS strengthened under the situation of the 850 hPa inverted trough, but weakened when the inverted trough evolved to into the SWCV. Eventually, it formed the phenomenon known as “existing vortex without cloud.” Through analysis of the possible reasons why precipitation strengthened (weakened) under the situation of the inverted trough (SWCV), it was found that the strengthening of precipitation was due to a strong tilting updraft in the area of the ULJ and LLJ intersection. On one hand, the upward motion was related to the vorticity advection variation with height and the low-level warm advection forcing; while on the other hand, the dew-point front near the LLJ also played a lifting role in the upward flow of the lower-layer vertical circulation. Meanwhile, the LLJ “head” was a high-value area of water vapor convergence, which provided sufficient water vapor for the rainstorm. During the SWCV, the weakening of precipitation was due to the SWCV weakening gradually; plus, the ULJ was interrupted over the SB, the upper airflow presented downdrafts, and its superposition with the ascending branch of low-level vertical circulation. This airflow structure inhibited the development of strong upward motion, whilst at the same time, the LLJ retreated toward the south and the dew-point front ultimately weakened and disappeared. Subsequently, water vapor convergence weakened and no longer supported the occurrence of heavy rainfall. Therefore, the strong upward motion caused by the ULJ-LLJ intersection and the lower-level dew-point front were the key reasons for the occurrence of this late-autumn rainstorm.",

The results show the following. The runoff in the SRYR displays a significant interannual and interdecadal variability. The runoff in the SRYR during the flood season is most closely related to 15-day (June 16 to September 15) antecedent rainfall in the coastal zone of the SRYR. In turn, the antecedent rainfall in the coastal zone of the SRYR is mainly affected by the intensity of the simultaneous WJ over a key region (55–85°E, 45–55°N). When the intensity of the WJ over the key region is greater (less) than normal , the jet position moves northward (southward), and the easterly (westerly) wind anomalies over the region to the west of the SRYR become unfavorable (favorable) to the transport of water vapor from high-latitude regions to the SRYR. In addition, the southerly wind over the equatorial region cannot (can) easily advance northward, which is unfavorable (favorable) to the northward transport of water vapor from the low-latitude ocean. Hence, these conditions result in a decrease (increase) in the water vapor content in the SRYR. Furthermore, the convergence (divergence) anomalies in the upper level and the divergence (convergence) anomalies in the lower level result in the descending (ascending) motion over the SRYR. These factors decrease (increase) the rainfall, thereby decreasing (increasing) the runoff in the SRYR during the flood season.",

    "abstract": "To obtain critical rainfall (CR) estimates similar to the rainfall value that causes minor basin outlet flooding, and to reduce the flash flood warning missed/false alarm rate, the effect of unit hydrographs (UHs) and rainfall hyetographs on computed threshold rainfall (TR) values was investigated. The Tanjia River basin which is a headwater subbasin of the Greater Huai River basin in China was selected as study basin. Xin’anjiang Model, with subbasins as computation units, was constructed, and time-variant distributed unit hydrographs (TVUHs) were used to route the channel network concentration. Calibrated Xin’anjiang Model was employed to derive the TVUHs and to obtain the maximum critical rainfall duration ( D max ) of the study basin. Initial soil moisture condition was represented by the antecedent precipitation index (Pa). Rainfall hyetographs characterized by linearly increasing, linearly decreasing, and uniform hyetographs were used. Different combinations of the three hyetographs and UHs including TVUHs and time-invariant unit hydrographs (TIVUHs) were utilized as input to the calibrated Xin’anjiang Model to compute the relationships between TR and Pa (TR-Pa curves) by using trial and error methodology. The computed TR-Pa curves reveal that, for given Pa and UH, the TR corresponding to linearly increasing hyetograph is the minimum one. So, the linearly increasing hyetograph is the optimum hyetograph type for estimating CR. In the linearly increasing hyetograph context, a comparison was performed between TR-Pa curves computed from different UHs. The results show that TR values for different TIVUHs are significantly different and the TR-Pa curve gradient of TVUHs is lower than that of TIVUHs. It is observed that CR corresponds to the combination of linearly increasing hyetograph and TVUHs. The relationship between CR and Pa (CR-Pa curves) and that between CR and duration ( D ) (CR- D curves) were computed. Warnings for 12 historical flood events were performed. Warning results show that the success rate was 91.67% and that the critical success index (CSI) was 0.91. It is concluded that the combination of linearly increasing hyetograph and TVUHs can provide the CR estimate similar to the minimum rainfall value necessary to cause flash flooding.",

    "abstract": "Reliable and accurate temperature data acquisition is not only important for hydroclimate research but also crucial for the management of water resources and agriculture. Gridded data products (GDPs) offer an opportunity to estimate and monitor temperature indices at a range of spatiotemporal resolutions; however, their reliability must be quantified by spatiotemporal comparison against in situ records. Here, we present spatial and temporal assessments of temperature indices ( T max , T min , T mean , and DTR) products against the reference data during the period of 1979–2015 over Punjab Province, Pakistan. This region is considered as a center for agriculture and irrigated farming. Our study is the first spatiotemporal statistical evaluation of the performance and selection of potential GDPs over the study region and is based on statistical indicators, trend detection, and abrupt change analysis. Results revealed that the CRU temperature indices ( T max , T min , T mean , and DTR) outperformed the other GDPs as indicated by their higher CC and R 2 but lower bias and RMSE. Furthermore, trend and abrupt change analysis indicated the superior performances of the CRU T min and T mean products. However, the T max and DTR products were less accurate for detecting trends and abrupt transitions in temperature. The tested GDPs as well as the reference data series indicate significant warming during the period of 1997–2001 over the study region. Differences between GDPs revealed discrepancies of 1-2°C when compared with different products within the same category and with reference data. The accuracy of all GDPs was particularly poor in the northern Punjab, where underestimates were greatest. This preliminary evaluation of the different GDPs will be useful for assessing inconsistencies and the capabilities of the products prior to their reliable utilization in hydrological and meteorological applications particularly over arid and semiarid regions.",

While almost all the WRF simulations overestimated the rainfall during the wet season, BMJ for cumulus physics performed better in the northern and central regions, and KF performed better in the south region. The YSU scheme performed best as the planetary boundary layer for both wet and dry seasons, while WSM5 for the wet season and Lin for the dry season gave the best model performance as the microphysics option.",

The purpose of this study is to understand the spatiotemporal variations of the droughts in this region and to further estimate future changes. Multiple drought indexes such as the standardized precipitation index (SPI), the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), and the self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (SC-PDSI) are used to investigate the temporal and spatial characteristics of the ARNC drought from 1950 to 2012. Our results indicate the following: (1) The drought indexes exhibit significant increasing trends, and the highest drought frequency occurred in the 1960s, followed by a decreasing trend during the next few decades. All four seasons exhibit a wet trend, with a higher drought frequency in summer than in the other seasons. (2) The changes of the drought indexes in the ARNC also exhibit distinct spatial variations, with a wet trend in the subregions of North Xinjiang (NXJ), the Tianshan Mountains (TS), South Xinjiang (SXJ), and the Qilian Mountains (QL), but with a dry trend in the subregions of the Hexi Corridor (HX) and the western part of Inner Mongolia (WIM).

Although many measures to control haze have been implemented, no significant improvement has been observed, and haze still exists. In this study, we used wavelet transform to investigate the changes in PM2.5 on the time scale, the relationship amongst meteorological factors, and the causes and changes in haze formation and take measures to prevent haze. Results indicated the following: (1) The peak of PM2.5 changes in winter in the past three years primarily occurred in the range from 11:00 to 13:00 and 20:00 to 22:00. (2) Multiple cycles of daily average PM2.5 concentrations existed in 3–5 d, 6–14 d, 6–21 d, and 16–27 d, with a significant oscillation in 6–14 d and stable cycle characteristics. (3) The meteorological factors promoted the formation of haze to a certain extent. When haze occurred, the near-surface wind speed was only 1 m/s, which was not conducive to the spread of pollutants. (4) The formation of haze was affected by the interaction of various factors; the photochemical reactions of NO2 and O3 also exacerbated the formation of pollutants. This study provided a clear direction for the prevention and prediction of haze. Furthermore, the government must take relevant measures to reduce pollutant emissions and ensure the air quality of cities in winter.",

Rain fell at a rate of 64 mm/h, producing 400 mm of total accumulation during this period.

The DEM derived from LiDAR enabled the debris flow to be mapped and analyzed in great detail. The estimated affected area and erosion/deposition volumes by debris flow were compared with two-dimensional numerical simulation. The simulation results were sufficiently in good agreement with the debris flow track, and a success rate of over 90% was achieved with a simulation time of 300 s. A comparison of the simulated and surveyed results based on deposition volume yields a success rate of over 97% with 350 s of simulation time.",

Firstly, the vital ocean environment factors which affect the underwater navigation safety are taken into account, and a novel basic probability assignment (BPA) construction method of ocean environment factors is proposed according to their characteristics. Then, a new transformation method of BPA to decision-making probability is put forward to deal with the uncertainty degree. Furthermore, the super-standard weight is applied to preprocess the BPA, and D-S combination rule is used to acquire the evaluation result by fusing the preprocessed BPA. Ocean environment safety situation index is obtained by quantizing the evaluation grades. Finally, experimental results show that the method proposed has the superior practicability and reliability in actual applications.",

The objective of the study is to characterize their climatology and role in rainfall variability in western Sahel. Wavelet analysis was used on wind speed data and implications to ENSO were discussed subsequently. Our results show that while the low-level African Westerly Jet (AWJ) correlates well with rainfall south of the equator in boreal winter months, the Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) and African Easterly Jet (AEJ) correlate better with rainfall north of the equator in the boreal summer months. Results of interannual-to-decadal variability in 200 mb, 600 mb, and 850 mb of zonal wind reveal that there is enhanced variability in the 2–8 year band. Also, the TEJ, AEJ, and AWJ fluctuations are coupled with variations in southern oscillation. Further analysis suggests a statistically significant association between TEJ and the El Niño events of the 1980s that led to intense drought in the Sahel region of West Africa. The 2007 moderate La Niña shows a statistically significant coherence with the 500 mb, 600 mb, and 850 mb jets. These associations are also phase locked, suggesting that the association may be more than by chance.",

This feature is adopted to validate the fidelity of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) in this study. In addition, the authors examine whether the teleconnection pattern persists in the future under a global warming scenario. Generally, most of the eight selected models show a positive correlation between November SST over Niño 3 region and December–February (DJF) mean daily precipitation anomalies over the SE US, consistent with the observation. However, the models with poor realization of skewness of Niño indices fail to simulate the realistic teleconnection pattern in the historical simulation. In the Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5) run, all of the models maintain positive and slightly increased correlation patterns. It is noteworthy that the region with strong teleconnection pattern shifts northward in the future. Increased variance of winter precipitation due to the SST teleconnection is shown over Alabama and Georgia rather than over Florida under the RCP8.5 scenario in most of the models, differing from the historical run in which the precipitation in Florida is the most attributable to the eastern Pacific SST.",

During the campaign, 8 haze periods were identified when on average PM 1 mass increased to 62.1 ± 25.6 μ g/m 3 compared to 30.7 ± 17.1 μ g/m 3 during clear weather periods. The sum of SIA in PM 1 increased in mass concentration during the haze from 14.9 ± 7.4 μ g/m 3 during clear periods to 29.7 ± 10.7 μ g/m 3 during the haze periods. Correlation coefficients ( R 2 ) of the visibility as function of mass concentrations of SIA species in PM 1 show negative exponential relations implying the importance of the SIA species in visibility reduction. The important role of ammonia in SIA formation is recognized and demonstrated. Generally, ammonium neutralizes sulfate and nitrate and the molar equivalent ratio of ammonium versus the sum of sulfate and nitrate increases during the haze episodes. Air mass backward trajectories introducing the haze periods show the impact of nonlocal ammonia on visibility degradation in Shanghai.",

    "abstract": "The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) is a physically based model that is used extensively to simulate hydrologic processes in a wide range of climates around the world. SWAT uses spatial hydrometeorological data to simulate runoff through the computation of a retention curve number. The objective of the present study was to compare the performance of two approaches used for the calculation of curve numbers in SWAT, that is, the Revised Soil Moisture Index (SMI), which is based on previous meteorological conditions, and the Soil Moisture Condition II (SMCII), which is based on soil features for the prediction of flow. The results showed that the sensitive parameters for the SMI method are land-use and land-cover features. However, for the SMCII method, the soil and the channel are the sensitive parameters. The performances of the SMI and SMCII methods were analyzed using various indices. We concluded that the fair performance of the SMI method in an arid region may be due to the inherent characteristics of the method since it relies mostly on previous meteorological conditions and does not account for the soil features of the catchment.",

This interface develops within a certain thickness, yet thin regarding the planetary radius and critical for water and other dynamics. This heterogeneous Critical Zone ranges from the bottom of groundwater reservoirs to the top of the tree canopy [1], including surface water liquid and frozen and gaseous flows and storages. Complex space-time effects develop in this critical zone such as orographic and oceanic influences on moisture-precipitation dynamics, hydrogeomorphological structure-function relationships, upstream-downstream integration, subsystems connectivities, variability interdependences, and scaling issues [2–6]. In some geographic settings, this critical zone is further complexified by extreme conditions of some of the properties, such as dryness or wetness, groundwater geometries and dynamics, cryospheric developments (snow, ice, and permafrost), soil and land covers, water uses, and concentration of water-driven chemicals.",

A large number of global climatic variables with varying interaction patterns over years influence monsoon. Various statistical and neural prediction models have been proposed for forecasting monsoon, but many of them fail to capture variability over years. The skill of predictor variables of monsoon also evolves over time. In this article, we propose a joint-clustering of monsoon years and predictors for understanding and predicting the monsoon. This is achieved by subspace clustering algorithm. It groups the years based on prevailing global climatic condition using statistical clustering technique and subsequently for each such group it identifies significant climatic predictor variables which assist in better prediction. Prediction model is designed to frame individual cluster using random forest of regression tree. Prediction of aggregate and regional monsoon is attempted. Mean absolute error of 5.2% is obtained for forecasting aggregate Indian summer monsoon. Errors in predicting the regional monsoons are also comparable in comparison to the high variation of regional precipitation. Proposed joint-clustering based ensemble model is observed to be superior to existing monsoon prediction models and it also surpasses general nonclustering based prediction models.",

Fruit-picking has become a popular rural tourism activity worldwide. However, fruit maturity dates (FMD) have been affected by climate change (CC), which has in turn profoundly affected fruit-picking tourism activities (FPTA). In this paper, phenological data on the FMD for 45 types of plants in 1980–2012, dates for more than 200 fruit-picking festivals, and data on monthly average air temperature in 1980–2013 were used to assess the impact of CC on FPTA by wavelet and correlation analyses. The findings indicated that the study area had been significantly affected by CC. Prevailing temperatures at one or three months prior have a decisive influence on FMD. Among the 11 plants directly related to FPTA, the FMD of four were significantly advanced, while 6-7 were significantly delayed owning to increased temperature. Of the 11 FPTA, only two had realized the impact of CC and had adjusted festival opening dates based on dynamic changes. However, a considerable number of festival activities remained fixed or scheduled on the weekends.",

Upon identifying a tropical VPR, the event can be further classified as either tropical-stratiform or tropical-convective rainfall by a fuzzy logic (FL) algorithm. Based on the precipitation-type fields, the reflectivity values are converted into rainfall rate using a Z - R relationship. In order to evaluate the performance of this rainfall classification scheme, three experiments were conducted using three months of data and two study cases. In Experiment I, the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) default Z - R relationship was applied. In Experiment II, the precipitation regime was separated into convective and stratiform rainfall using the FL algorithm, and corresponding Z - R relationships were used. In Experiment III, the precipitation regime was separated into convective, stratiform, and tropical rainfall, and the corresponding Z - R relationships were applied. The results show that the rainfall rates obtained from all three experiments match closely with the gauge observations, although Experiment II could solve the underestimation, when compared to Experiment I. Experiment III significantly reduced this underestimation and generated the most accurate radar estimates of rain rate among the three experiments.",

The impacts of meteorological variables on RET were assessed through sensitive analysis by comparing the resulting RETs from artificially disturbed meteorological variables. The results indicated that the RET for 16 stations in Mongolia showed an increasing trend, particularly in the center and south. The calculated RET was higher than precipitation, which means severe droughts in Mongolia. The spatial patterns of RET are significantly influenced by climatic conditions as well as characteristics of the underlying surface (e.g., elevation and vegetation).

A typical ungauged river reach of Heihe River in northwestern China was selected as a case study. Monthly discharge from 1991 to 2007 at one gauged section was estimated using this procedure to validate the procedure, and the results show its potential in estimating discharge for an ungauged area. Monthly discharge from 1979 to 2014 at four unmonitored sections was estimated using the same procedure, and the trend analysis was conducted to check the facticity of the estimated discharge. The annual and monthly trends could well describe the effects of anthropogenic activities on the flow at different sections.

    "abstract": "In order to analyze the primary sources of air pollutants in Chang-Zhu-Tan region, this article selected the environmental monitoring data and meteorological data in the winter of 2019 to calculate the backward airflow trajectories with the Chang-Zhu-Tan region as the starting point by using the backward trajectory model. Combined with the ground concentration monitoring data, cluster analysis, potential source contribution factor (PSCF) analysis, and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis were carried out to determine the pollutant transportation paths and sources of the potential source area. The results show that air mass transportation mainly comes from three directions: northwest, northeast, and southwest China. The airflow in northwest China moves faster and cleaner, while the airflow from the northeast and southwest moves slowly and carries a high concentration of pollutants. PSCF and CWT analyses show that the critical potential sources are mainly located in this area and some cities next to the study area. This study has important practical significance for the environmental research of Chang-Zhu-Tan region and can provide theoretical reference for regional joint prevention and control of air pollution.",

    "abstract": "Understanding hydroclimatic variability and trend for the past four decades in the Upper Tekeze River basin is significant for future sustainable water resource management as it indicates regime shifts in hydrology. Despite its importance for improved and sustainable water allocation for water supply-demand and food security, varying patterns of streamflow and their association with climate change are not well understood in the basin. The main objective of this study was to characterize, quantify, and validate the variability and trends of hydroclimatic variables in the Upper Tekeze River basin at Ghba subbasin using graphical and statistical methods for homogeneous stations for the time period from 1953 to 2017, not uniform at all stations. The rainfall, temperature, and streamflow trends and their relationships were evaluated using the regression method, Mann–Kendall (MK) test, Spearman’s rho (SR) test, Sen’s slope, and correlation analysis. The analysis focused on rainfall, temperature, and streamflow collected from 11 climate and six hydrostations. For simplicity to discuss the interannual and temporal variability the stations were categorized into two clusters according to their record length, category 1 (1983–2017) and category 2 (1953–2017). About 73% and 27% of the rainfall stations exhibited normal to moderate annual rainfall variability. The MK and SR test showed that most of the significant trends in annual rainfall were no change except in one station decreasing and the test also showed no significant change in temperature except in three stations showed an increasing trend. Overall, streamflow trends and change point timings were found to be consistent among the stations and all have shown a decreasing trend. Changes in streamflow without significant change in rainfall suggest factors other than rainfall drive the change. Most likely the observed changes in streamflow regimes could be due to changes in catchment characteristics of the subbasin. These research results offer critical signals on the characteristics, variability and trend of rainfall, temperature, and streamflow necessary to design improved and sustainable water allocation strategies.",

    "abstract": "The variation of solar radiation has a profound effect on the surface energy balance and hydrological cycle. Although the relationship between solar radiation variation and its influencing factors has been extensively studied, they are seldom used in Xinjiang, the largest province in China. In this study, we investigated the spatial distribution and temporal variation in global radiation (Eg), water vapor content (WVC), aerosol optical depth (AOD), total cloud cover (TCC), and low-level cloud cover (LCC) in Xinjiang, northwestern China, between 1961 and 2015. The annual average Eg reported at all stations was 5126.3–6252.8 MJ·m−2 with a mean of 5672 MJ·m−2. The highest annual mean Eg of 6252.8 MJ·m−2 occurred in Hami, eastern Xinjiang, whereas the lowest annual mean Eg of 5126.3 MJ·m−2 occurred in Urumqi, northern Xinjiang. The annual Eg variation was mainly affected by WVC, AOD, TCC, and LCC. Decreases in annual, spring, summer, autumn, and winter Eg trends were recorded in Xinjiang at rates of −33.88 × 10−2, −1.92 × 10−2, −1.89 × 10−2, −3.47 × 10−2, and −3.56 × 10−2 MJ·m−2·decade−1, respectively, with decreasing ratios of 9.43%, 5.85%, 0.14%, 8%, and 20.55%, respectively. Increasing trends in annual WVC, AOD, TCC, and LCC were noted in Xinjiang at rates of 7.12 × 10−5 mm·decade−1, 2.74 × 10−6 decade−1, 8.77 × 10−5 % decade−1, and 5.73 × 10−5% decade−1, respectively. In addition, increasing trends in the annual Eg at Yining and Yanqi stations were observed. The Eg spatial distribution was complex in Xinjiang at the stations observed in this study, which were divided into six groups. Eg at group 1 showed an increasing trend associated with decreases in the WVC and TCC, whereas decreases in Eg were observed at groups 2–6, which could have been influenced by increases in AOD, TCC, and LCC.",

The SHEP and SFP rainstorms have the characteristics of long duration and wide range, while the NCVP rainstorms are characterized by mobility and disaster weather accompaniment. The daily precipitation of LLVSP cases has extremity feature. The occurrence and development of rainstorms are well coordinated with the systems on lower levels. The main water vapor channel in lower layers of the SFP cases is from the South China Sea, while it is from Bohai for the NCVP cases and the Bay of Bengal for the SHEP and LLVSP cases. The main water vapor channel in middle layers is from the Bay of Bengal because of the affection of the southwest air flow. The south boundary of the MLYRB is the most important water vapor input boundary, followed by the west boundary, while the East and North boundaries are the outflow boundaries. During the rainstorms, the low-level water vapor is exuberant with low-level water vapor convergence much stronger than the high-level divergence. Among the four types of rainstorms, the NCVP cases provide the most abundant low-level water vapor convergence, resulting in the strongest short-term precipitation among the four types. Combined with water vapor transportation and convergence, the refined spatial conceptual models of the four types of rainstorms can better judge the process intensity and falling area and provide reference for disastrous weather forecast and early warning.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is a terrible global concern and one of the greatest future threats to societal development as a whole. The accelerating pace of climate change is becoming a major challenge for agricultural production and food security everywhere. The present study uses the midcentury climate derived from the ensemble of 29 general circulation models (GCMs) on a spatial grid to quantify the anticipated climate change impacts on rice, maize, black gram, and red gram productivity over Tamil Nadu state in India under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios. The future climate projections show an unequivocal increase of annual maximum temperature varying from 0.9 to 2.2°C for RCP 4.5 and 1.4 to 2.7°C in RCP 8.5 scenario by midcentury, centered around 2055 compared to baseline (1981–2020). The projected rise in minimum temperature ranges from 1.0 to 2.2°C with RCP 4.5 and 1.8 to 2.7°C under RCP 8.5 scenario. Among the monsoons, the southwest monsoon (SWM) is expected to be warmer than the northeast monsoon (NEM). Annual rainfall is predicted to increase up to 20% under RCP 4.5 scenario in two-third of the area over Tamil Nadu. Similarly, RCP 8.5 scenario indicates the possibility of an increase in rainfall in the midcentury with higher magnitude than RCP 4.5. Both SWM and NEM seasons are expected to receive higher rainfall during midcentury under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 than the baseline. In the midcentury, climate change is likely to pose a negative impact on the productivity of rice, maize, black gram, and red gram with both RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios in most places of Tamil Nadu. The magnitude of the decline in yield of all four crops would be more with RCP 8.5 over RCP 4.5 scenario in Tamil Nadu. Future climate projections made through multi-climate model ensemble could increase the plausibility of future climate change impact assessment on crop productivity. The adverse effects of climate change on cereal and legume crop productivity entail the potential adaptation options to ensure food security.",

The results show that the South Benin experienced extreme rainfall on many occasions between 1960 and 2018 with a nonuniform spatiotemporal distribution of this category of rainfall. No statistically significant trend in the frequency and variation of extreme rainfall intensities is revealed over the study period. Despite the low rate of extreme rainfall, the monthly trend is consistent with the bimodal rainfall regime in southern Benin. The global warming highlighted in its last decades in southern Benin is accompanied by a slightly upward trend in extreme rainfall compared to the period before 1990.",

    "abstract": "Central Vietnam is characterized by severe flooding associated with heavy rainfall events caused by interactions between multiscale atmospheric circulations and the complex local terrain. Previous studies believed rainfall in central Vietnam is closely related to the cold surge; however, it fails to explain the cause of the early rainfall occurrence in August in the subregion. For the first time, this study investigates the detailed atmospheric mechanisms associated with rainfall variations in central Vietnam using the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) applied to the recently developed high-resolution Vietnam gridded precipitation (VnGP) dataset. Reanalysis data NCEP/NCAR is used to associate the rainfall changes with respective atmospheric mechanisms. EOF analysis detected two dominant rainfall modes. The primary mode explains the rainfall variation from October to November over the central and is directly related to the interaction of cold surges and tropical disturbances. The second mode accounts for rainfall occurring in north central from September to mid-October, which is attributed to the westerly summer monsoon activities. Also, we revealed that, while the first mode exhibits a significant correlation with El Niño-southern oscillation, the second depends highly on the contrast of sea surface temperature in the northern and southern Hemispheres. This different oceanic forcing and the local topological effect of Truong Son mountain range reasonably explain the opposite rainfall pattern in central Vietnam in early fall.",

    "abstract": "The severe heatwaves and hot spells in Vietnam were observed more frequently in intensity and duration due to global warming and climate change impacts. The hot days and extreme summer events make the weather harsh and significantly affect human health and the environment. This study presents the spatiotemporal distribution of the number of hot days (NHDs) in Vietnam. The variability of NHD in seven climate subregions is also examined in association with the large-scale drivers. The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis version 5 (ERA5) data for the period 1981–2020 are used. Principal component analysis is also applied to the observed monthly NHD to obtain spatial patterns and time series. The results show that the NHD in the Highland and South subregions from March to May is linked with the subtropical high associated with decreased 500hPa-level vertical velocity (VV500). From May to June, the North and Central subregions seem related to deepening the Asiatic low and enhancement of southwest flows across the Indochina Peninsula. Finally, both increased southwest flows and decreased VV500 can partly contribute to the intensification of NHD in the North and Central subregions during July and August. The long trends of NHD are also examined. The results reveal that the increasing trends in NHD occur in most subregions, except for the Central Highland, and changing trends of NHD in June greatly contribute to the annual trend of NHD. Finally, the examinations with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation events show that NHD is significantly higher in El Niño events than in La Niña events in March and April for the Northwest, South Central, Central Highlands, and South, in May and June for all subregions, and in July and August for only the Red River Delta subregion. This suggests that ENSO can provide the potential for improving seasonal climate forecasts and mitigating natural disaster risks for the community.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the focus is on investigating how different climate scenarios, as they have been adopted in Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), can lead to different regimes in the energetics components in Lorenz’s energy cycle, hence impacting the “working rate” of the climate system, which is considered as a “heat engine.” The four energy forms on which this investigation is based on are the zonal and eddy components of the available potential and kinetic energies. The permissible correspondingly considered transformations between these forms of energy are also studied. Generation of available potential energy and dissipation of kinetic energy complete the Lorenz energy cycle that is adopted here. In the CMIP6 approach, the results of different climate change analyses were collected in a matrix defined by two dimensions: climate exposure as characterized by a radiative forcing or temperature level and socioeconomic development as classified by the pathways, known as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). The basis of the calculations in this study is the climatic projection produced by the HadGEM3-GC3.1-LL climatic model in the period from 2015 to 2100. In this respect, the results are presented in terms of time projections of the energetics components under different SSPs. The results have shown that the different SSPs yield diverse energetics regimes, consequently impacting on Lorenz energy cycle and, hence, a “working rate” of the climate system based on the components of this cycle. In this respect, Lorenz energy cycle projections are presented, under different SSPs. The results are also contrasted to the calculations for the historical period 1929 to 2014 as this is simulated by the same climatic model.",

Data preprocessing and geospatial analysis were conducted using R-Studio and ArcGIS software. The Mann–Kendall (MK) test and Sen’s slope estimator were employed for annual and seasonal rainfall trend analysis. Myanmar exhibited the highest average annual rainfall of 2137 mm during the study period, while Thailand had the lowest (1641 mm). Over the past four decades, the Peninsula Malaysian Basin experienced the highest average annual rainfall (2691 mm), whereas the Chao Praya Basin recorded the lowest (1311 mm). Increasing trends in rainfall were observed across all five countries and nine major river basins. Vietnam displayed the highest annual rainfall trend of 5.63 mm/year, while Lao PDR exhibited the lowest trend (3.16 mm/year). Among the river basins, the Chao Phraya Basin demonstrated the maximum annual rainfall trend (11.21 mm/year), while the Peninsula Malaysia Basin had the minimum trend (1.21 mm/year). These findings could significantly contribute to climate change monitoring in the region and can aid policymakers in sectors such as agriculture, urban planning, and disaster management.",

Two major parameters in the data assimilation scheme, the spatial decorrelation scale and the magnitude of the covariance matrix of the background error, are varied in forecast experiments for the track of typhoon Sinlaku over the Western Pacific. The results show that within a wide parameter range, the inclusion of the AIRS observation improves the prediction. Outside this range, notably when the decorrelation scale of the background error is set to a large value, forcing the assimilation of AIRS data leads to degradation of the forecast. This illustrates how the impact of satellite data on the forecast depends on the adjustable parameters for data assimilation. The parameter-sweeping framework is potentially useful for improving operational typhoon prediction.",

From the ensemble mean of the CCMs, the BDC exhibits strengthening trends in both the 20th and 21st centuries; however, the acceleration rates of tropical upwelling and southern downwelling during 2001–2050 are smaller than those during 1960–2000, while the acceleration rate of the northern downward branch of the BDC during 2001–2050 is slightly larger than that during 1960–2000. The differences in the extratropical downwelling trends between the two periods are closely related to changes in planetary-wave propagation into the stratosphere caused by the combined effects of increases in the concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and changes in stratospheric ozone. Model simulations demonstrate that the response of southern downwelling to stratospheric ozone depletion is larger than that to the increase in GHGs, but that the latter plays a more important role in the strengthening of northern downwelling. This result suggests that, under the expected future climate, northern downwelling will play a more important role in balancing tropical upwelling.",

Results showed that air quality deteriorated during haze but improved in fog. The particle size distributions, major cations, and carbonaceous species documented in the dew and airborne particles demonstrated consistent synchronous patterns with values descending in the order haze &gt; normal &gt; fog conditions. We found that dew is a good indicator of near-surface air quality. Specifically, its water-soluble ions and carbonaceous species could be used to distinguish emission sources and to identify the presence of secondary organic carbon. Dew is more effective at removing airborne particles in normal weather than in haze or fog conditions; PM 2.5 removal rates were 21.5%, 15.2%, and 13.7% on normal, foggy, and hazy days, respectively. Dew condensation processes reduce concentrations of gaseous and particulate pollutants in the near-surface layer.",

The Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model was used to simulate the precipitation process and explore mechanisms for the development and dissipation of the severe precipitation event. Precipitation in the first stage was induced by the convergence of northwesterly winds at the rear of the cold vortex and southwesterly winds that reached the rainfall region. However, in the second stage, because of the blockage caused by Changbai Mountain, winds at the bottom of the cold vortex turned from the northwest to the northeast. These winds strongly converged with the southwesterly winds and continuously triggered new convective clouds, which were associated with cold centers at the surface. The intensity of the cold center modulated the strength of the convective cells and resulting precipitation quantity. Furthermore, the local terrain features and direction of the motion of the airflows were critical in triggering convection.",

This work analyzes specific trends observed in association with atmospheric blocking predominantly across the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. Such trends include the relationship between the size, duration, and onset position of atmospheric blocking events and the frequency, duration, and intensity of heavy rainfall events across the central United States. A strong focus is placed on examining the duration and spatial extent of atmospheric blocking which has been found to influence the intensity of heavy rainfall events.

This research primarily focused on the optimization of Alpha model by employing multisensor and multitemporal SAR data. The disadvantage of the Alpha model can be eliminated by the combination of multisensor SAR data. The optimized Alpha model was evaluated on the basis of a comprehensive campaign for soil moisture retrieval, which acquired multisensor time series SAR data and coincident field measurements. The agreement between the estimated and measured soil moisture was within a root mean square error of 0.08 cm 3 /cm 3 for both methods. The optimized Alpha model shows an obvious improvement for soil moisture retrieval.

This research presents a method for determining, at high spatial and temporal resolutions, surface soil moisture and its changes through time in the Canadian High Arctic. An artificial neural network (ANN) is implemented using input variables derived from RADARSAT-2 SAR data and previously modelled surface roughness information. The model is applied to SAR data collected at various incidence angles and acquisition dates across two study sites on Melville Island, Nunavut. The model results in absolute soil moisture errors of approximately 15% ( r 2 = 0.46) for the primary study sites and 12% ( r 2 = 0.26) for the verification study area. The ANN model is accurate for modelling (i) the spatial distribution of soil moisture and (ii) the changes in moisture through time across the study areas, two characteristics that are very important for inputs to hydrologic or climate models. In addition, the models appear to be scalable when applied at coarser spatial resolutions, showing potential for large-area mapping or modelling.",

Accurate representation of precipitation, which has high variation in space and time, is critical to hydrologic model simulations and flood analyses. In this study, we examined responses of differently sized United States Geological Survey (USGS) hydrologic units to heavy precipitation using three different data sets. The first consists of rainfall observed at individual meteorological gauges. The second uses the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Environmental Modeling Center (EMC) 4 km gridded radar-estimated precipitation (GRIB) Stage IV data. The third one derives from the method we developed that blends gauge data with the spatial coverage of the Parameter-elevation Relationships on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) data. We examined how two watersheds in South Carolina respond to the three different representations of heavy rainfall, using the Hydrologic Engineering Center’s Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) developed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. We found that the latter two precipitation inputs that consider spatial representation of rainfall yielded similar performance and improved simulated streamflow as compared to simulation using rainfall observed at individual meteorological gauges. The method we developed overcomes the spatial sparsity of rain gauges required for interpolation and extends availability of precipitation surfaces. Our study advances the understanding of advantages and limitations of different precipitation products for flood simulation.",

Investigation was performed in May-June 2017 using an aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM), a 7-wavelength Aethalometer and a 3-wavelength integrating Nephelometer. A positive matrix factorisation (PMF) was used for the organic aerosol mass spectra analysis to characterise the sources of ambient organic aerosol (OA). Five OA factors were identified: hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), biomass-burning OA (BBOA), more and less oxygenated OA (LVOOA and SVOOA, respectively), and local hydrocarbon-like OA (LOA). The average absorption (at 470 nm) and scattering (at 450 nm) coefficients during the entire measurement campaign were 16.59 Mm −1 (standard deviation (SD) = 17.23 Mm −1 ) and 29.83 Mm −1 (SD = 20.45 Mm −1 ), respectively. Furthermore, the absorption and scattering Angström exponents (AAE and SAE, respectively) and single-scattering albedo (SSA) were calculated. The average AAE value at 470/660 nm was 0.97 (SD = 0.16) indicating traffic-related black carbon (BC tr ) dominance. The average value of SAE (at 450/700 nm) was 1.93 (SD = 0.32) and could be determined by the submicron particle (PM 1 ) dominance versus the supermicron ones (PM &gt; 1 µ m). The average value of SSA was 0.62 (SD = 0.13). Several aerosol types showed specific segregation in the SAE versus SSA plot, which underlines different optical properties due to various chemical compositions.",

Firstly, the rainfall data were arranged to display the overall patterns of rainfall volume along with its frequency as well as the temperature during Thailand’s rainy seasons. This makes it possible to see the cycle of rainfall, which is too long for people to intuitively understand the nature of precipitation. One puzzling phenomenon that has made rainfall forecast elusive is the unpredictability of the haphazard nature of rainfall in Thailand. A more precise prediction would certainly result in a better control of water volume in rivers and dams for fruitful agricultural business and adequate human consumption. This can also prevent the flooding that can devastate the economy and transportation of the whole country and also tremendously improve the future water management policy in many ways. This effective prediction could also be employed elsewhere around the globe for similar benefits.

Monitoring extreme snowfall trends in response to climate change is essential for sustainability and adaptation studies because climate change could significantly influence variability in precipitation during the 21st century. Many studies investigating snowfall within the GLB have focused on specific case study events with apparent under examinations of regional extreme snowfall trends. The current research explores the historical extremes in snowfall by assessing the intensity, frequency, and duration of snowfall within Ontario’s GLB. Spatiotemporal snowfall and precipitation trends are computed for the 1980 to 2015 period using Daymet (Version 3) monthly gridded interpolated datasets from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Results show that extreme snowfall intensity, frequency, and duration have significantly decreased, at the 90% confidence level, more so for the Canadian leeward shores of Lake Superior than that of Lake Huron, for the months of December and January. To help discern the spatiotemporal trends is snowfall extremes, several trend analyses for lake-induced predictor variables were analysed for two cities, Wawa and Wiarton, along the snowbelts of Lakes Superior and Huron, respectively. These variables include monthly maximum and minimum air temperature, maximum wind gust velocity, lake surface temperature, and maximum annual ice cover concentration. Resultant significant increase in December’s maximum and minimum air temperature for the city of Wawa may be a potential reason for the decreased extreme snowfall trends.",

This demand can be strongly constrained by weather variables, especially temperatures, whose forecast may be very useful to predict the balances between supply and demand, minimizing the risk of price volatility. Energy companies use the relationship between meteorological forecast output and energy request to provide an effective scheduling of national gas and power grids and reduce operational costs in critical periods. This work reports a comparison analysis for short- and medium-term daily temperature forecasts during the period 2013-2014 by using the weather model e-kmf™ (eni-kassandra meteo forecast), currently adopted in gas and power applications where meteorological output has a key role. This weather forecast system uses different models and initial data to develop probabilistic predictions from a perspective of eleven days ahead. In particular, a set of model runs with horizontal grid spacing of 5.5, 8, 13, and 18 km with the same domain size are undertaken to assess the sensitivity of temperature to horizontal resolutions. A nonlinear Kalman filter has been also applied to postprocess forecasted data in eight European cities (Milano, Roma, Torino, Napoli, Munich, Paris, Brussels, and London). Filtered forecasts over these cities have been compared to local observations taken from SYNOP (surface synoptic observations) and METAR (meteorological Aerodrome Report) stations. Skill scores of performance have been used to generally assess the forecast reliability up to day +11 . In order to understand the sensitivity to the horizontal resolution, investigations have been carried out even during four specific periods of two weeks with stable and unstable weather conditions.",

Based on time-dependency characteristic of nonsystematic forecast error, variational approach is adopted to establish the mapping relation between nonsystematic error series and the prior period nonsystematic error series, so as to estimate nonsystematic error in the future and revise the forecast under the premise of the revision for forecast systematic forecast error. According to the hindcast daily data of geopotential height on 500 hPa generated by GRAPES model on January and July from 2002 to 2010, preliminary analysis is carried out on characteristics of forecast error in East Asia. Further estimation and forecast correction test are conducted for nonsystematic error. The result shows that the nonsystematic forecast error in the GRAPES model has obvious characteristic of state dependency. Nonsystematic forecast error changes along season and the state of weather and accounts for great proportion in total forecast error. Nonsystematic forecast error estimated by variational approach is relatively close to the real forecast error. After nonsystematic correction, the corrected 24 h and 48 h forecast of majority samples has a smaller RMSE. Further study on temperature shows a similar result, even comparing to the observational upper air MICAPS data.",

The APO index (APOI) was redefined, and an autumn CEC precipitation index (CECPI) was calculated to elucidate the relationship between the APO and CEC precipitation. Significant positive correlation (correlation coefficient: 0.60) was found between the APOI and CECPI. Further analysis revealed anomalous southerly winds at 850 hPa over CEC when the APO was strong, which corresponded to anomalous strengthened (weakened) sea level pressure and increased 500-hPa geopotential height over Asia (the Pacific), together with strong meridional shear of the East Asian jet. This configuration is conducive to transportation of warm moist air to CEC during strong APOI years (SAY), but the effect is much diminished during weak APOI years. Moreover, strengthening of both the Walker Circulation of the tropical Pacific and the anomalous upward movement (and convergence) over the Western Pacific (WP) observed during SAY is also conducive to the formation of precipitation in CEC. A possible physical explanation for the close association of the APO with tropical circulation changes is that decreased (increased) sea surface temperature in the tropical eastern Pacific (WP and extratropical Pacific) is beneficial for stimulating a strong APO teleconnection pattern, which further affects precipitation in CEC by strengthening the connection between tropical and subtropical regions.",

    "abstract": "A Multi-Model Ensemble (MME) based seasonal rainfall forecast customization tool called FOCUS was developed for Myanmar in order to provide improved seasonal rainfall forecast to the country. The tool was developed using hindcast data from 7 Global Climate Models (GCMs) and observed rainfall data from 49 meteorological surface observatories for the period of 1982 to 2011 from the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology. Based on the homogeneity in terms of the rainfall received annually, the country was divided into six climatological zones. Three different operational MME techniques, namely, (a) arithmetic mean (AM-MME), (b) weighted average (WA-MME), and (c) supervised principal component regression (PCR-MME), were used and built-in to the tool developed. For this study, all 7 GCMs were initialized with forecast data of May month to predict the rainfall during June to September (JJAS) period, which is the predominant rainfall season for Myanmar. The predictability of raw GCMs, bias-corrected GCMs, and the MMEs was evaluated using RMSE, correlation coefficients, and standard deviations. The probabilistic forecasts for the terciles were also evaluated using the relative operating characteristics (ROC) scores, to quantify the uncertainty in the GCMs. The results suggested that MME forecasts have shown improved performance (RMSE = 1.29), compared to the raw individual models (ECMWF, which is comparatively better among the selected models) with RMSE = 4.4 and bias-corrected RMSE = 4.3, over Myanmar. Specifically, WA-MME (CC = 0.64) and PCR-MME (CC = 0.68) methods have shown significant improvement in the high rainfall (delta) zone compared with WA-MME (CC = 0.57) and PCR-MME (CC = 0.56) techniques for the southern zone. The PCR method suggests higher predictability skill for the upper tercile (ROC = 0.78) and lower tercile categories (ROC = 0.85) for the delta region and is less skillful over lower rainfall zones like dry zones with ROC = 0.6 and 0.63 for upper and lower terciles, respectively. The model is thus suggested to perform relatively well over the higher rainfall (Wet) zones compared to the lower (Dry) zone during the JJAS period.",

    "abstract": "The variation of autumn Arctic sea ice is a critical indicator of temperature anomalies over the Eurasian continent during winter. The retreat of autumn Arctic sea ice is typically accompanied by negative anomalous winter temperatures over the Eurasian and North American continents. However, such sea ice temperature linkages notably change from month to month. The variation of the autumn Arctic sea ice area and the relationship between the month-to-month sea ice and winter temperature anomalies in China are investigated using the Hadley Centre’s sea ice dataset (HadiSST) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis dataset (ERA-Interim) during 1979–2018. We present the following results: The sea ice in the Barents and Kara seas (BK) during the autumn and winter seasons shows notable low-frequency variability. The retreat of sea ice in the BK from September to November is significantly associated with negative temperature anomalies in the following winter in China. However, the linkage between the sea ice in the BK in September and the winter temperatures is stronger than that in both October and November. An anomalous positive surface pressure is exhibited over the northwestern part of Eurasia in the winter that is linked to decreasing sea ice in the BK in the preceding September. This surface pressure favors the persistence and intensification of synoptic perturbations, such as blocking highs and surface cold highs, as well as the intensification of the Siberian High and the East Asian winter monsoon. These favorable conditions ultimately contribute to the formation of large-scale winter cold anomalies in China. Compared to low sea ice cover in October and November, a more oceanic heat storage in the upper BK induced by low sea ice cover in the BK leads to a larger heat release to tropospheric atmosphere in winter by surface heat flux and upward longwave radiation in the BK. This regional tropospheric warming results in a higher barotropic positive height anomaly over the Ural Mountains, and then more active cold advection from the high latitude affects East Asia.",

In particular, the cases are studied in which the exit area of the Jet reaches the La Plata Basin with no precipitation associated, herein called Chaco Jet 1 (CJ1), which could remove aerosols from the atmosphere on their way towards the city. CJ1 events registered within the five-year period of 2001–2005 are examined along with changes in the optical properties of aerosols over the city from measurements from the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) site. Three-dimensional backward trajectories of CJ1 were obtained to verify the connection between the receptor site and the biomass-burning source region. A cluster analysis of the trajectories allows further characterizing the features and impacts of regionally transported aerosols. A subsample of days on which impacts of the contribution of biomass burning could have occurred, showed a statistically significant increase in aerosol optical depth and Ångström exponent, reflected by an increase in the peak of the derived volume size distribution in the fine fraction size range, which also shifts slightly towards bigger radii. The days with AOD greater than 0.15 show overall behaviour like other urban sites with pollution of different origins. The evaluation of the selected data reveals that higher values of AOD and changes in the Ångström exponent are linked to the dispersion of biomass-burning aerosols. Air mass trajectories coinciding with the CJ1 core present the strongest impact on aerosol characteristics, which can be seen in spectral measurements.",

    "abstract": "Compared with other regions in China, air pollution on the North China Plain (NCP) is serious. Fine particle pollution has been studied in-depth, but there is less research on long-term troposphere ozone (O 3 ) variation. This study focuses on the summer interannual tropospheric O 3 variation on the NCP and its influential factors. Our analysis relies on satellite observations (O 3 , nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), and formaldehyde (HCHO), determined as vertical column density of the troposphere) and dynamical processes (El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), potential vorticity (PV), the quasibiennial oscillation (QBO), and East Asian summer monsoon index (EASMI)). Our results show the vertical column density of tropospheric O 3 has a transition from the increasing trend to decreasing trend during the summer of 2005–2016. The summer series of tropospheric O 3 show two distinct phases: the first phase (2005–2011), with an average growth rate of 0.55 ± 0.20 DU/yr, and a second phase (2012–2016), with an average reduction rate of 0.16 ± 0.23 DU/yr. The tropospheric NO 2 column in the NCP also has a transition from the increasing trend to decreasing trend during the summer of 2005–2016. Tropospheric NO 2 and CO column concentrations obtained from satellite observations indicate that emission reductions might be the main cause of the tropospheric O 3 decrease. Particularly, the reduction of nitrogen oxides (NO x ) is more significant, and NO 2 decreased by (0.45 ± 0.11) × 10 15 molec·cm −2 per year in summer since 2012. However, tropospheric column HCHO shows an increase of 0.05 × 10 15 molec·cm −2 per year during the whole period of 2005 to 2016. An O 3 -NO x -VOC sensitivity experiment in the NCP showed that the O 3 is still in a NO x -saturated state in some heavily polluted cities, although the NO x emissions are decreasing overall. In addition to the chemical reactions, atmospheric dynamic processes also have an effect on tropospheric O 3 . Finally, we built a model to analyze the contributions of chemical processes and dynamic processes to the tropospheric O 3 column in the NCP. For the chemical process variables, 69.73% of the observed trend of tropospheric O 3 could be explained by the NO 2 tropospheric column. Therefore, the reduction of tropospheric O 3 since 2012 is associated with the reduction of NOx. For the dynamical process variables, ENSO, PV, and EASMI can explain 60.64% of the observed trend of tropospheric O 3 . This result indicates that the atmospheric circulation of the western Pacific Ocean in summer has a significant impact on the interannual trends of tropospheric O 3 in the NCP. It is also found that chemical processes had a more important impact on interannual tropospheric O 3 than dynamic processes, although the dynamic processes cannot be neglected.",

To evaluate the urban microclimates at the pedestrian level, a detailed monitoring project was performed at five representative locations near intersections, within a busy street canyon of the typical urban community in a densely populated urban city.

Methods that use diurnal groundwater level (GWL) fluctuations have been applied to various ecosystems, especially in arid or semi-arid environments. In this study, groundwater monitoring devices were deployed in ten lake basins at the hinterland of the Badain Jaran Desert, and the White method was used to estimate the ET G of these sites under three main vegetation covers. The results showed that regular diurnal fluctuations in GWL occurred only at sites with vegetation coverage and that vegetation types and their growth status were the direct causes of this phenomenon. On a seasonal scale, the amplitudes of diurnal GWL fluctuations are related to vegetation phenology, and air temperature is an important factor controlling phenological amplitude differences. The estimation results using the White method revealed that the ET G rates varied among the observation sites with different vegetation types, and the months with the highest ET G rates were also different among the sites. Overall, ET G was 600∼900 mm at observation sites with Phragmites australis during a growing season (roughly early May to late October), 600∼650 mm in areas with Achnatherum splendens , and 500∼650 mm in areas with Nitraria tangutorum and Achnatherum splendens . Depth to water table and potential evapotranspiration jointly control the ET G rates, while the influence of these two factors varied, depending on the specific vegetation conditions of each site. This study elucidated the relationship between diurnal GWL fluctuations and vegetation in desert groundwater-recharged lake basins and expanded the application of the White method, providing a new basis for the calculation and simulation of regional water balance.",

Data assimilation plays a vital role in the improvement of initial MABL moisture for sea fog modeling over the Yellow Sea. In this study, the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model and its three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) data assimilation module are employed for sea fog simulations. Two kinds of background error (BE) covariances with different control variables (CV) used in WRF-3DVAR, that is, CV5 and multivariate BE (CV6), are compared in detail by explorative case studies and a series of application experiments. Statistical verification metrics including probability of detection (POD) and equitable threat scores (ETS) of forecasted sea fog area are computed and compared for simulations with the implementations of CV5 and CV6 in the WRF-3DVAR system. The following is found: (1) there exists a dominant negative correlation between temperature and moisture in CV6 near the sea surface, which makes it possible to improve the initial moisture condition in the MABL by assimilation of observed temperature; (2) in general, the performance of the WRF-3DVAR assimilation with CV6 is distinctly better, and the results of 10 additional sea fog cases clearly suggest that CV6 is more suitable than CV5 for sea fog modeling. Compared to those with CV5, the average POD and ETS of forecasted sea fog area using 3DVAR with CV6 can be improved by 27.6% and 21.0%, respectively.",

In this paper, these weather phenomena are analysed in the vicinity of the Adolfo Suárez Madrid-Barajas Airport (Spain). Mountain waves are formed in this area due to the proximity of the Guadarrama mountain range. Twenty different weather research and forecasting (WRF) model configurations are evaluated in an initial analysis. This shows the incompetence of some experiments to capture the phenomenon. The two experiments showing the best results are used to simulate thirteen episodes with observed mountain waves. Simulated pseudosatellite images are validated using satellite observations, and an analysis is performed through several skill scores applied to brightness temperature. Few differences are found among the different skill scores. Nevertheless, the Thompson microphysics scheme combined with the Yonsei university PBL scheme shows the best results. The simulations produced by this scheme are used to evaluate the characteristic variables of the mountain wave episodes at windward and leeward and over the mountain. The results show that north-northwest wind directions, moderate wind velocities, and neutral or slightly stable conditions are the main features for the episodes evaluated. In addition, a case study is analysed to evidence the WRF ability to properly detect turbulence and icing associated with mountain waves, even when there is no visual evidence available.",

The Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm (LMA) was implemented for training a two-layer feed-forward ANN for the missing rainfall data prediction part of this research. The inaccessible rainfall parameters for Düzce were determined for the years 1995 to 2009. From 2010 to 2020, a two-layer feed-forward ANN was trained using the gradient descent algorithm to forecast daily average rainfall data by month.

This paper investigates extreme precipitation events in Xinjiang, using 54 stations with daily precipitation records from the period 1961–2008. Different statistical tests and approaches were used to check the significance of trends of single and Xinjiang regionally aggregated precipitation series for intensity and in frequency. There were predominantly positive trends in annual maximum precipitation and a remarkable increment in the frequency of extreme precipitation over certain thresholds (from 10 to 40 mm). Although the series of frequencies exceeding thresholds had positive trends, only a minority were statistically significant. This lack of significance is because of the high variability of extreme precipitation in space and time. Thus, significant trends were evident when we assessed the extreme precipitation indicators of intensity and frequency at the regional level, both in intensity and frequency over thresholds, with a clearer signal in Xinjiang.",

We compare the long-term variability of annual precipitation for Hurbanovo (Slovakia), Brno (Czech Republic), Vienna (Austria), and Mosonmagyarovar (Hungary) stations using autocorrelation and spectral analysis methods. From the long-term point of view, there is no consistent trend in the annual precipitation; only a multiannual variability has been detected. Consequently we identify changes in the distribution of annual maximum daily precipitation for Hurbanovo during different periods for winter-spring and summer-autumn seasons using histograms, empirical exceedance curves, and frequency curves of daily precipitation. Next, we calculate the periods of days without precipitation exceeding 29 days between 1872 and 2011. The longest period of days without precipitation was 83 days in 1947. The statistical analysis does not confirm our initial hypothesis that neither high daily precipitation (over 51.2 mm per day) nor long dry periods (more than 50 days without precipitation) would occur more frequently nowadays. We assume that the decrease in annual precipitation over the period 1942–2011 (compared to 1872–1941) is caused by the less frequent occurrence of daily precipitation between 0.4 and 25.6 mm.",

This study applies the DLS model to simulate the land cover under the business as usual (BAU) scenario and then analyses the seasonal and interannual variation of energy balance in the semiarid grassland area of China based on the simulated land cover with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The results indicate that the grassland will show a growing trend under the BAU scenario. Downward long wave radiation and downward short wave radiation will all have small-scale increase with time going by, while the surface net radiation will decrease from 2030 to 2050. However, there is obvious seasonal variation. Summer has the highest downward long wave radiation and downward short wave radiation, followed by spring and autumn. The lowest are in winter. As for the net surface radiation, there is obvious decrease in southeast of study area due to returning cropland to grassland. Those research conclusions can offer valuable information for the land use planning and relieving the effects of land cover change on climate change at the semiarid grassland area.",

    "abstract": "In arid and semiarid regions, dust storms are common during windy seasons. Strong wind can blow loose sand from the dry surface. The rising sand and dust is then transported to other places depending on the wind conditions (speed and direction) at different levels of the atmosphere. Considering dust as a moving object in space and time, trajectory calculation then can be used to determine the path it will follow. Trajectory calculation is used as a forecast supporting tool for both operational and research activities. Predefined dust sources can be identified and the trajectories can be precalculated from the Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) forecast. In case of long distance transported dust, the tool should allow the operational forecaster to perform online trajectory calculation. This paper presents a case study for using trajectory calculation based on NWP models as a forecast supporting tool in Oman Meteorological Service during some dust storm events. Case study validation results showed a good agreement between the calculated trajectories and the real transport path of the dust storms and hence trajectory calculation can be used at operational centers for warning purposes.",

Hence, quantifying the energy budget on different land uses is critical for understanding the water budget and providing useful land use information for decision makers. However, traditional methods, including in situ measurements and model-only approaches, have deficiencies in data availability, and we have still not yet fully realized how well the energy budgets presented in reanalysis data sets. Therefore, in this study, North American regional reanalysis (NARR) data set from 1992 to 2002 were employed to investigate the energy budget on various land uses (lake, wetland, agriculture, forest, and urban) at a regional scale in Florida. The results showed that the lake and urban areas had high values of energy budget, evaporation, and low Bowen ratio, while the wetland areas have the opposite treads because of the lowest evaporation rate. During drought periods, Bowen ratio, surface temperature, and sensible heat were becoming higher than those of normal years conditions. Finally, by comparing with the observed data, we found NARR had better assimilation of precipitation observations and demonstrated the land use effects from the different coefficient of correlation relationships.",

Hilbert-Huang transform-based time-frequency analysis is employed in this study to detect abrupt changes and periods of the runoff at five hydrological stations in the Weihe River Basin, China, from 1951 to 2010. The key part of the method is the empirical decomposition mode with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into small number of intrinsic mode functions that admit well adaptive Hilbert transforms. Moreover, an attempt has been made to find out the specific reason for the abrupt point at the five hydrological stations in the Weihe River Basin. The results are presented as follows: (1) annual runoff significantly declined in the basin in intervals of 8~15 years; (2) abrupt changes occurred in 1971, 1982, and 1994 at Huaxian, 1972 and 1982 at Xianyang, 1992 at Zhangjiashan, 1990 at Zhuangtou, and 1984 at Beidao; (3) changes were more frequent and complex in the mainstream and downstream reaches than in tributaries and upstream reaches, respectively.",

To reduce the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, an independent point scheme (IPS) is implemented during the estimation process. In twin experiments, both the prescribed IC and SS can be inverted successfully and better inversion results are obtained when the IPS is used than not, suggesting the feasibility and validity of the PM 2.5 transport model as well as the IPS. In practical experiments, several inversion strategies are compared based on the simulation results of PM 2.5 concentrations over China. It is found that IC and SS are better estimated with smaller difference between simulated results and observations, when IC and SS are inverted simultaneously than separately. And the simulated results can reproduce the temporal and spatial variation feature of the observed PM 2.5 concentrations. On the basis of the numerical results, it is shown that the adjoint method and the IPS are the powerful way to improve the precision of the simulation of the PM 2.5 concentrations.",

In this paper, we present a method to infer the impact of a better DEM on applications and science using the Lower Zambezi basin as a use case. We propose an analysis based on a targeted observation algorithm to evaluate potential data acquisition subregions in terms of their impact on the prediction of flood risk over the entire study area. Consequently, it becomes trivial to rank these subregions in terms of their contribution to the overall accuracy of flood prediction. The improvement from better topography data may be expressed in terms of economic output and population affected, providing a multifaceted assessment of the value of acquiring better elevation data. Our results highlight the notion that having higher resolution measurements would improve our current large-scale flood inundation prediction capabilities in the Lower Zambezi by at least 30% and significantly reduce the number of people affected as well as the economic loss associated with high magnitude flooding. We believe this procedure to be simple enough to be applied to other regions where high quality topographic and hydrodynamic data are currently unavailable.",

Aerosol measurements have been carried out in the past over Durban; however, no cloud measurements using LIDAR have ever been performed. Therefore, this study further motivates the continuation of LIDAR for atmospheric research over Durban. Low level clouds were observed on 20–22 November 2012 and high level clouds were observed on 23 November 2012. The low level cloud could be classified as stratocumulus clouds, whereas the high level clouds could be classified as cirrus clouds. Low level cloud layers showed high extinction coefficients values ranging between 0.0009 and 0.0044 m −1 , whereas low extinction coefficients for high level clouds were observed at values ranging between 0.000001 and 0.000002 m −1 . Optical depth showed a high variability for 20 and 21 November 2012. This indicates a change in the composition and/or thickness of the cloud. For 22 and 23 November 2012, almost similar values of optical depth were observed. Cloud-Aerosol LIDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) revealed high level clouds while the CSIR LIDAR could not. However, the two instruments complement each other well to describe the cloudy condition.",

    "abstract": "The Environmental Agency of Sao Paulo has a large dataset of carbon monoxide measurements: 20 years of records in 18 automatic stations inside the metropolitan area. However, a thorough investigation on the time evolution of CO concentration tendency and cycles also considering spatial variability is lacking. The investigation consists of a trend line analysis, a periodogram analysis, a correlation between CO concentration and meteorological variables, and spatial distribution of CO concentration. Local and federal policies helped in decreasing CO concentrations and the highest decreasing rate was 0.7% per month. This tendency is lately stabilizing, since the vehicles fleet is increasing. CO most relevant cycles are annual and diurnal and a few series indicate a weekly cycle. Diurnal cycle shows two peaks, morning and evening rush hours, 1.2 and 1.1 ppm, respectively, in 2012. However, lately there is an extended evening peak (20 h to 23 h), related to changes in emission patterns. The spatial analysis showed that CO concentration has high spatial variability and is influenced by proximity to heavy traffic and vegetated areas. The present work indicates that several processes affect CO concentration and these results form a valuable basis for other studies involving air quality modeling, mitigation, and urban planning.",

    "abstract": "The higher contribution of traffic delay to environmental impacts is urging the highway agencies to take work zone management into the maintenance schemes decision-making. Aiming to understand the role of work zone management in user CO2 emissions reduction, this paper firstly developed a practical methodological framework of traffic delay-related CO2 emissions caused by highway maintenance based on a popular life cycle user cost analysis approach in regard of the microscopic vehicle operation analysis. The method was applied in an actual freeway flexible pavement with 15-year design life in Shaanxi Province, China, covering three types of preventive maintenance, correction maintenance, and rehabilitation. In addition, the impacts of key inputs of proposed method on work zone user CO2 emissions results were checked. The results show that traffic delay attributes to 29.4% of total CO2 emissions of the life cycle of highway pavement maintenance, and 51.8% of work zone user CO2 emissions result from preventive maintenance, especially from micro vehicle operations including speed change and queue near work zone (62% of total work zone user CO2 emissions). The work zone management alternative strategies related to less traffic volume or higher highway capacity including vehicle type limitation and the limited work zone speed have an advantage in reducing the work zone CO2 emissions over changing work zone length or work zone timing. The findings in this paper may present a useful tool and reference for robustly supporting the decision-making on highway maintenance carbon mitigation in work zone traffic.",

    "abstract": "Alpine wetlands in western Sichuan plateau (WSCP) are located on the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), where the ecological environment is very sensitive to global climate change. Being naturally driven coupled with unreasonable human development activities, alpine wetlands have experienced serious ecological and environmental issues such as drought, inversion, and desertification. However, due to the limitations of data sources and calculation models, it is impossible for us to deeply understand the change mechanism and spatial difference of the ecological environment of the alpine wetland (EEAW) in previous studies. In view of this, an innovative approach for monitoring the EEAW change has been proposed in this paper. We employ the approach to perform the EEAW change trend analysis, and some meaningful characteristics were founded. Specifically, it includes the fol1owing aspects. The air temperature increase is relatively significant, while the precipitation change has obvious spatial differentiation, and even some region’s precipitation experienced a decrease especially in plot1. In Haizishan, Lugu Lake, and Bari Lake, we explored an interesting phenomenon that the precipitation increases first and then decrease, and the turning point occurred around 1999. Increases in air temperature and evaporation have aggravated the drought in high-latitude areas. The drought situation has been alleviated in high-altitude areas due to the acceleration of snow melt water. Wetland vegetation and biomass presented an overall increasing trend, but the degradation also occurs in some area, including Zoige and Lugu Lake area. The human activity disturbances of wetland degradation mainly include the settlements expansion, agricultural development, and the ecotourism prosperity. Among them, targeted poverty alleviation projects have accelerated the urbanization in WSCP, and the development of agriculture and tourism has increased the interference of wetlands. Additionally, we have used Landsat images and national wetland survey data (1999, 2013, and 2020 year) from the past two decades to verify the EEAW trend and confirm the reliability of the analysis results using this approach.",

    "abstract": "The Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) V06 product has been widely studied, but the errors and the source of the errors within IMERG over diverse climate regions still need to be quantified. To this end, the final run gauge-calibrated IMERG V06 (V06C) and uncalibrated IMERG V06 (V06UC) products are comprehensively evaluated here against 2088 precipitation gauges acquired between March 2014 and June 2018 over China. Moreover, V06C and V06UC rainfall estimates are compared against the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Imagery using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN)-Climate Data Record (CDR) and the Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH) gauge-satellite blended (BLD) products. Continuous statistical indices and two error decomposition schemes are used to quantify their performance. Key results are as follows. (1) Except for V06UC’s relatively high underestimation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and high overestimation over Xinjiang (XJ), Northeastern China (DB), and Northern China (HB) and CDR’s severe overestimation over TP, all four satellite-based precipitation products can generally capture the spatial pattern of precipitation over China. Moreover, the satellite-based precipitation estimates agree better with gauge observations over humid regions than over semi-humid, semi-arid, and arid regions. (2) All the statistical indicators show that CDR has the worst performance, whereas BLD is the best precipitation product. As for the two IMERG products, V06C has improved V06UC’s precipitation estimate. Results show that the gauge calibration algorithm (GCA) used in IMERG has active effect in terms of r, POD, and CSI. (3) Within all subregions, all four satellite-based precipitation products demonstrate their worst performance over the arid XJ region which exhibits the highest FAR and lowest POD and CSI values among all regions. (4) In terms of intensity distribution, for summer over China, the four satellite-based precipitation products generally overestimate the frequency of moderate precipitation and light precipitation events (&lt;25 mm/day) and underestimate heavy precipitation events (&gt;42 mm/day). (5) The relative bias ratio (RBR) analysis shows that the contribution of missed precipitation tends to be lower over wetter regions. In addition, for the same climate region, the contribution of missed precipitation is clearly lower in summer than in winter. In summer, false precipitation dominates the total error, whereas missed and false precipitation are the two leading error sources in winter. Future algorithm refinement efforts should focus on decreasing FAR in summer and winter and improving missed snow events during the winter.",

How to consider the effect of soil strength decay and water-soil characteristic curve hysteresis effect on transient stability change of slope is the key to solve this problem. In this paper, transient stability analysis of slopes considering soil strength decay and water-soil characteristic curve hysteresis is carried out based on Geo-Studio. The results of the study showed that the change of transient safety factor of the slope caused by rainfall-evaporation dry and wet cycle process has an overall decreasing trend and the safety factor decreased by 43% compared to the initial state. The seepage characteristics of the rainfall-evaporation dry-wet cycle have certain regularity. The location of slope measurement points has a greater influence on the magnitude of the pore pressure change: foot of slope &gt; middle of slope &gt; top of slope. Also, there is a significant response hysteresis in the change of pore pressure with increasing depth at the same location. The rainfall intensity has a certain influence on the change of slope safety factor, but its influence is not obvious when the rainfall intensity exceeds a certain amount.",

    "abstract": "Windshear is a kind of microscale meteorological phenomenon which can cause danger to the landing and takeoff of aircrafts. Accurate windshear detection plays a crucial role in aviation safety. With the development of machine learning, several learning-based methods are proposed for windshear detection, i.e., windshear and non-windshear classification. To obtain accurate detection results, it is significant to extract features that can distinguish windshear and non-windshear properly from the obtained wind velocity data. In this paper, we mainly introduce two statistical indicators derived from the Doppler Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) observational wind velocity data by plan position illustrate (PPI) scans for windshear features construction. Besides the indicators directly derived from the wind velocity data, we also study the visual information from the corresponding conical images of wind velocity. Based on the proposed indicators, we construct three feature vectors for windshear and non-windshear classification. Inspired by the idea of multiple instance learning, the wind velocity data collected in the 4 minutes within the reported time spot are considered in the procedure of feature vector construction, which can reduce the possibility of windshear features missing. Both statistical methods and clustering methods are applied to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed feature vectors. Numerical results show that the proposed feature vectors have good effect on windshear and non-windshear classification and can be used to provide more accurate windshear alerting to pilots in practice.",

These previous studies made use of reanalysis data sets in the calculations of the enstrophy-based diagnostics, such as the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis (2.5° × 2.5°) of geopotential height and horizontal winds. However, none of these studies has explored the use of the enstrophy-based diagnostics in weather or climate models with higher horizontal resolution. In this paper, the enstrophy-based diagnostics are used to analyze two blocking events, using data from the ERA-Interim reanalysis data set (0.75° × 0.75°) and also the Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) (1° × 1°). The results of this work indicate that using an ensemble may be more effective than a single dynamical control forecast in evaluating the enstrophy-based diagnostic quantities, and that the results are similar to those obtained with coarser resolution.",

We use a combination of three experiments: preindustrial, 20th century, and the projected changes under A1B scenario. The first empirical orthogonal function of rainfall in December–February is used to characterize summertime variability. The model can display two different regimes of natural variability of this mode. In one regime, there is a strong coupling between the South Atlantic convergence zone (SACZ) and the Atlantic Ocean. In the other regime, the SACZ is dominated by internal atmospheric variability. The detection of the impact of anthropogenic forcing is calculated comparing the probability density functions (pdfs) of the preindustrial run with the one under the A1B scenario. We found that the detection strongly depends on the pdf used to characterize internal climate variability. If the pdf of the mode with coupling between the SACZ and the Atlantic Ocean is used, the anthropogenic influence is felt very early within the future scenario (in less than 30 years). On the contrary, with the pdf that characterizes an SACZ dominated by internal atmospheric variability, the forcing is detected only several (almost 50) years into the scenario.",

In this method, the localization operation is directly applied to the ensemble anomalies with a Schur Product, rather than to the full error covariance of the state in the EnKF. Meanwhile, the correction space of analysis increment is expanded to a space with larger dimension, and the rank of the forecast error covariance is significantly increased. This scheme can reduce the spurious correlations in the covariance and approximate the full-rank background error covariance well. Furthermore, a deterministic scheme is used to generate the analysis anomalies. The results show that the SELKF outperforms the perturbed EnKF given a relatively small ensemble size, especially when the length scale is relatively long or the observation error covariance is relatively small.",

This study used the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to forecast the changes of energy flux and temperature based on the future cultivated land reclamation in India and then analyzed the impacts of cultivated land reclamation on climate change. The results show that cultivated land reclamation will lead to a large amount of land conversions, which will overall result in the increase in latent heat flux of regional surface as well as the decrease in sensible heat flux and further lead to changes of regional average temperature.

The membership functions used by the fuzzy logic method in the second step are extracted from normalized histograms of differential reflectivity and differential phase for birds and insects, respectively, while the normalized histograms are constructed by polarimetric data collected during the 2012 fall migrating season and sorted for bird and insects, respectively. The performance and effectiveness of the technique are demonstrated by real-data examples.",

Suitable thermal comfort and heat stress scales were selected for the evaluation. Experiments were conducted in hot sunny days to measure the required parameters (i.e., the dry and wet bulb temperatures, globe temperature, natural wet bulb temperature, and solar radiation flux) in the greenhouse. The results showed that in the uncooled greenhouse, workers are exposed to strong heat stress and would feel very hot most of the day time; they are safe from heat stress risk and would feel comfortable during night. An efficient evaporative cooling is necessary during the day to reduce heat stress and to improve the comfort conditions and is not necessary at night. In the cooled greenhouse, workers can do any activity: except at around noon they should follow a proposed working schedule, in which the different types of work were scheduled along the daytimes based on the heat stress value. To avoid heat stress and to provide comfort conditions in the greenhouses, the optimum ranges of relative humidity and air temperature are 48–55% and 24–28°C, respectively.",

Radar remote sensing is considered to be an effective means for aerodynamic roughness retrieval because radar backscattering is sensitive to the surface roughness and geometric structure of a given target. In this paper, a methodology for aerodynamic roughness length estimation using SAR data in urban areas is introduced. The scale and orientation characteristics of backscattering of various targets in urban areas were firstly extracted and analyzed, which showed great potential of SAR data for urban roughness elements characterization. Then the ground truth aerodynamic roughness was calculated from wind gradient data acquired by the meteorological tower using fitting and iterative method. And then the optimal dimension of the upwind sector for the aerodynamic roughness calculation was determined through a correlation analysis between backscattering extracted from SAR data at various upwind sector areas and the aerodynamic roughness calculated from the meteorological tower data. Finally a quantitative relationship was set up to retrieve the aerodynamic roughness length from SAR data. Experiments based on ALOS PALSAR and COSMO-SkyMed data from 2006 to 2011 prove that the proposed methodology can provide accurate roughness length estimations for the spatial and temporal analysis of urban surface.",

This study utilized the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and Climate Prediction Center Merged Analysis of Precipitation (CMAP) reanalysis data to probe the temporal and spatial distribution features of atmospheric precipitable water (PW) in China during a recent 65-year period (1951–2015), and the relationship between PW and actual precipitation was also studied. The temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of PW in China presented an overall decreasing spatial trend from the southeast to northwest direction. The spatial distribution pattern of the first eigenvector demonstrated that the PW in China shows nationwide variation features with a varying amount of PW across different regions. The year 1967 was further identified as an important transition period for the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the PW. We also found that the PW had inherent variability of around 30 years. Regarding the relationship with precipitation, PW was most closely correlated with precipitation in the northeastern region and the upper northwestern region in China. Different regions displayed different efficiencies for converting PW to precipitation. The conclusions are useful for understanding the long-term water vapor evolution and its potential effects on precipitation in China.",

The location of the dry line varied due to this “dry” and “wet” pattern, with the average dry line location around 1.5° longitude further to the east than climatology. Model simulations were used to further quantify the impact of variable surface conditions on dry line evolution and convective initiation (CI) during April and May 2011. Specifically, soil moisture conditions were altered to depict “wet” and “dry” conditions across the domain by replacing the soil moisture values by each soil category’s porosity or wilting point value. Overall, the strength of the dry line boundary, its position, and subsequent CI were dependent on the modification of soil moisture. The simulations demonstrated that modifying soil moisture impacted the nature of the dry line and showed that soil moisture conditions during the first half of the warm season modified the dry line pattern and influenced the evolution and perpetuation of drought over Oklahoma.",

Although coupled atmosphere-biosphere models have been widely used to forecast future vegetation patterns under various scenarios of global warming, they have not been used to assess the potentially critical role of variations in sea surface temperature (SST) in modifying the climate-vegetation interactions. Here, we use monthly output of a 100-year coupled model run to investigate the relationship between SST, precipitation, and productivity of vegetation. Specifically, we assess statistical correlations between SST variability and vegetation in six different South America regions: Northern South America, Western Amazonia, Eastern Amazonia, Northeast Brazil, Central Brazil, and Patagonia. Our model robustly simulates changes in mean precipitation, net primary production (NPP), upper canopy leaf area index (LAI), and lower canopy LAI under warming and nonwarming scenarios. Most significantly, we demonstrate that spatial-temporal variability in SST exerts a strong influence over the vegetation dynamics in all six South American regions.",

The results show that the upward wave activity fluxes mainly come from planetary waves 1 and 2, which provide a stable circulation background for the influence of the subplanetary-scale waves 3 and 4. The Rossby-wave propagation anomalies between the troposphere and the stratosphere are due to the modulating effects of waves 3 and 4 on waves 1 and 2. During 9–14 January 2014, the modulating effects helped strengthen upward and eastward wave activity fluxes over the Atlantic region and enhance the Pacific high in the stratosphere in its early stage. Later in 19–24 January, the downward wave activity fluxes over the east Pacific due to the modulating effects were beneficial to downward development of the stratospheric high over the Pacific and the formation of a blocking high over the west coast of North America in the troposphere accompanied by a strong adjacent cold low on the east side. These circulations benefit the southward invasion of polar cold air reaching the lower latitudes of east North America, leading to the cold wave outbreak.",

Analysis indicates that the models with well-resolved stratospheres, that is, with a high model top (HTOP) covering the whole stratosphere, a high vertical resolution (HVer) of the stratosphere, and nonorographic gravity wave drag (NOG), rank higher in both the temporal scoring system and the spatial scoring system.

A dynamical analysis shows that the heat flux propagating into the stratosphere is stronger in models with HTOP, HVer, and NOG, but these propagations are still weaker than those in the ERA40 reanalysis, indicating the lack of variability in the current CMIP5 models.",

The study area is centred on the Forni Glacier area (Central Italian Alps), where an automatic weather station is present since 2005. We set up a model based on monthly homogenised precipitation series and we spatialised climatologies and anomalies on a 30-arc-second-resolution DEM, using Local Weighted Linear Regression (LWLR) and Regression Kriging (RK) of precipitation versus elevation, in order to test the most suitable approach for this complex terrain area. The comparison shows that LWLR has a better reconstruction ability for winter while RK slightly prevails during summer. The results of precipitation spatialisation were compared with station observations and with data collected at the weather station on Forni Glacier, which were not used to calibrate the model. A very good agreement between observed and modelled precipitation records was pointed out for most station sites. The agreement is lower, but encouraging, for Forni Glacier station data.",

We provide a standardized scheme of weights for ordinal sequences of drought classifications by normalizing squared weighted Cohen Kappa. Illustrations of the proposed scheme are given by including temporal ordinal data on drought classes determined by the standardized precipitation temperature index (SPTI). Experimental results show that the proposed weighting scheme for WMC model is sufficiently flexible to address actual changes in drought classifications by restructuring the transient behavior of a Markov chain. In summary, this paper proposes a new weighting scheme to improve the accuracy of the WMC, specifically in the field of hydrology.",

The CESM/WRF climatological annual and seasonal precipitation and temperature simulations for years 1980–1999 at 10 km resolution for Sumatra and nearby regions are evaluated using observations and the global climate reanalysis ERA-Interim (ERA). CESM/WRF simulations at 10 km resolution are also compared with the downscaled reanalysis ERA/WRF at 10 km resolution. Results show that while temperature and precipitation patterns of the original CESM are very different from observations, those for CESM/WRF agree well with observations. Resolution and accuracies of simulations are significantly improved by dynamically downscaling CESM using WRF. CESM/WRF can simulate locations of very cold temperature at mountain peaks well. The high-resolution climate simulation system CESM/WRF can provide useful climate simulations at high resolution for Sumatra and nearby regions. CESM/WRF-simulated climatological temperature and precipitation at 10 km resolution agree well with ERA/WRF.

The prediction of total ozone took the form of an empirical linear regression with the variables of meteorological parameters in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere and the climatology value of total ozone. Additionally, to consider cloud extinction after the estimation of clear-sky UV radiation using a radiative transfer model simulation, a cloud modification factor was applied. The UV irradiance was estimated at one-hour intervals, and then, to improve the temporal resolution of the exposure time simulation, it was interpolated to a one-minute resolution. Exposure times from the simulation clearly followed seasonal and diurnal cycles. However, upon comparison with observations, biases with large variations were found, and the discrepancy in the exposure time between the observations and simulations was higher in low UV irradiance conditions. The large deviations in the prediction errors for total ozone and the simplified assumption for the cloud modification factor contributed to the large deviations in exposure time differences between the model estimation and observations. To improve the accuracy of the simulated exposure time, improved predictions of total ozone with a more detailed cloud treatment will be essential.",

    "abstract": "Ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) and carbon use efficiency (CUE), as two of the most important ecological indicators of an ecosystem, represent the carbon assimilation rate of unit water consumption and the capacity of transferring carbon from the atmosphere to potential carbon sinks. Revealing WUE and CUE changes and their impact factors is vital for regional carbon-water interactions and carbon budget assessment. Climate affects carbon and water processes differently. Compared to WUE, the variations in CUE in response to climate factors and human activity remain inadequately understood. In this study, ecosystem-level WUE and CUE variations in the Songnen Plain (SNP), Northeast China, during 2001–2015, were investigated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. The relationships between WUE, CUE, main climate factors, and human impacts were explored. The results showed that ecosystem WUE and CUE have fluctuated over time, with regional average values of 1.319 gC·kg −1 H 2 O and 0.516, respectively. Deciduous broad-leaved forests had the highest average WUE but the lowest CUE. The multiyear average CUE of grassland ranked in first place, while the lowest WUE indicated that a lesser capacity of net productivity was generated by the use of limited water supply. WUE and CUE showed a downward trend in most areas of the SNP, indicating that the carbon sequestration capacity of the terrestrial ecosystem became weaker in the past 15 years. Annual precipitation and relative humidity had positive influences on WUE and CUE in more than 60% of the study area. The total annual sunshine duration and annual average temperature negatively affected WUE and CUE in most areas. Human activities had a positive effect on ecosystem WUE changes in the SNP but might inhibit CUE variations. Our findings aid in understanding the biological regulation mechanisms of carbon-water cycle coupling and provide a scientific basis for formulating sustainable regional development strategies and guiding water and land resources management.",

    "abstract": "This study applied the remote sensing-based drought index, namely, the Energy-Based Water Deficit Index (EWDI), across Mongolia, Australia, and Korean Peninsula for the period between 2000 and 2010. The EWDI is estimated based on the hydrometeorological variables such as evapotranspiration, soil moisture, solar radiation, and vegetation activity which are derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imageries. The estimated EWDI was compared with the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI), the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The correlation coefficients between the drought indices are as follows: 0.73–0.76 (EWDI vs ESI), 0.64–0.71 (EWDI vs VCI), 0.54–0.64 (EWDI vs SPI-3), 0.69–0.71 (ESI vs VCI), 0.55–0.62 (ESI vs SPI-3), and 0.53–0.57 (VCI vs SPI-3). The drought prediction accuracy of each index according to error matrix analysis is as follows: 83.33–94.17% (EWDI), 70.00–91.67% (ESI), 47.50–85.00% (VCI), and 61.67–88.33% (SPI-3). Based on the results, the EWDI and ESI were found to be more accurate in capturing moderate drought conditions than the SPI at different geographical regions.",

    "abstract": "Linpan settlements (abbreviated as Linpan) are the most important traditional type of rural settlement in the Chengdu Plain, and they are an important part of the agroforestry ecological system in southwest China. In this study, we measured the micrometeorological parameters (air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed) in 12 Linpans for two years to determine the seasonal micrometeorology variations; then, we explored the impacts of Linpan size and tree distribution on the Linpan micrometeorology. The results show that the Linpans undergo seasonal cooling (from 0.6 to 1.3°C), humidification (from 0.9% to 4.1%), reduction in solar radiation flux (from 92.1 to 496.0 W/m 2 ), and changes in wind speed (by 0.4 to 0.5 m/s) compared to the surrounding environment. Both solar radiation flux and wind speed showed the following decreasing trend with respect to sampling positions in the Linpan: outside &gt; edge &gt; center. The Linpan size did not affect the solar radiation flux or wind speed over the four seasons. The main factor affecting solar radiation flux and wind speed was the horizontal tree distribution not the Linpan size. However, the Linpan size was significantly correlated with the air temperature in summer and winter. Large Linpans (&gt;5 × 10 3 m 2 ) showed better ability to control the temperature to within a comfortable range in extremely hot and cold seasons. The Linpan size also showed a negative relationship with the relative humidity, but only in winter. Among the tree distribution patterns, a scattered distribution was optimal to achieve a comfortable micrometeorology over the course of the year. In addition, we suggest some ways to adapt the Linpan micrometeorology, which could be used to protect traditional Linpans, as well as for ecological restoration.",

    "abstract": "Based on the NCEP/NCAR daily reanalysis product, NOAA monthly sea surface temperature (SST) dataset, and daily precipitation data collected at observational stations provided by Meteorological Information Center of China Meteorological Administration, the present study analyzes characteristic circulation anomalies conducive to regional extreme daily precipitation in the summer over Northeast China. Results indicate that 26 extreme precipitation events occurred during the 36-year period of 1979–2014. The precipitation threshold for the 99 th percentile is 22.2 mm/d, and the maximum extreme daily precipitation occurred in Liaoning Province. When extreme precipitation occurs, Northeast China is located to the southeast of an anomalous cyclonic circulation and northwest of an anomalous anticyclonic circulation, where a strong convergence zone is formed in the lower troposphere. The low-level convergence and upper-level divergence as well as the baroclinic circulation structure are favorable for the development of extreme daily precipitation. Meanwhile, there exist two symmetrical meridional circulations to the north and south of Northeast China. The two meridional circulations share the same ascending branch, which is conducive to the occurrence of precipitation. Located in the strong convergence zone to the southeast of the abnormal cyclonic circulation and northwest of the abnormal anticyclonic circulation, huge amounts of water vapor from the Inner Mongolia, Russia, the Japan Sea, and the mid-high latitudes of the Northwest Pacific are transported to Northeast China, providing sufficient water vapor condition for the occurrence of extreme daily precipitation in this region. In addition, daily extreme precipitation in Northeast China is also closely related to the accumulation and convergence of disturbance energy in Northeast China. It may also be related to the abnormal SST distribution that is high in the north and low in the south. Corresponding to extreme daily precipitation, SST anomaly in the Pacific Ocean is roughly characterized by the feature of “positive-north and negative- south” with the equator as the boundary.",

    "abstract": "Microphysics parameterization becomes increasingly important as the model grid spacing increases toward convection-resolving scales. Using observations from a field campaign for Mei-Yu rainfall in China, four bulk cloud microphysics schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model were evaluated with respect to their ability to simulate precipitation, structure, and cloud microphysical properties over convective and stratiform regimes. These are the Thompson (THOM), Morrison graupel/hail (MOR_G/H), Stony Brook University (SBU_YLIN), and WRF double-moment six-class microphysics graupel/hail (WDM6_G/H). All schemes were able to predict the rain band but underestimated the total precipitation by 23%–35%. This is mainly attributed to the underestimation of stratiform precipitation and overestimation of convective rain. For the vertical distribution of radar reflectivity, many problems remain, such as lower reflectivity values aloft in both convective and stratiform regions and higher reflectivity values at middle level. Each bulk scheme has its advantages and shortcomings for different cloud regimes. Overall, the discrepancies between model output and observations mostly exist in the midlevel to upper level, which results from the inability of the model to accurately represent the particle size distribution, ice processes, and storm dynamics. Further observations from major field campaigns and more detailed evaluation are still necessary.",

    "abstract": "Climate is a complex and chaotic system, and temperature prediction is a challenging problem. Accurate temperature prediction is also concerned in the fields of energy, environment, industry, and agriculture. In order to improve the accuracy of monthly mean temperature prediction and reduce the calculation scale of hybrid prediction process, a combined prediction model based on variational mode decomposition-differential symbolic entropy (VMD-DSE) and Volterra is proposed. Firstly, the original monthly mean meteorological temperature sequence is decomposed into finite mode components by VMD. The DSE is used to analyze the complexity and reconstruct the sequences. Then, the new sequence is reconstructed in phase space. The delay time and embedding dimension are determined by the mutual information method and G-P method, respectively. On this basis, the Volterra adaptive prediction model is established to modeling and predicting each component. Finally, the final predicted values are obtained by superimposing the predicted results. The monthly mean temperature data of Xianyang and Yan’an are used to verify the prediction performance of the proposed model. The experimental results show that the VMD-DSE-Volterra model shows better performance in the prediction of monthly mean temperature compared with other benchmark models in this paper. In addition, the combined forecasting model proposed in this paper can reduce the modeling time and improve the forecasting accuracy, so it is an effective forecasting model.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the performance of the latest version of RegCM4 in simulating summer precipitation over South Korea, comparing nine sensitivity experiments with different combinations of convective parameterization schemes (CPSs) between land and ocean. In addition to the gross pattern of seasonal and monthly mean precipitation, the northward propagation of the intense precipitation band and statistics from extreme daily precipitation are thoroughly evaluated against gridded and in situ station observations. The comparative analysis of 10-year simulations demonstrates that no CPS shows superiority in both quantitative and qualitative aspects. Furthermore, a nontrivial discrepancy among the different observation datasets makes a robust assessment of model performance difficult. Regardless of the CPS over the ocean, the simulations with the Kain–Fritsch scheme over land show a severe dry bias, whereas the simulations with the Tiedtke scheme over land suffer from a limited accuracy in reproducing spatial distributions due to the excessive orographic precipitation. In general, the simulations with the Emanuel scheme over land are better at capturing the major characteristics of summer precipitation over South Korea, despite not all statistical metrics showing the best performance. When applying the Emanuel scheme to both land and the ocean, precipitation tends to be slightly overestimated. This deficiency can be alleviated by using either the Tiedtke or Kain–Fritsch schemes over the ocean instead. As few studies have applied and evaluated the Tiedtke and Kain–Fritsch schemes to the Korean region within the RegCM framework, and this study introduces the potential of these new CPSs compared with the more frequently selected Emanuel scheme, which is particularly beneficial to RegCM users.",

It would be desirable to understand how they will evolve in the future as global warming becomes more serious with time. Thus, the primary objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the changing characteristics of the precipitation extremes in the 21st century over Shaanxi Province, a climate-sensitive and environmentally fragile area located in the east of northwestern China, based on a consecutive simulation of the 21st century conducted by the regional climate model RegCM4 forced by the global climate model HadGEM2-ES at high resolution under middle emission scenario of the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5). Basic validation of the model performance was carried out, and six extreme precipitation indices (EPIs) were used to assess the intensity and frequency of the extreme precipitation events over Shaanxi Province. The results show that RegCM4 reproduces the observed characteristics of extreme precipitation events over Shaanxi Province well. Overall for the domain, the EPIs excluding consecutive dry days (CDD) have a growing tendency during 1980–2098 although they exhibit spatial variability over Shaanxi Province. Some areas in the arid northern Shaanxi may have more heavy rainfalls by the middle of the 21st century but less wet extreme events by the end of the 21st century. And the humid central and southern regions would suffer more precipitation-related natural hazards in the future.",

    "abstract": "Climate change could affect botanical tourism by altering the plant phenology (e.g., flowering and leaf coloring date) and the physical comfort of tourists. To date, few studies have simultaneously considered the influence of plant phenology and physical comfort on the travel suitability of botanical tourism. Taking Beijing as an example, this study used phenological data of 73 species from 1963 to 2017 to construct a phenological ornamental index (POI) according to the flowering and leaf coloring date of ornamental plant. The climate comfort index (CCI) of tourism was calculated by using meteorological data of the corresponding periods. Finally, the travel suitability index (TSI) was constructed by integrating the two indices (POI and CCI). The POI showed that the best period for spring flower viewing was from April 4 to May 10, while the best period for autumn leaves viewing was from October 11 to November 6 on average. According to the variation of the CCI within the year, the most comfortable period for spring tourism was matched with the best period for spring flower viewing (April 4 to June 1), but the most comfortable period for autumn tourism (September 4 to October 19) was earlier than the best period for autumn leaves viewing. The TSI indicated that the best periods for spring and autumn botanical tourism were April 7 to May 10 and October 10 to November 7, respectively. Based on the climate data under different scenarios (representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5), we simulated the climate and phenological suitability for botanical tourism in the next thirty years. The results showed that the best period for spring botanical tourism during 2040–2050 was earlier and the period for autumn botanical tourism was later than that in the past 55 years. Meanwhile, the duration would shorten by 2–7 days for both seasons. This study provided a reference for assessing the impact of global climate change on the best season of botanical tourism.",

In this study, 3 groups of land surface temperature data from 2 different areas were selected for experiments, and several commonly used spatial interpolation methods were compared. Experimental results indicated that S-IDW outperformed IDW and several existing spatial interpolation methods, but there were also some abnormal value and interpolation outliers.

In this study, different precipitation products are compared in terms of their representation of the offshore rainfall maximum feature in this region. Climatologically, all products examined present similar rainfall distribution except for the CMAP. Significant discrepancies among different products are found in the interannual variation, as illustrated by the contrast features between 2002 and 2005. Based on the TRMM products (except for 3B42RT) and GPCP V1.2, the precipitation maximum occurred near the coast in 2002, while it was about 100–200 km offshore in 2005. However, this difference is not obvious in the GPCP V2.2 and TRMM 3B42RT products. Larger easterly vertical wind shear and warmer SST were present in 2005. Both favor stronger orographically-forced convective systems to propagate offshore, leading to the offshore rainfall maximum in 2005. Therefore, it is suggested that the TRMM 3B40RT, which is mainly based on passive microwave estimates, may be more reliable among different precipitation products in reflecting the precipitation feature in the coastal region of the east BoB.",

These instruments determine precipitation intensity indirectly, based on measuring different parameters in different sampling points in the atmosphere. A comparative study was carried out based on the data provided by each of these devices, revealing that the disdrometer and the rain gauge measure similar precipitation intensity values, whereas the MRR measures different rain fall volumes. The distributions of drop sizes show that the mean diameter of the particles varied considerably depending on the altitude considered. The level at which saturation occurs in the atmosphere is decisive in the distribution of drop sizes between 2,700 m and 3,000 m. As time passes, the maximum precipitation intensities are registered at a lower height and are less intense. The maximum precipitation intensities occurred at altitudes above 1,000 m, while the maximum fall speeds are typically found at altitudes below 700 m.",

One main limitation of most of weather generators is that they do not incorporate neither the spatial/temporal correlations between/within sites nor the cross-correlations between variables, characteristics specially important when aggregating, for example, simulated crop yields, freeze events, or heat waves in a watershed or region. Three models were developed to generate realization of daily maximum and minimum temperatures for multiple sites. The first model incorporates only spatial correlation, whereas temporal correlation using a 1-day lag and cross-correlation between variables were added to model one, respectively, by the other two models. Vectors of correlated random numbers were rescaled to temperature values by multiplying each element with the standard deviation and adding the mean of the corresponding weather station. An extension of Crout's algorithm was developed to enable the factorization of nonpositive definite matrices. Monthly spatial correlations of generated daily maximum and minimum temperatures between all pairs of weather stations closely matched their observed counterparts. Performance was analyzed by comparing the root mean squared error, temporal semivariograms, correlation/cross-correlation matrices, multiannual monthly means, and standard deviations.",

Moreover, a detailed sensitivity analysis under a visibility of 3 km and 23 km is performed in terms of uncertainties of land surface emissivity (LSE), water vapor content (WVC), and instrument noise, respectively. It is noted that the four-channel based method is more sensitive to LSE than SW method, especially for dry atmosphere; LST error caused by a WVC uncertainty of 20% is within 1.5 K for SW method and within 0.8 K for four-channel based method; the instrument noise would introduce LST error with a maximum standard deviation of 0.5 K and 0.04 K for the four-channel based method and SW method, respectively.",

Subsequently, Tembin passed over this extreme warming region and its intensity was enhanced drastically and suddenly from Category 1 to Category 3 within less than 1-day time interval. This unusual warming seems to largely prompt the intensification of Tembin. Next, the relationship between this extreme warming and rapid intensification of Tembin is identified by atmospheric model Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) with updated time-varying lower boundary condition. In addition, given the tight relationship between generation of unusual warming in the shore region and following possible TC intensification, a series of numerical experiments based on oceanic model Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS) were designed and executed to resolve the possible generated mechanism of the extreme warming. The results indicate that a distinct positive short-wave radiation influx anomaly may dominate the generation of the unusual warming in the shore region during Tembin’s passage. This result is validated by the distributions of free cloudy coverage shown in satellite infrared images.",

Ecosystem management clarifies the fundamental supporting functions of ecosystems for human survival and sustainable development. Integrated ecosystem monitoring and assessment has become a popular topic of ecology study. However, many scientific questions need to be addressed, including what assessment contents and methods are optimal for temporal and spatial measurements. Therefore, the development of a scientific evaluation framework that includes certain core contents and indicators is very important. This paper proposes a regional integrated ecosystem assessment framework involving comprehensive monitoring. Satellite images are the main data source for different ecosystem and ecological parameters, and these need to be supplemented with the help of surveys or field observation data. A healthy ecosystem is the basis of human survival and sustainable development, and ecological service should be taken as the core of integrated ecosystem assessment. This is decided by the spatial distribution, classification, and patterns of regional ecosystems. That is to say, ecological service, together with ecosystems distribution and pattern, ecological problem indicators, and ecological stress, needs to be integrated analyzed and evaluated.",

The most significant correlation between IOD index (IODI) and NINO3 appeared in boreal autumn. A new index (IODN3) related to the intensity of El Niño and IOD was created. Three indexes in boreal autumn were positively well correlated with the rainfall over the Yangtze River and its southern area (rain-YRBS) in next June. The most significant correlation appeared between IODN3 and rain-YRBS. Positive rain-YRBS anomalies in June tend to occur after P-IOD or El Niño solely matured in previous boreal autumn. However, when both events matured in boreal autumn, rain-YRBS anomalies tended to be more enhanced, which suggests that a delayed combined influence of both events on rain-YRBS in June was larger than that of either event alone. There was a low level anticyclonic circulation around the Philippines (PSAC) that developed in boreal autumn and was maintained until the following June when the single event occurred. However, a much stronger PSAC tended to occur when both events matured. The stronger PSAC could transport more water vapor to YRBS and cause more rainfall there in June.",

    "abstract": "In the current context of climate change discussions, predictions of future scenarios of weather and climate are crucial for the generation of information of interest to the global community. Due to the atmosphere being a chaotic system, errors in predictions of future scenarios are systematically observed. Therefore, numerous techniques have been tested in order to generate more reliable predictions, and two techniques have excelled in science: dynamic downscaling, through regional models, and ensemble prediction, combining different outputs of climate models through the arithmetic average, in other words, a postprocessing of the output data species. Thus, this paper proposes a method of postprocessing outputs of regional climate models. This method consists in using the statistical tool multiple linear regression by principal components for combining different simulations obtained by dynamic downscaling with the regional climate model (RegCM4). Tests for the Amazon and Northeast region of Brazil (South America) showed that the method provided a more realistic prediction in terms of average daily rainfall for the analyzed period prescribed, after comparing with the prediction made by set through the arithmetic averages of the simulations. This method photographed the extreme events (outlier) that the prediction by averaging failed. Data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) were used to evaluate the method.",

It is known that elimination of these effects from multifrequency GNSS measurements is handi-capped by diffraction effects during signal propagation through turbulent ionospheric plasma with the inner scale being smaller than the Fresnel radius. We demonstrated the possibility of reducing the residual ionospheric error in dual-frequency GNSS remote sensing in ionosphere-free combination by Fresnel inversion. The inversion parameter, the distance to the virtual screen, may be selected from the minimum of amplitude fluctuations. This suggests the possibility of improving the accuracy of GNSS remote sensing in meteorology. In the study of ionospheric disturbances with the aid of geometry-free combination, the Fresnel inversion eliminates only the third-order error. To eliminate the random TEC component which, like the measured average TEC, is the first-order correction, we should use temporal filtering (averaging).",

    "abstract": "In recent years, it has been documented that climatic variability influences hydrological processes; however, these influences, such as hydrologic dynamics, have not yet been incorporated into models, which have been assumed as stationary with regard to climatic conditions. In this study, the temporal variability of hydrological processes and their influence on the water balance of a mountainous and data-sparse catchment in Chile are observed and modeled through the comparison of a stationary (time-invariant parameters) and dynamic (time-variant parameters) model. Since conceptual models are the most adequate option for a data-scarce basin, a conceptual model integrated with the Monte Carlo Analysis Toolbox is used to perform the analyses. Simple analyses aimed at increasing the amount of information obtained from models were used. The General and Dynamic Identifiability Analyses were used to perform stationary and dynamic calibration strategies, respectively. As a result we concluded that the dynamic model is more robust than the stationary one. Additionally, DYNIA helped us to observe the temporal variability of hydrological processes. This analysis contributed to a better understanding of hydrological processes in a data-sparse Andean catchment and thus could potentially help reduce uncertainties in the outputs of hydrological models under scenarios of climate change and/or variability.",

Using reanalysis and satellite-based products, the variability and trends in the heat fluxes are compared with variations in three atmospheric teleconnection patterns: the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), the pressure and position of the Azores High (AH), and the East Atlantic-West Russia teleconnection pattern (EAWR). Comparison of correlations between the heat fluxes and teleconnections, along with analysis of composites of surface temperature, humidity, and wind fields for different teleconnection states, demonstrates that the AH explains the heat flux changes more successfully than NAO and EAWR. Trends in pressure and longitude of the Azores High show a strengthening and an eastward shift. Variations of the Azores High occur along an axis defined by lower pressure and westward location at one extreme and higher pressure and eastward location at the other extreme. The shift of the AH from predominance of the low/west state to the high/east state induces trends in Mediterranean Sea surface winds, temperature, and moisture. These, combined with sea surface warming trends, produce trends in wintertime sensible and latent heat fluxes.",

There was no significant land use change in the observed period, so all changes in hydrological processes can be considered to be without human impact in the last 35 years. Application of RAPS (Rescaled Adjusted Partial Sums) on all data series distinguished two subperiods with different length but the same behaviour. The first subperiod was a period characterised by the decrease, starting in 1980 and finishing between 1991 and 1995, while the second one was a period characterised by the increase of parameters in all analyses, starting between 1991 and 1995 and finishing in 2001. In comparison to the analysis of climate change impacts per decade, this approach is much more appropriate and gives insight into variations throughout the entire observed period. The most variable but not significant parameters are precipitation and discharges, especially in the second subperiod which has a major impact on occurrence of hydrological hazards such as droughts and floods and makes great pressure and responsibility on water management system.",

Meteorological data from 48 meteorological stations were used, and spatial correlations between three meteorological factors and two topological factors were analyzed to improve the mapping results including annual precipitation, average temperature, average water vapor pressure, elevation, and distance to coastline. Some missing annual precipitation data were estimated based on their historical probability distribution and were assimilated as soft data in the BME method. Based on this, the univariate BME, multivariate BME, univariate BME with soft data, and multivariate BME with soft data analysis methods were compared. The estimation accuracy was assessed by cross-validation with the mean error (ME), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). The results showed that multivariate BME with soft data outperformed the other methods, indicating that adding the spatial correlations between multivariate factors and soft data can help improve the estimation performance.",

This study aims to investigate the anomalous pattern of atmospheric and oceanic circulations due to 50% increase in the wind stress over the equatorial region and the Southern Ocean. In this paper we use a coupled climate model of intermediate complexity (SPEEDO). The results show that the intensification of equatorial wind stress causes a decrease in sea surface temperature in the tropical region due to increased upwelling and evaporative cooling. On the other hand, the intensification of wind stress over the Southern Ocean induces a regional increase in the air and sea surface temperatures which in turn leads to a reduction in Antarctic sea ice thickness. This occurs in association with changes in the global thermohaline circulation strengthening the rate of Antarctic Bottom Water formation and a weakening of the North Atlantic Deep Water. Moreover, changes in the Southern Hemisphere thermal gradient lead to modified atmospheric and oceanic heat transports reducing the storm tracks and baroclinic activity.",

The advantages of this technique include high productivity, fast measurements, operator safety, and high accuracy. However, there are concerns about controlling and operating a remote boat to achieve measurement goals, especially during extreme events such as floods. When performing river discharge measurements, the main error source stems from the boat path. Due to the rapid flow in a flood condition, the boat path is not regular and this can cause errors in discharge measurements. Therefore, improvement of discharge measurements requires modification of boat path. As a result, the measurement errors in flood flow conditions are 12.3–21.8% before the modification of boat path, but 1.2–3.7% after the DMG modification of boat path. And it is considered that the modified discharges are very close to the observed discharge in the flood flow conditions. In this study, through the distance made good (DMG) modification of the boat path, a comprehensive discharge measurement with high accuracy can be achieved.",

Through the use of multiple climate scenarios from 12 regional climate model simulations, the ensemble mean, and three synthetic simulations generated by a weighting procedure, we investigated intermodel seasonal climate change signals between current and future periods, for both median and extreme precipitation/temperature values. A significant dependence of seasonal climate change signals on the model biases over southern Québec in Canada was detected for temperatures, but not for precipitation. This suggests that the regional temperature change signal is affected by local processes. Seasonally, model bias affects future mean and extreme values in winter and summer. In addition, potentially large increases in future extremes of temperature and precipitation values were projected. For three synthetic scenarios, systematically less bias and a narrow range of mean change for all variables were projected compared to those of climate model simulations. In addition, synthetic scenarios were found to better capture the spatial variability of extreme cold temperatures than the ensemble mean scenario. These results indicate that the synthetic scenarios have greater potential to reduce the uncertainty of future climate projections and capture the spatial variability of extreme climate events.",

Comparisons of GPT in moist atmosphere with the equivalent potential temperature (EPT) in saturated moist atmosphere were made by analyzing three torrential rain cases occurring over Jianghuai Valleys in 2003, the north China in 2004, and with the typhoon Fung-Wong in 2008, respectively. Results showed that the relative humidity is not up to 100% even in torrential rain systems, the saturated condition for EPT is not always held, and thus GPT can describe the moisture concentration and moisture gradient better than EPT. The GPT's definition includes the process that the air changes from dry to moist, then up to saturated. Therefore, potential temperature (PT) and EPT can be considered as its two special status.

To understand changes in SO2 due to this policy, two observation stations were established on Waigaoqiao Dock in the Yangtze River estuary. Three data types were collected from March 2018 to May 2018, namely, wind speed and direction, SO2 concentration, and ships’ arrival and departure times. The statistics indicate that the wind direction changed little during the observation period and SO2 concentration was below 5 µg/m3 77.47% of the time. Meanwhile, ships’ arrival and departure at the dock had a distinct influence on overall SO2 distribution, including occurrence of concentrations ≥5 µg/m3. The three types of data were divided into six groups and a difference-in-difference model was used for analysis. The result shows that SO2 concentration increases due to the use of high-sulfur fuel and is especially significant when the wind is southwesterly. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between increases in SO2 concentrations over 5 µg/m3 and the number of ships arriving or departing from the port. This study reports the positive impact of fuel switching on air quality and can be used to evaluate adherence to the ECA policy.",

    "abstract": "The frequency distribution of winter extreme cold events (ECEs) in North China and the influences of mid-latitude sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the Northern Hemisphere are studied. The results show that (1) the frequency of single station ECEs (SSECEs) in winter increases from southeast to northwest, with a decrease before 2008 and then a significant increase. This trend abrupt change occurs in late winter. (2) When the SST in the North Pacific shows an “El-Niño-like” anomaly in winter, it triggers the negative Arctic Oscillation (−AO), positive Pacific North America (+PNA), and positive Eurasia Pacific (+EUP) atmospheric teleconnection patterns in the mid-lower troposphere. As a result, the ridge to south of Lake Baikal becomes stronger. Meanwhile, SST in the North Atlantic shows a “reversed C” negative anomaly with North Atlantic Oscillation (+NAO), (+PNA)-like and (+EUP)-like patterns, and the ridge to southwest of Lake Baikal becomes stronger. Furthermore, both cause the Siberian High to become weaker in the north and stronger in the south. With the weaker East Asia subtropical jet and stronger East Asia winter monsoon, these factors lead to a significant increase of SSECE frequency in North China. (3) When the SSTA shows an “El Niño-like” developing pattern from summer to autumn in the North Pacific, the winter SSECE frequency will be higher. (4) The purported mechanism between the mid-latitude SSTA and the winter SSECE frequency in North China is the following: the SSTA in the North Pacific in summer and autumn excites atmospheric teleconnection wave trains, and the Atlantic stores these anomaly signals. In winter, the interaction between the SSTAs in the North Pacific and the North Atlantic enhances the Eurasian teleconnection wave train. With the upstream fluctuation energy dispersing downstream, the wave train centers move eastward with the season, resulting in an increase in the frequency of the SSECEs.",

Meteorological and environmental factors, in both laboratory and epidemiological studies, have been reported to affect the survival and transmission of the virus. In this study, the possible effects of location-specific meteorological parameters in a tropical climate on new daily COVID-19 infection (NDI) are investigated in Kuala Lumpur from 14 March 2020 to 31 August 2020. A generalized additive model (GAM) was imposed on ambient temperature (T) and absolute humidity (AH) to explore their nonlinear relationship with NDI. Piecewise linear regression was then used to further discern the relationships below and above the threshold values of both T and AH. The relationship between T and NDI, which was linear and statistically significant for T &gt; 29.7°C, showed that each unit rise in temperature increases NDI by about 3.210% (CI: 1.372–7.976). AH had a more pronounced linear association with NDI for AH ≤ 22.6 g/m3 but tended to flatten the exposure-response curve above this value. A 1 g/m3 increase in AH increases NDI by 3.807% (CI: 2.064–5.732). Generally, the results indicated a positive association between T and NDI, particularly above 29.7°C, while the association with AH showed a stronger positive relationship below 22.6 g/m3.

Meanwhile, characteristics and development mechanisms for NECVs of different types are also analyzed. In the recent 30 years, the occurrences of NECV processes have been increasing year by year, with an average of 7.4 times per year in Northeast China and a duration of 3–5 days on average for each process. NECVs mostly occur in late spring and early summer, and the longest time influenced by NECVs exceeds 19 days, with annual means of 9.9 days, 8.8 days, and 7.0 days in May, June, and July, respectively. The frequency of weak NECVs is about 1.2 times that of strong NECVs. Strong NCVs in late spring and early autumn as well as weak MCVs in summer are with high-frequency occurrences. It is found that when NCVs occur in late spring and early autumn, the upper-level westerly jets are relatively stronger, thus strengthening the divergence in the upper troposphere and the vortex circulation. The circulation fields in upper and lower levels cooperate with the strong jets, promoting the continuous development and maintenance of the cold vortices. Apart from the jets and circulation, the lower central potential height combined with the obvious cold-core and stronger ascending motions favor the NCV’s development. In addition, the dry intrusion has a strong promotion due to the stronger lower-level cold advection and downward intrusion of high potential vorticity. However, when MCVs occur in summer, things are just the opposite.",

    "abstract": "Lomas formations in southern Peru are related to moisture availability due to frequent incursions of fog in austral winter. Due to warming of coastal waters of southern Peru during El Niño, lomas formations are enhanced via greater moisture availability for fog and drizzle. Our study evaluates the modern climatological record in austral winter to determine if there are differences in moisture availability between El Niño and La Niña for fog formation. Our results show anomalous northwesterly onshore flow, warmer than normal sea-surface temperatures, and an increase in precipitable water in El Niño, favoring lomas formations due to advection fog with higher moisture content. On the other hand, La Niña also favors frequent advection fog, with less moisture content due to strong onshore flow over relatively cool SSTs. Since lomas may represent fragments of a continuous vegetation belt that existed during the Pliocene, a permanent El Niño favoring vigorous vegetation production along the south Peruvian coast due to incursions of fog with high precipitable water may have occurred in this period. However, the possibility of normal El Niño variability superimposed on a warmer climatology producing fog with higher moisture content in both El Niño and La Niña conditions cannot be discounted.",

The refined forecasting system based on MM5, WRF, and statistical modules provided point-specific hourly wind forecasts for the five venues, and the severe weather monitoring and forecasting system was used in short-term forecasts and nowcasts for rainstorms, gales, and hailstones. Moreover, latest forecasting products, warnings, and weather information were communicated conveniently and timely through a synthetic, speedy, and digitalized network system to different customers. Daily weather information briefings, notice boards, websites, and community short messages were the main approaches for regatta organizers, athletes, and coaches to receive weather service products at 8:00 PM of each day and whenever new updates were available. During the period of OPSC, almost one hundred people were involved in the weather service with innovative service concept, and the weather support was found to be successful and helpful to the OPSC.",

In this research, we modified the net returns of each land use type for three scenarios, including business as usual (BAU) scenario, rapid economic growth (REG) scenario, and coordinated environmental sustainability (CES) scenario. The simulation results showed that, under different scenarios, future land use structures were different due to the competition among various land use types. The land use structure changes in North China Plain in the 40-year future will experience a transfer from cultivated land to built-up area, an increase of forestry, and decrease of grassland.

This study uses the author's mesoscale-convection-resolving model that was developed in the 1980s to improve parametrization schemes of moist convection. Results from numerical experiments by changing the SST anomaly in the warm pool area indicate that the period of the MJO does not monotonously change with increasing SST anomaly. Between the two extreme cases (no anomaly and strong anomaly), there is a regime in which the period varies in a wide range from 20 to 60 days. In the case of no warm pool, eastward-propagating Kelvin waves are dominant, whereas in the case of a strong warm pool, it produces a quasi-stationary convective system (with pronounced time variation). In a certain regime between the two extreme cases, convective activities with two different properties are strongly interacted, and the period of oscillations becomes complicated. The properties and behaviors of large-scale convective system (LCS), synoptic-scale convective system (SCS), mesoscale convective system (MCS), and mesoscale convection (MC), which constitute the hierarchical structure of the MJO, are also examined. It is also shown that cloud clusters, which constitute the SCS (such as super cloud cluster SCC), consist of a few MCS, and a new MCS forms to the west of the existing MCS. The northwesterly and southwesterly low-level flows contribute to this feature. In view of recent emphasis of the importance of the relative humidity above the boundary layer, it is shown that the model can simulate convective processes that moisten the atmosphere, and the importance of latent instability (positive CAPE), which is a necessary condition for the wave-CISK, is emphasized.",

Simulations were carried out for three different nucleation schemes involving (1) kinetic self‐nucleation of OIO (2) nucleation via OIO activation by H 2 SO 4 and (3) nucleation via OIO activation by H 2 SO 4 plus condensation of a low‐volatility organic vapour. Peak OIO and H 2 SO 4 vapour concentrations were both limited to 6 × 10 6 molecules cm -3 at noontime while the peak organic vapour concentration was limited to 12 × 10 6 molecules cm -3 . All simulations produced significant concentrations of new particles in the Aitken mode. From a base case particle concentration of 222 cm -3 at radii &gt;15 nm, increases in concentrations to 366 cm -3 were predicted from the OIO‐OIO case, 722 cm -3 for the OIO‐H 2 SO 4 case, and 1584 cm -3 for the OIO‐H 2 SO 4 case with additional condensing organic vapours. The results indicate that open ocean new particle production is feasible for clean conditions; however, new particle production becomes most significant when an additional condensable organic vapour is available to grow the newly formed particles to larger sizes. Comparison to sectional model for a typical case study demonstrated good agreement and the validity of using the modal model.",

Terrestrial water storage change (TWSC) is an important factor in the water cycle. In this study, we used Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites data to retrieve the TWSC in Tien Shan and Qi Lian Mountains. Variation of seasonal TWSC was obvious. However, the seasonal and annual differences reflected the imbalance of water resource distribution in two mountains. The TWSC decreased in the Tien Shan Mountains but increased in the Qi Lian Mountains during 2003 to 2010. Permafrost and glaciers play an important role in the water cycle in arid mountain regions. Demands for water for agriculture need more groundwater extraction for irrigation and glacial melt feeding the rivers which leads to the state of loss of TWSC in Tien Shan Mountains. Increase and thickening of the active layer of permafrost could lead to more infiltration of surface water into the groundwater, which result in increasing water storage and changes in the regional water balance. According to water balance, precipitation and evaporation changed little in short time, and TWSC changed obviously, whereas runoff showed an increasing trend in the Tien Shan Mountains and a decreasing trend in the Qi Lian Mountains.",

Given the fact that microwave links can obtain the total path attenuation accurately, we introduce the concept of regional attenuation correction using a multiple-microwave-links network based on the tomographic reconstruction of attenuation coefficients. Derived from the radar-based equation, the effect of rainfall distribution on the propagation of radar and microwave link signals was analyzed. This article focuses on modeling of the tomographic reconstruction of attenuation coefficients and regional attenuation correction algorithms. Finally, a numerical simulation of regional attenuation correction was performed to verify the algorithms employed here. The results demonstrate that the correction coefficient (0.9175) falls between the corrected and initial field of radar reflectivity factor (root mean square error, 2.3476 dBz; average deviation, 0.0113 dBz). Compared with uncorrected data, the accuracy of the corrected radar reflectivity factor was improved by 26.12%, and the corrected rainfall intensity distribution was improved by 51.85% validating the region attenuation correction algorithm. This method can correct the regional attenuation of weather radar echo effectively and efficiently; it can be widely used for the radar attenuation correction and the promotion of quantitative precipitation estimation by weather radar.",

    "abstract": "Composite analyses of the atmosphere over the central United States during elevated thunderstorms producing heavy rainfall are presented. Composites were created for five National Weather Service County Warning Areas (CWAs) in the region. Events studied occurred during the warm season (April–September) during 1979–2012. These CWAs encompass the region determined previously to experience the greatest frequency of elevated thunderstorms in the United States. Composited events produced rainfall of &gt;50 mm 24 hr −1 within the selected CWA. Composites were generated for the 0–3 hr period prior to the heaviest rainfall, 6–9 hours prior to it, and 12–15 hours prior to it. This paper focuses on the Pleasant Hill, Missouri (EAX) composites, as all CWA results were similar; also these analyses focus on the period 0–3 hours prior to event occurrence. These findings corroborate the findings of previous authors. What is offered here that is unique is (1) a measure of the interquartile range within the composite mean fields, allowing for discrimination between variable fields that provided a strong reliable signal, from those that may appear strong but possess large variability, and (2) composite soundings of two subclasses of elevated thunderstorms. Also, a null case (one that fits the composite but failed to produce significant rainfall) is also examined for comparison.",

The ARF method incorporates the optimization ability of the artificial fish swarm algorithm and the random forest regression function to provide quality control for multiple surface air temperature stations. Surface air temperature observations were recorded at stations in mountainous and plain regions and at neighboring stations to test the performance of the method. Observations from 2005 to 2013 were used as a training set, and observations from 2014 were used as a testing set. The results indicate that the ARF method is able to identify inaccurate observations; and it has a higher rate of detection, lower rate of change for the quality control parameters, and fewer type I errors than traditional methods. Notably, the ARF method yielded low performance indexes in areas with complex terrain, where traditional methods were considerably less effective. In addition, for stations near the ocean without sufficient neighboring stations, different neighboring stations were used to test the different methods. Whereas the traditional methods were affected by station distribution, the ARF method exhibited fewer errors and higher stability. Thus, the method is able to effectively reduce the effects of geographical factors on spatial quality control.",

CAM5 was driven by monthly mean climatological ozone in control experiment (CE) and OVTP in the sensitivity experiment (SE) was removed from May to September. After the removal of OVTP, South Asian High (SAH) becomes more robust and colder from June to August, especially in June. The reason for enhancement of SAH is that removal of OVTP increasing ozone in 200–30 hPa leads to significant enhancement of longwave and shortwave radiative heating rate in SAH region in June, and then enhancement of horizontal divergence resulting from the radiative warming leads to strengthening of SAH influenced by the Coriolis force, while the colder SAH is primarily caused by dynamic processes. Adiabatic expansion and ascending movement mainly bring about temperature decrease in SAH after OVTP removal, but the thermodynamic process related to radiative heating offsets part of the cooling response.",

The major influences occurred in urban areas, where wind speeds decreased greatly, while the daytime surface upward sensible heat flux clearly increased.

This work seeks to obtain a suitable combination of physics schemes of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for seasonal precipitation simulation over Ghana. Using the ERA-Interim reanalysis as forcing data, simulation experiments spanning eight months (from April to November) were performed for two different years: a dry year (2001) and a wet year (2008). A double nested approach was used with the outer domain at 50 km resolution covering West Africa and the inner domain covering Ghana at 10 km resolution. The results suggest that the WRF model generally overestimated the observed precipitation by a mean value between 3% and 64% for both years. Most of the scheme combinations overestimated (underestimated) precipitation over coastal (northern) zones of Ghana for both years but estimated precipitation reasonably well over forest and transitional zones. On the whole, the combination of WRF Single-Moment 6-Class Microphysics Scheme, Grell-Devenyi Ensemble Cumulus Scheme, and Asymmetric Convective Model Planetary Boundary Layer Scheme simulated the best temporal pattern and temporal variability with the least relative bias for both years and therefore is recommended for Ghana.",

During the last 7 years the Arctic sea-ice area has stabilized while the Antarctic sea-ice area has increased at a rate significantly higher than during the previous decades; that is, the sea-ice area of both regions has experienced a positive acceleration. This result is quite robust because it is confirmed by alternative temperature climate indices of the same regions. We also found that a significant 4-5-year natural oscillation characterizes the climate of these sea-ice polar areas. On the contrary, we found that the CMIP5 general circulation models have predicted significant warming in both polar sea regions and failed to reproduce the strong 4-5-year oscillation. Because the CMIP5 GCM simulations are inconsistent with the observations, we suggest that important natural mechanisms of climate change are missing in the models.",

The results suggested that the generalized extreme value and Gamma models better simulated the extreme precipitation and flood volume sequence than the generalized Pareto model for the annual maximum series, while the generalized Pareto distribution model was the best-fit model for peaks over threshold series. For the two-dimensional joint distributions of precipitation and flood volume, the Frank Copula was preferred in simulation of the annual maximum flood series whereas the Gumbel Copula was the most appropriate function to simulate the points over threshold flood series. We concluded that, compared with the traditional univariate approach, multivariate statistical analysis produced flood estimates that were more physically based and statistically sound and carried lower risk for flood design purposes.",

This study used passive microwave remote sensing data from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) and the Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS), providing observations under all weather conditions, to investigate the LST over the Amazon and Congo rainforests. The SSM/I and SSMIS data were collected from 1996 to 2012. The morning and afternoon observations from passive microwave remote sensing facilitate the investigation of the interannual changes of LST anomalies on a diurnal basis. As a result of the variability of cloud cover and the corresponding reduction of solar radiation, the afternoon LST anomalies tend to vary more than the morning LST anomalies. The dominant spatial and temporal patterns for interseasonal variations of the LST anomalies over the tropical rainforest were analyzed. The impacts of droughts and El Niños on this LST were also investigated. Differences between early morning and late afternoon LST anomalies were identified by the remote sensing product, with the morning LST anomalies controlled by humidity (according to comparisons with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data).",

As shown in this paper, it is the result of the meso-alpha interaction between the daily oscillation of coastal thermally driven circulations around the basin and the daily pulsation of sinking speeds over areas of the Western Mediterranean Sea. Furthermore, from the 15-year average, a statistically significant correlation has been found between these processes (the daily oscillation of sea breezes and the daily pulsation of subsidence/convergence on the WMB). The quantification of this persistent link between these tropospheric processes elucidates their teleconnection at the meso-alpha scale and the seasonal evolution of the strength of this linkage. Test statistics are greater than critical values for the 5% significance level of the F-distribution. Besides, we have estimated a generalised diurnal compensatory subsidence over the Western Mediterranean Sea with a maximum mean sinking (subsidence) motion of up to −0.2 cm/s at 18:00 h UTC and 1000 hPa and a nocturnal generalised mean upward (convergence) motion of up to 0.05 cm/s at 00:00 h UTC and 1000 hPa.",

A robust trend is found in winter over the United States, which exhibits a simple pattern of a decrease of sunlight over Northern USA. and an increase of sunlight over Southern USA. This structure was identified in both the seasonal mean and the mean climatology at different times of the day. It is broadly consistent with the known poleward shift of storm tracks in winter in climate model simulations with GHG forcing. The centennial trend of the downward shortwave radiation at the surface in Northern USA. is on the order of 10% of the climatological value for the January monthly mean, and slightly over 10% at the time when it is midday in the United States. This indicates a nonnegligible influence of the GHG forcing on solar energy in the long term. Nevertheless, when dividing the 10% by a century, in the near term, the impact of the GHG forcing is relatively minor such that the estimate of solar power potential using present-day climatology will remain useful in the coming decades.",

The results show that (1) anomalous heating of the TP helps to form and sustain the Siberian blocking high, which is important for persistent southward flow of dry and cold Siberian air; (2) TP heating helps the moisture flux move more north and strengthens the southerly wind above 850 hPa; (3) there are two Rossby wave trains at 500 hPa and the layers above it (at about 20 ∘ N–40 ∘ N). Correlation analysis reveals that TP heating anomalies are closely associated with these Rossby wave trains; (4) the Rossby wave propagates downstream from the TP to South China in the mid and high layers of the atmosphere when the TP changes swiftly from a heat sink to a heat source. This implies that anomalous heating of the TP may stimulate the Rossby wave train to propagate downward in midlatitudes.",

During the investigated period, a typical western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) covered most East Asia, including Taiwan and its surrounding areas. The observations showed strong correlations between WPSH invasion and forming high O 3 concentrations. The dispersion of air pollutants in the ambient air is not sufficient to dilute their concentrations. In the afternoon of June 30, more than 60% of the air quality monitoring stations found O 3 concentrations exceeding 100 ppb, which were 2~3 times higher than their normal concentrations. Model simulation results verified that the presence of the WPSH hindered the dilution and transportation of air pollutants in ambient air.

    "abstract": "The prediction of summers with notable droughts and heatwaves on the seasonal scale is challenging, especially in extratropical regions, since their development is not yet fully understood. Thus, monitoring and analysis of such summers are important tasks to close this knowledge gap. In a previous paper, the authors presented hints that extreme summers are connected with specific conditions during the winter-spring transition season. Here, these findings are further discussed and analysed in the context of the Earth’s circulation systems. No evidence for a connection between the North Atlantic Oscillation or the Arctic Oscillation during the winter-spring transition and extremely hot and dry summers is found. However, inspection of the geopotential at 850 hPa shows that a Greenland-North Sea-Dipole is connected with extreme summers in Central Europe. This motivated the introduction of the novel Greenland-North Sea-Dipole-Index, GNDI. However, using this index as predictor would lead to one false alarm and one missed event in the time series analysed (1958–2011). Hints are found that the disturbance of the “dipole-summer” connection is due to El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). To consider the ENSO effect, the novel Central European Drought Index (CEDI) has been developed, which is composed of the GNDI and the Bivariate ENSO Time Series Index. The CEDI enables a correct indication of all extremely hot and dry summers between 1958 and 2011 without any false alarm.",

In this study, it is found that the latent heat flux (LHF) over Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP, defined as the region 0°–5°N, 115°–125°W) in spring is negatively correlated with the annual Atlantic TC and hurricane counts. By using stepwise backward elimination regression, it is further shown that the March value of ETP LHF is a better predictor than the spring or summer ENSO index for Atlantic TC counts. Leave-one-out cross validation indicates that the annual Atlantic TC counts predicted by this ENSO-independent statistical model show a remarkable correlation with the actual TC counts (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.72</mml:mn></mml:math>;<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math>value<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.01</mml:mn></mml:math>).

Furthermore, we investigate the driving mechanism of XCH 4 spatiotemporal variations, especially for high XCH 4 values shown over Sichuan Basin, by analyzing both the emission mechanism of rice planting process and the regional atmosphere dynamic transportation. The results indicate that spatially the Sichuan Basin presents a higher XCH 4 concentration than other regions in China and is 17 ppb higher than the paddy area in the same latitude zone. Seasonally, XCH 4 in Sichuan Basin during rice harvest season is generally higher than that in early cultivation period. However, comparing to paddy area in the same latitude zone, Sichuan Basin shows a relatively higher XCH 4 value during the winter of noncultivation period when the emissions from rice paddies are weak and surface air temperature is low. To further investigate the high XCH 4 concentration during this low-emission period, we use the HYSPLIT model to simulate the atmosphere dynamic transport process, and the result suggests that the typical closed topography of Sichuan Basin, which may lead to CH 4 accumulation and keep it from diffusion, is one possible reason for the high XCH 4 value in winter.",

The variogram analysis revealed that the approximate characteristic scale of linear trend of hourly and daily precipitation statistics ranges between 50 km and 200 km and between 100 km and 250 km, respectively.

In the Gaussian framework, KF and PF give the same theoretical result. However, in high dimension and using finite sampling for the Gaussian distribution, the PF is not able to reproduce the solution produced by the KF. This discrepancy is highlighted from the convergence property of the Gaussian law toward a hypersphere: in high dimension, any finite sample of a Gaussian law lies within a hypersphere centered in the mean of the Gaussian law and of radius square-root of the trace of the covariance matrix. This concentration of probability suggests the use of norm as a criterium that discriminates whether a forecast sample can be compatible or not with a given analysis state. The contribution illustrates important characteristics that have to be considered for the high dimension but does not introduce a new approach to face the curse of dimensionality.",

The water demand for vegetative growth increased significantly from 1999 to 2015 with global warming, especially in parts of the temperate zone. We defined a relative change in the residual trend to quantify the impact of human activities on vegetation. <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <a:mrow> <a:msub> <a:mrow> <a:mtext>RESTREND</a:mtext> </a:mrow> <a:mrow> <a:mtext>NDVI</a:mtext> </a:mrow> </a:msub> </a:mrow> <a:mo>/</a:mo> <a:mrow> <a:mtext>NDVI</a:mtext> </a:mrow> </a:math> in two periods (P1, 1982–1998 and P2, 1999–2015) markedly increased, indicating that human activities play a key role in the reversal of land degradation.",

    "abstract": "Over nearly three rainy seasons of lightning activity in North China, numerical prediction experiments were carried out using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with electrification and discharge schemes (WRF-Electric). The numerical forecast results were evaluated using the neighborhood-based equitable threat score (ETS) and fraction skill score (FSS) verification methods based on nationwide observational lightning data. An algorithm was used to generate the coverage of the total flash (intracloud and cloud-to-ground flashes) by fitting the cloud-to-ground flash data. The numerical results showed that the region of lightning activity could be well predicted by the mesoscale WRF-Electric model, particularly during a 6–12-hour forecasting period. The average ETS score of the 6–12-hour forecasting period was 0.34 for a 20 km neighborhood radius. The predictive skill of the model varied not only monthly but also diurnally. The model showed better forecasting skills during the main rainy season (June–July–August) and at 14 : 00–20 : 00 local time. The predictability of the model was enhanced with increasing thunderstorm scale. On the other hand, the coverage of predicted lightning activity was relatively concentrated, and the lightning flash density was higher than the observations. The main discrepancies in the model prediction were related to the design of the discharge parameterization. Thus, in discharge parameterization, the initial threshold for lightning should be modified according to the model resolution, while the magnitude of the neutralization charge in a single discharge should be referenced to the observational results.",

For this purpose, monthly MODIS DB AOD datasets are directly compared with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) Version 3 Level 2.0 (cloud-screened and quality-assured) monthly measurements at 8 sites throughout Indonesia. The results indicate that MODIS DB AOD retrievals and AERONET AOD measurements have a high correlation in Sumatra Island (i.e., Kototabang (r = 0.88) and Jambi (r = 0.9)) and Kalimantan Island (i.e., Palangkaraya (r = 0.89) and Pontianak (r = 0.92)). However, the correlations are low in Bandung, Palu, and Sorong. In general, MODIS DB AOD tends to overestimate AERONET AOD at all sites by 16 to 61% and can detect extreme fire events in Sumatra and Kalimantan Islands quite well. Aerosol types in Indonesia mostly consist of clean continental, followed by biomass burning/urban industrial and mixed aerosols. Palu and Sorong had the highest clean continental aerosol contribution (90%), while Bandung had the highest biomass burning/urban-industrial aerosol contribution to atmospheric composition (93.7%). For mixed aerosols, the highest contribution was found in Pontianak, with a proportion of 48.4%. Spatially, the annual mean AOD in the western part of Indonesia is higher than in the eastern part. Seasonally, the highest AOD is observed during the period of September–November, which is associated with the emergence of fire events.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is a major threat to agricultural production and undermines the efforts to achieve sustainable development goals in poor countries such as Ethiopia that have climate-sensitive economies. The objective of this study was to assess characterization of local climate and its impact on productivity faba bean (Vicia faba L.) varieties (Gora and Tumsa) productivity in Welmera watershed area, central Ethiopia. Historical climate (1988–2017) and eight years of crop yield data were obtained from National Meteorological Agency of Ethiopia and Holeta Agricultural Research Center. Trend, variability, correlation, and regression analyses were carried out to characterize the climate of the area and establish association between faba bean productivity and climate change. The area received mean annual rainfall of 970 mm with SD of 145.6 and coefficient of variation (CV %) of 15%. The earliest and latest onset of rainfall were April 1 (92 DOY) and July 5 (187 DOY), whereas, the end date of rainy season was on September 2 (246 DOY) and October 31 (305 DOY), respectively. The average length of the growing period was 119 days, with a CV% of 35.2%. The probability of dry spell less than 7 days was high (&gt;80%) until the last decade of May (151 DOY); however, the probability sharply declined and reached 0% on the first decade of July (192 DOY). Kiremt (long rainy season that occurs from June to September) and belg (short rainy season that falls from February to April/May) rainfall had increasing trends at a rate of 4.7 mm and 2.32 mm/year, respectively. The annual maximum temperature showed increasing trend at a rate of 0.06°C per year and by a factor of 0.34°C, which is not statistically significant. The year 2014 was exceptionally drought year while 1988 was wettest year. Kiremt (JJAS) start of rain and rainy day had strong correlation and negative impact on Gora yield with (r = −0.407 and −0.369), respectively. The findings suggests large variation in rainfall and temperature in the study area which constraints faba bean production. Investment on agricultural sector to enhance farmer’s adaptation capacity is essential to reduce the adverse impacts of climate change and variability on faba bean yield. More research that combines household panel data with long-term climate data is necessary to better understand climate and its impact on faba bean yield.",

    "abstract": "This paper discusses the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning activity over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) from 2009 to 2018 and their dependence on meteorological factors. It is found that (1) the number of CG flashes fluctuates, reaches a maximum in 2014, and then gradually decreases. The main active period of CG lightning is from June to September each year, after which it decreases rapidly. CG lightning is mainly distributed in the valley areas at around 4800 m above sea level at Lhasa, Nagqu, and Chamdo, and there are differences in the characteristics of CG activity in these three areas. The peak of daily CG lightning occurs at 1000 UTC, and the lowest value is at 0400 UTC. The distribution of CG lightning in all seasons has obvious differences in peak time and the proportion of positive CG (+CG) lightning, with the ratio of +CG lightning to total CG lightning flashes in spring and autumn exceeding 50%. (2) The ratio of +CG lightning to total CG lightning flashes over the QTP is influenced by a combination of thermodynamic and microphysical factors. Over the QTP, greater vertical wind shear leads to the movement of upper positive charges and promotes the occurrence of +CG lightning. Also, the higher total column liquid water content implies higher cloud water content in the warm-cloud region, and the higher cloud-base height implies a thicker warm-cloud region, which is not conducive to the occurrence of +CG lightning. (3) During high-value years (in this study, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016), the midlatitude (30°N–60°N) high pressure is strong and the plateau is situated at the intersection of the East Asian and South Asian monsoons and the cold air from the northwest, which strengthens the water vapor convergence and increases the frequency of thunderstorms. When the plateau is under the control of the southerly monsoon from June to September every year, its atmosphere is full of water vapor and lightning activity is accordingly high, with the proportion of +CG lightning being about 10%. Meanwhile, in the remaining months, when controlled by the westerly wind belt, the plateau’s water vapor condition is poor, the level of lightning activity weakens, and the proportion of +CG lightning gradually increases to more than 50%.",

Understanding the dynamics of water availability under the changing climate in such a basin assists in the proper planning of land use and other development activities. This study presents changes in climatic elements such as rainfall, temperature, and evapotranspiration using observation data and regional climate models (RCMs) under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for three future periods. We use a calibrated hydrological model to further assess climate change’s effects on streamflow. We select three RCMs and their ensemble’s mean by evaluating their performance with respect to observations. We apply the modified Mann–Kendall test to detect trends in each dataset. The result shows that annual mean maximum and minimum temperatures increase in the catchment for the 2021–2040, 2041–2070, and 2071–2100 periods as compared to baseline (1989–2018) under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Annual mean maximum temperature and potential evapotranspiration experienced a significant decreasing trend during the year from 1989 to 2018. Furthermore, there was an increasing trend in annual rainfall from 1989 to 2018, which could be related to the cooling of sea surface temperature over the equatorial Pacific. We detect an increasing trend in temperature in both scenarios and all periods; however, no clear trend pattern is found in rainfall. The result from hydrological model simulations reveals that the mean monthly streamflow slightly increases in the winter season while it decreases during the main rainy season. Further study of detailed weather systems, which affect the subbasin’s climate, is recommended.",

This study analyzes the spatiotemporal variability of climate on rainfall distribution for the Hare catchment of Ethiopia. Numerous hydroclimatic variables and scenarios were developed to assess the pattern of rainfall during different seasons. The average annual precipitation varies between −37.3%, +33.1%, and −38.2%, +61.2%, for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. The anticipated declines in mean seasonal rainfall changes for the Bega and Belg seasons range from −69.6% to 88.4% and from −60.6% to 15.2% for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. Climate models predict that the average periodic precipitation considered for the Kiremt season will vary from −12.1% to 1.33%. The Belg, Kiremt, and Bega seasons will likely see a 28.2%, 12.2%, and 22.6% drop in mean seasonal precipitation, respectively. The decrease in stream flow accompanied by the aforementioned climate scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) can be as high as 19.6% and 6.7%, respectively. Also, the amount of discharge will reduce in the near future because of a substantial reduction in rainfall and a rise in evapotranspiration in the catchment. This decline in stream flow has its own effect on the future availability of water resources. The research finding is vital to environmental protection authority, decision makers, and scientific community to undertake climate change adaption techniques for rain scare areas. A program combined with multi-RCMs to evaluate climate change effects on hydrometeorology generated a novel approach to this research with appropriate adaptation mechanisms.",

Since a few years, the number of ceilometers available worldwide is rapidly increasing, and these simple backscatter lidars are investigated to be used for aerosol research. This study presents an assessment of the potential of CYY-2B ceilometer for the quantitative retrieval of aerosol properties. The signal-to-noise ratio of the ceilometer is calculated, and the effective height of inversion is determined. It is shown that the effective height of the ceilometer for backscatter coefficient profile inversion is 3-4 km at night and about 1.5–2 km during the day, which is lower than that of the micropulse lidar (MPL) system. The accuracy of the backscatter coefficient profiles derived from the CYY-2B ceilometer is analyzed by using the Vaisala CL51 ceilometer, MPL, forward scatter visibility instrument, and aerosol optical depth (AOD) dataset from aerosol robotic network (AERONET). Spectral conversions of the ceilometer’s and lidar’s data are performed using the Ångström exponent estimated by AERONET measurements. A good agreement is found between two ceilometers and the MPL lidar in backscatter coefficient profiles inversion. The AODs agree well with the AERONET AODs during the observation period of small AODs. However, for the period of large AODs, the results are approximately 50%–60% of AERONET AODs. The limited range of extinction integration is the main cause of this problem.",

This study assesses the high-resolution deterministic model ALADIN-CZ (Aire Limitée, Adaptation Dynamique, Development International–Czech Republic) and the ensemble model ALADIN-LAEF (Limited Area Ensemble Forecasting). Verified precipitation data were modified to the form in which they enter the hydrological model used for flood forecasting in the Czech Republic. ALADIN-LAEF, unlike ALADIN-CZ, is currently not considered to be of any value for hydrological predictions in the Czech Republic. In the present paper, we assess the added value of the ensemble model. The most significant rainfall events from the summer seasons during 2011–2015 were selected for the purpose of this study. The results show that ALADIN-LAEF does not have a lower success rate than ALADIN-CZ in predicting significant rainfall events. In fact, for the most verification scores and metrics, ALADIN-LAEF was assessed as more skilful. Surprisingly, the high-resolution ALADIN-CZ does not yield higher success rates than ALADIN-LAEF even at short prediction lead times. This is due to spatial aggregation into hydrological regions, with an area significantly larger than the resolution of the forecasting models. Furthermore, the relationship between synoptic weather types, hydrological regions, and predictability was considered. It was found that the worst prediction results are related to weather situation C (cyclone over central Europe), which dominantly affects Berounka and Lower Elbe catchments.",

Different from classical features extracted in the Euclidean space, the SPD matrix fuses multiple features and represents non-Euclidean geometric characteristics. MKSCDL is composed of three steps: feature extraction, dictionary learning, and classification. With the learned dictionary, the SPD matrix of the cloud image can be described with the sparse code. The experiments are conducted on two different ground-based cloud image datasets. Benefitting from the sparse representation on the Riemannian matrix manifold, compared to the recent baselines, experimental results demonstrate that MKSCDL possesses a more competitive performance on both grayscale and colour image datasets.",

Two techniques of flux partitioning are applied to evaluate ecosystem respiration, thoroughly evaluate the validity of the estimated fluxes, and arrive at an estimate of the yearly net ecosystem exchange (NEE).

The results show that the annual precipitation and <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math> increased from the northwest to the southeast of the HLR, suggesting it was drier in the northwest region of the HLR. <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>25</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math> and <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>50</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math> were mainly concentrated in the northwestern and southwestern parts of the HLR, reflecting that heavy rain was more likely to occur in these regions of the HLR. All of the annual precipitation and different classes of precipitation had no significant changing trends from 1966 to 2016, and the relationship between rainfall and sediment yield obviously changed in 2006. Compared with the average annual mean values from 1966 to 2016, both the annual precipitation and the different classes of precipitation were higher in the HLR during 2007–2016. The sediment yield decrease during 1990–1999 was mainly influenced by precipitation, while other factors were the main driving factor for the sediment yield decrease in the periods of 1980–1989, 2000–2009, and 2010–2016, and other factors have become the dominant driving factors of the sediment yield change in the HLR since 2000.",

    "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is a significant component in the water cycle, and the estimation of it is imperative in water resource management. Regional ET can be derived by using remote sensing technology which combines remote sensing inputs with ground-based measurements. However, instantaneous ET values estimated through remote sensing directly need to be converted into daily totals. In this study, we attempted to retrieve daily ET from remotely sensed instantaneous ET. The study found that the Gaussian fitting curve closely followed the ET measurements during the daytime and hence put forward the Gaussian fitting method to convert the remotely sensed instantaneous ET into daily ETs. The method was applied to the middle reaches of Heihe River in China. Daily ETs on four days were derived and evaluated with ET measurements from the eddy covariance (EC) system. The correlation between daily ET estimates and measurements showed high accuracy, with a coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) of 0.82, a mean average error (MAE) of 0.41 mm, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.46 mm. To make more scientific assessments, percent errors were calculated on the estimation accuracy, which ranged from 0% to 18%, with more than 80% of locations having the percent errors within 10%. Analyses on the relationship between daily ET estimates and land use status were also made to assess the Gaussian fitting method, and the results showed that the spatial distribution of daily ET estimates well demonstrated ET differences caused by land use types and was intimately linked with the vegetation pattern. The comparison between the Gaussian fitting method and the sine function method and the ETrF method indicated that results derived through the Gaussian fitting method had higher precision than that obtained by the sine function method and the ETrF method.",

    "abstract": "The focus of the current paper is to explore the influence of meteorological variables on atmospheric CO 2 and CH 4 mean annual cycles at a rural site. Four variables were investigated: boundary layer height, recirculation factor, trajectory direction, and wind speed modelled at the altitude of the site. Boundary layer height and wind speed were provided by the METeorological data EXplorer (METEX) model. Recirculation factor and trajectory direction were obtained from calculations based on this trajectory model, and a nonparametric procedure was used to obtain a smooth evolution. The main results are higher concentrations obtained during the night, attributed to lower dispersion in this period. The smoothed values of the boundary layer height reached nearly 1200 m AGL during the day in August, and its low values caused high concentrations in spring. During the night, the recirculation factor and wind speed showed a sharp contrast between summer and winter. The average recirculation factor was low, 0.10, and average wind speed was 5.1 m·s −1 . Trajectories were directionally distributed in four quadrants. Different tests were performed by selecting values of meteorological variables above or below certain thresholds. The influence of these variables reached values around 6.3 and 0.023 ppm for CO 2 and CH 4 average concentrations, respectively, during the day when the boundary layer was below 400 m. The main conclusion of this study is that the influence of meteorological variables should not be ignored. In particular, extremely low boundary layer heights may have noticeable effects on both gases.",

Thus, in this work, we comprehensively investigated 71 meteorological stations in Northeast China from 1965 to 2017 to analyze the spatial-temporal variation and trend of ET 0 and AI using the nonparametric Mann–Kendall test, the linear regression, and the Morlet wavelet methods. The results elucidated that ET 0 for Northeast China as a whole exhibited a decrease at a rate of −1.97 mm/yr, AI declined at a rate of −0.01/yr during 1965–2017, and approximately 94% stations showed a decrease trend. Spatially, the high values of AI and ET 0 were primarily at the western part of the study area except for the Heilongjiang province, and the stations showing low values were mainly distributed in the central and eastern part. The decreasing trends for AI were more obvious in the eastern part compared with the western part over the study region. The abrupt changes in AI occurred in 2005 and 2007, whereas only one abrupt change for ET 0 occurred in 1995. For annual ET 0 , there were periods of 3, 7, 11, and 15 yr, and there existed periods of 1, 7, 11, and 13 yr for annual AI. The correlation coefficients implied wind speed and precipitation were the dominant meteorological factors resulting in the ET 0 and AI decrease, respectively. Additionally, the change of the Indian summer monsoon index (ISMI) may also contribute to the weakened AI in the study area. Nevertheless, further investigation is still required to clarify the mechanisms for AI and ET 0 variations in the future.",

    "abstract": "Eleven tropical cyclones that landed in Guangdong Province since 2012 and experienced strengthening or weakening over the offshore area were studied. Since the structure of the tropical cyclone boundary layer significantly influences the variation of the intensity of the cyclone, continuous observations of the wind profile radar at a coastal radar station in Guangdong Province were combined with aircraft observation data of the No. 1604 “Nida” cyclone to analyse the variations in the distributions of the radial wind, tangential wind, and angular momentum in the typhoon boundary layer and the similarities and differences between the boundary layers of the 11 tropical cyclones during the strengthening or weakening of their intensities. The analysis results show that the presence of the supergradient wind and the enhancement effect of the radial inflow play important roles in enhancing the intensity of a tropical cyclone. The observations indicate that when the tangential wind velocity in the maximum wind velocity radius reaches the velocity of the supergradient wind and when the radial inflow either gradually increases towards the centre of the tropical cyclone or gradually covers the entire boundary layer, the angular momentum tends to be shifted towards the centre. At this time, the maximum radial inflow, maximum tangential wind, and maximum angular momentum are in the same height range in the vertical direction. When a strong radial outflow occurs in the boundary layer of a tropical cyclone or the area with maximum wind velocity is located in the air outflow, the angular momentum cannot easily be transported towards the centre of the typhoon. Therefore, the spatial configuration of the three physical quantities will determine future changes in the intensity of tropical cyclones. The scope of the results presented here is limited to the 11 selected cases and suggests extending the analysis to more data.",

This study attempts to evaluate the performances of five microphysics schemes (MPSs) in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in simulating the supertyphoon Neoguri in July 2014. The observed microwave brightness temperature, as well as retrieved data from the microwave radiometer imager (MWRI) onboard Chinese FY-3B satellite, are used to test hydrometeor simulations. In particular, two MWRI radiance indices, including the emission index (EI) and scattering index (SI), are used to assess the performance of five MPSs in simulating liquid and frozen hydrometeors, respectively. Overall, the WRF model can well reproduce the overall pattern of typhoon-produced precipitation, albeit with slightly overestimated precipitation in the inner rainband and underestimated precipitation in the stratiform rainband. Moreover, ice water paths (IWPs) from all five MPS simulations are higher than those estimated from MWRI retrieval in most areas, and the spatial pattern and values of IWP for the National Severe Storms Laboratory double-moment MPS (NSSL) are much closer to those for MWRI. The NSSL scheme reproduces a more realistic joint histogram distribution of SI and EI than other MPSs do, relative to the observation. Besides, the nonlinear Lucas – Kanade optical flow approach has been used to reflect the horizontal distribution of hydrometeors in the typhoon. The results show that the simulated EI and SI from the five MPSs show a systematic southwest bias of approximately about 10∼20 km and significant intensity bias in the convection area. Further model sensitivity tests confirm that the NSSL scheme generates more realistic graupel and supercooled water close to the observations among all MPSs. The findings suggest that satellite measurements would be helpful to assess MPSs in numeric weather models, especially for hydrometeor distributions in the whole typhoon system.",

    "abstract": "An accurate estimation of terrestrial evapotranspiration over heterogeneous surfaces using satellite imagery and few meteorological observations remains a challenging task. Wind speed ( u ), which is known to exhibit high temporal-spatial variation, is a significant constraint in the abovementioned task. In this study, a wind speed-independent two-source energy balance (WiTSEB) model is proposed on the basis of a theoretical land surface temperature ( T r )-fractional vegetation coverage ( f c ) trapezoidal space and a two-stage evapotranspiration decomposing method. The temperatures in theoretically driest boundaries of the T r - f c trapezoid are iteratively calculated without u by using an assumption of the absence of sensible heat exchange between water-saturated surface and atmosphere in the vertical direction under the given atmospheric condition. The WiTSEB was conducted in HiWATER-MUSOEXE-12 in the middle reaches of the Heihe watershed across eight landscapes by using ASTER images. Results indicate that WiTSEB provides reliable estimates in latent heat flux (LE), with root-mean-square-errors (RMSE) and coefficient of determination of 68.6 W m −2 and 0.88, respectively. The RMSE of the ratio of the vegetation transpiration component to LE is 5.7%. Sensitivity analysis indicates WiTSEB does not aggravate the sensitivity on meteorological and remote sensing inputs in comparison with other two-source models. The errors of estimated T r and observed soil heat flux result in LE overestimation/underestimation over parts of landscapes. The two-stage evapotranspiration decomposing method is carefully verified by ground observation.",

    "abstract": "The use of remotely sensed evapotranspiration (ET) for field applications in drought monitoring and assessment is gaining momentum, but meeting this need has been hampered by the absence of extensive ground-based measurement stations for ground validation across agricultural zones and natural landscapes. This is particularly crucial for regions more prone to recurring droughts with limited ground monitoring stations. A three-year (2016–2018) flux ET dataset from a pastureland in north central Kentucky was used to validate the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model at monthly and annual scales. Flux and SSEBop ET track each other in a consistent manner in response to seasonal changes. The mean bias error (MBE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) were 5.47, 21.49 mm mon −1 , 30.94%, and 0.87, respectively. The model consistently underestimated ET values during winter months and overestimated them during summer months. SSEBop’s monthly ET anomaly maps show spatial ET distribution and its accurate representation. This is particularly important in areas where detailed surface meteorological and hydrological data are limited. Overall, the model estimated monthly ET magnitude satisfactorily and captured it seasonally. The SSEBop’s functionality for remote ET estimation and anomaly detection, if properly coupled with ground measurements, can significantly enhance SSEBop’s ability to monitor drought occurrence and prevalence quickly and accurately.",

The Mann–Kendall (MK), Sen’s slope test estimator, and innovative trend detection ( ф ) (ITA) methods were used to detect the trends. According to the findings, average annual precipitation shows a descending trend ( ф = −0.17) in most stations. An increasing trend was found only in Fuyang station ( ф = 1.02). In all stations, the trends of mean annual temperature ( ф = 0.36) were abruptly increased. During the past 57 years, the mean air temperature has considerably increased by 12°C/10a. The river streamflow showed a dramatic declining trend in all stations for the duration of the study period (1960–2016) ( ф = −4.29). The climate variability in the study region affects the quantity of the streamflow. The river streamflow exhibits decreasing trends from 1965 onwards. The main possible reason for the declining stream flow in the study area is the declining amount of precipitation on some specific months due to the occurrence of climate change. The outcomes of this study could create awareness for the policymakers and members of the scientific community, informing them about the hydroclimatic evolutions across the study basin, and become an inordinate resource for advanced scientific research.",

Between 2013 and 2017, the average winter visibility in Xinjin Airport was lowest in January, followed by that in December. The occurrence frequency of haze days in winter was much higher than that of nonhaze (clean) days, being 90.2% and 9.8%, respectively. These were mainly mild haze days, with an occurrence frequency of 44.4%, while severe haze days occurred the least, with a frequency of 7.7%. The linear and nonlinear relationships between winter visibility, meteorological factors, and PM2.5 were measured using daily data in winter from 2013 to 2016. The linear correlation between PM2.5 concentration and visibility was the most evident, followed by that of relative humidity. Visibility had a higher nonlinear correlation with PM2.5 concentration, relative humidity, and dew point depression. When relative humidity was between 70% and 80%, the negative correlation between visibility and PM2.5 concentration was the most significant and could be described by a power function. The multivariate linear regression equation of PM2.5 concentration and relative humidity could account for 65.9% of the variation in winter visibility, and the multivariate nonlinear regression equation of PM2.5 concentration, relative humidity, and wind speed could account for 68.1% of the variation in winter visibility. These two equations reasonably represented the variation in winter visibility in 2017.",

The model initial and boundary conditions are from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Final Analyses (FNL). Observation data for two years at 20 m height at Bac Lieu station were used for model bias correction and investigating diurnal and annual variation of wind speeds. The results show that the WRF model overestimates wind speeds. After bias correction, the model reasonably well simulates wind speeds over the research area. Wind speed and wind power density show much higher values at levels of 50–200 m above ground levels than near ground (20 m) level and significantly higher near the coastal regions than inland. Wind speed has significant annual and diurnal cycles. Both annual and diurnal cycles of wind speeds were well simulated by the model. Wind speed is much stronger during daytime than at nighttime. Low-level wind speed reaches the maximum at about 14 LT to 15 LT when the vertical momentum mixing is highly active. Wind speeds over the eastern coastal region of Southern Vietnam are much stronger in winter than in summer due to two main reasons, including (1) stronger large-scale wind speed in winter than in summer and (2) funnel effect creating a local maximum wind speed over the nearshore ocean which then transports high-momentum air inland in winter.",

    "abstract": "Climate change inevitably leads to changes in hydrothermal circulation. However, thermal-hydrologic exchanging caused by land cover change has also undergone ineligible changes. Therefore, studying the comprehensive effects of climate and land cover changes on land surface water and heat exchanges enables us to well understand the formation mechanism of regional climate and predict climate change with fewer uncertainties. This study investigated the land surface thermal-hydrologic exchange across southern China for the next 40 years using a land surface model (ecosystem-atmosphere simulation scheme (EASS)). Our findings are summarized as follows. (i) Spatiotemporal variation patterns of sensible heat flux ( H ) and evapotranspiration (ET) under the land cover scenarios (A2a or B2a) and climate change scenario (A1B) are unanimous. (ii) Both H and ET take on a single peak pattern, and the peak occurs in June or July. (iii) Based on the regional interannual variability analysis, H displays a downward trend (10%) and ET presents an increasing trend (15%). (iv) The annual average H and ET would, respectively, increase and decrease by about 10% when woodland converts to the cultivated land. Through this study, we recognize that land surface water and heat exchanges are affected greatly by the future climate change as well as land cover change.",

In addition, the weather also had impacts on the potential evapotranspiration. In April, July, and October, the change of potential evapotranspiration of the Robinia pseudoacacia forests showed a bimodal curve in the sunny days and rainy days, while it showed a single-peak curve with quite small fluctuation in the rainy days. However, it showed a single-peak pattern even in the sunny days in January, and it showed no fluctuation in the snowy days in January.",

This paper aimed to model the potential climatological variability caused by future forest vulnerability in the Brazilian Amazon over the 21th century. The underlying land surface changes between 2005 and 2100 are first projected based on the respectable output produced by Hurtt et al. Then the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model is applied to assess the impacts of future deforestation on regional climate during 2090–2100. The study results show that the forests in the Brazilian Amazon will primarily be converted into dryland cropland and pasture in the northwest part and into cropland/woodland mosaic in the southeast part, with 5.12% and 13.11%, respectively. These land surface changes will therefore lead to the significant reduction of the sum of sensible heat flux and latent heat flux and precipitation and the increase of the surface temperature. Furthermore, the variability of surface temperature is observed with close link to the deforested areas.",

Fortunately, thermodynamic retrieval techniques traditionally applied to dual-Doppler wind analyses can be adapted to diagnose the balanced portion of an EnKF pressure analysis, thereby eliminating the fast-mode pressure oscillations. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated using a high-resolution supercell thunderstorm simulation as well as EnKF analyses of a simulated and a real supercell.",

Daily spatiotemporal means are in good agreement with previous short-term field campaigns and also corroborate hypothesis and conclusions reached from previous mesoscale modelling studies: (a) from a meteorological point of view, Mediterranean Basin should be considered as two different subbasins (the Western and the Eastern Mediterranean); (b) accumulation processes may affect the radiative balance at regional scale and the summer precipitation regimes. Furthermore, these satellite observations constitute strong empirical evidences that, (a) from late May to early October, contrary to what happens in the Eastern Mediterranean Basin (EMB), there is a net accumulation of TPW on the Western Mediterranean Basin (WMB) that favours the instability of the atmosphere, (b) there is a seasonal anticorrelation between the seasonal variability of the TPW column over the two Mediterranean subbasins, (c) solar radiation can not be the only driver for the annual variability of the TPW column over the Mediterranean Sea, and (d) both previous features are seasonally dependent and, therefore, their effects on the TPW column are attenuated by annual variability.",

The results show that, the response of temperature under SP onset involves a significant positive anomaly, with a symmetric distribution about the equator over the Indian Ocean region in the lower troposphere (850 hPa) and a negative anomaly in the lower stratosphere (50 hPa). Meanwhile, in the area 30°N and 30°S of the equator, most parts of the lower stratosphere feature a positive anomaly. This indicates that SP El Niño events are more conducive than SU events to warming the lower stratosphere. The atmospheric circulation structure over the tropical Indian Ocean is beneficial to the upward transfer of warm air to the upper layer. In contrast, the structure over the tropical Pacific Ocean favors the warming of upper air. On the other hand, the Eliassen–Palm (EP) flux is small and the heat flux is negative during SP-type events. Thus, the EP flux and Brewer–Dobson circulation decrease, making the temperature higher in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere region at low latitudes.",

In the northern and coastal cities of Jiangsu Province China, haze days showed a significant increase. Haze often appeared in fall and winter and rarely in summer in the study area. It also occurred more often inland, and less along the coast. Haze occurred more often in June due to straw burning in the harvest time. The haze day increased during the 1990s over southern and southwestern Jiangsu Province; in central and northern Jiangsu, haze day increased after 2000. The continuous, regional, and regional continuous haze days all showed increasing trends. As the urban area expanded each year, industrial emissions, coal consumption, and car ownership increased accordingly, resulting in regional temperature increase and relative humidity decrease, which formed the urban heat island and dry island effects. Hence, haze formation and maintenance conditions became more favorable for more haze days, which led to the increase of haze days, and the significant increases of continuous, regional, and regional continuous haze days.",

    "abstract": "Extracting multiple-scale observational information is critical for accurately reconstructing the structure of mesoscale circulation systems such as typhoon. The Space and Time Mesoscale Analysis System (STMAS) with multigrid data assimilation developed in Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL) in National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has addressed this issue. Previous studies have shown the capability of STMAS to retrieve multiscale information in 2-dimensional Doppler radar radial velocity observations. This study explores the application of 3-dimensional (3D) Doppler radar radial velocities with STMAS for reconstructing a 3D typhoon structure. As for the first step, here, we use an idealized simulation framework. A two-scale simulated “typhoon” field is constructed and referred to as “truth,” from which randomly distributed conventional wind data and 3D Doppler radar radial wind data are generated. These data are used to reconstruct the synthetic 3D “typhoon” structure by the STMAS and the traditional 3D variational (3D-Var) analysis. The degree by which the “truth” 3D typhoon structure is recovered is an assessment of the impact of the data type or analysis scheme being evaluated. We also examine the effects of weak constraint and strong constraint on STMAS analyses. Results show that while the STMAS is superior to the traditional 3D-Var for reconstructing the 3D typhoon structure, the strong constraint STMAS can produce better analyses on both horizontal and vertical velocities.",

This paper presents a comprehensive case study of the cumulative evolution of several characteristic quantities during one extremely severe convective weather process. The research results indicate that the main feature of strong convective weather is the uneven distribution of thermal energy in the atmosphere, and the structure of this heat distribution determines the level of instability in the atmosphere. A vertical “clockwise rolling current” occurs in the wind field structure at the beginning of the process, and this is accompanied by a rapid drop in temperature at the top of the troposphere. When these signs occurred in the case study, radar technology was used to refine the precipitation region and spatial characteristics of the approaching storm. The height and vertical evolution of radar echoes were indicative of the characteristics of the system’s movement through space. Such findings may be useful for improving the forecasting times for strong convective weather.",

Similar to the IAU, the NIAU is designed to add analysis increments at every model time step to improve the continuity in the intermittent data assimilation. However, unlike the IAU, the NIAU procedure uses time-evolved forcing using the forward operator as corrections to the model. The solution of the NIAU is superior to that of the forward IAU, of which analysis is performed at the beginning of the time window for adding the IAU forcing, in terms of the accuracy of the analysis field. It is because, in the linear systems, the NIAU solution equals that in an intermittent data assimilation method at the end of the assimilation interval. To have the filtering property in the NIAU, a forward operator to propagate the increment is reconstructed with only dominant singular vectors. An illustration of those advantages of the NIAU is given using the simple 40-variable Lorenz model.",

A case study of TC Fung-Wong which landed China in 2008 shows that Barnes filter not only cleanly removes these perturbations, but also well preserves the TC signals. Meanwhile, the centers (track) obtained from SLP processed with Barnes filter are much closer to the observations than that from SLP without Barnes filter. Based on the distance difference (DD) between the TC center determined by SLP with/without Barnes filter and observation, statistics analysis of 12 TCs which landed China during 2005–2015 shows that in most cases (about 85%) the DDs are small (between −30 km and 30 km), while in a few cases (about 15%) the DDs are large (greater than 30 km even 70 km). This further verifies that the TC centers identified from SLP with Barnes filter are more accurate compared to that directly obtained from model output SLP. Moreover, the TC track identified with Barnes filter is much smoother than that without Barnes filter.",

The exact analytical solution of the 3D VCKdV equation is obtained successfully by making use of CK’s direct method and the standard Zakharov–Kuznetsov equation. By some arbitrary functions and the analytical solution, a dipole blocking evolution process with twelve days’ lifetime is described, and the result illustrates that the central axis of the dipole is no longer perpendicular to the vertical direction but has a certain angle to vertical direction.

Simulated flow over midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere was assessed through flow indices, classified into 11 circulation types. Reference data were taken from the NOAA-CIRES 20th Century Reanalysis, version 2c. CNRM-CM5.1 exhibited analogous temperature biases to those reported for the mean of the CMIP5 GCMs’ ensemble. The most prominent features were an erroneous temperature dipole pattern in the Atlantic Ocean and a warm bias over regions of deep water upwelling (locally exceeding 5°C). The latter feature was associated with negative SLP biases in those regions. Too low pressure was found over midlatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, and CNRM-CM5.1 simulated too frequent zonal flow in these latitudes. The usage of three ensemble members with different initial conditions did not improve model’s outputs because the bias is found to be considerably larger compared to the ensemble members’ spread. The study showed that temperature and SLP biases are connected in certain regions, suggesting that improvement of GCMs and development of bias correction methods should be carried out with a complex insight.",

Evaluation indicates that WRF-Chem captured the main weather conditions and pollutant distribution in this event. The primary meteorological drivers of air pollution formation were stationary atmospheric flows in both vertical and horizontal directions. High relative humidity and a strong temperature inversion accelerated event formation. In the shallow temperature inversion layer, aerosol particles were strongly confined near the surface, producing high surface contaminant concentrations. In addition, based on a normal experiment, three sensitivity experiments were constructed by adding hypothetical terrain (HT) of 400, 300, and 200 meters, over the region 115°E, 38.8°N to 117.54°E, 38.8°N. The results indicate that pollutants were diffused and transported below 400 meters, and the pollutant amounts concentrated south of the HT because of the HT blocking effect. Nevertheless, because there were less total contaminants north of the HT in the normal run, there was a slight decrease in pollutants north of the HT. There were some increases in pollution north of the HT because of local emissions, which were obstructed by the HT. The higher the HT, the stronger the blocking effect.",

Four simulation tests of twelve years’ duration were conducted with various schemes of water consumption by residents, industries, and agriculture. The results indicate that water exploitation and consumption in the Haihe Plain causes wetting and cooling of the local land surface and rapid increases in the depth of the groundwater table. These wetting and cooling effects increase atmospheric moisture, which is transported to surrounding areas, including the Taihang Mountains to the west. In a simulation where water consumption in the Haihe Plain was doubled, the wetting and cooling effects in the Taihang Mountains were enhanced but at less than double the amount, because a cooler land surface does not enhance atmospheric convective activities. The impacts of water consumption activities in the Haihe Plain were more obvious during the irrigation seasons (primarily spring and summer). In addition, the land surface variables in the Taihang Mountains, e.g., sensible and latent heat fluxes, were less sensitive to the climatic impacts due to the water consumption activities in the Haihe Plain because they were strongly affected by local surface energy balance.",

The rural region LST change rates, which exhibited significant changes, were generally highest in the summer, with most of values of 0.1–0.5°C (yr −1 ) during the daytime across China, except for the Xinjiang autonomous regions, and 0.1–0.2°C (yr −1 ) during the night-time.

The spatiotemporal development of MCSs in terms of the initiation, maturation, dissipation, duration, and movement was statistically analyzed. Most mesoscale systems in the area were dominated by meso- β convective systems (M β CSs), which was in line with the annual heavy precipitation frequency. In meso- α convective systems (M α CSs), persistent elongated convective systems (PECSs) occurred more commonly than mesoscale convective complexes (MCCs). MCSs were common in summer, with the peak frequency of M α CS occurrence in June and the peak frequency of M β CS occurrence mainly in July and August. From the perspective of diurnal variations, MCSs initiated in the late afternoon, developed during the evening, and dissipated before midnight. MCSs in general lasted 6∼9 h between June and July and 9∼11 h in August. The M α CSs lasted approximately 14 h, and the M β CSs lasted from 7 h to 12 h. The development and termination stages of MCSs lasted 3∼6 h and 2∼7 h, respectively. In low-elevation areas and on the windward slope of the mountains, MCSs initiated more easily and more frequently over the northern and western slopes than that over the southern and eastern slopes. The central area of the Junggar basin hosted the development of MCSs, but the distribution of the convective systems at different scales varied. During the termination stage, these mesoscale systems were mainly located at the basin edges. In terms of tracks, most MCSs moved eastward under the influence of the westerlies and the M α CSs moved faster but in a more scattered manner than the M β CSs. Additionally, some unusual tracks appeared because of the effects of the underlying surface topography and environmental wind.",

These machine learning tools range from classical statistical methods to contemporary successful and powerful methods such as kernels and neural networks.

The variables to be calibrated are the 2-meter temperature, the 10-meter wind speed, and the precipitation in 24 hours. Classical statistical methods perform very well with the temperature and the wind speed; the precipitation is a subtler case: it seems there is not a general rule, and for each point, a decision has to be taken of what method (if any) improves the direct output of the model, but even recognizing this, a slight improvement can be shown with ML methods for the precipitation.",

First, we used the locally constrained fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering method to identify typhoon-dominant cloud systems. Second, we coupled the background field-constrained optical flow method with the semi-Lagrangian scheme to forecast typhoon-dominant cloud systems. The experimental results for Typhoon Maria showed that the improved FCM method was able to effectively identify changes in the cloud system while retaining its edge information through the effective removal of the offset field. The identified dominant cloud system was consistent with the precipitation field of the Global Precipitation Measurement mission. We optimized the semi-Lagrangian nonlinear extrapolation of the optical flow field by introducing background field information, thus improving the forecast accuracy of the optical flow field. Based on the assessment indicators of structural similarity, normalized mutual information, peak signal-to-noise ratio, relative standard deviation, and root mean square error, the forecast results demonstrated that the forecast effect of the background field-constrained optical flow method was better than that of the standard optical flow method.",

    "abstract": "Cloud vertical structures over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and Eastern China Plains (ECP) were analyzed by using data in rainy seasons from 2006 to 2009, in order to clarify the cloud development over adjacent regions but with distinct topographies. Results indicate that the largest occurrences of cloud top height over the TP are at 7-8 km above mean sea level, which is about 4 km lower than that over the ECP. Mixed-phase clouds dominated more than 30% over the TP, while it is lower than 10% over the ECP. The infrequent mixed-phase clouds over the ECP are attributed to the unique dynamic and moisture situations over the downstream areas of the TP. Ice clouds have similar occurrences over the two regions. The prominent distinctions are manifested by the probability density of cloud thickness. The probability density of cloud thickness around 4–8 km is about 2% higher over the TP than the ECP. However, there is almost no ice cloud thicker than 10 km over the TP, while it is about 1% over the ECP. Compared with those over the ECP, every cloud layer within multilayered clouds is generally higher and thinner over the TP, which is closely related to the elevated surface and the resulting thinner troposphere. The significant differences in cloud vertical structures between the TP and the ECP present in this study emphasize that topographical characteristics and the resulting moisture and circulation conditions have strong impacts on the cloud vertical structures.",

    "abstract": "As a tipping bucket rain gauge, the HOBO Data Logging Rain Gauge RG3-M (RG3-M) has been widely used for the field precipitation observation owing to its superiority of independent power supply by a small portable battery. To quantify the measurement accuracy of the RG3-M gauge, a standard Manual Gauge (MG) and eight other models of tipping bucket rain gauges were installed at the Chuzhou hydrological experiment station of China. In this study, we first compared and investigated the accumulated mounts of 18 rainfall events of two RG3-M gauges benchmarked by the standard MG. Then, five typical rainfall events were chosen to further analyse the observed accuracy of the RG3-M gauge for different rainfall intensities at hourly temporal scale. Finally, the impacts of wind speed and rainfall intensity on the precipitation measurements of the RG3-M gauge were preliminarily explored. Results indicate that the RG3-M gauge measurement generally underestimates rainfall approximately −4% against the standard MG observation, but the maximum deviation even reaches −12.87%. In terms of the hourly rainfall process, the reliable measurement scope of the RG3-M gauge is ranging from 1.5 to 3 mm/h; however, it should be noted that the underestimation is rather significant at the higher rainfall rates (&gt;6 mm/h). Last, it was found that rainfall intensity is a nonnegligible factor for influencing the measurement of the RG3-M gauge. But the windy effect seems to be insignificant in our experiments, which might be attributed to the similar exposure of the compared gauges.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies indicate that the summer (July-August) rainfall over North China has decreased since the mid-1970s due to the weakening of East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). However, this study firstly discovers the new evidences that the summer rainfall over North China had a significant increasing tendency during 1979–1996; since 1997, this increasing tendency has halted while more summer droughts occurred over North China. One important cause for the halted increasing tendency over North China is the interdecadal decrease of the westerly water vapor transport during 1997–2016 in addition to the weakened EASM. The decrease of the westerly water vapor transport during 1997–2016 was due to the interdecadal warming over Lake Baikal. The interdecadal warming in the upper troposphere at 200 hPa forced the weakening of the upper-level zonal winds since 1997, which resulted in the anomalous descending flow over the north side of North China and the halted precipitation trend in North China.",

The results showed that the T mean (daily mean air temperature), T max (daily maximum air temperature), and T min (daily minimum air temperature) all had increased significantly over the past 62 years, whilst RH (relative humidity), U 2 (wind speed at 2 m height), and SD (sunshine duration) had significantly decreasing trends across all climatic zones. At monthly scale, the ET 0 was mainly concentrated from April to September. And at annual and seasonal scales, the overall increasing trends were more pronounced in NX, NYR, and SMA, while CAZ was the opposite. For the spatial distribution, ET 0 presented a trend of rising first and then falling at all time scales. The abrupt change point for climatic factors and ET 0 series was obtained at approximately 1990 across all climatic zones, and the ET 0 had a long period of 25a and a short period of 10a at annual scale, while it was 15a and 5a at seasonal scale. RH and T max were the most sensitive climatic factors at the annual and seasonal scales, while the largest contribution rates were T max and SD. This study not only is important for the understanding of ET 0 changes but also provides the preliminary and elementary reference for agriculture water management in Ningxia.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we explore the possible mechanism of opposite ENSO effects on summer rainfall in the JJAS region (northern GHA) and autumn rainfall in the OND region (equatorial GHA). The two regions are identified based on the spatial distribution of high seasonal fractions of annual rainfall for the period 1979–2016. The summer rainfall over the JJAS region is negatively correlated with ENSO. It is because the warm Niño3.4 SST triggers zonal wave one pattern in tropics and forces upper-level westerly anomaly and the low-level easterly anomaly over tropical Africa. Thus, the weakened upper-level Tropical Easterly Jet (TEJ) and the low-level westerly over the JJAS region result in deficient rainfall during JJAS over the northern GHA. For the autumn rainfall variability over the equatorial GHA, IOD is a pivotal factor. But, autumn rainfall anomalies are far greater in ENSO and IOD coexisting years than those in IOD alone years. In other words, ENSO has a significant impact on the autumn rainfall over the equatorial GHA by means of IOD. It is because the warming SST, which is fully developed over western Indian Ocean (IO) in autumn of ENSO developing year, causes low-level convergence over the equatorial GHA and enhances upper-level easterly over tropical Africa. Those conditions are favorable for abundant rainfall over the equatorial GHA in autumn.",

Based on the Precipitation Reconstruction dataset in East China from 1950 to 2017, we investigate the spatiotemporal variations of summer precipitation, influencing environmental factors and their relation with the EASM and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in both central Pacific (CP) El Niño developing and decaying years. Results indicate the following: (1) The evolutions of CP El Niño events modulate the summer precipitation anomalies in East China. In the cool PDO phase, CP El Niño causes enhanced precipitation anomalies in the decaying years but less precipitation anomalies in the developing years, and vice versa for the warm PDO phase. (2) Atmospheric circulation anomalies drive the moisture transportation and combine the motion of western Pacific subtropical high resulting in the variation of precipitation patterns. Anomalous cyclone over the western North Pacific and the sustained Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) are favorable for the increment of summer precipitation. (3) The different CP El Niño-EASM relationship is caused by the influences of PDO on the evolution of CP El Niño. CP El Niño develops slowly (decays rapidly) and is associated with rapidly developing (slowly decaying) anomalous warming in the north Indian Ocean during the developing (decaying) years.",

Statistically significant relationships between these high-resolution (10 km) temperature indices and seven influential Northern Hemisphere teleconnection patterns (NHTPs) for the interannual climate variability were also identified. During the study period (1961–2011), warming trends in extreme temperatures were generally manifested by statistically significant increases in cold temperature extremes rather than in the warm temperature extremes. As expected, warm days and nights became more frequent, while fewer cold days and nights occurred. The frequency of frost and icing days also decreased. Finland experienced more (less) frequent warm (cold) temperature extremes over the past few decades. Significant lengthening in warm spells was observed in Finland during 1961–2011, while no clear changes are found in cold spells. Interannual variations in the temperature indices were significantly associated with a number of NHTPs. In general, warm temperature extremes show significant correlations with the East Atlantic and the Scandinavia patterns and cold temperature extremes with the Arctic Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation patterns.",

However, it is not known whether surface-flow constructed wetlands can effectively purify irrigation return water. To investigate the performance of a constructed wetland in terms of meeting the goals of pollutant purification, the 8th drainage of Ulansuhai Lake was used for this study. Pollutant removal performances, as well as hydrological characteristic variations in relation to specific characteristics of plants, were investigated utilizing two years of monthly average data. The results indicated that surface-flow constructed wetlands can effectively change the physical characteristics of return water and lead to a sharp decrease in pollutant concentrations. The 1200 m long, narrowly constructed wetland resulted in the average reduction rates of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) of up to 22.1% and 21.5%, respectively. The overall purification efficient of the constructed wetland presented seasonal variations in four different monitoring periods (May, July, September, and November). Constructed wetlands with multiple types of plants exhibited higher efficiencies in pollutants removal than those with a single type of plant. The current study can provide meaningful information for the treatment of agricultural wastewater.",

Both a macroscopical sea spray momentum flux algorithm and a microphysical heat and moisture flux algorithm are included in this turbulent model. Numerical results show that the model can well reproduce the upper ocean temperature, which is consistent with the data from the Kuroshio Extension Observatory. Besides, the sea surface temperature is decreased by about 0.5°C during the typhoon passage, which also agrees with the sea surface temperature dataset derived from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing and Reynolds. Diagnostic analysis indicates that sea spray acts as an additional source of the air-sea turbulent fluxes and plays a key role in increasing the turbulent kinetic energy in the upper ocean, which enhances the temperature diffusion there. Therefore, sea spray is also an important factor in determining the upper mixed layer depth during the typhoon passage.",

The gradient diffusion filter (GDF) is verified by a two-dimensional sea surface temperature (SST) assimilation experiment. Compared to the existing DF, the new GDF scheme shows a superior performance in the assimilation experiment due to its success in extracting the spatial multiscale information. The GDF can retrieve successfully the longwave information over the whole analysis domain and the shortwave information over data-dense regions. After that, a perfect twin data assimilation experiment framework is designed to study the effect of the GDF on the state estimation based on an intermediate coupled model. In this framework, the assimilation model is subject to “biased” initial fields from the “truth” model. While the GDF reduces the model bias in general, it can enhance the accuracy of the state estimation in the region that the observations are removed, especially in the South Ocean. In addition, the higher forecast skill can be obtained through the better initial state fields produced by the GDF.",

To assess interannual variability, we analyze the impacts of El Niño, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). We show that the CFS model is capable of simulating realistic storm tracks for frequency and intensity in the NH. The CFS storm tracks exhibit a reasonable response to El Niño and the NAO. However, it did not capture interannual variability for the IOD. Since one path by which storm tracks respond to external forcing is via Rossby waves due to anomalous heating, the CFS model may not be able to capture this effect especially since anomalous heating for the IOD is more local than El Niño. Our assessment is that the CFS model’s storm track response is sensitive to the strength of external forcing.",

Analysis results demonstrate that the SODA SSHA time series are significantly correlated to the AVISO SSHA time series in SCS. To investigate the predictability of SCS SSHA, an exponential smoothing approach and an autoregressive integrated moving average approach are first used to fit the interannual and residual terms of SCS SSHA while keeping the seasonal part invariant. Then, an array of forecast experiments with the start time spanning from June 1977 to June 2007 is performed based on the prediction model which integrates the above two models and the time-independent seasonal term. Results indicate that the valid forecast time of SCS SSHA of the statistical model is about 7 months, and the predictability of SCS SSHA in Spring and Autumn is stronger than that in Summer and Winter. In addition, the prediction skill of SCS SSHA has remarkable decadal variability, with better phase forecast in 1997–2007.",

This event is used as a case study to evaluate the usefulness of the polarimetric variables differential reflectivity (ZDR) and correlation coefficient (CC) in identifying the storm as a haboob. Photographic evidence of the haboob is collected and correlated to NEXRAD signatures of base reflectivity and velocity from the Lubbock TX NEXRAD station (KLBB). NEXRAD level III products ZDR and CC are also obtained. The storm presents with gust front features to the north and east of the station. Low values returned from CC indicate nonmeteorological content. ZDR representations weakly indicate the presence of gust fronts to the east, with a stronger signal to the north. As no visual evidence of the northern gust front is available, the ZDR data are inconclusive. The correlation of low CC values to the visual representation of the haboob is an indicator that CC in combination with the NEXRAD base reflectivity and velocity products may be used to test wind events for the presence of sand, dust, and dirt and therefore exhibit predictive qualities.",

To understand the synoptic differences between the two types of dust events, four dust events from 2006 to 2009 are selected for each type and the synoptic environment is compared. Surface measurements, trajectory analyses, and a regional dust model are also applied to further analyze each type. Results show that the strength of the low-level trough and the surface anticyclonic system are important in determining the transport route of dust event. A deep 700–850 hPa trough extending far south beyond 30°N associated with an intense surface anticyclone with maximum pressure greater than 1020 hPa over coastal East Asia favors southeastward movement of dust event. The prevailing northwesterlies or northerlies behind the deep trough and ahead of the intense surface anticyclone promote the southeastward movement of dust event. Since intense surface anticyclones often associated with strong dust events, severe dust activities tend to move southeastward. In contrast, a shallow trough accompanied by a weak surface high locating north of 30°N over the coastal East Asia favors an eastward transport route.",

The ground-truth data used for this validation study are aerosols measurements from 3 SKYNET ground sites. The results obtained show a good agreement between the ground-truth data AOT and that of one of the satellites’ algorithms, then a systematic overestimation (around 0.2) by the other satellites’ algorithm. The examination of the AE shows a clear underestimation (by around 0.2–0.3) by both satellites’ algorithms. The uncertainties explaining these ground-satellites’ algorithms discrepancies are examined: the cloud contamination affects differently the aerosols properties (AOT and AE) of both satellites’ algorithms due to the retrieval scale differences between these algorithms. The deviation of the real part of the refractive index values assumed by the satellites’ algorithms from that of the ground tends to decrease the accuracy of the AOT of both satellites’ algorithms. The asymmetry factor (AF) of the ground tends to increase the AE ground-satellites discrepancies as well.",

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observed dynamic LAI data from 2002 to 2009 were used in one modeling experiment, and the climatological seasonal cycle of the MODIS LAI was used in the other experiment. The results show that the use of dynamic LAI improves model performance. Compared with the use of climatological LAI, the use of dynamic LAI may reduce the warm (cool) bias in the years with large positive (negative) LAI anomalies. The reduction of the warm bias results from the modeled cooling effect of LAI increase through reducing canopy resistance, promoting transpiration, and decreasing sensible heat flux. Conversely, the reduction of cool bias is a result of the warming effect of negative anomaly of LAI. The use of dynamic LAI can improve model performance in summer and to a lesser extent, spring and autumn. Moreover, the dynamic LAI exerts a detectable influence on SAT in the WRF model when the LAI anomaly is at least 20% of the climatological LAI.",

A salinity parameterization scheme is incorporated into the lake scheme of CLM. The WRF-CLM model with the salinity parameterization scheme can better simulate temperature and precipitation compared to that without considering the salinity effects. The improvement of simulation is especially significant under cold weather condition. The precipitation caused by the GSL effect is always positive over the downwind area of the GSL during the study period. Increased precipitation is largely attributed to the warm lake surface temperature and high latent heat flux over the GSL, which are favorable for the development of strong convective activity and horizontal wind and moisture convergence. Such kind of GSL-induced forcing is the primary mechanism for the downstream GSL effect precipitation. The GSL effect precipitation is largely contributed by fresh water effect when the temperature is close to or higher than 0°C. However, with lower temperature, the salinity effect becomes dominant for the GSL effect precipitation.",

To analyze the effects of land use and climate change on grain production, the area of farmland in northern China during 1988–2008 was determined from remote sensing images, a moisture index (MI) was calculated from daily meteorological data obtained from weather stations, and unit grain production was obtained from statistical yearbooks. Using statistical and spatial analyses, we determined that MI decreased across most of the study area during this period. This decrease in humidity caused humid zones to decrease and semiarid areas to increase. Combined effects of decreased humid area and conversion of farmland resulted in a decrease in agricultural land in humid areas and an increase in semiarid and arid areas.

Second, assume that the system itself is the significant factor to provide chaotic characteristics to output data. For solving this issue, hydro-meteorological time series such as precipitation, air temperature, discharge, and storage volume were collected in the Great Salt Lake and Bear River Basin, USA. The time series in the period of approximately one year were extracted from the original series using the wavelet transform. The generated time series from summation of sine functions were fitted to each series and used for investigating the hypotheses. Then artificial neural networks had been built for modeling the reservoir system and the correlation dimension was analyzed for the evaluation of chaotic behavior between inputs and outputs. From the results, we found that the chaotic characteristic of the storage volume which is output is likely a byproduct of the chaotic behavior of the reservoir system itself rather than that of the input data.",

Concerning the wind field we find a clear distinction between 3 prevailing regimes (which have influence on the flux behavior) mainly caused by the topography at the measurement site. Concerning the fluxes we find a good agreement between the HMA and the eddy covariance method in cases of turbulent mixing in summer but deviations at stable conditions, when the HMA almost always shows negative fluxes. Part of the deviation is based on a dependence of HMA fluxes on friction velocity and the influence of the molecular boundary layer. Moreover, the flagging system of the eddy covariance software package TK3 is briefly revised. A new quality criterion for the use of fluxes obtained by the eddy covariance method, which is based on integral turbulence characteristics, is proposed.",

The average aerosol absorption coefficient was close to 9 Mm −1 and clear cycles at both daily and seasonal time scales were found. An average increase by a factor of two (from 6 to 12 Mm −1 ) was observed in winter if compared to summer season. The daily variations were similarly shaped for all seasons, with two morning and afternoon peaks, but with magnitudes modulated by the seasonal evolution. That was not the case if Sundays were considered. These variations can be explained in terms of the impact of local particle sources, related mainly to traffic and biomass burning and upward mixing of the aerosol due to variable mixing layer heights, either daily or seasonally. Also, a strong negative correlation between the aerosol absorption coefficient and the wind speed was verified, and an exponential decay function was found to fit very well to the data. The wind direction seems to be not correlated with the aerosol absorption coefficient.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the long-range transport of CO 2 in East Asian region, using concentration data in a surface measurement site (Gosan Station), column averaged concentration data of satellite-borne instrument (GOSAT), and GEOS-Chem modeling results for the period of June 2009 to May 2011. We perform a validation of the data from GOSAT and GEOS-Chem with total column observations (TCCON). The analysis of the long-range transport and high concentration (HC) events using surface/satellite observations and modeling results is conducted. During the HC events, the concentrations in CO 2 and other air pollutants such as SO 2 and CO are higher than that of all episodes. It means that CO 2 , known as a globally well-mixed gas, may also act as a fingerprint of human activity with unique regional characteristics like other air pollutants. This comprehensive analysis, in particular with GOSAT CO 2 observation data, shows that CO 2 plume with high concentration can be long-range transported with 1-2 days’ duration with regional scale. We can find out with GEOS-Chem tagging simulation that more than 45% of the elevated CO 2 concentration over central/eastern China, Korea, and Japan on high concentration days can be explained by emission sources of East Asia mainland.",

    "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation has been one of the most challenging problems in recent decades for hydrometeorologists. In this study, a nonparametric approach to estimate terrestrial evaporation was evaluated using both model simulation and measurements from three sites. Both the model simulation and the in situ evaluation at the Tiger Bush Site revealed that this approach would greatly overestimate ET under dry conditions (evaporative fraction smaller than 0.4). For the evaluation at the Tiger Bush Site, the difference between ET estimates and site observations could be as large as 130 W/m 2 . However, this approach provided good estimates over the two crop sites. The Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E) was 0.9 and 0.94, respectively, for WC06 and Yingke. A further theoretical analysis indicates the nonparametric approach is very close to the equilibrium evaporation equation under wet conditions, and this can explain the good performance of this approach at the two crop sites in this study. The evaluation indicates that this approach needs more careful appraisal and that its application in dry conditions should be avoided.",

    "abstract": "Dramatic short videos have quickly gained a huge number of user views in the current short video boom. The information presentation dimension of short videos is higher, and it is easier to be accepted and spread by people. At present, there are a large number of drama short video messages on the Internet. These short video messages have brought serious information overload to users and also brought great challenges to short video operators and video editors. Therefore, how to process short videos quickly has become a research hotspot. The traditional episode recommendation process often adopts collaborative filtering recommendation or content-based recommendation to users, but these methods have certain limitations. Short videos have fast dissemination speed, strong timeliness, and fast hot search speed. These have become the characteristics of short video dissemination. Traditional recommendation methods cannot recommend short videos with high attention and high popularity. To this end, this paper adds external index features to extract short video features and proposes a short video recommendation method based on index features. Using external features to classify and recommend TV series videos, this method can quickly and accurately make recommendations to target customers. Through the experimental analysis, it can be seen that the method in this paper has a good effect.",

To begin, a feature detection model for tennis serve images is established, followed by segmentation of the tennis serve images’ multiscale features. Second, the path of the tennis serving image is effectively corrected, thereby raising the bar for tennis training and competition. Additionally, a visual feature acquisition system for tennis serving action is being developed using remote video monitoring in order to correct the path of the serving image during play. The corner mark of the serving action error point is determined using this algorithm, and the optimal modeling of the tennis serving image’s path correction is realized using the developed edge segmentation algorithm. The results of simulations demonstrate that the aforementioned algorithm improves real-time performance and accuracy, and that it can accurately track players’ visual edge information feature points while they are serving, conduct real-time evaluation and guidance via an expert system, effectively correct the tennis serving image path, and enhance your capacity for service.",

    "abstract": "The amount of solar insolation that reaches the Earth in one hour is sufficient to fulfill its annual energy budget. One of the challenges for harvesting this energy is due to a lack of relevant data. In the least developed countries like Nepal, the number of observation stations is insufficient. This data gap can be filled by employing credible empirical models to estimate solar insolation in regions where insolation measurements are not available. In this paper, Angstrom–Prescott model parameters are estimated for fifteen different locations of Nepal. Then, correlation is developed for the prediction of solar insolation using only sunshine hour data. The different statistical parameters such as root mean square error (RMSE = 1.958), mean bias error (MBE = −0.018), mean percentage error (MPE = 2.973), coefficient of residual mass (CRM = 0.001), and correlation coefficient (r = 0.909) were used to validate the developed coefficients. The resulting Angstrom–Prescott coefficients are a = 0.239 and b = 0.508. These coefficients can be utilized for the prediction of solar energy at different parts of the country in similar weather conditions.",

    "abstract": "The dew condensation frequency is high, and the dew amount is heavy in urban ecosystems. During the condensation process, particulate matter acts as a condensation core, playing an important role in purifying the air. At night, dew mainly condenses on plant leaf surfaces, the plant leaves settle the particles in the dew, and some of the particles are resuspended into the atmosphere in the process of dew evaporation after sunrise. This paper monitored the condensation and evaporation processes of dew on four common plants in Changchun city from June to September 2020. By analyzing the mass and size of particles on different leaves after dew condensation and evaporation, the ability of different plants to retain particles in dew was analyzed. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the TSP capture ability during dew condensation between Buxus sinica (Rehd. et Wils.) Cheng subsp. sinica var. parvifolia M. Cheng, Syringa oblata Lindl., Hemiptelea davidii (Hance) Planch., and Pinus tabuliformis Carrière, with a TSP content of 0.21 ± 0.06 μg/cm2. Coarse particulate matter is the main type of deposit in the dew condensation stage. Particulate deposition varied according to species, leaf shape, and microstructure. The proportion of TSP remaining on leaves after dew evaporation from Pinus tabuliformis Carrière, Hemiptelea davidii (Hance) Planch., Buxus sinica (Rehd. et Wils.) Cheng subsp. sinica var. parvifolia M. Cheng, and Syringa oblata Lindl. tree was 89.7 ± 3.9%, 80.6 ± 3.6%, 75.9 ± 4.5%, and 71.4 ± 3.7%, respectively.

The highest amount of particle captured by Syringa oblata Lindl. individual was 15.17 g/y during dew condensation, and the amount of remaining particles after dew evaporation was 10.83 g/y.

This study aims to reveal the spatiotemporal changes of the BGS in Baiyangdian Wetland from 2016 to 2021. It uses Google Earth Engine (GEE) to calculate NDVI and NDWI based on Sentinel-2 Satellite remote sensing data and extracts the blue-green space by a classification model driven by NDVI and NDWI. Moreover, the land-use transfer matrix and landscape pattern indices are applied for evaluating the BGS changes in the wetland. According to the results, vegetation in the wetland shows no obvious spatial transfer. From 2016 to 2020, the BGS proportion in the wetland showed a stable increase, with the blue space getting larger by 10.8%. The indicators of the Number of Patches (NP), Patch Density (PD), Largest Patch Index (LPI), Contagion, and Landscape Shape Index (LSI) of the wetland decreased, suggesting a better ecological environment since the establishment of Xiong’an New Area in 2017. Based on the results, the author makes the following conclusion: the construction of BGS in Baiyangdian Wetland results in a well-organized ecological environment. The study provides a reference for building Xiong’an New Area and monitoring BGS changes in other regions.",

The satellite observational data were validated with the radiosonde data from three stations in Vietnam: Hanoi, Danang, and Ho Chi Minh City. Subsequently, the wetPf2 data are used to analyze the characteristics of temperature and relative humidity variations of the air masses over the Paracel and Spratly regions. Results show that the mean error of the satellite observational data for temperature ranges from −0.06°C to −0.02°C, with standard deviations ranging from 0.73°C to 1.04°C. The mean error of relative humidity fluctuates between 11.6% and 12.5%, with standard deviations ranging from 15.1% to 19.1%. The values are reasonable and comparable to those in previous studies. Seasonal variations of temperature and humidity show that the air mass over the Paracel Islands exhibits a larger annual temperature with an annual variation of approximately 5.0°C, significantly higher than the value of 2.2°C in the air mass over the Spratly Islands. The difference may be due to the greater influence of continental and seasonal wind systems in the northern region. Within both air masses, the annual temperature variation in the boundary layer is much larger than that in the free atmosphere. Annual relative humidity variation is higher in summer and autumn than in winter and spring. The significant changes in the relative humidity with height during winter and no significant change of the relative humidity with height during summer may be related to the important role of strong convective activity carrying moist air upward to higher atmospheric levels during the summer time.",

To this end, statistical methods widely recommended by climate researchers were adopted. We used monthly mean temperature data for the period 1980–2020 from 9 measuring stations belonging to the Moulouya Watershed Agency (ABHM). These stations were rigorously selected, taking into account their reliability, the length of their records, and their geographical position in the basin. In addition, a quality test and homogenization of the temperature series were carried out using the Climatol tool. The results obtained show a significant upward trend in mean monthly temperature, mainly pronounced during the summer months, in the Moulouya watershed. In fact, Z values generally exceeded the 0.05 significance level at all stations during April, May, June, July, August, and October. According to the results of Sen’s slope test, mean monthly temperatures show an annual increase ranging from 0 to 0.13°C. The maximum magnitude of warming is recorded in July, specifically at Oujda Station. On an overall watershed scale, May, August, and July show a rapid warming trend, with average rates of 0.093, 0.086, and 0.08°C per year, respectively. By contrast, the series for the other months show no significant trend. Significant trend change points were also identified at watershed and station scales, mainly around 2000, primarily for accelerated warming of the summer months.",

The diurnal cycle of the number of MCSs shows a maximum in the afternoon (around 1,600–2,200 LT), a morning minimum (around 0700–1,300 LT), and substantial activity during the night. Surface relative humidity is 5% lower on non‐MCS days, surface dew point 2% higher on MCS days between 0700 and 1800 hr, and solar radiation higher on MCS days between 0500 and 1000 hr. The percentage of rainfall associated with MCSs can exceed 60% on an annual scale and up to 80% on a seasonal scale.

Results indicate that 95% of the TCs causing high winds in Shanghai were generated during July to September, and located to the south of Shanghai for ~80% of the impact time. Divided into four categories according to tracks, the TCs show significant discrepancies in genesis month and location, intensity, size, and duration. The findings of high winds in Shanghai highlight the combination effect of TC intensity, track, and the distance between TCs and Shanghai normalized by TC size (ND SH-TC ). The maximum 10‐min sustained ( V max ) and extreme 3‐s wind speeds ( V ex ) in Shanghai only increase slightly with TC intensity, due to the fact that the stronger TCs are usually farther away from Shanghai. The V max and V ex differ in response to different TC tracks and reach the maximum value under TCs moving northward across the land west of Shanghai and the sea east of Shanghai, respectively. The urban and coastal wind speeds are the smallest and the largest respectively, indicating that the largest underlying surface roughness is associated with the most rapid urban construction. The wind speeds under the influence of TCs in four quadrants of Shanghai also present different variations with the ND SH-TC . Additionally, the wind direction in Shanghai is regularly related to the relative position between the TC center and Shanghai. A case study combined with TC In‐Fa (2106) verified the validity of the conclusions, which can provide a reference for TC forecasters to make more accurate wind field predictions.",

This study utilized the fifth‐generation ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and aerodrome routine meteorological reports (METARs) from 36 airports in China to analyze the impacts of a cold‐wave event from November 26 to 30, 2022. We assessed the effects on wind, visibility, thunderstorms, precipitation, ground‐icing conditions, in‐flight aircraft icing conditions, and clear air turbulence. The results indicated that regions affected by the cold wave shifted from northwest to southeast, with notable impacts on wind, precipitation, and icing conditions. Strong winds, particularly crosswinds, affected airports in coastal regions and narrow valleys, enhancing wind speeds and creating hazardous conditions. Ground‐icing conditions were prevalent, with 23 out of 36 airports experiencing significant icing, notably in Northeast, Central, southern, and eastern China. In‐flight icing conditions were identified in the lower and middle troposphere, primarily affecting Northwest, Northeast, and Central China and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. At cruising levels, the cold wave introduced light clear air turbulence. This study provides valuable insights for improving civil aviation operations during cold‐wave events, emphasizing the need for preventive measures and early warning systems to mitigate potential risks.",

    "abstract": "We study the air temperature with 10 years of hourly measured in 12 automatic weather stations, located in the State of Bahia (Brazil), considering mainly its auto‐ and cross‐correlation. We found that, in general, there is a positive linear trend, indicating warming in this variable for all stations. Also, we observe that the probability distribution function clearly exhibits a bimodal distribution, meaning that there are two main seasonal cycles (the largest relating to winter, the other to summer). In order to have a more robust statistical analysis, detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) method was applied in these time‐series to analyzing data where traditional methods might struggle due to nonstationary. In this case, DFA was useful in identifying long‐range autocorrelations in these time‐series (with persistent and antipersistent behavior) with specific seasonal time‐scales (1 day and 1 year). However, if we quantify the cross‐correlations between the air temperature in Salvador and the other stations, by ρ DCCA , we found that detrended cross‐correlation analysis cross‐correlation coefficient is always positive with two peaks, the first is located at n = 24 (1 day) and the second at n = 8766 (1 year). In this sense, ρ DCCA coefficient provides insights how air temperature in Salvador is correlated with air temperature in other weather stations over different time‐scales, helping to understand their long‐term interactions. These results, for example, allow us to identify temporal scales that may be useful to better understand trends in the air temperature and that can help us further answer global warming questions.",

    "abstract": "Local wind, such as sea breezes, play a crucial role in cooling coastal cities. This study presents new insights about the thermo‐hygrometric influence of the Tagus and Atlantic Ocean breezes (sea and estuarine breezes [SEBs]) in Lisbon’s urban climate (Portugal). SEB events were identified in the summer of 2022 according to a wind rotation criterion: the interruption of prevailing North and Northwest (Nortada) winds during the morning, the wind shift to Northeast/East/Southeast and, sometimes, to further South/Southwest/West (rotation between 22.6° and 292.5°) and the return of the regional flow at late afternoon. Additionally, air temperature and absolute humidity anomalies ( ΔT /Ha urb ) were calculated according to the distance to the riverfront area. Results show that SEB occurred on 37 (31%) out of 120 days, mainly in July (43%) and August (32%), between, on average, 10:00 AM and 4:00 PM, and average wind speeds of 3.4 m/s. According to the daily thermo‐hygrometric cycle, the areas up to 4 km of the Tagus estuary were, on average, cooler than northern Lisbon during SEB events, especially the areas up to 500 m (average ΔT urb reached −1.7°C). Additionally, there was a significant increase in the moisture content during SEB hours across the city but especially close to the riverfront area: the areas up to 500 m registered, on average, Δ Ha urb of 4.2 g/m 3 on SEB events (12:00 PM) against 2.1 g/m 3 during typical Nortada days. This research is a starting point for a future delimitation and preservation of SEB penetration zones in Lisbon to address outdoor thermal discomfort during summer.",

The system downloads global real-time ocean, atmosphere, and wave forcing data, producing regional forecasts every day. A coastal area in South China, encompassing Hainan Island, Leizhou Peninsula, and surrounding sea areas, was chosen as the study domain. A series of 72-hour forecasting simulations were conducted in the area, lasting from July 27 to August 31, 2019. The forecasts throughout August were chosen for evaluation with station observations, along with two sets of reanalysis data, ERA5 and CLDAS. The evaluation results revealed that the COAWST model had high potential for routine forecasting operations. The 24 h forecasts, with a lead time of 24 hours, had high accuracy, while the 48 h and 72 h forecasts did not differ greatly in terms of performance. The distributions of bias between forecast and reanalysis data showed obvious differences between land and sea, with more forecasted precipitation and lower temperatures in land grids than in sea grids. In most cases, the forecasts were closer to ERA5 in terms of means and other statistical measures. The forecasts enlarged the land-sea differences of temperature when compared with ERA5 and strengthened summer monsoon with more moisture transported to land areas. Resulting from that, a forecasted bias of lower surface pressure, higher air humidity, stronger south wind, and so forth was also detected over the domain but at low values.",

However, it is not clear whether the TCs stimulate the convective precipitation over the Al-Hajar Mountains in Oman or suppress it although it had been shown in many studies that TCs suppress the local convection development. This study aims to test the applicability of the hypothesis that the TCs suppress the convection over mountainous to the Al-Hajar Mountains. In order to test the hypothesis of tropical cyclones’ impact on local convection development over the Al-Hajar Mountains, this study considers three different cases during the premonsoon season between 2007 and 2018. The results revealed that weak local convection is reported over the Al-Hajar Mountains during the presence of the cyclones in the Arabian Sea and during the period of their direct impacts. The rainfall in these cases was mainly from stratiform clouds. Therefore, the impact of TCs on the convective suppression over the mountains is applicable to the Al-Hajar Mountains. This study will provide decision-makers and policy creators with knowledge as to whether the Al-Hajar Mountains are susceptible and vulnerable to the risk of torrential downpour, flash flooding, and thunderstorms as what is believed to be.",

    "abstract": "The ability to forecast tropical cyclone (TC) intensity has improved modestly in recent years, partly because of an inadequate understanding of eyewall convection processes. Short-term periodic convection activities (period: 3–5 h) have been identified in a number of TCs, but the effect of these activities on the evolution of TC intensity at the hourly scale is yet to be fully investigated. Using radar observations and a high-resolution numerical simulation based on the Weather Research and Forecasting model, we analyzed the periodic cycles of eyewall convection associated with the intensification of Typhoon Hato (2017). Results indicate the presence of four short-term periodic cycles (period: 3–5 h) in the eyewall convection, which correspond to TC intensification. We further divided each cycle into three stages. The periodic evolution of convection inhibited the rapid intensification of the TC. The highest and lowest intensification rates were associated with the first and third stages according to the virtual potential temperature tendency in the eyewall region, respectively. Heating was dominated by the vertical advection associated with sensible heat and latent heat, which were controlled by the eyewall convection and structure. Of the three stages in each cycle, the vertical transport released the largest amount of latent heat in the first stage; consequently, the highest intensification rate occurred in this stage. In the second stage, heating was reduced because of decreased latent heat and increased cooling of sensible heat associated with vertical advection as the eyewall intensified. Vertical transport was the weakest in the third stage; this resulted in the smallest amount of heating, which limited the rapid intensification of the TC.",

Vertical exchange of ozone was measured from a tower platform at 22 m above mean sea level to study fluxes over coastal waters excluding the tidal region. The results were averaged over 30 min and exhibited predominantly downward but also upward transport of ozone in the boundary layer. Data quality was found to be high based on inspection of cospectra and micrometeorological measurements. During the study period, a major physical influence on O 3 fluxes was found to be wind speed. Measured fluxes were of the same magnitude as reported in previous open ocean studies ranging from approximately +0.2 to −0.5 μ g m −2 s −1 (−0.017 μ g m −2 s −1 on average, corresponding to a deposition velocity of 0.25 mm s −1 or a surface resistance of 4.13 s mm −1 ). These results are considered to represent ozone fluxes over shallow coastal waters west of Ireland for conditions during summer and fall not affected by phytoplankton blooms.",

The model is applied to the annual streamflow data of particular stations in the Kızılırmak Basin, which is exposed to drought periods during the years (1970–1974 and 1994-1995). The aim of this study is to find the possibilities of using the nonparametric approaches as generators of monthly flows, with emphasis on the ability to reproduce the statistics related to drought and storage analysis for the selected stations in Turkey.

We have conducted two independent long-term integrations over 15 winter months (December only) from 2000 to 2014 with and without modified topography. The results show that the Changbai Mountain Range plays a vital role in increasing cyclone track frequency, low-level poleward eddy heat flux, and the local deepening rate over the Japan Sea through enhancement of the lower-tropospheric baroclinic zone (LTBZ). This mountain range gives rise to activation of the synoptic-scale cyclone activity over that region. From our case study on three typical cyclones, it is found that mesoscale structures in the vicinity of a cyclone’s center are dynamically modulated when it passes through the LTBZ and that cyclogenesis is triggered around that zone. A vorticity budget analysis shows that the stretching term relevant to enhanced low-level convergence plays a dominant role in intensifying cyclonic vorticities. We confirmed that the composite features of the three typical cases are consistent with the statistical ones of the dynamical modulation of the Changbai Mountain on synoptic-scale cyclone activity.",

Similarities and differences in cloud properties between the two periods are discussed based on seasonal changes in thermodynamic environments. For convective clouds migrating along the Changma (stationary) front, rain intensity is much stronger and cloud height is relatively higher than during any other summer period, including post-Changma period. Convective rain clouds have a large seasonal variability, even during summer. The seasonal variability in rain parameters related to convective rain type appears to be due to the thermodynamic and dynamic environments.",

Results show the interannual variability of temperature, salinity, and current fields can be reconstructed fairly well. The spread of temperature anomalies in the tropical Pacific region is also able to be reflected accurately when Argo data is assimilated, which may provide a reliable initial field for the forecast of temperature and currents for the subsurface in the tropical Pacific region.

This study presents a retrieval algorithm that evaluates observations of a hemispherically scanning thermal infrared radiometer, the NubiScope, to produce georeferenced, spatially explicit cloud maps. The algorithm uses atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles and an atmospheric radiative transfer code to differentiate between cloudy and cloudless measurements. In case of a cloud, it estimates its position by using the temperature profile and viewing geometry. The proposed algorithm was tested with 25 cloud maps generated by the Fmask algorithm from Landsat 7 images. The overall cloud detection rate was ranging from 0.607 for zenith angles of 0 to 10° to 0.298 for 50–60° on a pixel basis. The overall detection of cloudless pixels was 0.987 for zenith angles of 30–40° and much more stable over the whole range of zenith angles compared to cloud detection. This proves the algorithm’s capability in detecting clouds, but even better cloudless areas. Cloud-base height was best estimated up to a height of 4000 m compared to ceilometer base heights but showed large deviation above that level. This study shows the potential of the NubiScope system to produce high spatial and temporal resolution cloud maps. Future development is needed for a more accurate determination of cloud height with thermal infrared measurements.",

The results showed that three obvious flood events in 2005, 2006, and 2010 resulted in significant water surplus, although TWSA decreased in the TRB during 2002–2015. However, while the significant water deficits in 2004, 2009, and 2011 were associated with obvious negative river discharge anomalies at the hydrological stations, the significant water deficits were not well consistent with the negative anomalies of precipitation.

    "abstract": "This study investigates the effect of atmospheric refraction, affected by temperature, atmospheric pressure, and humidity, on airborne weather radar beam paths. Using three types of typical atmospheric background sounding data, we established a simulation model for an actual transmission path and a fitted correction path of an airborne weather radar beam during airplane take-offs and landings based on initial flight parameters and X-band airborne phased-array weather radar parameters. Errors in an ideal electromagnetic beam propagation path are much greater than those of a fitted path when atmospheric refraction is not considered. The rates of change in the atmospheric refraction index differ with weather conditions and the radar detection angles differ during airplane take-off and landing. Therefore, the airborne radar detection path must be revised in real time according to the specific sounding data and flight parameters. However, an error analysis indicates that a direct linear-fitting method produces significant errors in a negatively refractive atmosphere; a piecewise-fitting method can be adopted to revise the paths according to the actual atmospheric structure. This study provides researchers and practitioners in the aeronautics and astronautics field with updated information regarding the effect of atmospheric refraction on airborne weather radar detection and correction methods.",

In order to ascertain the optimal implementation of state-of-the-art 3Dvar and 4Dvar data assimilation techniques, 12 different experiments have been conducted for the period from 13 September to 18 October 2010 using the New Zealand limited area model. Verification has shown that an ensemble based on these experiments outperforms all of the individual members using a variety of metrics. In addition, the rainfall occurrence probability derived from the ensemble is a good predictor of heavy rainfall. Mountains significantly affect the performance of this ensemble which provides better forecasts of heavy rainfall over the South Island than over the North Island. Analysis suggests that underestimation of orographic lifting due to the relatively low resolution of the model (~12 km) is a factor leading to this variability in heavy rainfall forecast skill. This study indicates that regional ensemble prediction with a suitably fine model resolution (≤5 km) would be a useful tool for forecasting heavy rainfall over New Zealand.",

The events included one dry day with moderate-heavy SD, one localized moderate rainfall event with moderate SD, one island-wide light precipitation event with heavy SD, and one island-wide heavy precipitation event with light-moderate SD. Model results show that (1) precipitation results are improved when compared with observation with the presence of SD, (2) precipitation, cloud fraction, dew point temperatures, and humidity are significantly reduced under SD conditions, (3) precipitation can occur when SD is removed for a dry day, (4) there is evidence of rain being delayed due to the presence of SD without rainfall intensity or accumulation increases, (5) liquid mixing ratio increases of up to 1.4 g kg −1 occur in the absence of SD, and (6) vertical wind increases of up to 0.8 m s −1 occur in the absence of SD.",

A control simulation was generated excluding the new data source, but including all data assimilated operationally at the Canadian Meteorological Center. Experiments were conducted allowing surface sensitive channels to be assimilated over all surfaces or excluding Polar Regions. Resulting forecasts were intercompared and validated against NR fields. Results indicate significant positive impacts in the tropics and Southern Hemisphere extratropics and more modest impacts in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics. Some limitations of the OSSE approach are identified, linked to the different forecast systems used for the NR and the assimilation and higher cloud contamination in Polar Regions.

This severe dust storm hit Mt. Tai in east China with daily mean PM 10 concentration reaching 1400 μ g/m 3 and the model captured the PM 10 variation reasonably well. Modeled spatial distributions of AOD and vertical profiles of aerosol extinction coefficient during the dust storm were compared with MODIS and CALIPSO data, demonstrating that RAQMS was able to reproduce the 3D structure and the evolution of the dust storm reasonably well. During early days of the dust storm, daily mean dust-induced AOD exceeded 2.0 over dust source regions (the Gobi desert and the Taklamakan desert) and was in a range of 1.2–1.8 over the North China Plain, accounting for about 98% and up to 90% of total AOD over corresponding areas, respectively. The top of the dust storm reached about 8 km over east China, with high dust concentration locating at around 40°N. Dust aerosol below 2 km was transported southeastward off the Gobi desert while dust above 2 km was transported out of China along 40°–45°N.",

This study focuses on a role that the large-scale circulations named “the Okhotsk-Japan (OKJ) circulation pattern” played in causing the heavy rainfall case. We found that the 721 heavy rainfall occurred under a background of the OKJ circulation that persisted for about 10 days. However, the pattern was different from the normal OKJ circulation, for this circulation pattern accompanied a blocking high between the Ural Mountains and the Baikal Lake. This difference resulted from the seasonal change of the basic flow. The related Rossby wave propagated eastward during the persisting period of the dominated OKJ pattern. This caused the development of a low-pressure system around the Baikal Lake and the weakening of a ridge around the Okhotsk Sea. The slow evolution of the OKJ circulation created a favorable environment for the moisture transport to northern China, assisting in the generation of the 721 heavy rainfall.",

This study analyzed the possible biogeophysical effects of cultivated land change on the climate in Northeast China during 2010–2030 on the basis of simulation with the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model. Scenario analysis was first carried out on the possible changing trends of cultivated land. Then the climate effects of the cultivated land change were analyzed on the basis of the simulation with the WRF model. The simulation results indicate that the total cultivated land area in Northeast China will decrease during 2010–2030, mainly converting into urban and built-up land and forests due to the urbanization and governmental policies. Besides, the cultivated land change will lead to the increase of the sensible heat flux in the regions where a lot of cultivated land will change into urban and built-up land, while it will make the latent heat flux increase in the regions where the cultivated land will be mainly converted into forests through influencing the evapotranspiration. All these results can provide theoretical support for implementing the future land management in Northeast China.",

Two datasets, considered to describe intra- and interannual oscillations, respectively, were extracted from the measurements data and the results show that both types of fluctuations can be projected onto four empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs), interpreted as vertical distributions of oscillation amplitudes and four uncorrelated time series that represent the evolution of corresponding EOFs. It was found that intra-annual oscillations composed of periods between 30 and 120 days, together with interannual variations of 1- to 7-year period contribute to the highest extent (about 70%) of the temperature oscillations up to 20 km, changing in both cases the phase in the tropopause region. The other three EOFs indicate prevailing weight of the oscillations in the upper troposphere-low stratosphere region and are characterised by longer periods in both types of fluctuations. The intra-annual variations can be accounted for an interaction between Madden-Julian and Arctic oscillations, while the spectral features of interannual fluctuations could be associated with those of Quasi Biennial, El Niño, and North Atlantic global oscillations.",

The EOF1 mode, which explained 61.5% of the total variance, showed a same-sign distribution over all of East Asia, with a belt of enhanced ozone concentrations around 40°N. The principal component of EOF1 (PC1) suggested that photochemical ozone production together with Brewer-Dobson circulation and subtropical westerly jet plays important roles in modulating the seasonal variation of the TOVMR; ozone-rich air produced by photochemical processes was transported from the stratosphere to the troposphere by BD circulation and this ozone-rich air was then blocked by the subtropical westerly jet and accumulated north of the jet. The EOF2 mode explained 29.2% of the total variance with an opposite-sign pattern on the north and south side of 35°N. When anticyclonic circulation transported ozone-poor air from the upwelling area over the Bay of Bengal towards the Tibetan Plateau during the onset of the Asian summer monsoon, tropospheric ozone in this region decreased dramatically.",

    "abstract": "A number of technologically advanced devices, such as radars and satellites, are used in an actual weather forecasting process. Among these devices, the radar is essential equipment in this process because it has a wide observation area and fine resolution in both the time and the space domains. However, the radar can also observe unwanted nonweather phenomena. Anomalous propagation echo is one of the representative nonprecipitation echoes generated by an abnormal refraction phenomenon of a radar beam. Abnormal refraction occurs when the temperature and the humidity change dramatically. In such a case, the radar recognizes either the ground or the sea surface as an atmospheric object. This false observation decreases the accuracy of both quantitative precipitation estimation and weather forecasting. Therefore, a system that can automatically recognize an anomalous propagation echo from the radar data needs to be developed. In this paper, we propose a classification method for separating anomalous propagation echoes from the rest of the weather data by using a combination of a support vector machine classifier and the synthetic minority oversampling technique, to solve the problem of imbalanced data. By using actual cases of anomalous propagation we have confirmed that the proposed method provides good classification results.",

To this end, the land surface scheme is first validated against the Oklahoma Atmospheric Surface Layer Instrumentation System measurements with necessary refinements to the forward model implemented. The retrieval scheme involves a 1D land surface-atmosphere model, the corresponding adjoint codes, and a cost function that measures residuals between observed and modeled screen level atmospheric temperature and specific humidity. The retrieval scheme is robust when subjected to observational errors with magnitudes comparable to instrument accuracy and for initial guess errors larger than typical model forecast errors. Using varying assimilation window lengths centered on different periods of a day, the sampling strategy is assessed. The daytime observations are more informative compared to nocturnal observations. An assimilation window as narrow as four hours, if centered on local noon, contains comparable information to an expanded window covering the whole day. There exists an optimal assimilation window length resulting from the contest between degrading forecast accuracy and increasing information content. For an assimilation window less than two days, the “optimal” assimilation window length is inversely proportional to the data ingesting frequency.",

    "abstract": "Maize is one of the most important cereal food crops, and it can be grown all year in various agroecological zones. However, its vegetative growth and yield are susceptible to rainfall and temperature variability. As a result, the analysis of rainfall and temperature variability and trend was urgently needed in maize-growing agroecology zones to restructure the production system. The aim of the study was to examine rainfall and temperature variability and trends for developing a climate-resilient maize farming system in major agroecology zones in northwest Ethiopia. The study was implemented in low productive agroecology zones (LPZ), medium productive agroecology zones (MPZ), and high productive agroecology zones (HPZ) of northwest Ethiopia using daily time series climate data during the period 1987–2018. The coefficient of variation (CV), precipitation concentration index (PCI), rainfall anomaly index (RAI), and standardized precipitation (SPI) were applied to examine rainfall variability. Mann–Kendall’s and Sen’s slope estimator trend tests were used to detecting the statistical significance of changes in rainfall and temperature. Statistically significant increasing trends for annual maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded for all maize-producing agroecology zones. The mean annual temperature has exhibited a significant warming trend of 0.12 to 0.54°C per decade. The average annual rainfall has decreased by 38 to 67 mm per decade in all maize agroecology zones. Our research also showed that droughts now happen every one to three years; even consecutive droughts were seen in 2009, 2010, and 2011. For this reason, it could be required to develop a system of climate-resilient maize farming to address the issues of both global warming and the sub-Saharan countries that make up our study area. Climate-resilient maize agronomic activities have been determined by analyzing the onset, length of the growth period (LGP), and cessation date. Accordingly, the lower and upper quartiles of the date of onset of rainfall were in a range of May 9 to June 2, respectively; the length of the growth period (LGP) during the rainy season ranges from 97 to 232 days, and the cessation date of rainfall was November 1. Therefore, the short- to long-maturing maize varieties can be planted from May 9 to June 2 and can begin to be harvested in the first week of November under the current climatic circumstances.",

A composite analysis indicated that the interdecadal increase in EHEs is closely related to a deep dynamic anomalous Iranian high. Under the control of this high system, the water vapor content decreased over the western Tianshan mountains, and atmospheric circulation was dominated by a descending motion. Both were attributed to the decreased cloud cover, inducing a cloud-forced net solar radiation increase. The short-wave radiation flux and sensible heat flux reaching the surface increased, and the net surface heat flux increased cumulatively, which was conducive to the surface temperature increase and EHE occurrence. The anomalous Iranian high responsible for ECEs occurrence was related to the air-sea interaction over the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific. The latitudinal sea surface temperature (SST) difference between the tropical western Pacific and the western Indian Ocean directly strengthens the Walker circulation and thus enhances the Iranian high. In addition, the anomalous Iranian high was affected by the atmospheric wave trains at middle latitude, which was triggered by the warm anomaly of the Atlantic SST.",

Particle concentration levels are higher in heavy traffic than in light traffic. The population’s exposure to air pollution in cities is higher near roads. Several studies have analyzed pollution problems due to road traffic in Douala, Cameroon. In this city, the traffic density at the intersections is indeed higher. Thus, the question is as follows: Are these traffic areas hotspots of increased PM exposure levels? To determine it, four particle size fractions (PM10, PM2.5, PM5, and PM1) were collected using an “OC300 Gas and Dust Particle Laser Detector” for three months at different traffic locations (roundabouts or/and crossroads). Statistical analysis of the data shows very high concentrations at most measurement sites. PM concentrations at the different measurement sites are around 35.69-68.08 µg m−3 for PM1, 50.72-99.13 µg m−3 for PM2.5, 54.11-111.22 µg m−3 for PM5, and 57.97-119.25 µg m−3 for PM10. Exceedances of WHO daily guidelines for PM2.5 (45 µg m−3) and PM10 (15 µg m−3) were found during the measurement campaign, indicating that crossroads are the pollution hotspots in urban areas. Occupation of the roadsides for various economic activities (painting, restaurants, donut shops, etc.) is common in Cameroon, increasing health risks for people working around the roadside. Thus, crossroad locations are areas where the level of exposure to PMx is the highest on road traffics.",

    "abstract": "Cold front is an important weather system that produces precipitation in East Asia. Under the background of global warming, extreme precipitation caused by cold fronts presents a significant increasing trend. Hence, it is very important to quantify the cold-front precipitation that may cause great damages. In this study, an objective identification method is proposed for cold-front precipitation, which can objectively identify the precipitation area affected by cold fronts. Then, the climatological characteristics and trends of cold-front precipitation over East Asia in the winter half years from 1989 to 2018 are investigated by using the ERA-5 reanalysis dataset. Based on the dataset of cold fronts and frontal zones, this method automatically distinguishes the precipitation area affected by cold fronts to quantitatively estimate cold-front precipitation. The results show that this identification method can well describe cold-front activities and associated precipitation during an extreme cold wave event that occurred in southern China in January 2016. In the past 30 years, cold fronts have significantly contributed to the precipitation in East Asia in winter half years. The areas with the maximum cold-front precipitation and maximum contribution rate of cold-front precipitation to total precipitation are located in the North Pacific storm track, cold-front precipitation exceeds 700 mm, and the contribution of cold-front precipitation to total precipitation exceeds 60%. In addition, the contribution rates of cold-front precipitation are also relatively large in the midlatitudes of East Asia, especially in North China and Northeast China, where cold-front precipitation accounts for 50%–60% of total precipitation. In East Asia, the total precipitation in autumn is greater than that in winter; however, cold-front precipitation and its contribution rate in winter are significantly more and larger than those in autumn. As the cold-frontal activity is more frequent and intense in winter, the rainfall in winter depends more on cold fronts. In the past 30 years, the trends of cold-front precipitation and total precipitation are consistent in most parts of East Asia, indicating that cold-front precipitation makes a great contribution to the trend of total precipitation in winter half years.",

In this study, a numerical simulation of a southwest vortex rainstorm process was performed. The results show that the low-pressure system originated from the Tibetan Plateau affects the southwest vortex mainly at the middle level, causing the strength increase of southwest vortex (SWV), and acts as a connection between the positive vorticity centers at the upper and lower layers. For the microscopic cloud structure, the vertical updraft of the cloud cluster embedded in the SWV increases as the low-pressure system from the plateau arrives at the Sichuan Basin. Vapor and liquid cloud water at the lower level are transported upward, based on which the ice cloud at the upper level and the warm cloud at the lower level are joined to create favorable conditions for the growth of ice crystals. As the ice crystals grow up, snow and graupel particles form, which substantially elevates the precipitation. This effect leads to the rapid development of SWV rainstorm clouds and the occurrence of precipitation. In addition to the effect of the plateau vortex, the subsequent merging of the convective clouds is another important factor for heavy rainfall because it also leads to development of convective clouds, causing heavy rainfall.",

To improve the forecast of a heavy frontal rainfall event that occurred in the Yangtze-Huaihe River Basin from 4 July to 5 July 2014 in China, operational radar observations are assimilated by the Local Analysis and Prediction System (LAPS). Radar reflectivity data are used primarily in the LAPS cloud analysis procedure, which retrieves the number of hydrometeors and adjusts the moisture and cloud fields. Radial velocity data are analyzed through the LAPS wind analysis-based successive correction method. A new correction method is developed to correct three-dimensional radar reflectivity data based on hourly surface rain gauge observations. The performance of the correction method is demonstrated by assimilating radar reflectivity observations into LAPS. Experiments with different radar data assimilation are examined. Results show that the assimilation of radar data can effectively correct the background errors and improve the heavy rainfall forecast. The simulated intensity, pattern, and temporal evolution of the heavy rainfall event are better improved with radar reflectivity assimilation, especially when the correction method is implemented to correct radar observations.",

    "abstract": "In the present work, daily rainfall is simulated over the core monsoon region of India by using a feedforward multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. Daily rainfall is found to be optimally dependent on four concurrent meteorological parameters, namely, geopotential height, specific humidity, zonal, and meridional wind at 1000 mb, 925 mb, 850 mb, and 700 mb pressure levels during 00, 06, 12, and 18 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The architecture of the optimized feedforward MLP model consists of 64 nodes in the input layer, 10 nodes in the hidden layer, and 1 node in the output layer. The results from the model are compared with the 3B42 (version 7) rainfall product. In terms of root mean square error (rmse) and correlation coefficient (cc), the model is performing better compared to the satellite-derived 3B42 rainfall product, whereas in terms of bias, the performance of the 3B42 product is better compared to the model. The weight matrices of the feedforward MLP model are estimated at a particular location (22.5°N, 82.5°E). These weight matrices are able to simulate daily rainfall at neighbourhood locations also with reasonably good accuracy with cc in the range of 0.41 to 0.55. The performance of the model improves in case of an aerial average of daily rainfall with significantly enhanced cc (0.72). The model is able to capture monthly and intraseasonal variation of rainfall with reasonably good accuracy, with cc of 0.88 and 0.68, respectively. The simulation model has a limitation that it is not able to simulate extreme high rainfall events (&gt;60 mm/day). Overall, the developed model is performing reasonably well. This approach has a potential to be used as a rain parameterization scheme in the dynamical atmospheric and coupled models to simulate daily rainfall. Nevertheless, the present approach can also be used for multistep prediction of rainfall.",

It is also an important indicator for reflecting the relationship between the water and carbon cycles in a vegetation ecosystem. This paper uses data from MODIS Net Primary Production (NPP) and China’s spatial interpolation data for precipitation from 2000 to 2015 to calculate the annual value, multiyear mean value, interannual standard deviation, and interannual linear trend of Chinese terrestrial vegetative PUE over the past 16 years. Based on seven major administrative regions, eleven vegetation types, and four climate zones, we analyzed the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of China’s vegetative PUE. The research results are shown as follows: (1) China’s vegetative PUE shows obvious spatial variation characteristics, and it is relatively stable interannually, with an overall slight increasing trend, especially in Northwest and Southwest China. The vegetative PUE is higher, and its stability is declined in Xinjiang, western Gansu, and the southern Tibetan valley. The vegetative PUE is lower, and its stability is increased in northeastern Tibet and southwestern Qinghai. An increasing trend in vegetative PUE is obvious at the edge of the Tarim Basin, in western Gansu, the southern Tibetan valley, and northwestern Yunnan. (2) There is a significant difference in the PUEs among different vegetation types. The average PUE of Broadleaf Forest is the highest, and the average PUE of Alpine Vegetation is the lowest. The stability of the PUE of Mixed Coniferous and Broadleaf Forest is declined, and the stability of the PUE of Alpine Vegetation is increased. The increasing speed of the PUE of Grass-forb Community is the fastest, and the decreasing speed of the PUE of Swamp is the fastest. (3) There is a significant difference in the PUEs among different vegetation types in the same climate zone, the difference in vegetative PUE in arid and semiarid regions is mainly affected by precipitation, and the difference in vegetative PUE in humid and semihumid regions is mainly affected by soil factors. The PUEs of the same vegetation type are significantly different among climate zones. The average PUE of Cultural Vegetation has the largest difference, the stability of the PUE of Steppe has the largest difference, and the increasing speed of the PUE of Swamp has the largest difference.",

The case study results indicate that the use of radio occultation data after quality control can improve the quality of the analysis to be similar to that of the observations and, thus, have a positive effect when improving 24-hour rainfall forecasts. Batch tests for 119 days from May to August during the flood season in 2009 show that only the use of GPS RO data can make positive improvements in both 24-hour and 48-hour regional rainfall forecasts and obtain a better B score for 24-hour forecasts and better TS score for 48-hour forecasts. When using radio occultation refractivity data and conventional radiosonde data, the results indicate that radio occultation refractivity data can achieve a better performance for 48-hour forecasts of light rain and heavy rain.",

The Gumbel distribution was used to estimate the wind speed for recurrence periods of 1, 10, 50, 75, and 100 years. For all recurrence periods, the coastal regions experienced higher wind speeds, which exceeded the strong wind advisory level, than the inland and metropolitan regions. The strong winds were predominantly induced by summertime typhoons, especially in the south and west coastal regions. In addition, nontyphoon factors, such as a topographical factor with atmospheric instability in a mountainous coastal region, can cause localized severe weather in the form of strong wind. By performing the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model simulation, an abrupt increase in wind speed up to 20 m·s −1 was reproduced under the condition of onshore prevailing winds heading toward a mountain ridge in a coastal region. Estimation of strong wind spatial distribution can help the region-to-region establishment of an action plan to prepare for damage caused by strong winds.",

    "abstract": "In the past two decades, global navigation satellite system-reflectometry (GNSS-R) has emerged as a new remote sensing technique for soil moisture monitoring. Some experiments showed that the antenna of V polarization is more favorable to receive the reflected signals, and the interference pattern technique (IPT) was used for soil moisture and retrieval of other geophysical parameters. Meanwhile, the lower satellite elevation angles are most impacted by the multipath. However, electromagnetic theoretical properties are not clear for GNSS-R soil moisture retrieval. In this paper, the advanced integral equation model (AIEM) is employed using the wave-synthesis technique to simulate different polarimetric scatterings in the specular directions. Results show when the incident angles are larger than 70°, scattering at RR polarization (the transmitted signal is right-hand circular polarization (RHCP), while the received one is also RHCP) is larger than that at LR polarization (the transmitted signal is RHCP, while the received one is left-hand circular polarization (LHCP)), while scattering at LR polarization is larger than that at RR polarization for the other incident angles (1°∼70°). There is an apparent dip for VV and VR scatterings due to the Brewster angle, which will result in the notch in the final receiving power, and this phenomenon can be used for soil moisture retrieval or vegetation corrections. The volumetric soil moisture (vms) effects on their scattering are also presented. The larger soil moisture will result in lower scattering at RR polarization, and this is very different from the scattering of the other polarizations. It is interesting to note that the surface correlation function only affects the amplitudes of the scattering coefficients at much less level, but it has no effects on the angular trends of RR and LR polarizations.",

Climate change has been disrupting the lives of millions of households along the coastal region of Bangladesh. The country has allocated support from its national funds and accessed international funds for the implementation of adaptation interventions. With the focus of the scientific community on climate finance mechanisms and governance at the global and the national level, there is a lacuna in empirical evidence of how climate finance affects risk appraisal and engagement in adaptation measures at the local level. This paper aims to examine how the support from climate finance affects risk appraisal in terms of the perceived probability and severity and the factors which influence risk appraisal. A field survey was conducted on 240 climate finance recipient households (CF HHs) and 120 nonclimate finance recipient households (non-CF HHs) in Galachipa Upazila of Patuakhali District in coastal Bangladesh. The results indicate that both CF and non-CF HHs experience a high probability of facing climatic events in the future; however, CF HHs anticipated a higher severity of impacts of climatic events on different dimensions of their households. With higher income and social capital, the overall risk appraisal decreases for CF HHs. CF HHs have higher engagement in adaptation measures and social groups and maintain alternative sources of income. Climate finance played a critical role in supporting households in understanding the risks that they were facing, assisting them in exploring as well as enhancing their engagement in adaptation options.",

    "abstract": "The interannual variability of autumn rainfall in Southeast China (SEC) is significant, with two major modes, namely, monopole and dipole modes. It is found that the monopole mode is closely related to EP ENSO-like sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA), and the dipole mode is related to CP ENSO-like SSTA. During the warm phase of EP ENSO-like SSTA, an anomalous anti-Walker circulation emerges in the tropical Pacific, with an anomalous subsiding during 110°E–120°E and an anomalous ascending branch in SEC. These two branches of anomalous current are in the same longitude and form a closed meridional circulation. Besides, there also exists an anticyclone anomaly in the Northwest Pacific (NWP), transporting water vapor into SEC. These circulation configurations induced by the warm phase of EP ENSO-like SSTA are consistent with those of monopole mode positive anomaly year. The good correspondence between EP ENSO warm event and the positive monopole mode also helps to support the corresponding relationship between the EP ENSO-like SSTA and monopole mode of SEC autumn rainfall. After the diagnosis of the perturbation omega equation, the anomalous subsiding branch over SEC, as the key link of EP ENSO-like warm phase SSTA exerting impact on the monopole mode during positive anomaly year, is mainly related with the anomalous relative vorticity advection transported by basic zonal wind and temperature advection transported by meridional wind anomaly. As for the dipole mode, it is related to the CP ENSO-like SSTA, but the corresponding relationship is weaker than that of the monopole mode and EP ENSO-like SSTA. In special, during the warm phase of CP ENSO-like SSTA, an anomalous cyclone appears in the NWP and prevailing sinking motion over SEC, both of which favors the appearance of positive anomaly of the dipole mode. Specially, the local anomalous vertical motion mainly depends on anomalous relative vorticity transported by basic meridional wind. Generally speaking, the monopole (dipole) mode is closely associated with the EP (CP) ENSO-like SSTA, demonstrating some correspondence.",

    "abstract": "Socioeconomic drought is one of the most frequent natural disasters in the world and is closely related to human life. The main cause of socioeconomic drought is the contradiction between water supply and demand; hence, as local reservoirs play a major role in improving water supply and coping with extreme climate, it is reasonable to estimate socioeconomic drought based on reservoir operations. The multivariate standardized reliability and resilience index (MSRRI) is utilized to evaluate socioeconomic drought, considering the characteristics of reservoir management and storage water resources. Therefore, with the MSRRI, this study takes the Heihe River Basin in northwestern China, which is controlled by two reservoirs dominating the upstream and downstream regions, as a case study to reveal the evolution characteristics of socioeconomic drought in the basin and the external impacts of climate variability. The results showed that (1) the drought intensity in the up-midstream region is stronger than that in the downstream region; in view of the hysteresis in the downstream region, the occurrence of drought in the up-midstream region could be regarded as an early warning to implement preventive measures in the downstream region; (2) an increasing trend in socioeconomic drought throughout the basin exists on both monthly and annual scales, which indicates that the increasing possibility of drought should be effectively addressed; (3) cross wavelet analysis indicated that the large-scale climate indices contribute to the variations in the socioeconomic droughts throughout the basin, indicating that climate variability may provide a reference for managers to deal with socioeconomic drought in the HRB.",

    "abstract": "The velocity dealiasing is an essential work of automatic weather phenomenon identification, nowcasting, and disaster monitoring based on radial velocity data. The noise data, strong wind shear, and isolated echo region in the Doppler radar radial velocity data severely interfere with the velocity dealiasing algorithm. This paper proposes a two-step velocity dealiasing algorithm based on the minimization of velocity differences between regions to solve this problem. The first step is to correct aliased velocities by minimizing the sum of gradients in every region to eliminate abnormal velocity gradients between points. The interference of noise data and strong wind shear can be reduced by minimizing the whole gradients in a region. The second step is to dealiase velocities by the velocity differences between different isolated regions. The velocity of an unknown isolated region is determined by the velocities of all known regions. This step improves the dealiasing results of isolated regions. In this paper, 604 volume scan samples, including typhoons, squall lines, and heavy precipitation, were used to test the algorithm. The statistical results and analysis show that the proposed algorithm can dealiase the velocity field with a high probability of detection and a low false alarm rate.",

    "abstract": "The impact of stochastically perturbing the terminal velocities of hydrometeors on convective-scale ensemble forecasts of precipitation was examined. An idealized supercell storm case was first used to determine the terminal velocity error characteristics for a one-moment microphysics scheme in terms of the terminal velocities from a two-moment scheme. Two real cases were employed to evaluate the forecast skills resulting from perturbing the terminal velocities with real data. The results indicated that the one-moment scheme produced terminal velocities that were approximately three times higher than those of the two-moment scheme for snow and hail, which often resulted in overpredictions of hourly precipitation and areal accumulated precipitation. Therefore, stochastically perturbing the terminal velocities according to their error characteristics matched the observed hourly precipitation and areal accumulated precipitation better than the symmetrical perturbations. For the two-moment scheme, the symmetrical perturbations of the terminal velocities tended to produce lower falling speeds of precipitation hydrometeors; therefore, more light rain was produced. Compared to the unperturbed two-moment scheme, symmetrically perturbing the terminal velocities resulted in smaller precipitation errors when precipitation was overestimated but comparable or slightly larger precipitation errors when precipitation was underestimated. This work demonstrates the sensitivity of precipitation ensemble forecasts to terminal velocity perturbations and the potential benefits of adopting these perturbations; however, whether the perturbations actually result in significant improvements in precipitation forecast skill needs further study.",

During the late-onset period of 1979–1993, the SCSSM was characterized by stronger onset intensity and a gradual withdrawal, resulting in a continuous, strong preflood season in Southern China and a slower rain-belt retreat from north to south China in September. In addition, the rain-belt in the Yangtze River basin persisted much longer during summer. However, during the early-onset period in 1994–2016, the SCSSM is associated with a weaker onset intensity and comparatively faster retreat. The advanced preflood season lasted intermittently throughout May and the whole eastern China precipitation lasted until October when it retreated rapidly, making the rain-belt in Southern China persist for an extended duration. Further analysis indicates that a strong modulation of SCS intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) on the SCSSM evolution is observed. There are two active low-frequency oscillations over the SCS in summer during the late-onset period but three during the early-onset period. The wet ISO in the Northwest Pacific propagating northwestward into the SCS and enhanced SCSSM ISO activity may contribute to the early onset and faster withdrawal after 1993/94. The effect of warm western Pacific sea surface temperatures (SST) on the SCSSM evolution is also discussed.",

The anomalies were used to investigate the effect of extreme conditions on water budget parameters for various land uses in both northeast and south of Florida. The results showed that extreme events such as La Niña strongly affected the water budget on land-use areas in both regions as the negative monthly rainfall anomalies were observed during the 1999-2000 event, while EI Niño and thunderstorms in summer caused positive rainfall anomalies with more than 70% in all study areas. Higher rainfall led to higher soil moisture anomalies for the agriculture, forest, and wetland from 1992 to May 1998 in both study regions. However, soil moisture becomes primary source for evaporation in drier conditions, and differences in capacity of plants access water, often dictated by the rooting depth, can result in contrasting evaporative losses across vegetation types. Hence, the forest, which had the deeper roots, had lower soil moisture anomalies, but higher evaporation anomalies than agriculture area during the drought event.",

    "abstract": "An algorithm was developed to expand the surface air temperature and air humidity to a larger spatial domain, based on the fact that the variation of surface air temperature and air humidity is controlled jointly by the local turbulence and the horizontal advection. This study proposed an algorithm which considers the advective driving force outside the thermal balance system and the turbulent driving force and radiant driving force inside the thermal balance system. The surface air temperature is determined by a combination of the surface observations and the regional land surface temperature observed from a satellite. The average absolute difference of the algorithm is 0.65 degree and 0.31 mb, respectively, for surface air temperature and humidity expansion, which provides a promising approach to downscale the two surface meteorological variables.",

The surface layer turbulence observations from the Semi-Arid Climate and Environment Observatory (SACOL) of Lanzhou University in 2008 were processed in this study. High-quality turbulence parameters were calculated, the statistical and transfer characteristics of turbulence were analyzed, and the formation of turbulence was assessed in terms of dynamics and thermodynamics. The atmospheric stability in the semiarid region of the Loess Plateau is basically dominated by neutral/near-neutral and weakly unstable/weakly stable conditions; this pattern is significantly different from the preponderance of unstable and stable layers at other sites.

Taking the Yue River watershed in the Qinling Mountains in China as the study area, the Mann–Kendall test and Pettitt mutation test method were used to analyze the various characteristics of hydrological and climatic elements from 1960 to 2018. Then, the elastic coefficient method based on the Budyko framework was used to estimate the elastic coefficient of runoff change on each influencing factor. The results showed that the annual runoff decreased at a rate of 0.038 × 108 m3/a ( <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <a:mi>P</a:mi> <a:mo>&gt;</a:mo> <a:mn>0.05</a:mn> </a:math> ), and a significant abrupt change occurred in 1990. The annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (ET0) increased and decreased, with change rates of 0.614 mm/a and −0.811 mm/a ( <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <c:mi>P</c:mi> <c:mo>&gt;</c:mo> <c:mn>0.05</c:mn> </c:math> ), respectively. The elasticity coefficients of precipitation, ET0, and the underlying surface were 1.95, −0.95, and −0.85, respectively, indicating that annual runoff was most sensitive to the change in precipitation, followed by the change in ET0, and had the lowest sensitivity to the change in the underlying surface. Underlying surface change is the main factor of runoff decrease; the contribution is 89.07%. The total contribution of climate change to runoff change is 10.93%, in which the contributions of precipitation and ET0 are 17.59% and −6.66%, respectively. The NDVI reflecting underlying surface change has been increasing since 1990, which is an important reason for the runoff decrease.",

However, there are various observational biases in satellite data, including a random bias brought about by complex weather systems and a systematic bias caused by the instrument itself, which greatly influence the quality of satellite data. A gradient information assimilation method is proposed in this paper to eliminate systematic bias. This method uses a gradient operator for gradient transformation between the model variable and observation variable and reaches the objective of eliminating systematic bias. An ideal experiment of variational data assimilation is conducted using the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) and Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) data, indicating that only assimilating gradient information can eliminate the smooth systematic bias in observation data. Then, a numerical simulation of tropical cyclone (TC) Megi and data assimilation experiment are conducted using the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) and WRF Data Assimilation (WRFDA) model as well as the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) data. The results show that the method of gradient information assimilation can improve the accuracy of TC tracks forecast and is also applicable for dealing with unreliable satellite data.",

All ten experiments are finally analysed and compared to observations provided by the National Hurricane Center’s best track record and multisatellite rainfall measurements.

The results show that, from the perspective of spatial distribution, the precipitation amount (PA) in Chongqing presents a distribution pattern of more around and less in the middle; the area with high precipitation intensity (PI) is mainly located in the northeast of Chongqing; the large value centers of precipitation frequency (PF) are located in the south and west of Chongqing and near Chengkou. On the spatial distribution of hourly precipitation, the precipitation in most areas of Chongqing is mainly concentrated at night [0200–0900 BT (1800–0100 UTC)], and the rain belt spreads from west to east with the passage of time. On the whole, interannual evolution characteristics of summer precipitation amount, precipitation intensity, and precipitation frequency in Chongqing are basically the same, showing a fluctuation characteristic without obvious trend, but there are some peaks and valleys. From the perspective of diurnal cycle, a larger peak of PA in Chongqing appears near 0300 BT (1900 UTC), another lower peak around 1200 BT (0400 UTC), a larger peak of PI around 0300 BT (1900 UTC), another smaller peak around 1500 BT (0700 UTC), and only one peak of PF around 0700 BT (2300 UTC). The extreme precipitation of different duration in summer in Chongqing is closely related to the topographic characteristics and weather system, the extreme centers of each diachronic precipitation are mainly located near Shapingba, Kaizhou, Youyang, and Shizhu, and the time evolution characteristics of the extreme precipitation are not obvious, but the trend of the extreme precipitation accumulated in 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, or 12 h is basically the same.",

However, future climate change is expected to have great negative effects on cultural heritages, glacier and snow resources, and agricultural landscapes in arid areas of northwest China (high reliability).

To achieve this aim, we used fifteen-year DNI and aerosols data downloaded at 3-hour time intervals in nine defined zones throughout Cameroon. The wavelet transform is a powerful tool for studying local variability of amplitudes in a temporal dataset and constitutes our principal tool. The results show unequal distribution of aerosol types according to zones, but the Desert Dusts (DU) and Organic Carbon (OM) aerosols have been found as dominant particles in the studied region. The wavelet coherence analysis between DNI and each aerosol type reveals three bands of periodicity: <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <a:mo>∼</a:mo> </a:math> 4-month band, 8–16-month band, and sometimes after-32-month band, with the most important frequency at 8–16-month band period. However, the intensity of coherence across bands varies with respect to aerosol type as well as each of the nine climate zones. A significant anticorrelation relationship was obtained between DNI and each type of aerosol, emphasizing that the presence of such atmospheric particles could dampen the renewable energy utilized by power systems. Also, the analysis shows that scattering aerosols such as Sulfate and Sea Salt (SU and SS, respectively) lead DNI in phase while absorbing aerosols such as Organic Carbon, Black Carbon, and Dust (OM, BC, and DU, respectively) give phase lag with DNI.",

In addition, considering the continuity of frost occurrence, the method of reflecting the frost occurrence of the previous day as a variable and the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) pretreatment were used to increase the learning ability.",

    "abstract": "Mangroves are an essential plant community in coastal ecosystems. While the importance of mangrove ecosystems is well acknowledged, climate change is expected to have a considerable negative impact on them, especially in terms of temperature, precipitation, sea level rise (SLR), ocean currents, and increasing storminess. Sri Lanka ranks near the bottom of the list of countries researching this problem, even though the scientific community's interest in examining the variation in mangrove health in response to climate change has gained significant attention. Consequently, this study illustrates how the leaf area index, a measure of mangrove health, fluctuates in response to varying precipitation, particularly during droughts in Sri Lanka's Kadolkele mangrove forest. The measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to produce the leaf area index (LAI), which was then combined with the standard precipitation index (SPI) to estimate the health of the mangroves. The climate scenario, RCP8.5, was used to forecast future SPI (2021–2100), and LAI was modeled under the observed (1991–2019) and expected (2021–2100) drought events. The study reveals that the forecasted drought intensities modeled using the RCP8.5 scenario have no significant variations on LAI, even though some severe and extreme drought conditions exist. Nevertheless, the health of the mangrove ecosystem is predicted to deteriorate under drought conditions and rebound when drought intensity decreases. The extreme drought state (-2.05) was identified in 2064; therefore, LAI has showcased its lowest (0.04). LAI and SPI are projected to gradually increase from 2064 to 2100, while high fluctuations are observed from 2021 to 2064. Limited availability of LAI values with required details (measured date, time, and sample locations) and cloud-free Landsat images have affected the study results. This research presents a comprehensive understanding of Kadolkele mangrove forest under future droughts; thus, alarming relevant authorities to develop management plans to safeguard these critical ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Today, among the existing numerical weather prediction models, those detailing target classifications have been sufficiently explored; however, there are still many weather forecasting goals and needs, and research from theoretical to practical methods still needs additional study. For example, it is important to know as early as possible (months to years in advance) the forecast during a “specific large public event,” such as the hourly weather forecast for the Olympic Games. This study elaborates on the theory and methods for such ultra-early prediction of severe transient weather processes in the atmosphere. The main results of this study include (1) establishing the academic concept to capture precursor signals in modern meteorology and provide definitions; (2) establishing methods for capturing precursory signal quantification of unfavorable weather and proposing quantitative measurable thresholds; and (3) proposing the “ultra-early prediction” target task. A typical case is discussed: the meteorological conditions of the Beijing Winter Olympics, which serves as an example of social demand for weather forecasting of “special large-scale public activities,” as the case results show that the real-time observations during the Beijing Winter Olympics are consistent with the forecast and followed the precursor signal developed using the theoretical and methodological approaches in this study. The numerical quantization indicators for precursor signals include: (1) for a decrease in the height of the mixed layer hidden in the diurnal change; the precursor signal threshold is defined as a drop of more than 100 m for 3 consecutive days; (2) the signal of the δΘe displayed as a change by “negative ⟶ positive” of more than seven days in a continuous period. (3) the supersaturation (S) with thresholds reaching 6–7%, as well as the threshold &lt;0.5 × 10−3 for saturated condensation flux signals (ξp); and (4) the hourly resolution transport index of PLAM (parameter linking air-pollution to meteorological condition) PLAM ⟶ obj remaining continuous for 48 h, with its threshold reaching more than 100.",

The results of the statistical analysis showed that, during the observational period, the average daytime surface horizontal thermal gradient reached up to −0.2°C/km from the lakeshore to southern Gobi Desert area. The near-surface wind field of the 7 km horizontal extent from the lakeshore was dominated by onshore breezes with average peak wind speeds above 5 m/s. In the atmospheric near-surface layer, an isohumidity layer at a height between 10 and 50 m a.g.l. was observed from 11:00 to 18:00 LST. Also, a case study for the atmospheric boundary layer and local circulation analyses was conducted. The onshore breezes were found to play a major role in the vertical structure of the local atmospheric boundary layer. The numerical simulation results indicated that there was an alternating day-night local circulation in the Bosten Lake area.",

For each weather element in the study, frequency and a monthly average are presented. Furthermore, statistical correlations are presented: solar radiation and temperature, solar radiation and sky cover, and solar radiation and aerosol optical depth (AOD). The results indicate that the common assumption of a direct relationship between temperature and solar radiation is rather incorrect. In addition, whereas high solar altitudes are usually associated with high levels of solar radiation, the obtained results indicate a relatively weak relationship between the two variables (<mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn fontstyle=\"italic\">2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math> = 0.463).

The results showed that the temporal variations of precipitation δ 18 O for stations should be correlated with water vapor sources, the distance of water vapor transport, the changes in location, and intensity of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) rather than “amount effect.” Meanwhile, local meteorological and geographical factors showed close correlations with mean weighted precipitation δ 18 O values, suggesting that “altitude effect” and local meteorological conditions were significant for the spatial variations of precipitation δ 18 O.

One simple method for bias removal is to match cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) of modeled soil moisture data to satellite soil moisture data. Traditional methods approximate numerical CDFs using 12 or 20 uniformly spaced samples. In this paper, we applied the Douglas–Peucker curve approximation algorithm to approximate the CDFs and found that three nonuniformly spaced samples can achieve the same reduction in standard deviation. Meanwhile, the matching results are always closely related to the temporal and spatial availability of soil moisture observed by automatic soil moisture station (ASM). We also applied the new nonuniformly spaced sampling method to a shorter time series. Instead of processing a whole year of data at once, we divided it into 12 datasets and used three nonuniformly spaced samples to approximate the model data’s CDF for each month. The matching results demonstrate that NU-CDF3 reduced the SD, improved R , and reduced the RMSD in over 70% of the stations, when compared with U-CDF12. Additionally, the SD and RMSD have been reduced by over 4% with R improved by more than 9%.",

When SBF radar fine lines are identifiable, their position agrees very well with surface thermodynamic changes. Although temperatures were cooler at the coast, microscale offsets in location of thermal, moisture, and radiative features are noted in the vicinity of the SBF, particularly when the sea-breeze system is relatively weak or immature. At times, it seems that strong solar insolation causes the temperature to rise temporarily within the transition zone behind the kinematic SBF. These results are at variance with most other diagnostic studies. Some thermodynamic variations are noted within the marine air mass in connection to minor water bodies such as Biloxi Bay. The potential for passage of the SBF to at least temporarily increase human heat stress as described by heat index is also noted.",

We also compared the results of optical parameters of BC aerosols with homogeneous scales and analyzed the effect on climate. Compared with the conventional uniform-scheme optical parameterization, the concentrations of the first mode of BC aerosols simulated with the optical parameters that were recalculated based on the particle size are significantly higher, while the concentrations of the other modes and the total of BC aerosols are lower. In the respective of statistics, the changes of column burdens of BC in four modes are 0.085, −0.095, −0.089, −0.054 mg/m 2 . The clear-sky TRF of BC are weakened in the value of 0.03 W/m 2 averaged over the domain, while the all-sky TRF of BC are enhanced of 0.06 W/m 2 in general. The warming effect of BC becomes weaker when using the new scheme by −0.04 K to −0.24 K. When using the new optical parameters scheme, the regional average surface concentrations of BC in four modes are 0.372, 0.264, 0.055 and 0.004 μ g/m 3 , respectively. Especially, the first and the second mode account for as large as 53% and 38%. The surface concentration and column burden of total BC are 0.69 μ g/m 3 and 0.28 mg/m 2 can be dropped.

    "abstract": "Temperature changes have a major impact on all aspects of human society and have attracted global attention. The scarcity of observation data and the inaccuracy of the models make obtaining accurate temperature distributions a challenge. This study introduces high-accuracy surface modeling (HASM) combined with temperature simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and temperature records from observation stations to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of temperature in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region during the period of 1956–2005. Leave-one-out cross-validation is applied to verify the temperature fields before and after the fusion of the models. The results indicate that the WRF model has a limited ability to simulate temperature conditions, but the overall deviation across the region is relatively large. The fusion results of the HASM decrease the mean absolute error (MAE) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by half in most instances, and the correlation between the fusion data and observation data is approximately 0.01–0.03 higher than that with the WRF simulation data. Based on the fusion data, obvious warming trends are observed during 1976–2005. In general, temperatures in spring, summer, and autumn increase rapidly from 1996 to 2005 but from 1976 to 1995 in winter. The substantial fluctuations in the interannual temperature during 1996–2005 in summer, autumn, and winter may be related to the frequent occurrence of extreme weather. The spatial distribution of temperature change differs in each season during 1956–1995. A dramatic increase in temperature occurs in the western part of the study area during 1996–2005 but with no seasonal difference.",

    "abstract": "Ozone (O 3 ) flux-based indices are considered better than O 3 concentration-based indices in assessing the effects of ground O 3 on ecosystem and crop yields. However, O 3 flux ( F o ) measurements are often lacking due to technical reasons and environmental conditions. This hampers the calculation of flux-based indices. In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN) method was attempted to simulate the relationships between F o and environmental factors measured over a wheat field in Yucheng, China. The results show that the ANN-modeled F o values were in good agreement with the measured F o values. The R 2 of an ANN model with 6 routine independent environmental variables exceeded 0.8 for training datasets, and the RMSE and MAE were 3.074 nmol·m −2 ·s and 2.276 nmol·m −2 ·s for test dataset, respectively. CO 2 flux and water vapor flux have strong correlations with F o and could improve the fitness of ANN models. Besides the combinations of included variables and selection of training data, the number of neurons is also a source of uncertainties in an ANN model. The fitness of the modeled F o was sensitive to the neuron number when it ranged from 1 to 10. The ANN model consists of complex arithmetic expressions between F o and independent variables, and the response analysis shows that the model can reflect their basic physical relationships and importance. O 3 concentration, global radiation, and wind speed are the important factors affecting O 3 deposition. ANN methods exhibit significant value for filling the gaps of F o measured with micrometeorological methods.",

Since the monthly runoff series during 1956–2016 is a time series with change points, it is necessary to find a new stochastic streamflow series generation approach to preserve the statistical characteristics of the original series and to refine the reliability of water supply risk analysis. This paper improves a known stochastic streamflow simulation method of previous research to better reflect the characteristics of series with change points. And this paper simulates the monthly runoff series with change point of Panjiakou reservoir during 1956–2016 by three different methods, including Thomas–Fiering model, copula function stochastic simulation method, and copula function stochastic simulation method with the mixed distribution model. Among the three methods, the copula function stochastic simulation method with the mixed distribution model which is improved on the basis of copula function stochastic simulation method in this study performs best in simulating the observed monthly runoff series during 1956–2016, and the water supply risk indices including reliability (time-based and volume-based), resilience, vulnerability, drought risk index (DRI), and sustainability index (SUI) are evaluated for Panjiakou reservoir and analyzed by using the stochastic simulation results. By comparing with the previous studies, all indicators are between the corresponding results of 1956–1979 and 1980–2016 with stationary inflows; it can be seen that change point seriously affects the water supply risk of Panjiakou reservoir. These results make it easy to formulate water supply strategies and schemes in changing environment for water resources managers.",

Additionally, more than 50% of sites show declined and increased SPEI-3 in January, April, June, and August–December and the remaining months, respectively. Except for wGX with dominant of ET 0 , annual SPEI-3 changes in SWC and other four subregions have dominant of precipitation. Spatially, annual SPEI-3 changes at 59% of sites are because of precipitation, generally located in southeast SC, south YN, CQ, GZ, and south and northeast wGX.

    "abstract": "Based on observational data collected during the summer of 2009 from the southern Badain Jaran Desert, the surface sensible and latent heat fluxes and shallow soil thermal storage were obtained through corrections and quality control measures. The soil thermal properties and characteristics of the land surface energy budget before and after rainfall episodes were systematically analyzed. Short-term precipitation had a greater influence than systematic precipitation on the soil temperature (ST) and soil volumetric water content (VWC). After rainfall, the VWC rapidly increased, showing a decreasing growth rate trend with depth and time in all layers; the soil temperature change rate (TCR) exhibited the opposite tendency. The surface albedo, which was affected little by the solar elevation angle and short-term precipitation, fluctuated from low to high during short-term rainfall. The soil thermal parameters, including the volumetric heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and diffusivity, all increased after rainfall. The diurnal soil heat flux variations in each layer manifested as quasisinusoids, and the amplitude gradually decreased with depth. The energy balance ratio (EBR) without and with soil heat storage ( S ) varied differently; after incorporating S , the EBR increased by approximately 5-6% regardless of rainfall but remained lower afterward. Throughout the observation period, the maximum daytime EBR appeared approximately 1-2 days before or after rainfall and gradually declined otherwise. These findings are fundamental for understanding the influences of cloud and precipitation disturbances on radiation budgets and energy distributions and improving the parameterization of surface radiation budgets and energy balances for numerical models of semiarid areas.",

    "abstract": "The accurate, efficient, and reliable forecasting of wind speed is a hot research topic in wind power generation and integration. However, available forecasting models focus on forecasting the wind speed using historical wind speed data and ignore multidimensional meteorological variables. The objective is to develop a hybrid model with multidimensional meteorological variables for forecasting the wind speed accurately. The complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) is applied to handle the nonlinearity of the wind speed. Then, the original wind speed will be decomposed into a series of intrinsic model functions with specified numbers of frequencies. A quadratic model that considers the two-way interactions between factors is used to pursue accurate forecasting. To reduce the model complexity, Gram–Schmidt-based feature selection (GSFS) is applied to extract the important meteorological factors. Finally, all the forecasting values of IMFs will be summed by assigning weights that are carefully determined by the whale optimization algorithm (WOA). The proposed forecasting approach has been applied on six datasets that were collected in Qinghai province and is compared with several state-of-the-art wind speed forecasting models. The forecasting results demonstrate that the proposed model can represent the nonlinearity of the wind speed and deliver better results than the competitors.",

Crops grow best within specific temperature intervals, and excessive heat is detrimental to the physiological processes of crops and eventually affects yield levels. Analysing historical changes in concurrent extreme high temperatures is critical to preparing for and mitigating the negative effects of climatic change. The North China Plain (NCP) is the most important wheat production area in China. In this study, the spatiotemporal variations in temperature and heat wave trends in the NCP were analysed. Furthermore, we examined the potential of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) to capture the influence of heat wave impacts on wheat crops in the NCP by comparing satellite remote sensing data of SIF and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and validated ground-based yield data. The results indicate that temperatures and the number of heat wave days in the study region all show increasing trends, especially daily minimum temperature, which has increased by 0.38°C per decade for the past 30 years. Spatially, the southern NCP has suffered greater increasing-temperature trends and more heat wave days than the northern region. Regarding the response of SIF and NDVI to heat waves, SIF can better capture wheat yield decline due to heat waves compared to NDVI; thus, the SIF result indicated more sensitivity to heat waves compared to NDVI.",

Comprehensive study of diurnal variation of precipitation is helpful in studying the formation of local climate and validating satellite precipitation products. In this study, a comparison is drawn between precipitation gauge observations and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) 3B42 data on diurnal variation of precipitation. First, using the K-means clustering algorithm, stations with gauge observations and pixels with TRMM data are divided into different groups according to the diurnal variation of precipitation, respectively. In each group, the stations have similar diurnal variation of precipitation. Then maps of diurnal variation of precipitation for gauge observations and TRMM data are obtained. According to these maps, the diurnal variation of precipitation over the contiguous United States (CONUS) presents seasonal variability in both gauge observations and TRMM data. In addition, the diurnal variation of precipitation shows clustered features in space. However, the spatial patterns of the obtained maps do not match, and the TRMM satellite data perform poorly in capturing the hourly precipitation event. Finally, the possible mechanism behind the prevailing nocturnal precipitation over the middle of the CONUS is discussed, with the prevailing nocturnal precipitation judged likely to be strongly related to the mountain-plains solenoid (MPS) circulation.",

This problem is that the measurement taken by the satellite sensor is fundamentally different from the one it is compared with on the ground. Additionally, since the satellite has the limited capability to measure the light rain rate exactly, the comparison should also consider the threshold value of satellite rain rate. This paper proposes a ground-truth design with threshold for the satellite rain rate. This ground-truth design is the generalization of the conventional ground-truth design which considered the only (zero, nonzero) and (nonzero, nonzero) measurement pairs. The mean-square error is used as an index of accuracy in estimating the ground measurement by satellite measurement. An application to the artificial random field shows that the proposed ground-truth design with threshold is valid as the design bias is zero. The same result is also derived in the application to the COMS (Communication, Ocean, and Meteorological Satellite) rain rate data in Korea.",

It is found that, by assimilating Argo observations, the reanalysis quality is much improved: the root mean square (RMS) error of temperature and salinity can be further reduced by about 10% and the RMS error of current can be further reduced by 18%, compared to the case only assimilating conventional in situ temperature and salinity observations. Consistent with the unique feature of Argo observations, the temperature is improved in all levels and the largest improvement of salinity happens in the deep ocean.

It compares the modelling results from twelve meteorological sites with varying anemometer heights, located at different distances from the air pollution measurements and exhibiting different land use characteristics. The results show that the index of agreement (IA) between observed and predicted concentrations can be improved from 0.4 to 0.8 by using the most compared to the least representative wind data as input to the air pollution model. Although improvements can be achieved using wind data from a site closer to the air quality monitoring site, choosing the closest wind site does not necessarily yield the best results, especially if the meteorological station is located in a region of complex land use. In addition, both the height of the anemometer and the openness of the terrain surrounding the anemometer were found to be equally important in obtaining good model predictions. The simple SOSE model can therefore be used to complement regulatory meteorological guidelines by providing a quantitative assessment of wind site representativeness for air quality applications in complex urban environments.",

It is therefore important that General Circulation Models (GCMs) are able to represent this feature well in order to adequately represent the Australian Monsoon. Given that there are many different configurations of GCMs used globally (such as those used as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project), it is difficult to assess the underlying causes of the differences in circulation between such GCMs. In order to address this problem, the work presented here makes use of three different configurations of the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator (ACCESS). The configurations incorporate changes to the surface parameterization, cloud parameterization, and both together (surface and cloud) while keeping all other parameterized processes unchanged. The work finds that the surface scheme has a larger impact on the heat low than the cloud scheme, which is caused by differences in the soil thermal inertia. This study also finds that the differences in the circulation caused by changing the cloud and surface schemes together are the linear sum of the individual perturbations (i.e., no nonlinear interaction).",

The present paper documents the meteorological observations of an aircraft over the seas west of the Philippines on encountering severe turbulence associated with an area of convection. From the valuable flight data available from this aircraft, it is found that, on encountering the significant turbulence, the aircraft experienced increase in wind speed, strong downdraft, high windshear hazard factor, and, most importantly, high level of eddy dissipation rate, which is a measure of turbulence intensity in civil aviation. The application of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models in the forecasting of this severe turbulence case is also studied. It turns out that the cumulonimbus extent and in-cloud turbulence potential products from World Area Forecast System may have some indication of the occurrence of significant turbulence associated with convection in the area concerned. A mesoscale NWP model even forecasts the possibility of moderate-to-severe turbulence about 24 to 27 hours ahead of the event.",

This diagnostic pressure equation constraint (DPEC) is aimed to improve dynamic consistency among different model variables so as to produce better data assimilation results and improve the subsequent forecasts. Ge et al. (2012) described the development of DPEC and testing of it with idealized experiments. DPEC was also applied to a real supercell case, but only radial velocity was assimilated. In this paper, DPEC is further applied to two real tornadic supercell thunderstorm cases, where both radial velocity and radar reflectivity data are assimilated. The impact of DPEC on radar data assimilation is examined mainly based on the storm forecasts. It is found that the experiments using DPEC generally predict higher low-level vertical vorticity than the experiments not using DPEC near the time of observed tornadoes. Therefore, it is concluded that the use of DPEC improves the forecast of mesocyclone rotation within supercell thunderstorms. The experiments using different weighting coefficients generate similar results. This suggests that DPEC is not very sensitive to the weighting coefficients.",

Using the shallow lake ecological degradation and restoration model, CNOP method is adopted to discuss the instability and sensitivity of the ecosystem to the finite-amplitude perturbations related to the initial condition and the parameter condition. Results show that the linearly stable clear (turbid) water states can be nonlinearly unstable with the finite-amplitude perturbations, which represent the nature factors and the human activities such as the excessive harvest of the macrophytes and the sediment resuspension caused by artificially dynamic actions on the ecosystems. The results also support the viewpoint of Scheffer et al., whose emphasis is that the facilitation interactions between the submerged macrophytes and the water transparency are the main trigger for an occasional shift from a turbid to a clear state. Also, by the comparison with CNOP-I, CNOP-P, CNOP, and (CNOP-I, CNOP-P), results demonstrate that CNOP, which is not a simple combination of CNOP-I and CNOP-P, could induce the shallow lake ecosystem larger departure from the same ground state rather than CNOP-I, CNOP-P, and (CNOP-I, CNOP-P).",

Furthermore, analysis of large-scale atmosphere-ocean dynamics showed better conditions for TC development and strengthening during WP El Niño years.

In order to develop the S 4 M with a higher degree of climate forecasting resolution, an in-depth analysis was conducted regarding precipitation and evapotranspiration for the semiarid region of the watershed. Weather station data were compiled for both precipitation and evapotranspiration from 1980 to 2004. Several logistic regression models were developed for determining the relationships among precipitation events, that is, duration and volume, and evapotranspiration levels. These data were then used to develop a stochastic weather generator for S 4 M.

    "abstract": "Localized convection in Barbados accounts for hazardous conditions and a significant percentage of the island’s annual rainfall. The feature results in rainfall accumulations exceeding 50 mm in 3 hours or less, over isolated locations. Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) simulations are conducted for a rapid convective initiated and heavy precipitation event of 26 August 2008 over Barbados. The simulation results from the 1 km grid resolution domain depict that the shallow topography on the island plays a significant role in enhancing convective activity under weak synoptically disturbed conditions. The model results also demonstrate that the driving forces for the development of deep convective clouds include low-level moisture convergence that form as a result of the temperature differential between the land and the ocean and forced low-level uplift as a result of the blocking by the topography. The high-resolution WRF simulations demonstrate its capability to accurately capture the low-level flow over the island, as well as the orientation of the divergence and convergence patterns throughout the depth of the atmosphere. These results are heartening to use the WRF as a resource for studying deep convection in Barbados for disaster managers and water resource managers.",

    "abstract": "Although the issue of climate change is often dealt with in global perspective, the impact of climate change must be assessed at regional scales. While global climate models can provide projections of the average state of large-scale circulation of future climate, the downscaling of such projections to regional scale with improved spatial and temporal resolution for both the forcing fields and the climatic responses is the basis for assessing the societal impacts of climate change. Therefore, it is important to not only study climate change at the global scale but also study the regional manifestations of the climate system at spatial scales ranging from less than a hundred kilometers to thousands of kilometers with time scales from months to years to decades. This special issue publishes a collection of articles covering a wide range of topics of our understanding of “regional climate” from downscaling the variability of extreme rainfall over the Yangtze River basin (T. Gao and L. Xie) and assessing the water resources in the Yellow River region (Z. Wu et al.) in China to forecasting the precipitation and water resources in the Lake Victoria region in East Africa (X. Sun et al., R. Argent et al., and K. A. Smith and F. H. M. Semazzi), from downscaling wind energy resources in the contiguous United States (B. Liu et al.) to characterizing the precipitation extremes in the Carpathian region in central and southern Europe (L. Gaal et al.), and from analyzing the energy balance in semiarid grasslands in China (Q. Jiang et al.) to detecting future climate change signals in central and eastern Europe from numerical model simulations (M. Belda et al.). This special issue also includes articles addressing the impacts of regional climate change on tropical cyclones over the Atlantic Ocean (K. Xie and B. Liu), on crop yields in North China (H. Liu et al.), and on litter production and nutrient dynamics in a plantation in China (X. Ge et al.), as well as rainfall and drought in Eastern Kenya (M. O. Kisaka et al.). Additionally, several articles with focus on regional climate downscaling methodologies are also included. S. Kim et al. studied the effects of geographic features in a mountainous area on the downscaling of global climate model data; T. R. Lee et al. demonstrated the feasibility of using PRISM (parameterelevation regression on independent slope model) to downscale maximum temperature to subkilometer scale; L. Gao et al. applied the LASSO algorithm to statistically downscale the ERA-interim precipitation forecast over complex terrain; and K.-H. Min and W.-Y. Sun explored the application of an atmosphere-cryosphere coupledmodel in regional climate applications. These articles reflect the recent advances and applications in “regional climate downscaling, prediction, and impact assessment” from a set of unique angles. We hope they are of interest to peers.",

    "abstract": "There have been significant advances in our understanding of the climate system, but two major problems still exist in modeling atmospheric response during cold seasons: (a) lack of detailed physical description of snow and frozen soil in the land-surface schemes and (b) insufficient understanding of regional climate response from the cryosphere. A multilayer snow land-surface model based on the conservations of heat and water substance inside the soil and snow is coupled to an atmospheric RCM, to investigate the effect of snow, snowmelt, and soil frost on the atmosphere during cold seasons. The coupled RCM shows much improvement in moisture and temperature simulation for March-April of 1997 compared to simple parameterizations used in GCMs. The importance of such processes in RCM simulation is more pronounced in mid-to-high latitudes during the transition period (winter–spring) affected by changes in surface energy and the hydrological cycle. The effect of including cryosphere physics through snow-albedo feedback mechanism changes the meridional temperature gradients and in turn changes the location of weather systems passing over the region. The implications from our study suggest that, to reduce the uncertainties and better assess the impacts of climate change, RCM simulations should include the detailed snow and frozen soil processes.",

    "abstract": "Open ecosystems in Mexico are under increasing pressure, due particularly to the expansion of cities and agricultural activities. These developments occur without integrating biodiversity concerns in land use planning and result in extensive fragmentation and transformation of the landscapes. The semiarid region of Mesa Central was characterized using ten precipitation-based indices. Using multivariate statistical and geostatistical spatial analysis techniques, the influence of those indices on five land use strata was explored. Land use analysis indicated that the maximum values of the five significant precipitation-based indices were found in Grasslands, Agricultural Use, and Shrubs; minimum values were characteristic of substrates Secondary Desert Vegetation and Other Use. Our results suggest that the greatest number of extreme precipitation events is likely to occur in open ecosystems and consequently will have a strong influence on landscaping and land use. The semivariogram analysis and geostatistical layers demand attention from research institutions, policy makers, researchers, and food producers to take the appropriate and coordinated actions to propose scenarios to deal with climate change. Perhaps this study can stimulate thought concerning research endeavours aimed at promoting initiatives for biodiversity conservation and planning programs for climate change mitigation.",

There was a strong relationship between b b ( λ ) and N , with a minimum regression coefficient of 0.97 at 488 nm and a maximum value of 0.98 at other bands. The cell density calculated by the multiband inversion model was similar to the field measurements of the coastal waters (the average relative error was only 8.9%), but it could not accurately discern the red tide from mixed pixels, and this led to overestimation of the area affected by the red tide. While the single-band inversion model is less precise than the former model in the high chlorophyll water, it could eliminate the impact of the suspended sediments and make more accurate estimates of the red tide area. We concluded that the two models both have advantages and disadvantages; these methods lay the foundation for developing a remote sensing forecasting system for red tides.",

As discussed in our previous work, the model has some appealing features for atmospheric modeling and can be expected as a practical framework of the dynamic cores, which well balances the numerical accuracy and algorithmic complexity. The flows over the mountains of various half widths and heights were simulated with the model. The semianalytic solutions to the mountain waves through the linear theory are used to check the performance of the MCV model. It is revealed that the present model can accurately reproduce various mountain waves including those generated by the mountains with very steep inclination and is very promising for numerically simulating atmospheric flows over complex terrains.",

Several well documented historical floods provided opportunity for the calibration of the chosen numerical model. Once established, the model could be used for investigation of different extreme flood scenarios and to establish the Base Flood Elevation. The calibration has shown that the coefficient of friction in case of the Tisza River is dependent both on the actual water level and on the preceding flood events. The effect of flood plain maintenance as well as the activation of six potential detention ponds on flood mitigation has been examined. Furthermore, the expected maximum water levels have also been determined for the case if the ever observed biggest 1888 flood hit the region again. The investigated cases of flood superposition highlighted the impact of tributary Maros on flood mitigation along the Tisza River.",

The best track process was designed with five basic stages: database, potential interval (PI), optimization, smoothing, and metadata. The PI was newly devised as a tool for expressing the uncertainty in the location of the center of the TC. This PI determined the minimum range at which the center of the TC can be adjusted and based on the analysis manual for each dataset used in the TC best tracking. Furthermore, the PI can be optimized by the differential application of the range depending on the reliability of the data. By smoothing all TC centers within the optimized PI, a best track can be produced more stably. Therefore, the analysis can be less subjective even when the determination of the TC center is difficult. For three typhoon cases that had affected Korea in 2013 (LEEPI, KONG-REY, and DANAS), best tracks were obtained based on the suggested analysis stages and verified. The results showed that the PI was relatively large in the early development and weakening stage of the TC or when the estimation of the TC center was difficult because of interactions with the land. And the best tracking was performed well with reasonable applicability.",

The computational results showed that although most of the rainstorm floods have nothing to do with the severe earthquakes from a statistical perspective, some floods might relate to earthquakes. This is especially true when the earthquakes happen in the vapor transmission zone where rainstorms lead to abundant water vapors. In this regard, earthquakes are more likely to cause big rainstorm floods. However, many cases of rainstorm floods could be found after severe earthquakes with a large extent of uncertainty.",

The impacts of the horizontal resolution increase from 12 km to 4 km on the WRF-RTFDDA simulations are also examined in conjunction with the TAMDAR data impacts. The assimilation of the TAMDAR data reduces the root mean squared error of the moisture field predictions and increases the correlation between the predictions and the observations for both domains with 12 km and 4 km grid spacings. The TAMDAR data reduce the model dry biases in the middle and lower levels by adding moisture at those levels. Assimilating the TAMDAR data improves temperature predictions at middle to high levels and wind speed predictions at all levels especially for the 12 km domain. Increasing the horizontal resolution from 12 km to 4 km results in significantly larger impacts on surface variables than assimilating the TAMDAR data.",

Profiles of the eddy diffusion coefficients in the YSU planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme are evaluated in the advanced research WRF (ARW) system. Three versions of the YSU scheme (original, K025, and K200) are included in this study. The simulation results are compared with the observational data from track, center sea-level pressure (CSLP), and maximum surface wind speed (MWSP). Comparing with the original version, the K200 improves the averaged mean absolute errors (MAE) of track, CSLP, and MWSP by 6.0%, 3.7%, and 23.1%, respectively, while the K025 deteriorates the averaged MAEs of track, CSLP, and MWSP by 25.1%, 19.0%, and 95.0%, respectively.

    "abstract": "We constructed a similarity model (based on Euclidean distance between rainfall and runoff) to study time-correlated characteristics of rainfall-runoff similar patterns in the upstream Red River Basin and presented a detailed evaluation of the time correlation of rainfall-runoff similarity. The rainfall-runoff similarity was used to determine the optimum similarity. The results showed that a time-correlated model was found to be capable of predicting the rainfall-runoff similarity in the upstream Red River Basin in a satisfactory way. Both noised and denoised time series by thresholding the wavelet coefficients were applied to verify the accuracy of model. And the corresponding optimum similar sets obtained as the equation solution conditions showed an interesting and stable trend. On the whole, the annual mean similarity presented a gradually rising trend, for quantitatively estimating comprehensive influence of climate change and of human activities on rainfall-runoff similarity.",

The impacts of four momentum transfer parameterization schemes (COARE, TY, OT, and DN) and three heat transfer parameterization schemes (COARE, GR, and ZK) on typhoon modelling have been studied by means of the track, intensity, and radial structure of typhoon. The results show that the track of Yutu is not sensitive to the choice of parameterization scheme, while the combinations of different parameterization schemes affect the intensity of Yutu. Among the four momentum flux parameterization schemes, three wave-state-based schemes (TY, OT, and DN) provide better intensity results than the wind-speed-based COARE scheme, but the differences between the three wave-state-based schemes are not obvious. Among the three heat flux parameterization schemes, the results of the GR scheme are slightly better than those of the COARE scheme, and both the GR and COARE schemes are significantly better than the ZK scheme, from which the intensity of Yutu is underpredicted obviously. The influence of the combination of different parameterization schemes on the intensity of the typhoon is also reflected in the radial structure of the typhoon, and the radial structure of the typhoon simulated by experiments with stronger typhoon intensity also develops faster. Differences of intensity between experiments are due mainly to the differences in sea surface heat flux, the enthalpy transferred from sea surface to the atmosphere has a significant impact on the bottom atmosphere wind field, and there is a strong correspondence between the distribution of enthalpy flux and the bottom wind field.",

Sea breeze convergence has been detected in 21 of these days, mostly during evening hours and under large-scale winds. Breeze events are associated with a cold anomaly at the peninsula with respect to the climatology. This condition favors the onset of the necessary horizontal thermal gradients to trigger the breeze circulation. At the same time, no anomaly of the average pressure at sea level is found, indicating that events are favored when the average synoptic flow is present. Case studies indicate that the convergence location over the peninsula is controlled by the synoptic wind. An average convergence over the peninsula happens from 14:00 to 22:30 UTC, with a maximum at 18:00 UTC. There is a strong potential temperature gradient between the surface of the peninsula and the sea, with the sea breeze circulation system extending up to 1.2 km or higher. The sensible heat flux reaches 80 W/m 2 at the top of mountains and 10 W/m 2 near the coast.",

It is produced when there is a breakdown in the resistance in the electric field between the ground and an electrically charged cloud. By simple observation, we observe that precipitation, especially the most intense, is often accompanied by lightning. Given this observation, lightning has been employed to estimate convective precipitation since 1969. In early studies, mathematical models were deduced to quantify this relationship and used to estimate precipitation. Currently, the use of several techniques to estimate precipitation is gaining momentum, and lightning is one of the novel techniques to complement the traditional techniques for Quantitative Precipitation Estimation. In this paper, the authors provide a survey of the mathematical methods employed to estimate precipitation through the use of cloud-to-ground lightning. We also offer a perspective on the future research to this end.",

It is caused by the fact that the number of active regions that enhance the solar radio emission with respect to the quiet component, as seen from Earth, varies because of the Sun’s rotation about its axis. The analysis is based on solar signals contained in the polar volume data produced during the operational weather scan strategy. This paper presents hundreds of daily comparisons between radar estimates and the Sun’s reference signal, during the current active Sun period (year 2014). The Sun’s reference values are accurately measured by the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory (DRAO) at S-band and converted to C-band using a standard DRAO formula. Vertical and horizontal polarization receivers are able to capture the monthly oscillation of the solar microwave signal: the standard deviation of the log-transformed ratio between radars and the DRAO reference ranges from 0.26 to 0.4 dB. A larger coefficient (and a different value for the quiet Sun component) in the standard formula improves the agreement.",

A whole-layer soil evaporation scheme was developed in the integrated urban land model (IUM) to improve the soil evaporation simulation.

In this paper, the integrated urban land model was validated at one desert site and six urban road sites to emphasize the improvement in the evaporation simulations for arid and urban areas. A sensitivity analysis was implemented in seven basins to expand the utility of the whole layer soil evaporation scheme. For the urban road sites, the validation results indicate that imperious surface evaporation (ISE) plays a crucial role in road surface temperature (RST) simulations on rainy days. For the desert site, the validation results show that the inner layer evaporation is very important in arid regions. For the basins, the analysis results indicate that the relative monthly mean differences in the evapotranspiration (ET) between the simulations with (IUM) and without (Common Land Model (CoLM)) considering the inner layer evaporation range from −8% to 8%, which is proportional to the degree of dryness. In arid areas, especially deserts, the inner layer soil evaporation could not be neglected.",

The path, intensity, precipitation, microphysical processes, and the release of latent heat resulting from the typhoon in all three simulations were analyzed to show that an increase in CCN concentration leads to decreases in intensity and precipitation, an increase of the cloudless area in the eye of the typhoon, a more disordered cloud system, and less latent heat released through microphysical processes, especially the automatic conversion of cloud water into rainwater. Overall, an increase in CCN concentration reduces the total latent heat released during the typhoon suggesting that typhoon modification by aerosol injection may be optimized using numerical simulations to ensure the strongest release of latent heat within the typhoon.",

The results show that the eastward-moving TPV category occurs mostly in May and June, but leastly in July and September. With consecutive enhancement of precipitation intensity and convection intensity, an increasing trend is found in the proportions of deep convection clouds and multiple layer clouds during the TPV category eastward movement. In order to reveal the inner connection among the precipitation intensity, the convection intensity, and the microphysical characteristics of TPV category cloud clusters, the TPV category cloud clusters are classified into different categories by the criteria of the precipitation intensity and the convection intensity separately. Consequently, the two different criteria share the commonality that the number concentration of both ice crystal and cloud droplets increases obviously with the enhancement of precipitation intensity or convection intensity. However, the discrepancy of conclusions also exists between the two classification criteria. A notable stretching upward trend is found in the number concentration distribution of the ice crystal and downward trend in the number concentration distribution of the cloud droplet. The same increasing trend is also discovered in the effective average radius of the ice crystal and cloud droplet. But the TPV category cloud clusters with severe convection do not present the similar variation trend both in the number concentration and the effective average radius. Hence, although the above findings confirm that the precipitation intensity, the convection intensity, and the distribution of cloud hydrometers are associated and interacting mutually, the closed function relationship among them cannot be established, and other meteorology factors related to the ambient conditions should also be taken into consideration as a complete cloud microphysical system.",

    "abstract": "Autumn phenology plays a critical role in terrestrial ecosystem circulations. However, the changes in autumn phenology and their correlation with temperature remain uncertain because mean temperature alone was not able to determine the changes in autumn phenology at various sites. Here, the leaf coloring season (LCS) was defined as the period when the leaves of more than half of the species had recognized changes in color. We systematically studied the changes in peak, start, end, and duration of LCS and their correlations with five temperature parameters (mean temperature, accumulated cold temperature, day temperature, night temperature, and temperature difference between day and night) in four periods. Similarly to previous findings, the start date of LCS advanced and the end of LCS delayed over the past 50 years, which consequently led to a lengthened duration of LCS in Xi’an, Harbin, Minqin, and Shenyang. In general, the rise in mean temperature, day temperature, and night temperature would delay the peak, start, and end of LCS and lengthen the duration of LCS in most cases. We also proved that the changes in LCS metrics not only could completely be explained by mean temperature but also were influenced by day temperature, night temperature, temperature difference, and even other climatic factors such as precipitation, at different sites.",

    "abstract": "Key microphysical processes whose parameterizations have substantial impacts on the simulation of updraft mass fluxes and their response to aerosol are investigated in this study. For this investigation, comparisons of these parameterizations are made between a bin scheme and a bulk scheme. These comparisons show that the differences in the prediction of cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) between the two schemes determine whether aerosol-induced invigoration of updrafts or convection occurs. While the CDNC prediction leads to aerosol-induced invigoration of updrafts and an associated 20% increase in the peak value of the updraft-mass-flux vertical profile in the bin scheme, it leads to aerosol-induced suppression of updrafts and an associated 7% decrease in the peak value in the bulk scheme. The comparison also shows that the differences in ice processes, in particular, in the snow loading lead to the different vertical patterns of the updraft-mass-flux profile, which is represented by the peak value and its altitude, between the schemes. Higher loading of snow leads to around 20–30% higher mean peak value and its around 40% higher altitude in the bin scheme than in the bulk scheme. When differences in the CDNC prediction and ice processes are removed, differences in the invigoration and the vertical pattern disappear between the schemes. However, despite this removal, differences in the magnitude of updraft mass fluxes still remain between the schemes. Associated with this, the peak value is around 10% different between the schemes. Also, after the removal, there are differences in the magnitude between cases with different aerosol concentrations for each scheme. Associated with this, the peak value is also around 10% different between those cases for each scheme. The differences between the cases with different aerosol concentrations for each scheme are generated by different evaporative cooling and different intensity of gust fronts between those cases. The remaining differences between the schemes are generated by different treatments of collection and sedimentation processes.",

The high clouds over the TP are dominated by cirrus and show seasonal variation characteristics. There were two distinct areas with the high occurrence of cirrus clouds in the area (0°–60°N, 75°–103°E). One was located in the regions from the equator to 25°N, and the other was within the latitude belt from 30° to 40°N. From January to May, cirrus clouds mainly occurred in the central and northern parts of the TP (30° to 40°N), and the cirrus cloud fraction increased from January and reached its maximum (∼0.51) in April. From June to August, cirrus clouds mainly occurred in the southern part of the TP during summer. The cirrus clouds over the southern TP were relatively high (located in 10–17 km) and manifested northward and southward movements. The ice clouds in the southern TP are associated with plateau deep convection activities and abundant vapor transmitted by the Asian monsoon. Cirrus clouds over the northern and central TP may be relevant to the atmospheric lift by an approaching cold front and topographic lifting. Moreover, the high clouds below 11 km are dominated by opaque clouds, while the nonopaque (or thin) and opaque (or thick) clouds above 11 km are comparable.",

The results of our investigation revealed that the continued northeastward movement of Yagi on 14 August was related to the divergence of the upper-level westerly jet stream, the northward shift of the subtropical high in the midtroposphere, as well as the steering flow and asymmetrical air flow around the disturbance itself in the lower troposphere. The enhancement of Yagi over the Bohai Sea on the night of 14 August was related to the decrease of friction over the ocean and the increase of diabatic heating from the sea surface flux. The wind speed increased to a maximum when the depression moved over the Bohai Sea, an occurrence that was not only due to the enhancement of the cyclone itself but also due to the flow of cold air from high latitudes along the north side of the Bohai Sea. The behavior of the cold air was related to the shift of the convergence zone in the upper-level westerly jet at 200 hPa, long-wave troughs and ridges at 500 hPa, and terrain effects. Thus, the gale development in the Bohai Sea was due to both the enhancement of tropical cyclone Yagi after it moved over the ocean and the flow of cold air from high latitudes.",

    "abstract": "An analysis based on July-August precipitation reveals that there is a tripole pattern of the precipitation distribution, that is, significantly increased rainfall over North China (NC) is related to the increased rainfall over the Indian subcontinent (IS) and the decreased rainfall over the southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP) and vice versa, that corresponds to the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) and TP heating pattern, which are interactive. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effect of NC rainfall-related atmospheric circulation and the physical linkage with the two thermal forcings together. The linear baroclinic model (LBM) is applied to determine the dynamics of the process. The results show that an enhanced ISM is accompanied by reduced TP heating, favors convection and easterly anomaly over the IS, and produces a Gill-type Rossby wave that affects the vorticity over North Africa. Meanwhile, there is another Rossby wave originating in North Africa and moving eastward to the Pacific Ocean, which interferes with circulation at mid- to high-latitudes, i.e., it strengthens the cyclone over the Baikal region and stretches the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) northward to northeastern Asia, and results in abundant water vapor transported to NC. Furthermore, the strong convection over the IS excites the Kelvin waves over the equatorial region, which moves eastward and generates anticyclones over Philippines, consequently leading to the Pacific-Japan (PJ) pattern. The PJ pattern cooperates with the wave train at midlatitudes, resulting in abundant water vapor being transported to NC. The summer rainfall over NC is therefore modulated by synergistic effect of both the ISM and TP heating.",

Comparing with measuring T p by hand, a T p simulation model could obtain T p data readily. The two-layer energy budget model which divides the soil layer and canopy layer was widely used to predict rice canopy temperature ( T c ), but panicle existed mostly in the upper layer canopy, and we have proved that T c was different from the upper layer canopy temperature ( T c 1 ), and the upper layer must be separated from the whole canopy for the purpose of estimating T p . Thus, we developed the three-layer model, contained upper canopy layer with panicle (50–100 cm), lower rice canopy layer (10–40 cm), and water surface layer (≤10 cm) to estimate T p with general meteorological and vegetation growth data. There were two steps to estimate T p . The first step was calculating T c 1 and lower layer canopy temperature ( T c 2 ) by solving heat balance equations with canopy resistances. And the second step was estimating T p with following parameters: (a) the inclination factors of leaves and panicles ( F 1 , F 2 , and F p ) which were decided by fitting the calculated transmissivity of downward solar radiation (TDSR) to the measured TDSR, (b) the aerodynamic resistance between the panicle and atmosphere ( r ap ) denoted by wind speed, (c) the panicle resistance for transpiration ( r p ) denoted by days after heading, and (d) air temperature and humidity at the panicle’s height ( T ac 1 and e ac 1 ) calculated from the resistances of the pathways of sensible and latent heat fluxes in accordance with Ohm’s law. The model simulated fairly well the T c 1 , T c 2 , and T p with root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.76°C, 0.75°C, and 0.81°C, respectively, where RMSE of measured T p and predicted T p by integrated micrometeorology model for panicle and canopy temperature (IM 2 PACT) including two-layer model was 1.27°C. This model was validated well by two other rice cultivars, and thus, it demonstrated the three-layer model was a new feasible way to estimate T p .",

    "abstract": "The four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var) method has been widely employed as an operational scheme in mainstream numerical weather prediction (NWP) centers. In addition to the ensemble data assimilation method, the randomization technique is still used to diagnose the standard deviations of background error in variational data assimilation (VAR) systems; however, such randomization techniques induce sampling noise, which may contaminate the quality of the standard deviations. First, this paper studies the properties of the sampling noise induced by the randomization technique. The results show that the sampling noise is on a small scale displaying high-frequency oscillations around the estimate compared with the estimate and this difference motivates the use of filtering techniques to eliminate the sampling noise effects. The characteristics of the standard deviation field of the control variables are also investigated, and the standard deviation fields of different model parameters have different scales and vary with the vertical model levels. To eliminate such sampling noise, the spectral filtering method used widely in the operational system and a modified spatial averaging approach are investigated. Although both methods have splendid performance in eliminating sampling noise, the spatial averaging approach is more efficient and easier to implement in operational systems. In addition, the optimal filtered results from the spatial averaging approach are dependent on model parameters and vertical levels, which is consistent with the variation in the standard deviation field. Finally, the spatial averaging approach is tested on the operational system at the global scale based on the YH4DVAR and the global NWP system, and the results indicate that the spatial averaging approach has positive effects on both analysis and forecast quality.",

A Mann–Kendall test and Hurst’s rescaled range analysis were used to detect the change in CI trends. The CI ranged from 0.58 to 0.65, suggesting that a quarter of the rainiest days contributed approximately 69–78% of the total precipitation. The LAC analysis indicated that the nonuniform distribution of precipitation was mainly attributed to a large proportion of days with light rainfall. Compared with that of the central region, the daily precipitation in the western and eastern regions was more irregular. At a seasonal scale, the dry season had a less homogeneous spatial distribution of CI compared to that of the wet season. Most areas exhibited no significant trends in CI from 1970 to 2017. A quarter of the stations presented a significant downward trend in CI, which were primarily found in the central and northern regions. In addition, the future trends of CI in most areas mostly agree with those of the current state; however, the majority of stations exhibited an uneven precipitation distribution in the dry season.",

Most of the precipitation cloud exhibits a shape between square and long strips in the horizontal direction and lanky in the vertical direction. The average rainfall intensity of precipitation clouds is between 0.5 and 6 mm h−1. The average length and width of precipitation clouds show a logarithmic, linear relationship. The distribution of raindrops in precipitation clouds is relatively compact. With the expansion of the area, the precipitation clouds gradually become squatty. The relationship between physical and geometric parameters of precipitation clouds shows that with the precipitation cloud area expanding, the average rainfall rate of precipitation clouds also increases. Heavy convective rainfall is more likely to occur in larger precipitation clouds. For the precipitation clouds of the same size, the area fraction and contribution of convective precipitation are lower than that of stratiform precipitation.",

    "abstract": "China holds the largest amount of reservoirs in the world, while more than 80% of them were constructed 50–70 years ago and are approaching a critical stage of their designed lifetime. Before deciding the future of a reservoir, it is essential to find out whether it could still satisfy its original purpose in the context of hydroclimate change under global warming. Here, we present a case study of the Meishan reservoir in east-central China, which was primarily built for irrigation and flood control in the 1950s. We evaluate the impacts of rainfall change on the hedging and releasing rules over the historical period (1969–2008) by instrumental data and future period (2061–2100) based on simulations in a regional rivalry-mitigated scenario from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) the annual total rainfall has a remarkable increasing trend from 2015 to 2100 and the annual precipitation variability exceeds the envelope range during the past 50-year period. The increased precipitation amount mainly occurs in spring (March to May). (2) The optimal regulation cycle is from September to August and from July to June for both historical and future periods. The limiting level during the nonflooded season is lower than the operating water level for more than five months in the historical period, which limits the ability of reservoir regulation and utilization of water resources. However, the water supply is no longer affected by flood control in 2061–2100 because of the redistribution of annual precipitation. (3) The projected irrigation and residential water demands of the Meishan reservoir are stable; thus, the improvement of the total economic benefit will mainly depend on power generation. This case provides a practical guide for many reservoirs serving water supply for small cities in eastern China, where the size of the population and cultivated land area is stagnant and the climate is getting wetter.",

    "abstract": "Hydropower is sustainable and environmentally friendly source of energy worldwide. Driven by streamflow, it is vulnerable to climate change and land use change. The hydropower production from the two existing run-of-river hydropower projects on the Sondu Miriu River is vulnerable to rainfall variability and requires strategies for building resilience for the local communities. The objective of this study was to identify appropriate and sustainable strategies for integrating climate change adaptation into hydropower development within the Sondu Miriu River Basin. The methodology involved review of existing climate change adaptation strategies to identify appropriate strategies for integrating climate change adaptation in hydropower developments within the Sondu Miriu River Basin. The results indicate that no clear climate change adaptation strategies are being implemented within the basin. A framework is needed to implement appropriate climate change adaptation strategies within the basin. Climate Change act of 2016 created linkage with other existing policies for effective support of integration of climate change adaptation into hydropower development in Sondu Miriu River Basin. Strengthening community resilience to climate change impacts is one of the benefits to be derived from the hydropower projects by supporting appropriate adaptation strategies.",

Three sets of mean monthly precipitation data from 1980 to 2019 were sourced from the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre, the Climate Research Unit, and China Meteorological Information Service Centre. Several indicators that represent the Asian summer monsoon boundary (ASMB) were selected to compare their applicability to the TP region and elucidate the changes in the location of the ASMB in the TP over the last four decades. The results showed that the ASMB in the TP region extends in a southwest-northeast direction, with a clear north-south variation. It reaches as far north as the Kunlun Mountains and as far south as the Himalayas. The largest amplitude in spatial fluctuation occurs in the middle of the TP, and the smallest amplitude occurs at both ends of the region. A “small-large-small” fluctuation pattern was observed from west to east. The water vapor mainly originates from the South Asian region. The South Asian summer monsoon can move the ASMB position northward, whereas the westerly wind moves the ASMB position southward. Variation in the ASMB in the TP region is closely associated with the South Asian monsoon and westerly wind.",

Also, this ensemble prediction provides an estimation of the solar global horizontal irradiance uncertainty (i.e., coverage rate of the prediction interval), which can be useful to provide flexible energy production forecasts. This article displays how the method Kalman filter could be used as an error correction way to alter the predicted irradiance value.

The results show that the amount of short-term extreme precipitation is 1.8 and 3.7 times that of normal precipitation and short-term heavy precipitation, respectively. Considerable interannual and interdecadal fluctuations in the proportion of short-term heavy precipitation and extreme precipitation during summer are affected by typhoons, with a wide range of changes occurring between 1980 and 2000. The areas with high amounts of short-term heavy precipitation and extreme precipitation are distributed mostly in the middle and southern parts of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, whereas areas with a high amount of normal precipitation are distributed mostly in the southeastern parts of the river. The spatial distribution of the three intensities of rainfall affected by typhoons is consistent, with a gradual decrease from southeast to northwest; in addition, the spatial distribution of the proportion of total summer rainfall has similar characteristics. The three intensities of precipitation are affected by the spatial distribution of the typhoon path frequency, and the distribution of the high-value areas is essentially the same as that of precipitation. This indicates that most of the typhoons that affect summer precipitation pass through the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.",

    "abstract": "Neural machine translation (NMT) has been bringing exciting news in the field of machine translation since its emergence. However, because NMT only employs single neural networks to convert natural languages, it suffers from two drawbacks in terms of reducing translation time: NMT is more sensitive to sentence length than statistical machine translation and the end-to-end implementation process fails to make explicit use of linguistic knowledge to improve translation performance. The network model performance of various deep learning machine translation tasks was constructed and compared in English-Chinese bilingual direction, and the defects of each network were solved by using an attention mechanism. The problems of gradient disappearance and gradient explosion are easy to occur in the recurrent neural network in the long-distance sequence. The short and long-term memory networks cannot reflect the information weight problems in long-distance sequences. In this study, through the comparison of examples, it is concluded that the introduction of an attention mechanism can improve the attention of context information in the process of model generation of the target language sequence, thus translating restore degree and fluency higher. This study proposes a neural machine translation method based on the divide-and-conquer strategy. Based on the idea of divide-and-conquer, this method identifies and extracts the longest noun phrase in a sentence and retains special identifiers or core words to form a sentence frame with the rest of the sentence. This method of translating the longest noun phrase and sentence frame separately by the neural machine translation system, and then recombining the translation, alleviates the poor performance of neural machine translation in long sentences. Experimental results show that the BLEU score of translation obtained by the proposed method has improved by 0.89 compared with the baseline method.",

In this study, we analyzed the continuous air pollution records of Weinan city on the Fenwei Plain from 2016 to 2020 to provide specific prevention and control strategies for the region. From 2016 to 2020, pollutant concentrations showed an overall decreasing trend, with a slight increase in O3 concentration. The study found that during the COVID-19 lockdown period, O3 was also significantly affected by the lockdown policy. During the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, anthropogenic emissions were reduced due to restraints on commercial and social activities. NO2 responds sensitively during COVID-19, and PM2.5 has a delayed response. We applied pathway analysis to investigate the contribution of different pollutants and meteorology to PM2.5. The results show that CO and NO2 have the largest positive comprehensive effect, while wind speed and temperature have the largest negative comprehensive effect. Spearman’s correlation analysis shows that NO2 contributes significantly to O3 production in different AQI ranges. We advocate that the NOx should be given more attention and become the new focus of air control.",

    "abstract": "The spatiotemporal characteristics of dry-wet trends were identified and assessed, and the dominant meteorological factors were identified for the climate of Jiangsu province in humid southeastern China for the period 1960–2019. We conducted the research using data for the entire Jiangsu province as well as three major regions in Jiangsu (Huaibei, Jianghuai, and Sunan) with different regional climates. The results showed that decreased precipitation and relative humidity in spring and autumn over the study period were mainly responsible for the dry trends of the climates of all three regions and the entire province. Precipitation had a greater influence in spring and relative humidity in autumn. Decreases in sunshine hours and wind speed were responsible for the summer wet trends of the climates of Huaibei and Jianghuai and the entire province. However, precipitation increased significantly in the summer and was responsible for the increasing wet trend in Sunan. Significantly increased precipitation in winter was primarily responsible for the increasing wetness in Jianghuai and Sunan and the entire province in that season. However, the wet trend in northern Huaibei in winter was mainly caused by the decrease in wind speed over the study period. For the growing season and annually, the positive effects of changes in wind speed, sunshine hours, and precipitation led to increased humidity index in Jianghuai, Sunan, and the entire province. Precipitation showed a decreasing trend that countered the positive effects of decreases in wind speed and sunshine hours, which resulted in a slight decrease in the humidity index in Huaibei for both the growing season and annually. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the humidity index was positively sensitive to precipitation and relative humidity and negatively sensitive to air temperature, wind speed, and sunshine hours in Jiangsu province during 1960–2019. Overall, the humidity index in this region of southeastern China was most sensitive to changes in precipitation followed, in order of sensitivity, by sunshine hours, air temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity. Our findings provide a theoretical basis for adjusting irrigation programs and efficient utilization of water resources at the regional scale in humid southeastern China.",

    "abstract": "Climate reanalysis products have been widely used to overcome the absence of high-quality and long-term observational records for wind energy users. In this study, the applicability of two popular reanalysis datasets (ERA5 and MERRA2) in estimating wind characteristics for four tall tower observatories (TTOs) in South China was assessed. For each TTO, linear and nonlinear downscaling techniques, namely, multiple linear regression (MLR) and an artificial neural network (ANN), respectively, were adopted for the downscaling of the scalar wind speed and the corresponding U/V components. The downscaled wind speed and U/V components were subsequently compared with the TTO observations by correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r), the root mean square error (RMSE), the uncertainty analysis (U95), and the reliability analysis (RE). According to the results, ERA5 had a better applicability (higher Pearson’s r and RE, but lower RMSE and U95) in estimating TTO wind speed than MERRA2 when using both the MLR and ANN downscaling method. The average Pearson’s r, RE, RMSE, and U95 of the downscaled wind from ERA5 by the MLR (ANN) method were 0.66 (0.69), 40.8% (41.8%), 2.20 m/s (2.11 m/s), 0.181 m/s (0.179 m/s), respectively, and 0.60 (0.63), 38.0% (39.7%), 2.32 m/s (2.25 m/s), 0.189 m/s (0.187 m/s), respectively, for MERRA2. The wind components analysis showed that the better performance of ERA5 was attributed to its smaller error in estimating V component than MERRA2. For the wind direction, the two reanalysis datasets did not display distinct differences. Additionally, the misalignment of the wind direction between the reanalysis products and the TTOs was higher for the secondary predominant wind direction (SPWD) than for the predominant wind direction (PWD). Furthermore, we found that the reanalysis U wind had a higher RMSE but a lower RE and Pearson’s r than the V wind, which indicates that the misalignment in the wind direction was mainly associated with the deviation in the U component.",

However, increasing numerous ensemble sizes will enlarge sampling errors. This study proposes a modified Cholesky decomposition based on the covariance localization (CL) scheme, namely a covariance localization scheme with modified Cholesky decomposition (CL-MC). Our main idea utilizes a modified Cholesky (MC) decomposition technique for estimating the background error covariance matrix; meanwhile, we employ the tunable singular value decomposition method on the background error covariance to improve the ensemble increment and avoid the imbalance of the system. To verify if the proposed method can effectively mitigate the sampling errors, numerical experiments are conducted on the Lorenz-96 model and large-scale model (SPEEDY model). The results show that the CL-MC method outperforms the CL method for different data assimilation parameters (ensemble sizes and localizations). Furthermore, by performing one year of assimilation experiments on the SPEEDY model, it is found that the 1-day forecast RMSEs obtained by the CL are approximately equal to the 5-day forecast RMSEs of CL-MC. So, the CL-MC method has potential advantages for long-term forecasting. Maybe the proposed CL-MC method achieves good prospects for widespread application in atmospheric general circulation models.",

    "abstract": "The variation of boundary layer circulation caused by the influence of complex underlying surface is one of the reasons why it is difficult to forecast hourly heavy rainfall (HHR) in the middle Yangtze River Valley (YRV). Based on the statistics of high-resolution observation data, it is found that the low resolution data underestimate the frequency of HHR in the mountain that are between the twain-lake basins in the middle YRV (TLB-YRV). The HHR frequency of mountainous area in the TLB-YRV is much higher than that of Dongting Lake on its left and is equivalent to the HHR frequency of Poyang Lake on its right. The hourly reanalysis data of ERA5 were used to study the variation of boundary layer circulation when HHR occurred. It can be found that the boundary layer circulation corresponding to different underlying surfaces changed under the influence of the weather system. Firstly, the strengthening of the weather system in the early morning resulted in the strengthening of the southwest low-level air flow, which intensified the uplift of the windward slope air flow on the west and south slopes of the mountainous areas in the TLB-YRV. As a result, the sunrise HHR gradually increases from the foot of the mountain. The high-frequency HHR period of sunrise occurs when the supergeostrophic effect is weakened, the low-level vorticity and frontal forcing are strengthened, and the water vapor flux convergence begins to weaken. Secondly, the high-frequency HHR period of the sunset is caused by stronger local uplift and more unstable atmospheric stratification, but the enhanced local uplift is caused by the coupling of the terrain forcing of the underlying surface and the enhanced northern subgeostrophic flow, which causes the HHR to start closer to the mountain top at sunset than at sunrise.",

On millennial-scale, the grain size record is generally consistent with mean stalagmite δ 18 O from Hulu Cave, grain size of Gulang loess sequence, Chinese Loess Plateau, and Greenland ice core δ 18 O. The results show that the millennial-scale variation was well compared with the Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events, indicating that those global events were well documented in lake sediments in the Asian monsoon region.

    "abstract": "We analyze precipitation data from 47 meteorological stations spanning between 1961 and 2012 and NCEP/NCAR reanalysis to understand spatiotemporal variability and change of spring precipitation of South China and their relations to atmospheric circulations. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis and rotated EOF (REOF) are used to reveal dominant spatial structures of precipitation anomaly and Mann-Kendall testing method to determine the temporal locations of abrupt changes during the analyzed time span. We find that the first spatial mode of the spring precipitation of the South China has a domain uniform structure; the second is dominated by a spatial dipole; and the third contains six variability centers. 1980s was the decade of the largest amount of precipitation while 1960s the decade of the smallest amount of precipitation. The spring precipitation also appeared to have a decreasing trend since 2000. We also find that spring precipitation of the South China has experienced a few abrupt changes: sudden increment at 1964, sudden decrement at 2002, and sudden increment at 1995. In addition to these abrupt changes, the precipitation could also be characterized by variability of multiple temporal scales, with dominant periodicities of 4 years, 8 years, and 14 years. The South China spring precipitation is also closely tied to the atmospheric circulations: when Aleutian Low strengthens, westerly weakens, and the center of the Western Pacific subtropical high shifts southeastward in the early spring; and the South China precipitation tends to be abundant (positive anomaly). In contrast, when Ural ridge strengthens, the southern branch of the East Asian trough weakens and the Western Pacific subtropical high shifts northwestward in the early spring, the South China precipitation tends to be reduced (negative anomaly).",

    "abstract": "Precipitation science is becoming a thrivingmultidisciplinary area as a special interest topic for meteorology, climatology, hydrology, remote sensing, and computing science. This is not surprising since precipitation features a key component of many human activities, most notably agriculture and water resources management, making rain estimation and forecasting a relevant research topic for society and policymakers. A better knowledge of precipitation processes is instrumental to respond to increasingly pressing societal needs and to provide better scientific tools for dealing with hydrological problems. This special issue gathers a number of contributions in precipitation science, including radar studies, artificial intelligence methods, modeling, geostatistical analyses, chemical research, satellite estimates, climate variability, data assimilation, computing science, solid precipitation studies, and microphysics. The synergisms between the many approaches are clear.Thus, for instance, surface precipitation is known to be a rough (i.e., not smooth) geophysical field and as such difficult to model. That makes precipitation the prime yardstick to gauge model performance. Therein, improvements in the precise quantification of rain using rain gauges, disdrometers, and satellites translate into bettermodel tuning and at the end improved model validation. The collection illustrates well the observed bloom of the studies focused on the Asian weather and climate, where a precise understanding of precipitation processes is perhaps even more important than in other geographical areas as that part of the world accounts for more than half of the planet population. Moreover, knowledge of such an important atmospheric process as the Meiyu translates into increased ability to model and simulate mesoscale systems in other parts of the planet. It is therefore worthy to pay attention to observations and simulations in that area to advance the precipitation science program: a program that could be defined as a multisource, multidisciplinary, and multinational effort to better understand precipitation physics in the context of increasing societal awareness of the consequences of ongoing global warming.",

Wavelet filter technique was applied to data filtration process. The proposed model was applied to determine the rainfall of five rain gauge meteorological stations in Thailand. The three-hourly rainfall and radar reflectivity data were used in this study. The results indicated that the accumulative rainfall of wavelet filters technique was close to the observed rainfall data more than the results of conventional practice for both calibration and validation processes. Consequently, we are confident that a wavelet filters technique is a useful tool for estimating the rainfall.",

The retrieval algorithm for trace gases exploits the concept of partially scanned interferogram technique, which is a tool mostly suited for Fourier transform spectrometers in the infrared. Minor and trace gases retrievals for July 2010 are presented and compared to in situ observations from five Mediterranean, permanent, stations of the Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) network. The comparison evidences a good general consistency between satellite and in situ observations. IASI retrievals show a marked southeastern gradient, which is shown to be consistent with the general tropospheric circulation over the Mediterranean basin. These patterns are barely seen from in situ observations, a fact which stresses the importance of satellite (trace gases) data assimilation to improve the performance and quality of trace gases transport models.",

During the last four years Stromboli experienced normal activity, volcanic unrests, and an effusive eruption (August–November 2014). The comparative analysis of the recorded data, both in the time and frequency domains, evidenced a peculiar micrometeorological regime at Stromboli, more turbulent during unrests with respect to the quieter periods, but showing an apparent paradox during eruptions, characterized by a lower atmospheric turbulence. These observations suggest that the studied volcanic-micrometeorological system is chaotic, due to contemporary opposite transients generated in the atmosphere by volcanic activity changes, and that micrometeorological conditions in volcanic areas are controlled both by exogenous processes and volcanic activity.",

The numerical simulation successfully reproduced the structure and intensity of super Typhoon Haitang. The model, especially, reproduced the looped path and landfall at nearly the right position. Sensitive experiments indicated that Taiwan’s surface heat fluxes have significant influence on the super Typhoon Haitang. Compared to sensible heat (SH) fluxes, latent heat (LH) is the dominant factor affecting the intensity and rainfall, but they showed opposite effects on intensity and rainfall. LH (SH) flux of Taiwan Island intensified (weakened) Typhoon Haitang’s intensity and structure by transferring more energy from (to) surface. However, only LH played a major role in the looped path before the landfall of the Typhoon Haitang.",

This particular case was chosen based on the strong dry removal that occurred, rendering it ideal for examining the deposition processes. The simulation of synoptic conditions and dry deposition of four dust particles including clay, small silt, large silt, and sand was performed with Eta model, coupled with a desert dust cycle module.

The eigenpoints are located according to the á trous wavelet planes of the QRSP. Based on these concepts, this letter proposes an eigenpoint based multiscale method for validating the QRSPs. The basic idea is that the QRSPs at coarse scales are validated by validating their eigenpoints using the QRSP at fine scale. The QRSP at fine scale is finally validated using observation data at the ground based eigenpoints at instrument scale. The ground based eigenpoints derived from the forecasted QRSP can be used as the observation positions when the satellites pass by the studied area. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is manpower-and time-saving compared with the ideal scanning method and it is satisfying to perform simultaneous observation at these eigenpoints in terms of efficiency and accuracy.",

The ANN-SKlm technique was compared with the Thiessen technique and the ordinary kriging (OK) technique in the study area and the SKlm technique showed the best results. Future rainfall levels have been predicted by downscaling the data from CNRM-CM3 climate model, which was simulated under the A1B scenario. According to the results of future annual average rainfall by each regionalization technique, the Thiessen and OK techniques underestimated the future rainfall when compared to the ANN-SKlm technique. Therefore this methodology will be very useful for the prediction of future rainfall levels under climate change, most notably in a mountainous area.",

We evaluated CMIP5 models in their ability to simulate wind climatology, seasonal cycle, interannual variability, and trends at the pressure levels from 850 hPa to 30 hPa. We also addressed the question of the number of years required to detect statistically significant wind trends using radiosonde wind measurements. Our results show that CMIP5 models and reanalysis successfully reproduced the observed climatological annual mean zonal wind and wind speed vertical distribution. They also capture the observed seasonal zonal, meridional, and wind speed vertical distribution with stronger (weaker) wind during the winter (summer) season. However, there is some disagreement in the magnitude of vertical profiles among CMIP5 models, reanalysis, and radiosonde observation. Overall, the number of years to obtain statistically significant trend decreases with increasing pressure level except for upper troposphere. Although the vertical profile of interannual variability of CMIP5 models and reanalysis agree with the radiosonde observation, the wind trend is not statistically significant. This indicates that detection of trends on local scale is challenging because of small signal-to-noise ratio problems.",

The Aleatory Uncertainty refers to posterior uncertainty of runoff given the input variables’ observations. The Epistemic Uncertainty refers to the posterior uncertainty increase due to the imperfect observation decoding in models. Daily hydrometeorological observations in 24 catchments were aggregated from 10 days to 1 year before implementing the information analysis. Estimations of information contents and flows of hydrologic terms across temporal scales were related with the catchments’ seasonality type. It also showed that information distilled by the monthly and annual water balance models applied here did not correspond to that provided by observations around temporal scale from two months to half a year. This calls for a better understanding of seasonal hydrologic mechanism.",

The three-dimensional (3D) wind field of the squall line in its mature period was retrieved by Guangzhou-Shenzhen dual-Doppler data. The 3D conceptual model of this squall line was proposed. On the horizontal plane, the storm-relative front-to-rear inflow prevailed at the lower altitudes of the leading edge. The rear-to-front cold inflow in the stratiform region was observed below 3 km height, which enhanced the convergence in the convective region. At the middle altitudes of the squall line, the front-to-rear horizontal flow prevailed. Strong updrafts were observed at the lower and middle altitudes of the leading edge. Some convergence centers were located at the lower altitudes of the convective region. Furthermore, the storm-relative flow in the vertical cross-section perpendicular to the squall line was revealed. The front-to-rear warm flow extended from the surface to 7.5 km altitude at the leading edge. Above it, part of the front-to-rear inflow blew upward and then forward, and the other part of the inflow blew backward. The descending rear-to-front cold flow was only seen below 3 km height in the stratiform region.",

    "abstract": "Cotonou, the economic capital of Benin, is suffering from the impacts of climate change, particularly evident through recurrent floods. To effectively manage these floods and address this issue, it is crucial to have a deep understanding of return periods and hydroclimatic parameters (such as intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves and related coefficients), which are essential for designing stormwater drainage structures. Determining return periods and these parameters requires statistical analysis of extreme events, and this analysis needs to be regularly updated in response to climate change. The objective of this study was to determine the necessary return periods and hydroclimatic parameters to improve stormwater drainage systems in the city and its surroundings areas. This required annual maximum precipitation series of 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h for 20 years length (1999–2018) as well as flood record data. The intensity series, derived by dividing the amount of rainfall by its duration, was adjusted using Gumbel’s law. IDF curves were constructed based on Montana and Talbot models, and their coefficients were determined according to the corresponding return periods. In 2010, which witnessed devastating floods in the country, the return period for the most intense rainfall events was 40 years, followed by 2013 with a return period of 13.4 years. Consequently, the commonly used 10-year return period for the design of stormwater drainage structures in Cotonou is insufficient. The Talbot model produced the lowest mean square errors for each quantile series and coefficients of determination closest to one, indicating that the parameters obtained from this model are well suited for designing hydraulic structures in Cotonou. The hydroclimatic parameters presented in this study will contribute to the improved design of hydraulic structures in the city of Cotonou.",

The primary transmission routes and putative source locations of O3 pollution in Nanjing were determined through the integration of trajectory clustering analysis, potential source contribution function (PSCF), and concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis with meteorological data and O3 concentration data. The results showed that the high O3 concentrations and exceedance rates in Nanjing were in late spring and early summer, with the highest in June. The diurnal variation of O3 concentrations in all seasons exhibited a single peak with a maximum from 13:00 to 16:00. The southeasterly flow passing through Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Shanghai dominated the O3 pollution in Nanjing. The PSCF and CWT presented a high consistency of O3 potential sources in Nanjing. Zhenjiang, Ma’anshan, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Huzhou were identified as the main potential source regions of O3 pollution in Nanjing. This study provides accurate theoretical references for regional joint prevention and control of O3 pollution in Nanjing.",

The results showed that (1) in addition to having a significant positive correlation with wind speed, the visibility in winter at the Mianyang Airport has a significant negative correlation with relative humidity, dew point temperature, AQI, PM2.5 concentration, PM10 concentration, and CO, and it has the strongest correlation with relative humidity, and the correlation coefficient is −0.76. (2) The multivariate linear regression model and the KNN model were adopted for grading forecasting experiments on visibility, and the results revealed that both models could be used for visibility grading forecasts. The multiple regression model secures an accuracy of over 70% for forecasts of level 1–5 visibility. In terms of the KNN model, the forecast accuracy is the best when K = 3 or K = 5, notably for level-2, level-4, and level-5 visibility. The forecast accuracy rate is 100% for level-2 visibility, but the forecast for level-1 visibility is poor.

    "abstract": "Due to the unique topography and geographical location, severe snowfall is the main disastrous weather in winter in the Hunan Province of China. Based on the daily precipitation data in Hunan Province from 1961 to 2021, the regional heavy snowfall processes are classified by using the synoptic diagnostic method. In addition, the water vapor transport characteristics of typical heavy snowfall processes are analyzed by the hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) air mass backward trajectory model. Then, the responses of the differences in water vapor transport to heavy snowfall under different weather situations are discussed. The results show that the spatial distribution of climatic mean heavy snowfall days in Hunan Province is extremely uneven, and the heavy snowfall days decrease from north to south, with the most in the Dongting Lake area and the least in the Nanling Mountains. In the past decades, snowstorms mainly occur in local areas, and there are fewer widespread snowstorms. The frequency of heavy snowfall days generally shows a decreasing trend, with three peaks all appearing before 1990. After the 2010s, the number of days and stations of heavy snowfall decreased noticeably, and so did the number of regional heavy snowfall processes. This result indicates that global warming has remarkable effects on the snowstorm events in Hunan Province. Heavy snowfall mainly occurs from December to February, and peaks from mid-January to early February. Over the past 61 years, more than 50% of heavy snowstorm events occurred after 2000. According to the main weather systems affecting regional heavy snowfall processes, these weather processes in Hunan Province can be classified into three categories: southern branch trough (SBT) type, blocking high collapse (BHC) type, and stepped trough type. Among them, the SBT type accounts for more than 60% of the heavy snowfall events in Hunan. In terms of the SBT type and the stepped trough type, the water vapor from the high-latitude inland and low-latitude sea surface accounts for a comparable proportion, each accounting for nearly 50%. For the SBT type, the proportion of the water vapor from warm-humid airflows is slightly higher than that from cold-humid airflows. However, in terms of the stepped trough type, the water vapor transported by cold-humid airflows from the north contributes more than that by warm-humid airflows. For the BHC type, the specific humidity and the water vapor from the high-latitude inland contribute 70% of heavy snowfall processes. In addition, the contribution of the two southwesterly water vapor channels to heavy snowfall processes is small. The water vapor sources differ remarkably for different heavy snowfall types, but all of them are dominated by the water vapor transport in the middle and lower troposphere, which is the main reason why the formation of snowfall areas under different weather types is obviously different.",

Based on the data of the total lightning location system from 2018 to 2022, the total lightning, cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning, and intracloud (IC) lightning activity regularity for the Sichuan province (SC) and its three climate subregions: Sichuan Basin (SB), Panxi district (PD), and West Sichuan Plateau (WSP) are analyzed, and the influences of different climate and topography conditions on lightning activities are also discussed. The results show that (1) for the whole province, the annual mean value of total lightning is about 850 thousand. The SB has the most lightning occurrences, and the WSP has the largest IC and +CG proportion. The southwest of PD, the north-center of PD, and the southeast of SB are the three high-value centers of lightning density. (2) For SB, the better thermodynamic and moisture conditions account for the most lightning occurrences. For PD, the lightning distribution is attributed to the joint effect of specific meteorological conditions and mountainous topography. For WSP, the convections are weak and shallow, which lead to high IC and +CG proportion. (3) The IC lightning mainly occurs below 12 km, and the IC height is much lower on WSP. The spatial and seasonal variation of IC height corresponds well to the cloud base height (CBH) and cloud top height (CTH). (4) The seasonal lightning frequency distribution in the three regions is similar, but the diurnal variation is quite different. The lightning activity mainly occurs between 1400 and 2200 LT on WSP but shows obvious nocturnal in SB.

In preparation of the launch of the Global Change Observation Mission-Climate/Second-Generation GLobal Imager (GCOM-C/SGLI) satellite, an evaluation study on the sensitivity of atmospheric models to variations of atmospheric conditions is conducted. In this evaluation, clear sky and above low clouds water vapour radiances of the upper troposphere obtained from satellite observations and those simulated by atmospheric models are compared. The models studied are the Nonhydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM) and the National Center for Environmental Protection/Department Of Energy (NCEP/DOE). The satellite observations are from the Terra/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Terra/MODIS) satellite. The simulations performed are obtained through a forward radiative transfer calculation procedure. The resulting radiances are transformed into the upper tropospheric brightness temperature (UTBT) and relative humidity (UTRH). The discrepancies between the simulated data and the observations are analyzed. These analyses show that both the NICAM and the NCEP/DOE simulated UTBT and UTRH have comparable distribution patterns. However the simulations’ differences with the observations are generally lower with the NCEP/DOE than with the NICAM. The NCEP/DOE model outputs very often overestimate the UTBT and therefore present a drier upper troposphere. The impact of the lower troposphere instability (dry convection) on the upper tropospheric moisture and the consequences on the models’ results are evaluated through a thunderstorm and moisture predictor (the K-stability index). The results obtained show a positive relation between the instability and the root mean square error (RMSE: observation versus models). The study of the impact of convective clouds shows that the area covered by these clouds increases with the humidity of the upper troposphere in clear sky and above low clouds, and at the same time, the error between the observations and the models also increases. The impact of the above low clouds heat distribution on the models is studied through the relation between the low clouds cover and their effective emissivity. The models’ error appears to be high at midrange effective emissivity clouds.",

A validation climatology is computed using the classic Lorenz energetic formulation, with generation and dissipation components estimated as residuals. The results show a good agreement overall between models and reanalysis for the present day climate, noting that the models generally give more zonal energy and less eddy energy when compared to the reanalysis. Spatial analysis translates the above results as models depicting greater energy associated with the subtropical jet streams than effectively observed. This pattern is observed regardless of season or hemisphere. The projections for future climate scenarios suggest a further increase in the zonal kinetic energy, with a slight average reduction in all other terms. This pattern is seen in association with a substantial decrease in the conversion term mainly associated with sensible heat transport (CA) under a warmer climate. In agreement with recent work in the literature, our results suggest an overall reduction of the global energetics under increasing CO 2 .",

Previous studies on this case used only one or two radars that are very close to this storm. However, three other radars observed the upper-level part of the storm. Because these three radars are located far away from the targeted storm, they were overlooked by previous studies. High-frequency intermittent 3DVAR analyses are performed using the data from five radars that together provide a more complete picture of this storm. The analyses capture a well-defined mesocyclone in the midlevels and the wind circulation associated with a hook-shaped echo. The analyses produced through this technique are used as initial conditions for a 40-minute storm-scale forecast. The impact of multiple radars on a short-term NWP forecast is most evident when compared to forecasts using data from only one and two radars. The use of all radars provides the best forecast in which a strong low-level mesocyclone develops and tracks in close proximity to the actual tornado damage path.",

    "abstract": "Energy shortfalls are becoming more and more serious all over the world, and worldwide governments have tried to promote the development of biofuels in order to mitigate the climatic impacts of massive fossil fuel consumption. Since the land is the main input factor of the bioenergy production, the development of biofuels will inevitably lead to change of the land use structure and allocation and thereby affect the climate system. With Central Europe as the study area, this study explored the impacts of land use/land cover change (LUCC) on climate under the influence of demand of bioenergy production for land resources. First, the land use structure from 2010 to 2050 is simulated with the Agriculture and Land Use model in MiniCam. The result indicates that the main conversion will be mainly from grassland and forest to cropland and from cropland to grassland. Then the Dynamics of Land System model was used to spatially simulate the LUCC in the future. The impacts of LUCC on the climate were analyzed on the basis of simulation with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The climate change will be characterized by the increase of latent heat flux and temperature and the decrease of precipitation.",

    "abstract": "The ability of numerical simulations to predict typhoons has been improved in recent decades. Although the track prediction is satisfactory, the intensity prediction is still far from adequate. Vortex initialization is an efficient method to improve the estimations of the initial conditions for typhoon forecasting. In this paper, a new vortex initialization scheme is developed and evaluated. The scheme requires only observational data of the radius of maximum wind and the max wind speed in addition to the global analysis data. This scheme can also satisfy the vortex boundary conditions, which means that the vortex is continuously merged into the background environment. The scheme has a low computational cost and has the flexibility to adjust the vortex structure. It was evaluated with 3 metrics: track, center sea-level pressure (CSLP), and maximum surface wind speed (MWSP). Simulations were conducted using the WRF-ARW numerical weather prediction model. Super and severe typhoon cases with insufficiently strong initial MWSP were simulated without and with the vortex initialization scheme. The simulation results were compared with the 6-hourly observational data from Hong Kong Observatory (HKO). The vortex initialization scheme improved the intensity (CSLP and MWSP) prediction results. The scheme was also compared with other initialization methods and schemes.",

The CloudSat/CALIPSO data were used to extract the cloud and aerosol profiles properties. The mean value of cloud occurrence probability (COP) was the highest in the mixed cloud layer (−40°C~0°C) and the lowest in the warm cloud layer (&gt;0°C). The atmospheric humidity was more statistically relevant to COP in the warm cloud layer than aerosol condition. The differences in COP between the two regions in the mixed cloud layer and ice cloud layer (&lt;−40°C) had good correlations with those in the aerosol extinction coefficient. A radar reflectivity factor greater than −10 dBZ occurred mainly in warm cloud layers and mixed cloud layers. A high-COP zone appeared in the above-0°C layer with cloud thicknesses of 2-3 km in both regions and in all the four seasons, but the distribution of the zonal layer in R2 was more continuous than that in R1, which was consistent with the higher aerosol optical thickness in R2 than in R1 in the above-0°C layer, indicating a positive correlation between aerosol and cloud probability.",

The suppression method is constructed using maximum likelihood methodology in time domain and is called parametric time domain method (PTDM). The procedure relies on the assumption that precipitation and clutter signal spectra follow a Gaussian functional form. The multiple interleaved pulse repetition frequencies (PRFs) that are used in this work are set to four PRFs (952, 833, 667, and 513 Hz). Based on radar simulation, it is shown that the new method can provide accurate retrieval of Doppler velocity even in the case of strong clutter contamination. The obtained velocity is nearly unbiased for all the range of Nyquist velocity interval. Also, the performance of the method is illustrated on simulated radar data for plan position indicator (PPI) scan. Compared with staggered 2-PRT transmission schemes with PTDM, the proposed method presents better estimation accuracy under certain clutter situations.",

The difference of calculated precipitation using these two methods is generally smaller for stable precipitation systems and larger for unstable precipitation systems. If the echo intensity signal is sinusoidal, the discrepancy between the two methods is most significant. For stratiform and convective precipitation, the normalized error ranges from −0.138 to −0.15 and from −0.11 to −0.122, respectively. If the echo intensity signal is linear, the normalized error ranges from 0 to −0.13 and from 0 to −0.11, respectively. If the echo intensity signal is exponential, the normalized error ranges from 0 to −0.35 and from 0 to −0.30, respectively.

The PMCS can capture autocorrelated images of precipitation particles by double-exposure in one frame, by which the size, axis ratio, and fall velocity of precipitation particles can be calculated. The PMCS is calibrated by a series of glass balls with certain diameters under varying light conditions, and a self-adaptive threshold method is proposed. The shape, axis ratio, and fall velocity of raindrops were calculated and discussed based on the field measurement results of PMCS. The typical shape of large raindrop is an oblate ellipsoid, the axis ratio of raindrops decreases linearly with the diameter, the fall velocity of raindrops approaches its asymptote, and the above observed results are in good agreement with the empirical models; the synchronous observation of a PMCS, an OTT PARSIVEL disdrometer, and a rain gauge shows that the PMCS is able to measure the rain intensity, accumulated rainfall, and drop size distribution with high accuracy. These results have validated the performance of PMCS.",

The results show that the highest temperature variability occurs in the weak wind and decoupled state and in the transition between flow regimes. In agreement with previous efforts, the results indicate that the reduction of diurnal temperature range is related to the existence of two distinct flow regimes in the stable boundary layer. However, in the decoupled state, the occurrence of intermittent bursts of turbulence may cause temperature variations among the different scenarios to become unpredictable. It implies that it is difficult to predict the diurnal temperature range in places where low winds are common.",

Then, histogram differences between dust load classes are used to describe the impact of dust load on cloud property statistics. The analysis of the histogram differences shows that ice crystal sizes are reduced with increasing aerosol load and ice cloud optical depth and ice water path are increased. The distributions of all three variables broaden and get less skewed in dusty environments. For ice crystal size the significant bimodality is reduced and the order of peaks is reversed. Moreover, it is shown that not only are distributions of ice cloud variables simply shifted linearly but also variance, skewness, and complexity of the cloud variable distributions are significantly affected. This implies that the whole cloud variable distributions have to be considered for indirect aerosol effects in any application for climate modelling.",

The analysis reveals the following synoptic scale processes as significant contributors: (1) upper level jet splitting and merging, (2) advection of cold arctic air at low levels by a large anticyclone, and (3) an incoming upper level shortwave trough. In addition to the synoptic scale processes, the following mesoscale features played a major role in this snowstorm event: coexisting potential (convective) instability and conditional symmetric instability, terrain blocking, and a double LLJ development process. Sensitivity experiments including (1) limiting the orographic effects of elevated plateau in Texas and the Sierra Madre Mountains in Mexico by reducing the terrain height to 225 meters, (2) the microphysics/latent heating effects, and (3) surface fluxes on the development and intensity of the snowstorm were also conducted by turning these options off in the numerical model.

The determination of optimal sampling strategies that effectively utilize available resources to maximize the information content of the collected ocean data is becoming an open problem. The historical sea surface temperature (SST) dataset contains the spatial variability information of SST, and this prior knowledge can be used to optimize the configuration of sampling points. Here, a configuration method of sampling points based on the variability of SST is studied. Firstly, in order to get the spatial variability of SST in the ocean field to be sampled, the historical SST data of the field is analyzed.

Finally, to evaluate the sampling performance of the new configuration method of sampling points, the SST field is reconstructed by the method based on compression sensing algorithm. Results show that the proposed optimal configuration method of sampling points significantly outperforms the traditional random sampling points distribution method in terms of reconstruction accuracy. These results provide a new method for configuring sampling points of ocean in situ observation with limited resources.",

Generating spatiotemporally continuous SAT fields using spatial interpolation represents an approach to address this problem. This study proposed a backpropagation artificial neural network (BPANN) optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) to estimate the monthly SAT fields of the Antarctic continent for the period 1960–2019. Cross-validations demonstrate that the interpolation accuracy of GA-BPANN is higher than that of two benchmark methods, i.e., BPANN and multiple linear regression (MLR). The errors of the three interpolation methods feature month-dependent variations and tend to be lower (larger) in warm (cold) months. Moreover, the annual SAT had a significant cooling trend during 1960–1989 (trend = −0.07°C/year; <a:math xmlns:a=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <a:mi>p</a:mi> <a:mo>=</a:mo> <a:mn>0.04</a:mn> </a:math> ) and a significant warming trend during 1990–2019 (trend = 0.06°C/year; <c:math xmlns:c=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M2\"> <c:mi>p</c:mi> <c:mo>=</c:mo> <c:mn>0.05</c:mn> </c:math> ).

Furthermore, the Antarctic SAT decreases with latitude and the distance away from the coastline, but the eastern Antarctic is overall colder than the western Antarctic. Spatiotemporal inconsistencies on SAT trends are apparent over the Antarctic continent, e.g., most of the Antarctic continent showed a cooling trend during 1960–1989 (trend = −0.20∼0°C/year; <e:math xmlns:e=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M3\"> <e:mi>p</e:mi> <e:mo>=</e:mo> <e:mn>0.01</e:mn> <e:mo>∼</e:mo> <e:mn>0.27</e:mn> </e:math> ) with a peak over the central part of the eastern Antarctic continent, while the entire Antarctic continent showed a warming trend during 1990–2019 (trend = 0∼0.10°C/year; <g:math xmlns:g=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M4\"> <g:mi>p</g:mi> <g:mo>=</g:mo> <g:mn>0.04</g:mn> <g:mo>∼</g:mo> <g:mn>0.42</g:mn> </g:math> ) with a peak over the higher latitudes.",

However, the temporal and spatial variability of precipitation leads to large errors in radar estimates of mixed precipitation. To improve the accuracy of radar QPE, we propose an offline spatiotemporal deep fusion model that uses the reflectivity data of the Shijiazhuang Doppler radar Z9311 and the precipitation data from 17 national weather stations (NWSs) and 260 automatic weather stations (AWSs). Considering the abrupt spatial changes in precipitation, a three-dimensional radar data structure is proposed, and the spatial features of multielevation and multiscale radar data are extracted and merged using the feature fusion network (FFNet). Finally, the time dependence of the precipitation is captured using the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and the precipitation estimation is obtained. Based on a comparison of the results of the proposed model (FFNet-LSTM) with those of the ordinary kriging (OK) interpolation, two Z-R relationship, the multilayer perceptron (MLP), the LSTM, and the FFNet, the proposed method is superior to these models, has a promising performance, and is a general-purpose rainfall algorithm.",

At the same time, the LST of the same type of factors in the same city will have a difference of ±2.5°C due to the different surrounding features.

A well-known statistical estimation theoretic approach, namely, Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE), is examined on 16 member models. The results are compared with superensemble methodology based on various skill scores. Results show that BLUE is providing promising forecasts. As far as comparative studies are concerned BLUE and superensemble schemes compete and show their importance from normal years to extreme rainfall years. BLUE methodology is capable of predicting draughts very well compared with other multimodel schemes. One basic advantage of BLUE is computationally less expensive than superensemble scheme.

In recent decades, considerable research has focused on the trends and evolution of SAT on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). However, assessment of the uncertainties in SAT change on the TP has not been done adequately, which is of considerable importance for climate research. Using station-observed SAT data from the TP, this study estimates long-term variations and trends of sampling error variances in gridded monthly SAT data over recent decades. Results revealed large sampling error variances in northern and western parts of the TP but small variances in eastern, southern, and central areas. The sampling error variances also exhibited strong monthly variations with maximum errors in winter and minimum values in summer. Furthermore, spatial distributions of the trends of seasonal and annual mean sampling error variances were found distributed unevenly with decreasing trends found mainly in central and southern parts of the TP and increasing trends in northeastern, southeastern, and northwestern areas. Additionally, differences were also found in the trends of seasonal and annual mean sampling error variances on various timescales.",

    "abstract": "This study simulated the evolution of Typhoon Hato (2017) with the Weather Research and Forecasting model using three bulk schemes and one bin scheme. It was found that the track of the typhoon was insensitive to the microphysics scheme, whereas the degree of correspondence between the simulated precipitation and the cloud structure of the typhoon was closest to the observations when using the bin scheme. The different microphysical structure of the bin and three bulk schemes was reflected mainly in the cloud water and snow content. The three bulk schemes were found to produce more cloud water because the application of saturation adjustment condensed all the water vapor at the end of each time step. The production of more snow by the bin scheme could be attributed to several causes: (1) the calculations of cloud condensation nucleus size distributions and supersaturation at every grid point that cause small droplets to form at high levels, (2) different fall velocities of different sizes of particles that mean small particles remain at a significant height, (3) sufficient water vapor at high levels, and (4) smaller amounts of cloud water that reduce the rates of riming and conversion of snow to graupel. The distribution of hydrometeors affects the thermal and dynamical structure of the typhoon. The saturation adjustment hypothesis in the bulk schemes overestimates the condensate mass. Thus, the additional latent heat makes the typhoon structure warmer, which increases vertical velocity and enhances convective precipitation in the eyewall region.",

This research examines the changes in the surface of HIW and its role in air temperature (Tair) using data on land surface temperature (LST), vegetation, wind speed, and relative humidity. The Cubist regression model (CRM) is used to simulate the effects of land surface factors (LSFs) on Tair. Four microsites with different plant cover percentages were selected for this purpose. After data collection, 75% of the data were used for modeling and 25% of the data were used for model testing. The results showed that CRM has adequate performance for estimating Tair. The assessment of the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and Tair at 2 meter height showed that there was a high correlation coefficient between 0.86 and 0.91 in the different microsites. The results of using CRM for estimating Tair showed that this model can estimate air temperature from independent parameters of LST, wind speed, vegetation percentage, and relative humidity with a correlation coefficient of 0.98. In this model, the LST, relative humidity, and vegetation percentage were entered with values of 100%, 93%, and 83% respectively.

    "abstract": "On May 11, 2022, despite the favorable upper and lower-level circulation patterns of the high-altitude trough, shear line, and southwest jet stream, the urban cluster of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area experienced light to moderate rainfall, deviating significantly from the forecasted heavy rain and local heavy rainstorm. This study explores the reasons for false alarms and predictability using ground observation data, radar data, ECMWF-ERA5 reanalysis field data, and ECMWF and CMA-TRAMS forecast data. The results indicate that the warm and moist airflow transported by the low-level jet stream was intercepted by the upstream MCS (mesoscale convective system) along the coastal area of western Guangdong, and inadequate conditions of negative vorticity dynamics led to insufficient moisture, thermodynamic, and dynamic conditions over the urban cluster, preventing the triggering of heavy precipitation. In addition, the 700 hPa westerly flow guiding the airflow and the stable low-level shear line, coupled with surface convergence lines, influenced the northward or southward movement of MCSs along the coastal and inland regions of western Guangdong. The weak and discontinuous intensity of echoes in the upstream Zhaoqing region further hindered the influence of surrounding echoes on the urban cluster. Numerical forecast models ECMWF and CMA-TRAMS overestimated the 850 hPa windspeed and 925 hPa meridional windspeed, resulting in the forecasted urban cluster experiencing heavy rain. Sensitivity tests of wind fields indicate that the 850 hPa wind field information is more sensitive to precipitation in the urban cluster. In this process, weak signal correction can be achieved in strong precipitation forecasts using the distinct signal of lower 850 hPa water vapor flux divergence compared to 925 hPa. Therefore, in the future, when the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area encounters similar warm-sector heavy rainfall events, adjustments to model forecasts can be made using specific 850 hPa elements such as wind speed, water vapor flux divergence, or specific humidity to enhance predictive accuracy.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to quantify the magnitude of latent heat release by strong typhoons in the Northwest Pacific region and to identify the key cloud microphysical processes that affect the release of latent heat. The Weather Research and Forecasting mesoscale numerical model was used to simulate Typhoon Songda from 2011. Single‐ and double‐moment 6‐class (WSM6 and WDM6) cloud microphysics schemes were used to simulate the 3D structure and evolution of latent heat release. Simulations show that condensation of cloud water is the main source of latent heat release, while the main sources of latent heat absorption are evaporation of rain and cloud water. Depositional heating in cold cloud processes in the upper troposphere also plays an important role in the evolution of typhoon intensity. Latent heat release and absorption simulated by both schemes evolve through the phases of intensifying, maintaining, and weakening during the lifetime of the typhoon. The largest latent heat release occurs at altitudes between 5 and 10 km; condensational heating plays a major role at altitudes below 6 km, while depositional heating is the dominant process at altitudes from 6 to 12 km. Compared with WSM6, the WDM6 scheme produces smaller absolute values of latent heating from condensation and evaporation of cloud water and a more reasonable vertical distribution of cloud water mixing ratio. Positive latent heating from WDM6 is larger than that from WSM6. However, because of stronger processes of evaporation of rainwater and sublimation of cloud ice, total net latent heat release is lower in WDM6, and hence, simulated typhoon intensity is higher in WSM6.",

Two multivariate models, the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model and vector error correction model (VECM), are compared to examine whether there is any long‐ or short‐run association between variables. It is observed that the ARDL model shows long‐ and short‐run associations between inflow, outflow, and levels. In contrast, VECM shows only a long‐run association between the variables.

The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) dual‐frequency precipitation radar (DPR) provides improved three‐dimensional observation data of strong and weak precipitation and performs effective observations in alpine mountain regions. Therefore, this study used GPM/DPR Level‐3 data from January 2015 to December 2022 to analyze the convective and stratiform precipitation characteristics over Xinjiang. The results showed that (1) the range of maximum precipitation reflectivity factors (PRF_max) near the ground and at different heights were larger in summer and maximum PRF_max values appeared in areas along the Altai, Tianshan, and Kunlun Mountains and plains on the respective mountain slopes. In summer, the PRF_max of stratiform (convective) precipitation nearsurface ranged from 24 to 34 dBZ (28–40 dBZ). (2) The two types of precipitation exhibited the highest storm top heights in summer, with convective precipitation having higher values than stratiform precipitation and mountainous areas having higher values than the surrounding basins due to the effects of topographic uplift. (3) The value domains of the PRF, particle mass‐weighted diameter ( D m ), and particle number concentration for stratiform (convective) precipitation were more concentrated (wider), that is, PRF: 14–30 dBZ (12–40 dBZ), D m : 0.9–1.4 mm (0.7–2.1 mm), and the particle concentration: 29–35 (24–39). The height of the center of the probability density of each variable was higher in the three major mountain ranges than in the two major basins owing to the influence of topography. PRF increased and then decreased with height. Convective raindrops were in an active state of high concentration and exhibited a large scale in the lower layers, whereas the particle spectral parameters of stratiform precipitation showed a more concentrated and symmetric distribution and insignificant changes with height.",

The major LULCC during 2001–2018 were conversions from grasslands to croplands over the central regions of Northeast China and conversions from woody savannas to deciduous broadleaf forests in the northern and eastern portions of Northeast China. The changes in Fg and albedo are highly correlated with the daytime land surface temperature ( T s ). From 2001 to 2018, the daytime T s is decreased (increased) over the central regions of Northeast China by more than 1 K in summer (winter). There is also a widespread, about 1 K, cooling in the spring and autumn temperatures. The changes of the nighttime T s and the daytime T s from 2001 to 2018 are similar in summer, autumn, and winter, but the nighttime T s changes are comparatively smaller. Analysis of the surface energy budget and the biophysical effects found that the cooling of the daytime T s over the central regions of Northeast China in spring, summer, and autumn from 2001 to 2018 can be attributed to a decrease of absorbed shortwave radiation and an increase of latent heat flux corresponding to LULCC. This cooling is weakened by the decrease of the sensible heat flux. In contrast, the widespread warming trend of the daytime T s in winter is mainly due to an increased net shortwave radiation, which offsets the cooling effects of surface fluxes. During the nighttime, the soil heat flux contributes the most to the changes of T s .",

As bias exists between the model simulated and observed surface albedo, data assimilation is an important method to improve the simulation results. Moreover, surface albedo is associated with the wavelength of the sunlight. So, solar radiation partitioning is important to parameterize the surface albedo. In this paper, the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer- (MODIS-) retrieved direct visible, direct near-infrared, diffuse visible, and diffuse near-infrared surface albedos were assimilated into the integrated urban land model (IUM). The solar radiation partitioning method was introduced to parameterize the surface albedo. Based on the albedo data from MODIS and the solar radiation partitioning method, the surface albedo data set for the Beijing municipal area was generated. Based on the surface albedo data set and the IUM, the impacts of the surface albedo on the surface radiation budget were discussed quantitatively. Surface albedo is inversely proportional to the net radiation. For urban areas, after assimilation, the annual average net radiation decreases about 5.6%. For cropland, grassland, and forest areas, after assimilation, the annual average net radiations increase about 20.2%, 24.3%, and 18.7%, respectively.",

The characteristics of the roles played by different cities and ecosystem types to contribute to the thermal environment of the metropolitan region were summarized, and the differences and changes in the corresponding contribution intensity of various ecosystem types were measured. The results indicate the following: (1) Different cities play different roles as the sources and sinks with respect to the thermal environment in the daytime and nighttime. Based on the diurnal differences of the contribution indices, cities can be divided into three types: the day-night heat source type, the day-sink and night-source type, and the day-night heat sink type. (2) The farmland and the grassland ecosystems are the most important source and sink landscapes in the thermal environment of the Sichuan-Chongqing Region, respectively. (3) The region is affected by the spatial arrangement of the internal ecosystems and its own development conditions, and, consequently, there are significant temporal-spatial variations and role transitions between heat source and heat sink regarding the contribution of different ecosystem types to the thermal environment of individual cities. It is important to scientifically regulate the thermal environment effect on tourism destinations and maintain the comfort and sustainable development through identifying the source and sink ecosystems of the thermal environment, controlling the quantity and spatial arrangement of the heat source ecosystems, and fully enabling the cooling effect of the heat sink ecosystems.",

Results show that significant diurnal variations of PWV are found at the 18 GPS stations. The harmonics with 24 h cycle (diurnal cycle) over PL (i.e., Duchang and Poyang) and Nanchang city only have about 50% (or even smaller than 50%) of variance contribution with the amplitude of about 0.2 mm, while above 70% (or even 80%) of variance contribution occurs elsewhere around PL, with the amplitude of about 0.9 mm. The harmonics with diurnal cycles in most stations peak from afternoon to evening (i.e., 1200-2000 LST), but one exception is Duchang site, where the diurnal cycle peaks in the morning (i.e., 1000 LST). Moreover, the harmonics with 12 h cycle (semidiurnal cycle) have the relatively uniform amplitude of about 0.2 mm, but their variance contributions show uneven distribution, with the contributions of about or above 50% in PL and Nanchang city (the semidiurnal cycles peak about 0000 LST or 1200 LST) and below 30% (or even 10%) in other areas. The preliminary diagnosis analysis shows that the diurnal variation of the low-level (below 850 hPa) air temperature (increasing after the sunrise, decreasing after the sunset, and peaking around 1400-1800 LST) may be responsible for the diurnal cycle. Moreover, in PL (Duchang and Poyang) and Nanchang city, the effects (heating or cooling) of lake and urban, the diurnal variation of the 10 m wind over PL, and the acceleration of PL on overlying air also contributed to the diurnal variation of PWV.",

    "abstract": "Variations in all-sky and clear-sky long-wave effective radiation (LER) in China during the period 2001–2016 were determined using monthly radiative datasets from the Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES). Annual and seasonal spatial distributions are found to be quite similar and show a decreasing trend from northwest to southeast, although highest values are found in spring. Mean LER under clear-sky conditions is approximately 20–30 Wm −2 higher than that under all-sky conditions. There is a consistent downward trend in annual and seasonal variations of LER under different weather conditions in China especially after 2007. In northwest China, the eastern Tibetan Plateau, and southeast and northeast China, LER is significantly reduced in two weather conditions and this is more pronounced in spring. However, decreases in clear-sky LER are more obvious. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) results for LER differences between all-sky conditions and clear-sky conditions were used to analyze regional characteristics and modulating factors. The first mode shows that the LER differences of two weather conditions over China become larger and significant after 2007. The second mode reflects the spatial characteristics, and four climate regions are divided according to the second pattern. According to the definition of LER, regression analysis shows that downward long-wave radiation has a greater influence on LER. When considering cloud effects and other modulating factors, LER has higher correlation with relative humidity in climate regions 3 and 4. However, there are higher negative correlations with middle and high clouds in regions 1 and 2, which are modulated by cloud characteristics. When these factors influence LER together, their correlation is significant in all regions (correlation coefficients are on average higher than 0.7). In summary, changes of LER can well reflect the change of climate system.",

The results reveal that the sweeping changes in PR show generally positive trends throughout the fall seasons of the past decades. Moreover, the climatic indices have an effect on the PR over SA within the fall months and season. During the study period, the most substantial relationship recorded, with an inverse correlation of −0.7, is between the PR over SA and the climatic index of GSAT for September and October. Moreover, there is a clear correlation of +0.5 between the PR over SA and the ENSO and Nino 3.4 index for October and November.",

Here the TC frequency (TCF), lifespan, and genesis position of TCs are analysed. A distinctive negative correlation between subsurface water temperature and TCF is observed, especially the TCF in the southeastern quadrant of the WNP (0–15°N, 150–180°E). According to the detrended subsurface temperature anomalies of the 125 m depth layer in the main TC genesis area (0–30°N, 100–180°E), we selected the subsurface cold and warm years. During the subsurface cold years, TCs tend to have a longer mean lifespan and a more southeastern genesis position than the subsurface warm years in general. To further investigate the causes of this characteristic, the TC genesis potential indexes (GPI) are used to analyse the contributions of environmental factors to TC activities. The results indicate that the negative correlation between subsurface water temperature and TCF is mainly caused by the variation of TCF in the southeastern quadrant of the WNP, where the oceanic and atmospheric environments are related to ocean subsurface conditions. Specifically, compared with the subsurface warm years, there are larger relative vorticity, higher relative humidity, smaller vertical wind shear, weaker net longwave radiation, and higher ocean mixed layer temperature in the southeastern quadrant during cold years, which are all favorable for genesis and development of TC.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, a frequently employed technique named the sparsity-promoting dynamic mode decomposition (SPDMD) is proposed to analyze the velocity fields of atmospheric motion. The dynamic mode decomposition method (DMD) is an effective technique to extract dynamic information from flow fields that is generated from direct experiment measurements or numerical simulation and has been broadly employed to study the dynamics of the flow, to achieve a reduced-order model (ROM) of the complex high dimensional flow field, and even to predict the evolution of the flow in a short time in the future. However, for standard DMD, it is hard to determine which modes are the most physically relevant, unlike the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method which ranks the decomposed modes according to their energy content. The advanced modal decomposition method SPDMD is a variant of the standard DMD, which is capable of determining the modes that can be used to achieve a high-quality approximation of the given field. It is novel to introduce the SPDMD to analyze the atmospheric flow field. In this study, SPDMD is applied to extract essential dynamic information from the 200 hPa jet flow, and the decomposed results are compared with the POD method. To further demonstrate the extraction effect of POD/SPDMD methods on the 200 hPa jet flow characteristics, the POD/SPDMD reduced-order models are constructed, respectively. The results show that both modal decomposition methods successfully extract the underlying coherent structures from the 200 hPa jet flow. And the DMD method provides additional information on the modal properties, such as temporal frequency and growth rate of each mode which can be used to identify the stability of the modes. It is also found that a fewer order of modes determined by the SPDMD method can capture nearly the same dynamic information of the jet flow as the POD method. Furthermore, from the quantitative comparisons between the POD and SPDMD reduced-order models, the latter provides a higher precision than the former, especially when the number of modes is small.",

The results of the return cross test for the historical years from 1979 to 2008 and independent sample return test from 2009 to 2018 show that this statistical model has a good performance in predicting the summer precipitation in the WMR, especially in the flood years.

    "abstract": "In precipitation nowcasting, it is common to track the motion of precipitation in a sequence of weather radar images and to extrapolate this motion into the future. The total error of such a prediction consists of an error in the predicted location of a precipitation feature and an error in the change of precipitation intensity over lead time. So far, verification measures did not allow isolating the extent of location errors, making it difficult to specifically improve nowcast models with regard to location prediction. In this paper, we introduce a framework to directly quantify the location error. To that end, we detect and track scale-invariant precipitation features (corners) in radar images. We then consider these observed tracks as the true reference in order to evaluate the performance (or, inversely, the error) of any model that aims to predict the future location of a precipitation feature. Hence, the location error of a forecast at any lead time Δt ahead of the forecast time t corresponds to the Euclidean distance between the observed and the predicted feature locations at t + Δt. Based on this framework, we carried out a benchmarking case study using one year worth of weather radar composites of the German Weather Service. We evaluated the performance of four extrapolation models, two of which are based on the linear extrapolation of corner motion from t − 1 to t (LK-Lin1) and t − 4 to t (LK-Lin4) and the other two are based on the Dense Inverse Search (DIS) method: motion vectors obtained from DIS are used to predict feature locations by linear (DIS-Lin1) and Semi-Lagrangian extrapolation (DIS-Rot1). Of those four models, DIS-Lin1 and LK-Lin4 turned out to be the most skillful with regard to the prediction of feature location, while we also found that the model skill dramatically depends on the sinuosity of the observed tracks. The dataset of 376,125 detected feature tracks in 2016 is openly available to foster the improvement of location prediction in extrapolation-based nowcasting models.",

    "abstract": "At present, there is insufficient research on the refinement of the vertical structure of winter snowstorm systems in arid areas, and, compared with the central and eastern China, the observation sites in arid areas of northwestern China are scarce. To deepen the understanding of dynamics and microphysical processes and improve the level of forecasting and warning of snowstorms in northwestern China, the Institute of Desert Meteorology, China Meteorological Administration, Urumqi, carried out the Central Asia Extreme Precipitation Observation Test (CAEPOT) in Yili, Xinjiang, a typical arid region in China in February 2020. This paper uses multiple fine detection datasets obtained from the CAEPOT, including radar wind profiler, ground-based microwave radiometer, and millimeter-wave cloud radar to analyze macroscopic characteristics and microphysical changes of snowstorm system in Xinjiang. Studies have shown that the low trough with sufficient moisture, heat, power conditions, and weakening banded cloud system, which moved eastward from the Aral Sea to the west of Xinjiang during the snowstorm, were the key influencing system of this snowstorm. Before the snowstorm, the vertical shear of the horizontal wind field was severe, which aggravated the instability of the atmosphere, and there was upward motion in the lower atmosphere. A variety of physical quantities related to moisture showed a tendency to increase at the lower level and could be used as an early warning signal for snowstorm about 8 hours in advance, and the cloud and snow particles observed by millimeter-wave cloud radar were simultaneously developing upward and downward from 4 km, providing snowstorm warning 12 hours in advance. During the snowstorm, the horizontal wind speed and vertical speed were obviously enhanced, and the physical quantities related to moisture further increased, and, with the blocking and uplifting of the Tianshan Mountains, the snowstorm increased. The particles collided and grew while falling, resulting in a decrease in particle concentration and an increase in particle radius from high altitude to the ground, eventually resulting in near-ground reflectivity factor up to 30 dBz. In addition, reflectivity factor, physical quantities related to moisture, wind field, particle concentration, and particle radius all had a good correspondence with the beginning, end, and intensity of snowstorm, so when the physical quantities mentioned above weakened and stopped, snowstorm also weakened and stopped. In a word, this research is an important and meaningful work that provides more backgrounds and references for the forecast and warning of snowstorm in northwestern China.",

    "abstract": "Global warming and the intensification of extreme temperature events have been major issues around the world in recent decades. Understanding changes in temperature extremes is critical to assessing and responding to the risks associated with regional temperature change. This paper takes the Longtan watershed as the research object, and 11 extreme temperature indices were calculated based on the meteorological observation data from 1959 to 2017. The Mann-Kendall trend mutation test, Empirical Orthogonal Function, and other methods were used to explore the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of temperature extremes. Meanwhile, the simulation effects of temperature were analyzed based on 11 CMIP5 climate models, and the extreme temperature change in 2021–2050 under the high emission scenario RCP8.5 and low emission scenario RCP4.5 was estimated. The main results are as follows: both the warm-related indices and the extreme minimum temperature show an increasing trend. The cold-related frequency indices all show a decreasing trend. The spatial distribution of most temperature extremes increases or decreases from southwest to northeast, and the fluctuation is obvious with the alternation of positive and negative positions of the time. In the next 30 years, compared with the reference period 1961–1990, under the RCP4.5, the multiyear average of the Extreme Tmax and the multiyear average of the Extreme Tmin increase by 2.1°C and 0.4°C, respectively, and by 2.0°C and 0.3°C under the RCP8.5. Overall, the frequency of extreme cold events decreases, and the frequency of extreme warm events increases. There is a warming trend in temperature extremes.",

The image of the basketball shooting trajectory is captured using imaging technology; the image is then preprocessed in four steps: binary erosion, binary expansion, closing operation, and opening operation to create a smooth image. After removing the background from the preprocessed image using the background difference method, the edge contour features are extracted, the candidate target area is set based on the extraction result, and a diagonal matrix reflecting the length and width of the trajectory target is introduced to calculate the probability of the color of the area in the shooting trajectory, thereby characterizing the trajectory. The target’s size changes in two directions to capture the basketball shooting trajectory automatically. The algorithm’s simulation results indicate that it has a higher accuracy and a shorter capture time.",

    "abstract": "Reuse of reclaimed water in constructed wetlands is a promising way to conserve water resources and improve water quality, and it is playing a very important role in wetland restoration and reconstruction. This study utilized reflectance spectra of wetland vegetation to estimate nitrogen content in water in the Beijing Bai River constructed wetland, a typically constructed wetland that uses reclaimed water. Canopy reflectance spectra of two dominant plants in the wetland, including reed and cattail, were acquired using a spectrometer (350–2500 nm). Simultaneously, water samples were collected to measure water quality. To establish the appreciate relationship between total nitrogen content (TN) and reflectance spectra, both simple and multiple regression models, including simple ration spectral index (SR), normalized difference spectral index (ND), stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR) model, and partial least squares regression (PLSR), were adopted in this study. The results showed that (1) compared with simple regression models (SR and ND), multiple regressions models (SMLR and PLSR) could provide a more accurate estimation of TN concentration in the wetland environment. Among these models, the PLSR model had the highest accuracy and was proven to be the most useful tool to reveal the relationship between the spectral reflectance of wetland plants and the total nitrogen consistency of wetland at the canopy scale. (2) The inversion effect of TN concentration in water is slightly better than that of wetland vegetation, and the reflection spectrum of the reed can predict TN concentration more accurately than that of cattail. The finding not only provides solid evidence for the potential application of remote sensing to detect water eutrophication but also enhances our understanding of the monitoring and management of water quality in urban wetlands using recycled water.",

Based on eddy covariance observations over a semiarid alpine steppe ecosystem in Bange on the Tibetan Plateau during the growing season from 2014 to 2017, the variations in evapotranspiration (ET), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and their components and the associated driving factors were analyzed. Linear and nonlinear models were applied to investigate the relationships between fluxes and their controlling factors over different timescales. The results show that the average ET for the growing season ranged from 1.1 to 2.4 mm/d with an average of 2.0 mm/d for the four consecutive years. Drought conditions reduced the surface conductance and hence the Priestley–Taylor coefficient. Mean T/ET was low (0.34) due to low vegetation cover. Plant growth increased the T/ET ratio during the growing season, whereas soil water content (SWC) explained most of the variation of ET and E on daily and monthly scales. The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was the most important controlling factor for temperature. Transpiration increased with SWC in dry conditions. For the growing season in 2014, 2016, and 2017, Bange was a carbon sink, while it was a carbon source in 2015. The largest CO2 flux was higher and the temperature sensitivity coefficient (Q10) was lower for 2015 than for the other three years. SWC affected these photosynthesis and respiration parameters. The ratio of respiration (Re) to gross primary production (GPP) was the highest during the 2015 growing season. Both on daily and monthly scales, Re was positively and linearly correlated with GPP. The most important controlling factor for the CO2 flux was EVI on daily and monthly scales.",

    "abstract": "Forecasting applications based on hourly meteorological predictions for weather variables are nowadays used in energy market operations, planning of gas and power supply, and renewable energy, among others. Available meteorological and climatological data, as well as critical thresholds of rainfall, may also have a key role in the hazard classification, related to slope instabilities of pipelines and critical infrastructures along routes. The present study concerns the performance of a weather forecast model in the framework of an early warning system (EWS) application, which supports the integrity management of oil and gas pipelines. This EWS has been applied on to a specific area: the Val d’Agri basin in the Basilicata region of Southern Italy, which is extensively affected by several landslides and floods. The hourly precipitation forecasts are provided by a dedicated meteorological model, the KALM-HD, using two different horizontal resolutions, 1.25 and 5 km, to analyze possible influences of the mesh grid size as well. On this area, several weather stations were specifically deployed to obtain observed data in a region where hydrogeological hazards are relevant for asset management. A comparison among observations and the KALM-HD scaled forecasts on six of these weather stations is presented to assess the model performance. Besides, precipitation, temperature, and wind speed are evaluated as well. The forecasting analysis is performed considering two years of data both on an overall and seasonal basis. Results show that the KALM-HD performs well with the 1.25 km grid, particularly on temperature and wind speed variables. Since weather stations can be gathered in two main sets depending on their positions, differences arise in the forecast quality of these two groups, related to orography and thermal effects, whose detection is difficult in the typical narrow valleys characterizing the area of study. This issue prevalently influences temperatures and local winds, which, these latter, are generally underestimated, while precipitation is mainly driven by synoptic circulation and its interaction with mesoscale meteorological features.",

During the training phase, each model distinctly demonstrated unique strengths in enhancing accuracy, refining loss functions, optimizing resource utilization, and accelerating training processes. In the test phase, the models’ performance was rigorously evaluated using overall accuracy (OA) and other quantitative metrics, providing solid empirical evidence for the variations in their performance. Furthermore, an insightful analysis of the visualization outcomes and a meticulous comparison of the nuanced differences between model predictions and actual cloud images underscored the individual models’ exceptional abilities in capturing intricate cloud details and executing precise edge processing. To alleviate the cumbersome process of pixel‐level labeling, this study adopts the effective block‐level labeling approach. This approach drastically streamlines annotation processes, ultimately translating into substantial cost savings and a marked reduction in time required for data preparation. The experimental results demonstrate that the Swin Transformer network performs particularly well in the cloud detection task of Landsat 8 images, achieving an OA of 90.73% under block‐level annotation, significantly higher than other comparison models, showcasing excellent cloud detection capabilities. Furthermore, the study also found that the size of input image blocks has a significant impact on detection results. Under the same network architecture, using 32 × 32 image blocks for cloud detection improves the OA by at least 10 percentage points compared to using 64 × 64 image blocks. This finding provides important insights for optimizing cloud detection algorithms. In summary, this study not only verifies the superiority of Swin Transformer in cloud detection in remote sensing images but also reveals the impact of image block size on detection performance, providing new ideas and directions for future advancements in remote sensing image processing and cloud detection technology.",

    "abstract": "The winter sea surface temperature (SST) in the South China Sea (SCS) before and after 2013 experienced a shift from warming slowdown to rewarming, and the interdecadal variability in the northern SCS was more pronounced than that in the southern SCS. The heat budget results indicate that the warming slowdown of SST in the northern SCS was primarily attributed to negative oceanic advection during 1997–2012. During 2013–2019, the reduction of evaporation played a dominant role in the rewarming of SST in the northern SCS, while the increase of short‐wave radiation and positive oceanic advection played secondary roles. Further analysis suggests that the shift from warming slowdown to rewarming in the northern SCS may be related to the changes in the location and intensity of the North Pacific subtropical high. The southward shift of the eastern Pacific subtropical high (EPSH) during 1997–2012 resulted in anomalous easterly winds in the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean and caused the weakening of Kuroshio intrusion into the SCS, which was the main mechanism leading to the warming slowdown of winter SST in the northern SCS. During 2013–2019, the enhancement of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) caused the weakening of the East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM) and the reduction of cloud cover, resulting in the enhancement of the net surface heat flux into the ocean, which was the primary mechanism leading to the rewarming of winter SST in the northern SCS. Meanwhile, the northward shift of the EPSH led to the increase of Kuroshio intrusion into the SCS due to the anomalous westerly winds in the equatorial eastern Pacific Ocean, which also contributed to the rewarming of winter SST in the northern SCS.",

The monthly difference of June minus July (JJ) SIE has the strongest correlation with September SIE, with a correlation coefficient of −0.786 (original time series) and −0.625 (detrended time series) at confidence level of 99%. Furthermore, it is found that the correlation coefficient between JJ SIE and July minus August (JA) SIE is so low (0.068) that they can be thought to be independent from each other, considering that the JA SIE is also significantly negatively correlated to September SIE. A simple regression forecasting model for September SIE was established using monthly SIE differences for the JJ and JA. This study also shows that the JJ SIE is significantly correlated not only with sea level pressure (SLP) in polar regions and midlatitudes over eastern Atlantic in July, a pattern which resembles the negative phase of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), but also with sea surface temperature (SST) in midlatitudes over central North Pacific in the preceding spring.",

Our results demonstrate that the 1988 drought featured a poleward-displaced cyclone track with a reduced role for cyclone-induced precipitation, especially in the spring of 1988. The 1993 flood featured a cyclone track from Mexico northeast to Missouri in the spring, while the summer featured two cyclone tracks: one in the southwestern US and the other across Canada linked to the right-entrance and left-exit regions of a strong 200 hPa Jetstream across the upper Midwest. Enhanced 850 hPa inflow from the Caribbean northeast to the Midwest with high precipitable water values occurred in conjunction with the right entrance portion of the 200 hPa Jetstream. Linking storm tracks and the 200 hPa Jetstream to a storm-rain index for the Midwest showed that these extreme events conformed to features of the general circulation normally associated with wet/dry episodes in the warm half of the year. Although El Niño did not play a role in the 1993 flood, the 1988 drought was associated with a poleward displacement of cyclone tracks in response to La Niña.",

In this special issue, massive observational data sets and mathematical modeling tools have been applied to couple the observed and/or modeled environmental processes to societal impacts. Examples include coastal and inshore flooding events, normally associated with tropical cyclones which, because of sea level rise, could extend into the winter season when extratropical cyclones are present and also include a higher frequency of flood events in the Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. The societal implications of these events are huge and other evolving and emerging phenomena in kind have been revealed. The topics covered in this special issue generally include the following: feasibility and “proof-of-concept” studies utilizing diagnostic and prognostic tools; pilot to mature studies relevant to the use of atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrological data sets including in situ and remotely sensed data sets, to drive societally relevant research; modern analytics and informatics including utilizing environmental and socioeconomics data; numerical modeling results focusing on leveraging interoperability and knowledge management; value assessments of environmental data, including investments in satellite and other technologies; studies using new methodological paradigms in environmental research; and environmental information that provides enabling capacity for environmental managers and society. The specific topics include the following: rainfall and cloud dynamics; flood hazard mapping by using geographic information systems and hydraulic models; the detection of abrupt changes in runoff and river discharge; the historical and future spatial and temporal variability of precipitation; the suitability and sustainability of water harvesting; the dynamics of a typhoon and a related high ozone episode; the forecasting of oceanic surface currents via the assimilation of radar data in a numerical model; the impact of wind stress on the global heat transport, thermohaline circulation, and oceanic instability; the onset and evolution of hydrological drought in human disturbed areas; projections of future drought hazard areas based on climate change scenarios; and the effects of climate and anthropogenic activity on hydrologic riverine features. This special issuewas intended to present scientific breakthrough results which are expected to reveal the couplings of environmental event scale with subseasonal variability scale to the implications for society at local to regional and global scale environments.

These TCs are selected to be representative of different intensity categories and basins. Impact is via a series of data denial experiments that systematically exclude the remote sensed information. Compared with the control case, in which only the final analysis atmospheric variables are used to initialize and provide the lateral boundary conditions, the data assimilation runs performed consistently better, but with very different skill levels for the different TCs. Eliassen-Palm flux analyses are employed. It is confirmed that if a polar orbital satellite footprint passes over the TC’s critical genesis region, the forecast will profit most from assimilating the remotely sensed information. If the critical genesis region lies within an interorbital gap then, regardless of how strong the TC later becomes (e.g., Katrina 2005), the improvement from assimilating near-surface winds and total precipitable water in the model prediction is severely limited. This underpins the need for a synergy of data from different scatterometers/radiometers. Other approaches are suggested to improve the accuracy in the prediction of TC genesis and tracks.",

The amount of water consumed in a city is affected by the weather conditions greatly such that as the weather changes, the amount of water consumed changes as well. In this study, several models including zero-order Pearson’s correlation coefficient, first-order Pearson’s correlation, generalized additive model (GAM), generalized linear model (GLM), support vector machine (SVM-Nu), and simplex optimization algorithm were used in order to identify linear/nonlinear reactions of monthly water consumption to the individual and combined associations of meteorological variables (temperature, air pressure, and relative humidity) in Khorramabad city. Zero-order and first-order correlations showed that, by controlling the air temperature, the effect of pressure and relative humidity on changes in water consumption increase. On the other hand, both individual and combined GAM models showed the same result in the nonlinear response of water consumption to the changes in relative humidity and air pressure. The spline method also revealed that, by eliminating the effect of air temperature, the nonlinear reaction of water consumption to changes in pressure and relative humidity was increasing, and by eliminating the effects of the relative humidity and air pressure, the nonlinear reaction of water consumption to the air temperature was intensified. In general, by decreasing the air pressure and temperature, the amount of urban household water consumption decreases drastically. These conditions are generally provided by entering low-pressure systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper shows the effects of changes in the spatial-temporal behavior and phase shift of climate variables on rainfed agriculture in the Lerma-Chapala-Santiago Basin in central Mexico. Specifically, changes in rainfall (R), maximum temperature (Tmax), and minimum temperature (Tmin) were analyzed over two 25-year periods (1960 to 1985 and 1986 to 2010). Climate surfaces were generated by interpolation using the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm in the software ANUSPLIN. Climate data were Fourier-transformed and fitted to a sinusoidal curve model, and changes in amplitude (increase) and phase were analyzed. The temporal behavior (1960–2010) indicated that rainfall was the most stable variable at the monthly level and presented no significant changes. However, Tmax increased by 2°C in the final period, and Tmin increased by 0.7°C at the end of the final period. The basin was discretized into ten rainfed crop areas (RCAs) according to the extent of changes in the amplitude and phase of the climate variables. The central and southern portions (55% of the area) presented more significant changes in amplitude, mainly in Tmin and Tmax. The remaining RCAs were smaller (14.6%) but presented greater variation: the amplitude of the Tmin decreased in addition to showing a phase shift, whereas Tmax increased in addition to showing a phase shift. These results translate into a delay in the characteristic temperatures of the spring and summer seasons, which can impact the rainfed crop cycle. Additionally, rainfall showed an annual decrease of approximately 50 mm in all RCAs, which can affect the phenological development of crops during critical stages (emergence through flowering). These changes represent a significant threat to the regional economy and food security of Mexico.",

To improve the accuracy of velocity dealiasing, traditional dealiasing algorithms usually set a series of empirical thresholds, combine three- or four-dimensional data, or introduce other observation data as a reference. In this study, we transform the velocity dealiasing problem into a clustering problem and solve this problem using the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) method. This algorithm is verified with a case study involving radar data on the tropical cyclone Mangkhut in 2018. The results show that the accuracy of the proposed algorithm is close to that of the four-dimensional dealiasing (4DD) method proposed by James and Houze; yet, it only requires two-dimensional velocity data and eliminates the need for other reference data. The results of the case study also show that the 4DD algorithm filters out many observation gates close to the missing data or radar center, whereas the proposed algorithm tends to retain and correct these gates.",

Two days in September, 2002 are studied using the model presented in Estoque Model (1990) (hereafter referred to as EsM90). The EsM90 produces a realistic day-night wind field somewhat in agreement with observations provided by the Port and Shipping Organization of Iran. The study demonstrates that the model has a 3-hour delay predicting the time of the maximum of sea breeze, but accurately predicts when the end of the sea breeze occurs. Accurate estimates near mountains at the edge of the modeled region require a more complex simulation. The study shows that a reliable modeling of a complicated coastal environment like Bushehr not only depends on land/sea breezes but also on elevations and prevailing winds. This dependence is especially important when local thermal forcings are weak, for example, during late afternoon and at night.",

In this paper, a perturbed ensemble Kalman filter (PEKF) and à trous wavelet transform (AWT) integrated method are proposed to implement the evapotranspiration assimilation. In this method, the AWT is used to decompose the EPs into multiple channels since it is very powerful in fusing high frequency spatial information of multisource data, and then the Kalman filter is performed in the AWT domain. The proposed method combines the advantages of the PEKF that is capable of accommodating model error and observation error, and the AWT can effectively perform multiresolution fusion. Assimilation experiment conducted with the Noah model and the EP retrieved from the MODIS data shows that the proposed method performs better than the traditional ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and PEKF methods. The analysis results fit well with the evapotranspiration observation at two field sites with different land surface conditions. These indicate that the proposed method is promising for assimilating regional scale satellite retrieved EP into LSMs.",

One of the main goals of the comprehensive observation was to reveal the basic meteorological and hydrological characteristics of the Bohai Gulf. The results indicated that the diurnal characteristic curve for the air temperature (AT) was steeply unimodal, while the curve of the SST was a bimodal valley type and mainly influenced by tides with its valley value corresponding to the high water level during the observation period. Southeasterly winds dominated and the wind speed was generally lower than 8 m/s, and the atmospheric stability over the Bohai Gulf was generally unstable. The wave strength levels were generally below level 3, with a greater number of swell waves than wind waves. The latter were usually associated with more momentum transport, a larger difference between AT and SST, and less heat transport. During the observational period, the mean momentum, sensible, and latent heat turbulent fluxes were 0.21, 21.6, and 27.8 W/m 2 , respectively. The ratio of the mean latent and sensible turbulent fluxes was about 1.3 and much lower than that in the South China Sea during the summer.",

However, a challenge question still remains for providing convincing scientific evidence during these practices and experiments. This is a very difficult scientific issue, which is related to complicated cloud physical science, such as to accurately predict the large natural variability of cloud formation and precipitation. In this study, we report a clear evidence that the cloud water is reduced after spreading diatomite particles in stratus clouds during a field experiment in Beijing, China. The analysis shows that the diatomite particles (15–20 μ m in radius) are large and have strong hygroscopic property (absorbing cloud water). As a result, during the experiment, spreading large diatomite particles lead to downward motion (producing more stable atmospheric condition) and reduction of cloud water. It is noted that due to lacks of instruments, this designed experiment only can provide a qualitative result (such as photo evidence), and no quantitative result can be drawn from this experiment.",

    "abstract": "This paper tries to identify one of the reasons for the poor land skin temperature simulated by a climate model over Greenland. It first compares ICEsat surface height measurements over Greenland with those used by the model and reveals that the surface height of Greenland prescribed in the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model/Community Land Model version 3 (CCSM/CLM3) differs greatly from the satellite measurements from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) ICEsat at edges and central glacier regions. This deficiency, in part, leads to underestimated skin temperatures at coastal regions—the areas where significant ice sheet melt is observed. Furthermore, sensitivity studies reveal that surface skin temperature simulations of Greenland would be significantly improved if the more accurate surface height is used. The problem of the height used in current global climate model is mainly due to the fact that the model has to use coarse grid size, and within one grid, land surface height has high heterogeneity. How to assign a proper surface height for each model grid and meanwhile adequately present the high heterogeneity of land surface is a great challenge in current model development.",

To take full advantage of the rich spectral information in CrIS data to improve the land surface retrievals, particularly the acquisition of a continuous Land Surface Emissivity (LSE) spectrum, this paper attempts to simultaneously retrieve a continuous LSE spectrum and the Land Surface Temperature (LST) from CrIS data with the atmospheric reanalysis data and the Iterative Spectrally Smooth Temperature and Emissivity Separation (ISSTES) algorithm. The results show that the accuracy of the retrieved LSEs and LST is comparable with the current land products. The overall differences of the LST and LSE retrievals are approximately 1.3 K and 1.48%, respectively. However, the LSEs in our study can be provided as a continuum spectrum instead of the single-channel values in traditional products. The retrieved LST and LSEs now can be better used to further analyze the surface properties or improve the retrieval of atmospheric parameters.",

Considering the insufficiency of the observations, the performance of assimilation with few temperature and salinity (T-S) profiles is not satisfied. To modify the situation, an extending algorithm based on the Argo temperature profile is developed and applied to present more reconstructed information. Meanwhile, when the reconstructed information is assimilated into the ocean model, the accuracy of the outcomes would obtain a notable enhancement. To validate it, an experiment including four cases is conducted based on Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) and 4-dimensional variational method (4DVAR). The comparison with the EN4 dataset shows that the cases assimilated the Argo and the reconstructed temperature profiles are both promoted; the addition of reconstructed temperature profiles does enhance the accuracy; the impact of SST introduced in the extending algorithm process is negligible; the net enhancement of reconstructed temperature profiles is comparable with Argo T-S observations. Finally, the positive impact of the developed algorithm on data assimilation is validated.",

It is well known that the oceanic mixing across the potential density surface is much weaker than that along the potential density surface. However, traditional ODA schemes allow the mixing across the potential density surface and thus may result in extra assimilation errors. Here, a new ODA scheme that uses potential density gradient information of the model background to rescale observational adjustment is designed to improve the quality of assimilation. The new scheme has been tested using a regional ocean model within a multiscale 3-dimensional variational framework. Results show that the new scheme effectively prevents the excessive unphysical projection of observational information in the direction across potential density surface and thus improves assimilation quality greatly. Forecast experiments also show that the new scheme significantly improves the model forecast skills through providing more dynamically consistent initial conditions",

In terms of climate states, the snow melting rate over the southern TP in P2 is faster than that in P1. The acceleration of snow melting during P2 is mainly found over high elevation areas caused by the increase of local air temperature. Diagnoses of the thermodynamic equation further demonstrate that the warming over the southern TP during the two periods is mainly attributed to the meridional temperature advection and diabatic heating in situ. On the interannual time scale, the SD over the southern TP is closely related to diabatic heating over South Asia. During P1, the diabatic cooling from the southern Bay of Bengal eastward to the western South China Sea suppresses convection over the Bay of Bengal and southern TP and has resulted in an upper-level anomalous cyclone and cold temperature anomalies from the surface to 200 hPa over the southern TP, favoring the above-normal SD over the southern TP. On the other hand, SD over the southern TP in P2 is closely related to diabatic cooling over the northern Indochina Peninsula and diabatic heating over the southern China. But we could not prove that these diabatic heating anomalies can affect the SD over the southern TP by modulating local surface air temperature. This may be limited by the quality of the data and the simulation capability of the simple model.",

However, the analysis error variance computed from the previously developed spectral formulations is constant and thus limited to represent only the spatially averaged error variance. To overcome this limitation, analytic formulations are constructed to efficiently estimate the spatial variation of analysis error variance and associated spatial variation in analysis error covariance. First, a suite of formulations is constructed to efficiently estimate the error variance reduction produced by analyzing the coarse-resolution observations in one- and two-dimensional spaces with increased complexity and generality (from uniformly distributed observations with periodic extension to nonuniformly distributed observations without periodic extension). Then, three different formulations are constructed for using the estimated analysis error variance to modify the analysis error covariance computed from the spectral formulations. The successively improved accuracies of these three formulations and their increasingly positive impacts on the two-step variational analysis (or multistep variational analysis in first two steps) are demonstrated by idealized experiments.",

There are many ways to measure SM, satellite microwave remote sensing is now considered the primary method because it can provide real-time high-resolution data. However, SM data obtained by satellite remote sensing exhibit certain deviation compared with reference data obtained from ground stations. To improve the accuracy of SM forecasts, this study proposed the use of a Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method to integrate multisatellite SM data. First, China was divided into eight regions. Then, SM data observed by satellites (FY3B, SMOS, and WINDSAT) were fused using the BMA method and a traditional averaging method. Finally, SM data were predicted using data from ground observation stations as a reference standard. Following the fusion process, three parameters (standard deviation, correlation coefficient, and root mean square deviation) were used to evaluate the fusion results, which revealed the superiority of the BMA method over the traditional averaging method.",

Previous research suggests that timing and patterns in cloud height, echo top height, vertical integrated liquid (VIL), intracloud (IC) lightning, and cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning may identify and predict microbursts. Eleven quasi-cellular microburst cases and eight non-microburst severe wind cases were identified from New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey between 2012 and 2016. Total lightning data (IC + CG) were obtained from Vaisala’s National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN), and radar parameters were obtained from the Thunderstorm Identification Tracking Analysis and Nowcasting (TITAN) software. Values of VIL, echo top height, and cloud height were tracked through time along with total lightning strikes within a 15 km radius of the storm center. These parameters were plotted with respect to their mean and standard deviation for the 45 minutes leading up to event occurrence. Six of eleven cases featured peaks in total and IC lightning within 25 minutes prior to the microburst. These were the only variables among those examined to peak more than half the time for either the microburst cases or the null cases. The results suggest that microbursts behave somewhat differently than severe wind events, particularly in terms of lightning and VIL timing. The results dispute previous research that suggests that microbursts are highly predictable by the behavior of lightning and radar parameters.",

Previous studies focused on the mechanisms of the TPMV in the viewpoint of deterministic forecast; however, few studies investigate the predictability of the TPMV using the Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment (THORPEX) Interactive Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF). This paper investigates the location and the intensity of the larger-scale synoptic systems that influenced the development of the TPMV and its associated heavy rainfall by correlation and composite analysis. The case study on 18 July 2013 shows that stronger Balkhash Lake ridge, weaker Baikal Lake trough, and weaker western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) are favorable to formation of TPMV over the Sichuan basin (SCB); otherwise, weaker Balkhash Lake ridge, stronger Baikal Lake trough, and stronger WPSH result in formation of TPMV to west of the SCB slightly. After the initial time, forecast for next 48 h of the geopotential height over the SCB can be viewed as a precursor of the subsequent time-averaged 90–108 h forecast of TPMV. TPMV had critical contributions to the heavy rainfall over the SCB on 18 July 2013.",

    "abstract": "Hallasan Mountain is located at the center of Jeju Island, Korea. Even though Hallasan Mountain has a height of just 1,950 m, the temperature during the winter decreases below −20 degrees Celsius. On the contrary, the temperature on the coastal areas remains just above freezing. Therefore, large snowfalls in the mountain and rainfall in the coastal areas are very common in Jeju Island. Most of the rain gauges are available around highly populated coastal areas, and snow measurements are available at just four locations on the coastal areas. Therefore, it is practically impossible to distinguish the rainfall and snowfall in Jeju Island. Fortunately, two radars (Seongsan and Gosan radars) operate on Jeju Island, which fully covers Hallasan Mountain. This study proposes a method of using both the radar and rain gauge information to map the snowy region in Jeju Island, including Hallasan Mountain. As a first step, this study analyzed the Z - R and Z - S relationships to derive a fixed threshold of radar reflectivity to separate snowfall from rainfall, and, in the second step, this study additionally considered the observed rain rate information to implement the problem of using the fixed threshold. This proposed method was applied to radar reflectivity data collected during November 1, 2014, to April 30, 2015, and the results indicate that the method considering both the radar and rain gauge information was satisfactory. This method also showed good performance, especially when the rain rate was very low.",

    "abstract": "Both convection and land surface parameterization influence seasonal precipitation forecasts. In this study, the sensitivity of dynamical downscaling seasonal precipitation forecasts to convection and land surface parameterization was investigated by nesting the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model into the NCEP’s Climate Forecast System version 2 (CFSv2) retrospective forecasts with four convective schemes: Kain–Fritsch (KF), Betts–Miller–Janjic (BMJ), Grell–Freitas (GF), and new simplified Arakawa–Schubert (NSAS) schemes, and two land surface schemes: Noah and simplified Simple Biosphere (SSiB) schemes over the Han River basin. The CFSv2 model biases are reduced when the KF convective scheme is used in the wet summer season. However, negative biases still exist especially when the combination of BMJ and SSiB schemes is used. Compared with CFSv2 reforecasts and other combinations of schemes, the forecast skills of spatial patterns of precipitation anomalies are highest when the combination of KF and Noah schemes is used in summer. In contrast, the combination of BMJ and SSiB schemes shows lowest forecast skills in summer. To understand the causes of the differences in precipitation forecasts using different parameterization schemes, the simulated moisture flux convergence, thermodynamic parameters at different pressure levels, convective available potential energy (CAPE), convective inhibition (CIN), and heat fluxes are compared with the data in the ERA-5 reanalysis dataset. The WRF model-simulated moisture flux convergence is closer to that of the ERA-5 reanalysis compared with that of the CFSv2 reforecasts in summer. The vertical thermodynamic profiles also suggest that the combination of the KF and Noah schemes has caused a more unstable atmosphere, which is crucial for precipitation. In contrast, the combination of BMJ and SSiB schemes shows a less unstable atmospheric environment in summer, which explains the lower forecast skills compared with other schemes. The spatial patterns of CAPE are also improved when using the WRF model, which further enhances the precipitation forecast skills over the Han River basin.",

    "abstract": "Background. Extreme events like flooding, extreme temperature, and ozone depletion are happening in every corner of the world. Thus, the need to model such rare events having enormous damage has been getting priorities in most countries of the world. Methods. The dataset contains the ozone data from 29 representative air monitoring sites in South Korea collected from 1991 to 2015. Spatial generalized extreme value (GEV) using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and two max-stable and Bayesian kriging models are the statistical models used for analysis. Moreover, predictive performances of these statistical models are compared using measures like root-mean-squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), relative bias (rBIAS), and relative mean separation (rMSEP) have been utilized. Results. From the time plot of ozone data, extreme ozone concentration is increasing linearly within the specified period. The return level of ozone concentration after 10, 25, 50, and 100 years have been forecasted and showed that there was an increasing trend in ozone extremes. High spatial variability of ozone extreme was observed, and those areas around the territories were having extreme ozone concentration than the centers.

The proposed denoising scheme consists of several components. (i) It selects LiDAR observations according to their SNR values so that serious noisy data can be removed. (ii) A polar-based total variation smoothing term is employed to regularize LiDAR observations. (iii) The regularization parameters are automatically determined to balance the data-fitting term and the total variation smoothing term. Numerical results for LiDAR data collected at the Hong Kong International Airport are reported to demonstrate that the denoising performance of the proposed method is better than that of the testing LiDAR data denoising schemes in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Cloud identification methods of passive sensors are usually on the basis of different thresholds at different wavelengths. However, the high pollution levels may contribute to the misidentification of cloud mask of Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) carried on Himawari-8. This study comprehensively analyses and demonstrates this possibility by comparing the AHI cloud-masks and space-based lidar observations based on surface observations of air-polluted loadings from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019. Therefore, this study comprehensively explores this impact by comparing the AHI cloud-masks and space-based lidar observations by using surface observations of air-polluted loadings from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2019. Case studies that compare the two sensors indicate that the performance of AHI cloud detection is degenerative during aerosol events. Long-term statistical analysis demonstrates that the average hit ratio of clear (cloud) between the two sensors during the period is 79% (63%) and the consistency (hit rate) of cloud-mask between AHI and CALIOP decreases with increasing pollution levels. On the contrary, the low uncertainty ratios with 15% of cloud and 3% of clear exist in low PM2.5 levels (lower than 40 μg/m3), while the high uncertainty ratios with 47% of cloud and 15% of clear exist in high PM2.5 levels (higher than 130 μg/m3). Therefore, results demonstrate that the reliability of AHI cloud-mask is weakened by high air-polluted levels. Further improvement of AHI cloud-mask algorithm is desired because AHI products with high temporal resolution are vital in several related fields, such as climate change, aerosol-cloud interaction, and air-polluted mapping.",

Two datasets were separately selected as the initial fields of WRF with the same physical parameterization schemes. By investigating the improvement rate of the forecast when using one set of data rather than the other, the important degree of the initial conditions with respect to the forecasts for each case has been obtained. For those initial errors are the important sources of forecast errors, we further explored the source of the initial errors by comparing the two initial conditions. It was found that, interestingly, the significant differences between two initial conditions are all located upstream the rainfall area, with a distance of 5° of longitude away and an area of about 4° × 4°. Based on this, we developed a new method (which we refer to as the “guide flow method”) to identify the sensitive area for rainstorm forecasts in the South China monsoon region and then examined the efficiency of the sensitive areas. It was found that reducing the initial errors in the sensitive areas leads to better forecast results than doing the same in other areas. Thus, the sensitive areas are the source areas of forecast errors for rainstorms in the South China monsoon region.",

Considering the data of the 44 years from 1961 to 2004 as the training set of the model and the other years as the test set, the training accuracy of the model can reach to 95.45% and the test accuracy can reach to 81.82%. Three types of Spring Kuroshio SST are different in intensity and distribution. The results show that the prediction model of Spring Kuroshio SST based on CHAID algorithm has a high prediction accuracy, with the reasonable and effective model and the well-thought-out decision rules. Moreover, based on the results of decision classification, the SST anomalies correspond to different distribution characteristics of summer daily precipitation anomalies in eastern China, which can provide a new idea and method for climate prediction of regional summer precipitation.",

    "abstract": "Air temperature (Ta) is an essential parameter for science research and engineering practice. While the traditional site-based approach is only able to obtain observations in limited and discrete locations, satellite remote sensing is promising to retrieve some environmental variables with spatially continuous coverage. Nowadays, land surface temperature (Ts) measurements can be obtained from some satellite sensors (e.g., MODIS), further enabling us to estimate Ta in view of the relationship between Ta and Ts. In this article, we proposed a two-phase integrated framework to estimate daily mean Ta nationwide. In the first phase, multivariate linear regression models were fitted between site-based observations of daily mean air temperature (Ta-mean) and MODIS land surface temperature products (including Terra day: TMOD-day, Terra night: TMOD-night, Aqua day: TMYD-day, and Aqua night: TMYD-night) conditional on some covariates of environmental factors. The fitted models were then used to predict Ta-mean from those covariates at unobserved locations. The predicted Ta-mean were looked on as stochastic variables, and their distributions were also obtained. In the second phase, Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) methods were used to produce spatially continuous maps of Ta-mean taking the meteorological station observations as hard data and the predicted Ta-mean in the first phase as soft data. It is shown that the proposed approach is promising to improve the interpolation accuracy significantly, comprehensively considering the prior knowledge and the context of space variability and correlation, which will enable it to compile spatially continuous air temperature products with higher accuracy.",

Besides turbulence and convection, in-flight icing is part of SESAR and can be seen as one of the most important meteorological phenomena, which may lead to hazardous flight conditions for aircraft. In this study, several methods with varying complexities are analyzed for combining three individual in-flight icing forecasts based on numerical weather prediction models from Deutscher Wetterdienst, Météo-France, and Met Office. The optimal method will then be used to operate one single harmonized in-flight icing forecast over Europe. As verification data, pilot reports (PIREPs) are used, which provide information about hazardous weather and are currently the only direct regular measure of in-flight icing events available. In order to assess the individual icing forecasts and the resulting combinations, the probability of detection skill score is calculated based on multicategory contingency tables for the forecast icing intensities. The scores are merged into a single skill score to give an overview of the quality of the icing forecast and enable comparison of the different model combination approaches. The concluding results show that the most complex combination approach, which uses iteratively optimized weighting factors for each model, provides the best forecast quality according to the PIREPs. The combination of the three icing forecasts results in a harmonized icing forecast that exceeds the skill of each individual icing forecast, thus providing an improvement to in-flight icing forecasts over Europe.",

The collected data included temperature and relative humidity (RH) and confirmed cases for indoor and outdoor configurations over 5 and 11 months, respectively. For the indoor infections, data were collected over the period of 5 weekdays, while for the outdoor infections, they were collected on the days when statistics were published. The prospective cross-section design was used for different statistical analyses. The overall indoor infections were very low, and the maximum values for RH and temperature were approximately &lt;24% and &lt;20°C, respectively; in the one-sample t-test, the results were significantly correlated ( <math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" id=\"M1\"> <mi>p</mi> </math> value &lt;0.05) with the confirmed COVID-19 cases.

This paper examines the trends of the hydrometeorological data in Gilgel Gibe catchment and whether the trends are significant. Daily rainfall, temperature, and streamflow data of the stations in/around (nearby) the catchment (7 stations for rainfall, 4 stations for temperatures, and 6 stations for streamflow) for a period longer than 25 years were collected and then analyzed to detect the variability and the changes in trend. Prior to conducting trend tests, the missed data were filled, and their inconsistencies were also adjusted. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test along with Sen’s slope technique was employed to detect monotonic trends in the data series. The results showed that, on average, the rainfall exhibits an insignificant increasing tendency. It was also observed that there is, in general, an increasing trend in temperature (both maximum and minimum) in the study area. The analysis of the stream flows indicated that only one station (Bulbul Nr. Serbo) showed a positive slope at a 5% significance level. Two stations (Aweitu Nr. Babu and Gibe Nr. Seka) showed a slightly increasing trend, whereas the remaining 3 stations (Gibe Nr. Assendabo, Aweitu at Jimma, and Kitto Nr. Jimma) indicated an insignificant decreasing trend. The streamflow of the catchment generally shows a tiny decreasing tendency (0.007% per year) at its outlet. However, the results in general specified statistically insignificant trend changes of the hydrometrological data of the study catchment.",

The results show that there is a significant correlation between the EASWJ and the EASM from June to October in terms of both intra-annual variability and interannual fluctuations, and the correlation between the AHS over TP and the EASWJ and the EASM during the same period is significantly enhanced in August. The synthetic analysis indicated that when the AHS was strong, a positive anomaly of a horizontal temperature gradient appeared over TP, which was conducive to the southward shift of the high-altitude temperature gradient center, resulting in the southward position of the axis of the 200 hPa westerly jet, and an upward and downward inclined westerly anomaly zone appeared from the south slope of TP to the main body and its north slope. Meanwhile, the East Asia–Pacific (EAP) teleconnection pattern with a negative phase appeared at 500 hPa, and TP to western Japan was located in the negative value area of the wave train. The AHS was conducive to the enhancement of the EAP negative phase, which was not conducive to the further northward transportation of water vapor by the EASM. On the contrary, when the AHS on TP was weak, the position of the westerly jet was northward and the EAP positive phase enhanced, contributing to the further northward transport of water vapor from the EASM.",

Based on a 12-year (2007–2018) record dataset measured with the eddy covariance technique over the Dali agriculture ecosystem in the southeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau, we investigated the diurnal, seasonal, and interannual variations of the sensible heat flux (Hs), latent heat flux (LE), and carbon dioxide flux (Fc), and their controlling variables. The results showed that Hs and LE exhibited similar diurnal and seasonal variations, while the amplitude of LE was clearly larger than that of Hs throughout the year. The turbulent fluxes showed remarkable fluctuation on the annual scale. The annual average Hs (LE) increases (decreases) from approximately 8 (110) W·m−2 during 2007–2013 to 20 (79) W·m−2 during 2014–2018. The annual cumulative net CO2 ecosystem exchange (NEE) increases significantly from approximately −739 g·C·m−2·yr−1 during 2007–2013 to −218 g·C·m−2·yr−1 during 2014–2018. The relationship between turbulent fluxes and meteorological variables was also examined. Wind speed (WS) is found to be the dominant controlling factor for the Hs on different temporal scales and their correlation coefficients increase when the timescales vary from daily to annual scale; whereas the product of WS and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is the major meteorological variable controlling the LE over all temporal scales. The net radiation (Rn) is the dominating factor for Fc on daily and monthly timescales, while WS becomes the most controlling factor for Fc on an annual scale. Notably, surface energy and CO2 fluxes are also greatly influenced by the vegetation cover surrounding the measurement site.",
