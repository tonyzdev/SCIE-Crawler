    "abstract": "Major components of suspended particulate matter (PM) are inorganic ions, organic matter (OM), elemental carbon (EC), geological minerals, salt, non-mineral elements, and water. Since oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H) are not directly measured in chemical speciation networks, more than ten weighting equations have been applied to account for their presence, thereby approximating gravimetric mass. Assumptions for these weights are not the same under all circumstances. OM is estimated from an organic carbon (OC) multiplier (f) that ranges from 1.4 to 1.8 in most studies, but f can be larger for highly polar compounds from biomass burning and secondary organic aerosols. The mineral content of fugitive dust is estimated from elemental markers, while the water-soluble content is accounted for as inorganic ions or salt. Part of the discrepancy between measured and reconstructed PM mass is due to the measurement process, including: (1) organic vapors adsorbed on quartz-fiber filters; (2) evaporation of volatile ammonium nitrate and OM between the weighed Teflon-membrane filter and the nylon-membrane and/or quartz-fiber filters on which ions and carbon are measured; and (3) liquid water retained on soluble constituents during filter weighing. The widely used IMPROVE equations were developed to characterize particle light extinction in U.S. national parks, and variants of this approach have been tested in a large variety of environments. Important factors for improving agreement between measured and reconstructed PM mass are the f multiplier for converting OC to OM and accounting for OC sampling artifacts.",

During the total lockdown, most of the sources for poor air quality were stopped in India. In this paper, we present an analysis of air quality (particulate matter-PM2.5, Air Quality Index, and tropospheric NO2) over India using ground and satellite observations. A pronounced decline in PM2.5 and AQI (Air Quality Index) is observed over Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Chennai and also a declining trend was observed in tropospheric NO2 concentration during the lockdown period in 2020 compared with the same period in the year 2019. During the total lockdown period, the air quality has improved significantly which provides an important information to the cities' administration to develop rules and regulations on how they can improve air quality.",

Governments and health officials around the world have introduced mandatory preventive measures to combat Covid-19, i.e., hand sanitizers, gloves, and masks, which have contributed to large quantities of medical wastes. Social distancing and mandatory lockdown have also been put in place to protect people from Covid-19. This epidemic has caused severe demographic changes and unemployment, and economic activities have been shut down to save human lives. Transportation and travel industries are most severely hit as global tourism has fallen to almost zero in recent months; as a solution, economic institutes have introduced stimulus packages worth more than $6 trillion. However, restricted economic activities have also contributed towards a cleaner environment. However, environmental changes are not permanent, and the pollution level may rise again in the future. As a result, current research suggests that policymakers must introduce stringent environmental policies to promote clean energy.",

A systematic review was conducted to identify relevant articles on air pollution and ALRI in children. Using a Bayesian approach to meta-analysis, a summary estimate of 1.12 (1.03, 1.30) increased risk in ALRI occurrence per 10 μg/m3 increase in annual average PM2.5 concentration was derived from the longer-term (subchronic and chronic) effects studies. This analysis strengthens the evidence for a causal relationship between exposure to PM2.5 and the occurrence of ALRI and provides a basis for estimating the global attributable burden of mortality due to ALRI that is not influenced by the wide variation in regional case fatality rates. Most studies, however, have been conducted in settings with relatively low levels of PM2.5. Extrapolating their results to other, more polluted, regions will require a model that is informed by evidence from studies of the effects on ALRI of exposure to PM2.5 from other combustion sources, such as secondhand smoke and household solid fuel use.",

    "abstract": "In urban areas of Brazil, vehicle emissions are the principal source of fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)). The World Health Organization air quality guidelines state that the annual mean concentration of PM(2.5) should be below 10 μg m(-3). In a collaboration of Brazilian institutions, coordinated by the University of São Paulo School of Medicine and conducted from June 2007 to August 2008, PM(2.5) mass was monitored at sites with high traffic volumes in six Brazilian state capitals. We employed gravimetry to determine PM(2.5) mass concentrations, reflectance to quantify black carbon concentrations, X-ray fluorescence to characterize elemental composition, and ion chromatography to determine the composition and concentrations of anions and cations. Mean PM(2.5) concentrations and proportions of black carbon (BC) in the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Curitiba, Recife, and Porto Alegre were 28.1 ± 13.6 μg m(-3) (38% BC), 17.2 ± 11.2 μg m(-3) (20% BC), 14.7 ± 7.7 μg m(-3) (31% BC), 14.4 ± 9.5 μg m(-3) (30% BC), 7.3 ± 3.1 μg m(-3) (26% BC), and 13.4 ± 9.9 μg m(-3) (26% BC), respectively. Sulfur and minerals (Al, Si, Ca, and Fe), derived from fuel combustion and soil resuspension, respectively, were the principal elements of the PM(2.5) mass. We discuss the long-term health effects for each metropolitan region in terms of excess mortality risk, which translates to greater health care expenditures. This information could prove useful to decision makers at local environmental agencies.",

    "abstract": "Air pollution (AP) is one of the major causes of health risks as it leads to widespread morbidity and mortality each year. Its environmental impacts include acid rains, reduced visibility, but more importantly and significantly, it affects human health. The price tag of not managing AP is seen in the rise of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease, and respiratory ailments like asthma and chronic bronchitis. But as the world battles the corona pandemic, COVID-19 lockdown has abruptly halted human activity, leading to a significant reduction in AP levels. The effect of this reduction is captured by reduced cases of morbidity and mortality associated with air pollution. The current study aims to monetarily quantify the decline in health impacts due to reduced AP levels under lockdown scenario, as against business as usual, for four cities-Delhi, London, Paris, and Wuhan. The exposure assessment with respect to pollutants like particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), NO2, and SO2 are evaluated. Value of statistical life (VSL), cost of illness (CoI), and per capita income (PCI) for disability-adjusted life years (DALY) are used to monetize the health impacts for the year 2019 and 2020, considering the respective period of COVID-19 lockdown of four cities. The preventive benefits related to reduced AP due to lockdown is evaluated in comparison to economic damage sustained by these four cities. This helps in understanding the magnitude of actual damage and brings out a more holistic picture of the damages related to lockdown.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Microplastics (MPs) have become a growing concern in the context of environmental pollution, with an increasing focus on their presence in indoor environments, including university facilities. This study investigates the presence and characteristics of MPs in different university indoor environments. Initial examination of indoor ambient MPs involved physical characterization through optical microscopy, focusing on classifying MPs by shape and color. Various types of MPs, including fibers, fragments, pellets, foams, films, and lines, were identified, with the most common colors being black, red, blue, and brown. Fragments were the predominant type of MPs found, although accurately quantifying their numbers proved challenging due to the dense sample content. These MPs displayed rough and irregular margins suggestive of abrasion. Subsequent chemical and elemental characterization was conducted using micro-Raman and SEM-EDX, revealing the presence of 25 different types of MPs, including PA 66, PTFE, PP, HDPE, and PE. The study indicates that university inhabitants are exposed to airborne MPs (≥ 2.5–336.89 μm) at inhalation rates of 13.88–18.51 MPs/m 3 and 180–240 MPs daily. These MPs exhibited significant variations in size, and their distribution varied among the different indoor environments studied. SEM-EDX analysis revealed common elements in the identified MPs, with C, O, F, Na, Cl, Al, Si, and others consistently detected. This research is the first to comprehensively analyze MPs in nine different indoor university environments using active sampling. Identifying and reducing MP contamination in these facilities might stimulate more awareness, promote extensive scientific investigation, and facilitate the development of informed policies.",

    "abstract": "Air pollution has been associated with significant adverse health effects leading to increased overall morbidity and mortality of worldwide significance. Epidemiological studies have shown that the largest portion of air pollution-related mortality is due to cardiovascular diseases, predominantly those of ischemic nature. Human studies suggest an association with atherosclerosis and increasing experimental animal data support that this association is likely to be causal. While both gasses and particles have been linked to detrimental health effects, more evidence implicates the particulate matter (PM) components as major responsible for a large portion of the proatherogenic effects. Multiple experimental approaches have revealed the ability of PM components to trigger and/or enhance free radical reactions in cells and tissues, both ex vivo as well as in vivo. It appears that exposure to PM leads to the development of systemic prooxidant and proinflammatory effects that may be of great importance in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. This article reviews the epidemiological studies, experimental animal, and cellular data that support the association of air pollutants, especially the particulate components, with systemic oxidative stress, inflammation, and atherosclerosis. It also reviews the use of transcriptomic studies to elucidate molecular pathways of importance in those systemic effects.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decades, the development of the Klang Valley (Malaysia), as an urban commercial and industrial area, has elevated the risk of atmospheric pollutions. There are several significant sources of air pollutants which vary depending on the background of the location they originate from. The aim of this study is to determine the trend and status of air quality and their correlation with the meteorological factors at different air quality monitoring stations in the Klang Valley. The data of five major air pollutants (PM(10), CO, SO(2), O(3), NO(2)) were recorded at the Alam Sekitar Sdn Bhd (ASMA) monitoring stations in the Klang Valley, namely Petaling Jaya (S1), Shah Alam (S2) and Gombak (S3). The data from these three stations were compared with the data recorded at Jerantut, Pahang (B), a background station established by the Malaysian Department of Environment. Results show that the concentrations of CO, NO(2) and SO(2) are higher at Petaling Jaya (S1) which is due to influence of heavy traffic. The concentrations of PM(10) and O(3,) however, are predominantly related to regional tropical factors, such as the influence of biomass burning and of ultra violet radiation from sunlight. They can, though, also be influenced by local sources. There are relatively stronger inter-pollutant correlations at the stations of Gombak and Shah Alam, and the results also suggest that heavy traffic flow induces high concentrations of PM(10), CO, NO(2) and SO(2) at the three sampling stations. Additionally, meteorological factors, particularly the ambient temperature and wind speed, may influence the concentration of PM(10) in the atmosphere.",

    "abstract": "Studies in air pollution epidemiology may suffer from some specific forms of confounding and exposure measurement error. This contribution discusses these, mostly in the framework of cohort studies. Evaluation of potential confounding is critical in studies of the health effects of air pollution. The association between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution and mortality has been investigated using cohort studies in which subjects are followed over time with respect to their vital status. In such studies, control for individual-level confounders such as smoking is important, as is control for area-level confounders such as neighborhood socio-economic status. In addition, there may be spatial dependencies in the survival data that need to be addressed. These issues are illustrated using the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention II cohort. Exposure measurement error is a challenge in epidemiology because inference about health effects can be incorrect when the measured or predicted exposure used in the analysis is different from the underlying true exposure. Air pollution epidemiology rarely if ever uses personal measurements of exposure for reasons of cost and feasibility. Exposure measurement error in air pollution epidemiology comes in various dominant forms, which are different for time-series and cohort studies. The challenges are reviewed and a number of suggested solutions are discussed for both study domains.",

    "abstract": "In Brazil, the principal source of air pollution is the combustion of fuels (ethanol, gasohol, and diesel). In this study, we quantify the contributions that vehicle emissions make to the urban fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) mass in six state capitals in Brazil, collecting data for use in a larger project evaluating the impact of air pollution on human health. From winter 2007 to winter 2008, we collected 24-h PM(2.5) samples, employing gravimetry to determine PM(2.5) mass concentrations; reflectance to quantify black carbon concentrations; X-ray fluorescence to characterize elemental composition; and ion chromatography to determine the composition and concentrations of anions and cations. Mean PM(2.5) concentrations in the cities of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Curitiba, Porto Alegre, and Recife were 28, 17.2, 14.7, 14.4, 13.4, and 7.3 μg/m(3), respectively. In São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, black carbon explained approximately 30% of the PM(2.5) mass. We used receptor models to identify distinct source-related PM(2.5) fractions and correlate those fractions with daily mortality rates. Using specific rotation factor analysis, we identified the following principal contributing factors: soil and crustal material; vehicle emissions and biomass burning (black carbon factor); and fuel oil combustion in industries (sulfur factor). In all six cities, vehicle emissions explained at least 40% of the PM(2.5) mass. Elemental composition determination with receptor modeling proved an adequate strategy to identify air pollution sources and to evaluate their short- and long-term effects on human health. Our data could inform decisions regarding environmental policies vis-à-vis health care costs.",

Yokohama city was selected as a case study to assess the amount of VOC released from Industrial area to characterize the ambient air quality with respect to VOC as well as to know the impact of petrochemical storage facilities on local air quality. For this purpose, ambient air samples were collected (from June 2007 to November 2008) at six selected locations which are designated as industrial, residential, or commercial areas. To find out the diurnal variations of VOC, hourly nighttime sampling was carried out for three nights at one of the industrial locations (Shiohama). Samples were analyzed using gas chromatographic system (GC-FID). Results show strong variation between day and nighttime concentrations and among the seasons. Aliphatic fractions were most abundant, suggesting petrochemical storage facilities as the major source of atmospheric hydrocarbons. High concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene (BTEX) were observed at industrial locations. BTEX showed strong diurnal variation which is attributed to change in meteorology. During our campaign, low ambient VOC concentrations were observed at the residential site.",

This paper examines how each of these factors influences the magnitude of the $/ton estimate. We employ a reduced-form air quality model to predict changes in ambient PM(2.5) resulting from an array of emission control scenarios affecting 12 different combinations of sources emitting carbonaceous particles, NO(x), SO(x), NH(3), and volatile organic compounds. We perform this modeling for each of nine urban areas and one nationwide area. Upon modeling the air quality change, we then divide the total monetized health benefits by the PM(2.5) precursor emission reductions to generate $/ton metrics. The resulting $/ton estimates exhibit the greatest variability across certain precursors and sources such as area source SO(x), point source SO(x), and mobile source NH(3). Certain $/ton estimates, including mobile source NO(x), exhibit significant variability across urban areas. Reductions in carbonaceous particles generate the largest $/ton across all locations.",

    "abstract": "Chemical components of air pollutant exposures that induce oxidative stress and subsequent inflammation may be partly responsible for associations of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with airborne particulate matter and combustion-related pollutant gasses. However, epidemiologic evidence regarding this is limited. An exposure-assessment approach is to measure the oxidative potential of particle mixtures because it is likely that hundreds of correlated chemicals are involved in overall effects of air pollution on health. Oxidative potential likely depends on particle composition and size distribution, especially ultrafine particle concentration, and on transition metals and certain semivolatile and volatile organic chemicals. For health effects, measuring systemic oxidative stress in the blood is one feasible approach, but there is no universal biomarker of oxidative stress and there are many potential target molecules (lipids, proteins, DNA, nitric oxide, etc.), which may be more or less suitable for specific study goals. Concurrent with the measurement of oxidative stress, it is important to measure gene and/or protein expression of endogenous antioxidant enzymes because they can modify relations between oxidative stress biomarkers and air pollutants. Conversely, the expression and activities of these enzymes are modified by oxidative stress. This interplay will likely determine the observed effects of air pollutants on systemic inflammatory and thrombotic mediators and related clinical outcomes. Studies are needed to assess the reliability and validity of oxidative stress biomarkers, evaluate differences in associations between oxidative stress biomarkers and various pollutant measurements (mass, chemical components, and oxidative potential), and evaluate impacts of antioxidant responses on these relations.",

    "abstract": "The seasonal changes in ambient mass concentrations and chemical composition of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were investigated in three locations in Poland. The analyses included PM2.5-bound hazardous benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), As, Ni, Cd, and Pb. The samples of PM2.5 were collected daily in Katowice (southern Poland, urban background site), Gdańsk, and Diabla Góra (northern Poland, urban and regional background sites, respectively) during 1-year-long campaign in 2010. Based on monthly ambient concentrations of PM2.5-bound carbon (organic and elemental), water-soluble ions (Na+, NH4+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Cl-, NO3-, SO42-), and elements As, Ni, Cd, Pb, Ti, Al, Fe, the chemical mass closure of PM2.5 was checked for each of the four seasons of the year and for the heating and non-heating periods at each site. Also, the annual concentrations of PM2.5 were determined and the annual PM2.5 mass closure checked. At each measuring point, the PM2.5 concentrations were high compared to its Polish yearly permissible value, 25 μg/m3, and its concentrations elsewhere in Europe. The highest annual PM2.5 concentration, 43 μg/m3, occurred in Katowice; it was twice the annual PM2.5 concentration in Gdańsk, and thrice the one in Diabla Góra. The high annual averages were due to very high monthly concentrations in the heating period, which were highest in the winter. PM2.5 consisted mainly of carbonaceous matter (elemental carbon (EC) + organic matter (OM), the sum of elemental carbon, EC, and organic matter, OM; its annual mass contributions to PM2.5 were 43, 31, and 33 % in Katowice, Gdansk, and Diabla Góra, respectively), secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA), the Na_Cl group, and crustal matter (CM)-in the decreasing order of their yearly mass contributions to PM2.5. OM, EC, SIA, Na_Cl, and CM accounted for almost 81 % of the PM2.5 mass in Katowice, 74 % in Gdańsk, and 90 % in Diabla Góra. The annual average toxic metal contribution to the PM2.5 mass was not greater than 0.2 % at each site. In Katowice and Gdańsk, the yearly ambient BaP concentrations were high (15.4 and 3.2 ng/m3, respectively); in rural Diabla Góra, the concentrations of BaP were almost equal to 1 ng/m3, the Polish BaP annual limit. The great seasonal fluctuations of the shares of the component groups in PM2.5 and of the concentrations of PM2.5 and its components are due to the seasonal fluctuations of the emissions of PM and its precursors from hard and brown coal combustion for energy production, growing in a heating season, reaching maximum in winter, and decreasing in a non-heating period. In Gdańsk, northern Poland, especially in the spring and autumn, sea spray might have affected the chemical composition of PM2.5. The greatest hazard from PM2.5 occurs in Katowice, southern Poland, in winter, when very high concentrations of PM2.5 and PM2.5-related carbonaceous matter, including BaP, are maintained by poor natural ventilation in cities, weather conditions, and the highest level of industrialization in Poland. In less industrialized northern Poland, where the aeration in cities is better and rather gaseous than solid fuels are used, the health hazard from ambient PM2.5 is much lower.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiologic studies have consistently reported associations between outdoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) air pollution and adverse health effects. Although Asia bears the majority of the public health burden from air pollution, few epidemiologic studies have been conducted outside of North America and Europe due in part to challenges in population exposure assessment. We assessed the feasibility of two current exposure assessment techniques, land use regression (LUR) modeling and mobile monitoring, and estimated the mortality attributable to air pollution in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. We developed LUR models for predicting wintertime spatial patterns of NO2 and SO2 based on 2-week passive Ogawa measurements at 37 locations and freely available geographic predictors. The models explained 74% and 78% of the variance in NO2 and SO2, respectively. Land cover characteristics derived from satellite images were useful predictors of both pollutants. Mobile PM2.5 monitoring with an integrating nephelometer also showed promise, capturing substantial spatial variation in PM2.5 concentrations. The spatial patterns in SO2 and PM, seasonal and diurnal patterns in PM2.5, and high wintertime PM2.5/PM10 ratios were consistent with a major impact from coal and wood combustion in the city's low-income traditional housing (ger) areas. The annual average concentration of PM2.5 measured at a centrally located government monitoring site was 75 μg/m3 or more than seven times the World Health Organization's PM2.5 air quality guideline, driven by a wintertime average concentration of 148 μg/m3. PM2.5 concentrations measured in a traditional housing area were higher, with a wintertime mean PM2.5 concentration of 250 μg/m3. We conservatively estimated that 29% (95% CI, 12-43%) of cardiopulmonary deaths and 40% (95% CI, 17-56%) of lung cancer deaths in the city are attributable to outdoor air pollution. These deaths correspond to nearly 10% of the city's total mortality, with estimates ranging to more than 13% of mortality under less conservative model assumptions. LUR models and mobile monitoring can be successfully implemented in developing country cities, thus cost-effectively improving exposure assessment for epidemiology and risk assessment. Air pollution represents a major threat to public health in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, and reducing home heating emissions in traditional housing areas should be the primary focus of air pollution control efforts.",

    "abstract": "The effectiveness of regulatory actions designed to improve air quality is often assessed by predicting changes in public health resulting from their implementation. Risk of premature mortality from long-term exposure to ambient air pollution is the single most important contributor to such assessments and is estimated from observational studies generally assuming a log-linear, no-threshold association between ambient concentrations and death. There has been only limited assessment of this assumption in part because of a lack of methods to estimate the shape of the exposure-response function in very large study populations. In this paper, we propose a new class of variable coefficient risk functions capable of capturing a variety of potentially non-linear associations which are suitable for health impact assessment. We construct the class by defining transformations of concentration as the product of either a linear or log-linear function of concentration multiplied by a logistic weighting function. These risk functions can be estimated using hazard regression survival models with currently available computer software and can accommodate large population-based cohorts which are increasingly being used for this purpose. We illustrate our modeling approach with two large cohort studies of long-term concentrations of ambient air pollution and mortality: the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS II) cohort and the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC). We then estimate the number of deaths attributable to changes in fine particulate matter concentrations over the 2000 to 2010 time period in both Canada and the USA using both linear and non-linear hazard function models.",

    "abstract": "A major public health goal is to determine linkages between specific pollution sources and adverse health outcomes. This paper provides an integrative evaluation of the database examining effects of vehicular emissions, such as black carbon (BC), carbonaceous gasses, and ultrafine PM, on cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. Less than a decade ago, few epidemiological studies had examined effects of traffic emissions specifically on these health endpoints. In 2002, the first of many studies emerged finding significantly higher risks of CV morbidity and mortality for people living in close proximity to major roadways, vs. those living further away. Abundant epidemiological studies now link exposure to vehicular emissions, characterized in many different ways, with CV health endpoints such as cardiopulmonary and ischemic heart disease and circulatory-disease-associated mortality; incidence of coronary artery disease; acute myocardial infarction; survival after heart failure; emergency CV hospital admissions; and markers of atherosclerosis. We identify numerous in vitro, in vivo, and human panel studies elucidating mechanisms which could explain many of these cardiovascular morbidity and mortality associations. These include: oxidative stress, inflammation, lipoperoxidation and atherosclerosis, change in heart rate variability (HRV), arrhythmias, ST-segment depression, and changes in vascular function (such as brachial arterial caliber and blood pressure). Panel studies with accurate exposure information, examining effects of ambient components of vehicular emissions on susceptible human subjects, appear to confirm these mechanisms. Together, this body of evidence supports biological mechanisms which can explain the various CV epidemiological findings. Based upon these studies, the research base suggests that vehicular emissions are a major environmental cause of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in the United States. As a means to reduce the public health consequences of such emissions, it may be desirable to promulgate a black carbon (BC) PM(2.5) standard under the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which would apply to both on and off-road diesels. Two specific critical research needs are identified. One is to continue research on health effects of vehicular emissions, gaseous as well as particulate. The second is to utilize identical or nearly identical research designs in studies using accurate exposure metrics to determine whether other major PM pollutant sources and types may also underlie the specific health effects found in this evaluation for vehicular emissions.",

    "abstract": "Air quality health impact assessment (HIA) synthesizes information about air pollution exposures, health effects, and population vulnerability for regulatory decision-making and public engagement. HIAs often use annual average county or regional data to estimate health outcome incidence rates that vary substantially by season and at the subcounty level. Using New York City as an example, we assessed the sensitivity of estimated citywide morbidity and mortality attributable to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone to the geographic (county vs. neighborhood) and temporal (seasonal vs. annual average) resolution of health incidence data. We also used the neighborhood-level analysis to assess variation in estimated air pollution impacts by neighborhood poverty concentration. Estimated citywide health impacts attributable to PM2.5 and ozone were relatively insensitive to the geographic resolution of health incidence data. However, the neighborhood-level analysis demonstrated increasing impacts with greater neighborhood poverty levels, particularly for PM2.5-attributable asthma emergency department visits, which were 4.5 times greater in high compared to low-poverty neighborhoods. PM2.5-attributable health impacts were similar using seasonal and annual average incidence rates. Citywide ozone-attributable asthma morbidity was estimated to be 15 % lower when calculated from seasonal, compared to annual average incidence rates, as asthma morbidity rates are lower during the summer ozone season than the annual average rate. Within the ozone season, 57 % of estimated ozone-attributable emergency department for asthma in children occurred in the April-June period when average baseline incidence rates are higher than in the July-September period when ozone concentrations are higher. These analyses underscore the importance of utilizing spatially and temporally resolved data in local air quality impact assessments to characterize the overall city burden and identify areas of high vulnerability.",

    "abstract": "The impact of environmental pollutants and climate indicators on the outbreak of COVID-19 has gained considerable attention in the recent literature. However, specific investigation of industrial economies like Germany is not available. This provides us motivation to examine the association between environmental pollutants, climate indicators and the COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and deaths in Germany using daily data from February 24, 2020, to July 02, 2020. The correlation analysis and wavelet transform coherence (WTC) approach are the analytical tools, which are used to explore the association between variables included in the study. Our findings indicate that PM2.5, O3, and NO2 have a significant relationship with the outbreak of COVID-19. In addition, temperature is the only significant climate indicator which has significant correlation with the spread of COVID-19. Finally, PM10, humidity, and environmental quality index have a significant relationship only with the active cases from COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings conclude that Germany's successful response to COVID-19 is attributed to environmental legislation and the medical care system, which oversaw significant overhaul after the SARS and MERS outbreaks. The current study implicates that other industrial economies, especially European economies, that are still facing COVID-19 outbreak can follow the German model for pandemic response.",

This research article helps to determine the impact of climate on the lethality of this disease. Air quality index and average humidity are selected from the family of climate variables, to determine its impact on the daily new cases of COVID-19-related deaths in Wuhan, China. We have used wavelet analysis (wavelet transform coherence (WTC), partial (PWC), and multiple wavelet coherence (MWC), due to its advantages over traditional time series methods, to study the co-movement nexus between our selected data series. Findings suggest a notable coherence between air quality index, humidity, and mortality in Wuhan during a recent outbreak. Humidity is negatively related to the COVID-19-related deaths, and bad air quality leads to an increase in this mortality. These findings are important for policymakers to save precious human lives by better understanding the interaction of the environment with the COVID-19 disease.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, research into the efficacy of indoor air biofiltration mechanisms, notably living green walls, has become more prevalent. Whilst green walls are often utilised within the built environment for their biophilic effects, there is little evidence demonstrating the efficacy of active green wall biofiltration for the removal of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at concentrations found within an interior environment. The current work describes a novel approach to quantifying the VOC removal effectiveness by an active living green wall, which uses a mechanical system to force air through the substrate and plant foliage. After developing a single-pass efficiency protocol to understand the immediate effects of the system, the active green wall was installed into a 30-m3 chamber representative of a single room and presented with the contaminant 2-butanone (methyl ethyl ketone; MEK), a VOC commonly found in interior environments through its use in textile and plastic manufacture. Chamber inlet levels of MEK remained steady at 33.91 ± 0.541 ppbv. Utilising a forced-air system to draw the contaminated air through a green wall based on a soil-less growing medium containing activated carbon, the combined effects of substrate media and botanical component within the biofiltration system showed statistically significant VOC reduction, averaging 57% single-pass removal efficiency over multiple test procedures. These results indicate a high level of VOC removal efficiency for the active green wall biofilter tested and provide evidence that active biofiltration may aid in reducing exposure to VOCs in the indoor environment.",

    "abstract": "Since the identification of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the death toll from the direct infection by COVID-19 has exceeded 775,000, and more than 21 million cases have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) around the world. It is strongly believed that its impact might be worsened by poor outdoor and indoor air qualities, particularly on older adults. The nationwide lockdown measures were imposed between March 23 and June 20, 2020, to stop the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). In this work, the possible effects of the lockdown on the air quality were investigated using meteorological and air quality datasets obtained from eight monitoring stations covering the Eastern Province of the KSA. The studied air pollutants include carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and inhalable particulate matter (PM10). The NO2 was found to be the marker pollutant responding best to the lockdown measures since its concentrations decreased at all sites during- and post-lockdown periods and ranged between 12–86% and 14–81%, respectively. Compared with pre-lockdown period, the Eastern Province also experienced significant concentration reductions at varying rates for PM10 (21–70%), CO (5.8–55%), and SO2 (8.7–30%), while O3 concentrations showed increasing rates ranging between 6.3 and 45%. The consequences of these reductions were reflected in easing the outdoor air quality, which might reduce the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, especially on elderly and sensitive groups.",

    "abstract": "Amidst COVID-19 pandemic, extreme steps have been taken by countries globally. Lockdown enforcement has emerged as one of the mitigating measures to reduce the community spread of the virus. With a reduction in major anthropogenic activities, a visible improvement in air quality has been recorded in urban centres. Hazardous air quality in countries like India and China leads to high mortality rates from cardiovascular diseases. The present article deals with 6 megacities in India and 6 cities in Hubei province, China, where strict lockdown measures were imposed. The real-time concentration of PM2.5 and NO2 were recorded at different monitoring stations in the cities for 3 months, i.e. January, February, and March for China and February, March, and April for India. The concentration data is converted into AQI according to US EPA parameters and the monthly and weekly averages are calculated for all the cities. Cities in China and India after 1 week of lockdown recorded an average drop in AQIPM2.5 and AQINO2 of 11.32% and 48.61% and 20.21% and 59.26%, respectively. The results indicate that the drop in AQINO2 was instantaneous as compared with the gradual drop in AQIPM2.5. The lockdown in China and India led to a final drop in AQIPM2.5 of 45.25% and 64.65% and in AQINO2 of 37.42% and 65.80%, respectively. This study will assist the policymakers in devising a pathway to curb down air pollutant concentration in various urban cities by utilising the benchmark levels of air pollution.",

    "abstract": "Assessment of exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is important due to the widespread presence of PAHs in the environment and their toxicological relevance, especially to susceptible populations such as children and their health. The aim of this study is to compare indoor and outdoor concentrations of particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) and 15 individual PAHs, as well as contribution of the analyzed PAHs to mutagenic and carcinogenic activity. Samples were collected during spring season in two sites in southern Poland (Silesia) representing urban and rural areas. Indoor samples of PM2.5 were sampled in kindergartens. At the same time, in the vicinity of the kindergarten buildings, the collection of the outdoor PM2.5 samples was carried out. Mutagenic (MEQ) and carcinogenic (TEQ) equivalents related to BaP and the percentage share expressed as mutagenic (MP) and carcinogenic (CP) potential of each individual compound to the total mutagenic/carcinogenic potential of the PAH mixture were calculated. The obtained results show that high concentrations of PM2.5 (above 25 μg/m3) and 15 PM2.5-bound PAHs in outdoor and indoor air were similar in the two studied areas. In overall PAHs mutagenic and carcinogenic potential, the percentage share of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) was dominant and varied from 49.0-54.5% to 62.5-70.0%, respectively. The carried out study indicates the necessity of reducing PAH emission from solid fuel combustion, which is reflected in PM2.5-bound PAHs concentrations and their diagnostic ratios. In the recent years, health effects on children resulting from their activity pattern and air quality in the public places have been a serious problem.",

    "abstract": "The main goal of this paper is to identify the drivers responsible for the high particulate matter concentrations observed in recent years in several urban areas in Poland. The problem was investigated using air quality and meteorological data from routine monitoring network, air mass back trajectories and multivariate statistical modelling. Air pollution in central and southern part of the country was analysed and compared with this in northern-eastern \"The Green Lungs of Poland\" region. The analysis showed that in all investigated locations, there is a clear annual cycle of observed concentrations, closely following temperature-heating cycles, with the highest concentrations noted in January. However, the main drivers differ along the country, being either connected with regional background pollution (in the central part of the country) or with local emission sources (in the southern part). The occurrence of high PM10 concentrations is most commonly associated with the influence of high-pressure systems that brought extremely cold and stable air masses form East or South of Europe. During analysed episodes, industrial point sources had the biggest (up to 70-80 %) share in PM10 levels on the days with maximum PM pollution, while remote and residential/traffic sources determined the air quality in the early stages of the episodes. Principal component analysis (PCA) shows that secondary inorganic aerosols account for long-range transported pollution, As, Cd, Pb and Zn for industrial point sources, while Cr and Cu for residential and traffic sources of PM10, respectively.",

    "abstract": "On the 23 March 2020, a country-wide COVID-19 lockdown was imposed on the UK. The following 100 days saw anthropogenic movements quickly halt, before slowly easing back to a \"new\" normality. In this short communication, we use data from official UK air-quality sensors (DEFRA AURN) and the UK Met Office stations to show how lockdown measures affected air quality in the UK. We compare the 100 days post-lockdown (23 March to 30 June 2020) with the same period from the previous 7 years. We find, as shown in numerous studies of other countries, the nitrogen oxides levels across the country dropped substantially (∼ 50%). However, we also find the ozone levels increased (∼ 10%), and the levels of sulphur dioxide more than doubled across the country. These changes, driven by a complex balance in the air chemistry near the surface, may reflect the influence of low humidity as suggested by Met Office data, and potentially, the reduction of nitrogen oxides and their interactions with multiple pollutants.",

    "abstract": "In this work, based on the existing studies on photochemical reactions in the lower atmosphere, an analysis of the historical series of NOx, NO2, and O3 concentrations measured in the period 2015-2019 by two monitoring stations located in the urban area of Turin, Italy, was elaborated. The objective was to investigate the concentration trends of the contaminants and evaluate possible simplified relationships based on the observed values. Concentration trends of these pollutants were compared in different time bands (diurnal or seasonal cycles), highlighting some differences in the dispersion of the validated data. Calculated [NO2]/[NOx] ratios were in agreement with the values observed in other urban areas worldwide. The influence of temperature on the [NO2]/[NOx] ratio was investigated. An increase of [NO2]/[NOx] concentration ratio was found with increasing temperature. Finally, a set of empirical relationships for the preliminary determination of NO2 concentration values as a function of the NOx was elaborated and compared with existing formulations. Polynomial functions were adapted to the average concentration values returned by the division into classes of 10 μg/m3 of NOx. The choice of an empirical function to estimate the trend of NO2 concentrations is potentially useful for the preliminary data analysis, especially in case of data scarcity. The scatter plots showed differences between the two monitoring stations, which may be attributable to a different urban context in which the stations are located. The dissonance between a purely residential context (Rubino station) and another characterised by the co-presence of residential buildings and industries of various kinds (Lingotto station) leads to the need to consider a greater contribution to the calculation of the concentrations emitted in an industrial/residential context due to a greater presence of industrial chimneys but also to more intense motorised vehicle transport. The analysis of the ratio between nitrogen oxides and tropospheric ozone confirmed that, as O3 concentration increases, there is a consequent reduction of NOx concentration, due to the chemical reactions of the photo-stationary cycle that takes place between the two species. This work highlighted that the use of an empirical formulation for the estimation of [NOx] to [NO2] conversion rate could in principle be adopted. However, the application of empirical models for the preliminary estimation of [NOx] conversion to [NO2] cannot replace advanced models and should be, in principle, restricted to a limited area and a limited range of NOx concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Airborne microplastics (MPs) can be easily inhaled by humans, impacting their health as they spend more than 80% of their time indoors, especially during the pandemic. Only a few research studies have examined indoor MPs in the micrometer size range using active sampling, and studies have mainly concentrated on MPs that are millimeters in size. This study investigated the composition of indoor airborne MPs by active sampling in seven houses in the city center of northwestern Turkey (Eskişehir) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The visual identification showed the presence of different colored MPs, white, red, orange, green, and yellow, with different shapes (fibers, fragments, films, lines, foam, and pellets). The size of the identified MPs was between 2.5 and 327.36 μm. The polymeric composition analysis showed the presence of 123 MPs in all the samples with 22 different polymeric compositions. Residents in these houses are exposed to airborne MPs, with inhalation estimates ranging from 12.03 to 18.51 MPs/m 3 . However, it was also estimated that humans inhale 156–240 MPs daily in these houses. The dominant MPs were polyamide 6, polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, ethylene propylene, polystyrene, and high-density polyethylene. Scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x-ray elemental analysis revealed the presence of common structural elements, additives, or vectors that are added or adsorbed to MPs like carbon, oxygen, fluorine, magnesium, silicon, chlorine, nitrogen, and aluminum. These indoor environments are prone to MP pollution. Still, the MP level varies due to different characteristics of indoor environments, like activities and the number of occupants/people in the space, etc. The smaller MPs in all the samples highlight the necessity for standardized techniques of MP collection.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This research analyzes the dynamic relationship between green bonds, energy prices, geopolitical risk, and CO 2 emissions. In doing so, the study examines the global scale at disaggregated (i.e., sectoral) level, applies a novel time and frequency-based approach (i.e., wavelet local multiple correlation-WLMC), and uses high-frequency daily data between 1st January 2020 and 28th April 2023. In doing so, the study considers the potential differences among sectors. So, aggregated and disaggregated level CO 2 emissions on sectoral bases are investigated. Hence, the study comprehensively uncovers the effect of the aforementioned indicators on global CO 2 emissions. The results reveal that on CO 2 emissions (i) the most influential factor is the geopolitical risk (2020/1–2021/5), green bonds (2021/5–2021/7), energy prices (2021/7–2023/1), and green bonds (2023/1–2023/4); (ii) the effects of the influential factors are much weaker (stronger) at lower (higher) frequencies; (iii) the effect of the influential factors change based on times and frequencies; (iv) however, the effects of the influential factors on CO 2 emissions do not differ at aggregated or disaggregated levels. Overall, the results present novel insights for time and frequency-varying effects as well as both aggregated and disaggregated level analyses of global CO 2 emissions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Emission of microplastics (MP) to the atmosphere, airborne transport, and subsequent deposition are now recognized. However, the temporal and spatial resolution of data on MP pollution and knowledge of their atmospheric behaviour and fate is still very limited. Hence, we investigated MP wet and dry deposition in Central Germany and examined the role of weather conditions on MP contamination levels. Monthly samples of dry and wet deposition were taken over an eight-month period (05/2019-12/2019) and analysed by micro-Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy (µFTIR) down to 11 μm particle size and one dry deposition sample was subjected to Raman analysis to determine plastic particles down to a size of 0.5 μm. MP in a size range from 11 μm to 130 μm were detected in all wet deposition samples and in 4 out of 8 dry deposition samples by µFTIR. Polypropylene particles were found most frequently and accounted for 62% and 54% of all particles in wet and dry deposition samples, respectively. Over the eight-month period, wet deposition of MP slightly dominated at the study site and comprised 59% of the total MP deposition. The MP mean total (wet + dry) deposition flux (DF) was 17 ± 14 MP m − 2 day − 1 . Extensive Raman analyses of an exemplary dry deposition sample revealed additional plastic particles in the extended size range from 1 to 10 μm resulting in a deposition flux of 207 MP m − 2 day − 1 . Our results suggest that MP analysis by µFTIR down to 11 μm may underestimate DF at least by an order of magnitude. More comprehensive studies on submicron plastics and nanoplastics are needed to fully assess air pollution by plastic particles.",

    "abstract": "An important source of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in residential areas, particularly in the winter season, is the burning process when wood is used for domestic heating. The target of this study was to investigate the particle-phase PAH composition of ambient samples in order to assess the influence of wood combustion on air quality in residential areas. PM(10) samples (particulate matter <10 mum) were collected during two winter seasons at two rural residential areas near Stuttgart in Germany. Samples were extracted using toluene in an ultrasonic bath and subsequently analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Twenty-one PAH compounds were detected and quantified. The PAH fingerprints of different wood combustion emissions were found in significant amounts in ambient samples and high correlations between total PAHs and other wood smoke tracers were found, indicating the dominant influence of wood combustion on air quality in residential areas. Carcinogenic PAHs were detected in high concentrations and contributed 49% of the total PAHs in the ambient air. To assess the health risk, we investigated the exposure profile of individual PAHs. The findings suggest that attention should be focused on using the best combustion technology available to reduce emissions from wood-fired heating during the winter in residential areas.",

    "abstract": "Both nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) are powerful oxidants in ambient air that are intimately linked through atmospheric chemistry and which continuously interchange over very short timescales. Based upon atmospheric chemistry alone, there is a strong, a priori, reason for considering O3 and NO2 together in epidemiological studies, rather than either of the two pollutants separately in single-pollutant models. This paper compares two approaches to this, using Ox, defined as O3 + NO2, as a single metric and also using O3 and NO2 together in two-pollutant models. We hypothesised that the magnitude of the association between Ox and daily mortality would be greater than for NO2 and O3 individually. Using collocated hourly measurements for O3 and NO2 in London, from 2000 to 2005, we carried out a time series analysis of daily mortality. We investigated O3, NO2 and Ox individually in single-pollutant Poisson regression models and NO2 and O3 jointly in two-pollutant models in both all-year and season-specific analyses. We observed larger associations for mean 24-h concentrations of Ox (1.30 % increase in mortality per 10 ppb) than for O3 (0.87 %) and NO2 (0 %) individually. However, when analysed jointly in two-pollutant models, associations for O3 (1.54 %) and NO2 (1.07 %) were comparable to the Ox association. Season-specific analyses broadly followed this pattern irrespective of whether the Ox concentrations were driven by O3 production (summer) or depletion (winter). This novel approach in air pollution epidemiology captures the simultaneous impact of both oxidants whilst avoiding many of the statistical issues associated with two-pollutant models and potentially simplifies health impact calculations.",

    "abstract": "The growing number of health studies identifying adverse health effects for populations spending significant amounts of time near large roadways has increased the interest in monitoring air quality in this microenvironment. Designing near-road air monitoring networks or interpreting previously collected near-road monitoring data is essential for transportation system planning, environmental impact assessments, and exposure assessments in health studies. For these applications, care must be taken in determining the pollutants of interest for both air quality and health assessments. In addition, planners and data analysts need to evaluate and understand the potential influence of the roadway type, design, and presence of roadside structures on the potential transport and dispersion of traffic-emitted pollutants on these air quality and health evaluations. This paper summarizes key factors related to the collection and interpretation of near-road air quality data from the perspective of the pollutants of interest and the location of the monitoring sites.",

    "abstract": "Forty-nine components of ambient particulate matter (PM) in size-fractionated PM were investigated at an urban background site in Katowice (Silesian Agglomeration in Southern Poland) in the non-heating season of 2012. PM was analyzed for two groups of carbon compounds (organic (OC) and elemental (EC) carbon, Lab OC-EC Aerosol Analyzer), five major water-soluble ions (NH4+, Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, and Na+ contents in PM water extracts, ion chromatography), 26 elements (X-ray fluorescence spectrometry), and 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs, gas chromatography). The distributions of the masses of these components among 13 basic PM fractions were determined, and chemical mass closure was checked for each of these fractions separately. The particles having their aerodynamic diameters in the interval 0.03-0.26 μm, the fraction PM0.03-0.26, contributed about 13 % to the total PM mass. This PM fraction consisted of primary particles predominantly composed of various inorganic compounds, primary organic compounds, and, in lesser amounts, of elemental carbon, secondary ions, and secondary organic compounds. The second particle fraction, PM0.26-1.6, consisted mainly of secondary matter, and its mass contribution to the total PM mass was about 59 %. The third fraction, PM1.6-40, was a fraction of coarse particles composed of mineral/soil and organic matter and elemental carbon. It contributed to the PM mass about 28 %. For each of PM0.03-0.26, PM0.26-1.6, and PM1.6-40, the health hazard from its 16 PAH contents was determined by computing toxicity factors. PM0.26-1.6 posed the greatest health hazard from the mixture of the 16 PAHs that it contained, PM1.6-40 was the next, and the hazard from the PM0.03-0.26-bound 16 PAHs was the smallest. The molecular diagnostic ratios computed for these three fractions were specific for coal and wood combustion; some indicated the road traffic effects.",

    "abstract": "Bioaerosols play a significant role in indoor air quality (IAQ) as they can be the cause of several health problems, including acute allergies and infectious diseases. This study aimed to characterize and compare the microbial air quality of air-conditioned (AC) and naturally ventilated (NV) office rooms in the Upper Silesia region of Poland. The bacterial samples were collected during the late spring season. Culturable bacteria were deposited on the nutrient media on Petri dishes to investigate the viable-culturable count (VCC) of bacteria and bacterial community structure using a Biolog GEN III system. In total, 12 species of bacteria were identified, with the most isolated Macrococcus equipercicus, Micrococcus luteus D, Staphylococcus xylosus (indoor), and Bacillus species (outdoor). The indoor mean concentrations of bacterial aerosol ranged from 102 to 103 CFU m−3, below Polish proposals for threshold limit standards in office buildings. The indoor-to-outdoor (I/O) ratios indicated that studied air pollutants in the office rooms originated from the indoor air. These results, together with community composition of bacteria, indicate that most of the bacteria present in the studied office building were relatively fresh and of human origin. Multi-antibiotic resistance (MAR) tests showed that the most antibiotic-resistant features were present in Macrococcus species. The office building exposure dose (OBED) and mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of bacteria aerosol were estimated. The highest value of OBED over the study period was obtained for staff working in offices with natural ventilation (141 CFU kg−1), in contrast to the value for staff working in offices equipped with air conditioning (about 100 CFU kg−1). The MMAD of viable airborne bacteria was higher in AC offices (2.4 μm) than in NV offices (2.2 μm).",

    "abstract": "This study presents a comprehensive analysis of an extreme dust event recorded in the Arabian Peninsula and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) between 31 March and 3 April 2015. Simulations of the dust event with the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with the Chemistry module (WRF-Chem) were analyzed and verified using MSG-SEVIRI imagery and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the recent 1-km Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm for MODIS Terra/Aqua. Data from the National Centers for Atmospheric Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) and the upper-air radiosonde observations were used to understand the synoptic of the event. In addition, the impact of the event on atmospheric and air quality conditions is investigated. The Air Quality Index (AQI) was calculated prior, during, and after the event to assess the degradation of air quality conditions. Simulated temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and surface radiation were compared to observations at six monitoring stations in the UAE giving R2 values of 0.84, 0.63, 0.60, and 0.84, respectively. From 1 to 2 April 2015, both observations and simulations showed an average drop in temperature from 33 to 26 °C and radiance reduction from about 950 to 520 Wm−2. The AOD modeled by WRF-Chem showed a good correlation with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements in the UAE with R2 of 0.83. The AQI over the UAE reached hazardous levels during the peak of the dust event before rapidly decreasing to moderate–good air quality levels. This work is the first attempt to demonstrate the potential of using WRF-Chem to estimate AQI over the UAE along with two satellite products (MODIS-MAIAC and MSG-SEVIRI) for dust detection and tracking.",

    "abstract": "It has been well established that both meteorological attributes and air pollution concentrations affect human health outcomes. We examined all cause nonaccident mortality relationships for 28 years (1981-2008) in relation to air pollution and synoptic weather type (encompassing air mass) data in 12 Canadian cities. This study first determines the likelihood of summertime extreme air pollution events within weather types using spatial synoptic classification. Second, it examines the modifying effect of weather types on the relative risk of mortality (RR) due to daily concentrations of air pollution (nitrogen dioxide, ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter <2.5 μm). We assess both single- and two-pollutant interactions to determine dependent and independent pollutant effects using the relatively new time series technique of distributed lag nonlinear modeling (DLNM). Results display dry tropical (DT) and moist tropical plus (MT+) weathers to result in a fourfold and twofold increased likelihood, respectively, of an extreme pollution event (top 5 % of pollution concentrations throughout the 28 years) occurring. We also demonstrate statistically significant effects of single-pollutant exposure on mortality (",

    "abstract": "In Bangladesh, a nationwide lockdown was imposed on 26 March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to restricted emissions, it was hypothesized that the air quality has been improved during lockdown throughout the country. The study is intended to assess the impact of nationwide lockdown measures on air quality in Bangladesh. We analyzed satellite data for four different air pollutants (NO2, SO2, CO, and O3) to assess the changes in the atmospheric concentrations of pollutants in major cities as well as across the country. In this study, the concentrations of NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 from 1 February to 30 May of the year 2019 and 2020 were analyzed. The average SO2 and NO2 concentrations were decreased by 43 and 40%, respectively, while tropospheric O3 were found to be increased with a maximum of > 7%. Among the major cities, Dhaka, Gazipur, Chattogram, and Narayanganj were found to be more influenced by the restricted emissions. In Dhaka, NO2 and SO2 concentrations were decreased approximately by 69 and 67%, respectively. Our analysis reveals that NO2 concentrations are highly correlated with the regional COVID-19 cases (r = 0.74). The study concludes that the lockdown measures significantly reduced air pollution because of reduced vehicular and industrial emissions in Bangladesh.",

    "abstract": "More than 80% of people living in urban areas who monitor air pollution are exposed to air quality levels that exceed limits defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). Although all regions of the world are affected, populations in low-income cities are the most impacted. According to average annual levels of fine particulate matter (PM2.5, ambient particles with aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less) presented in the urban air quality database issued by WHO in 2016, as many as 33 Polish cities are among the 50 most polluted cities in the European Union (EU), with Silesian cities topping the list. The aim of this study was to characterize the indoor air quality in Silesian kindergartens based on the concentrations of gaseous compounds (SO2, NO2), PM2.5, and the sum of 15 PM2.5-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), including PM2.5-bound benzo(a)pyrene (BaP), as well as the mutagenic activity of PM2.5 organic extracts in Salmonella assay (strains: TA98, YG1024). The assessment of the indoor air quality was performed taking into consideration the pollution of the atmospheric air (outdoor). I/O ratios (indoor/outdoor concentration) for each investigated parameter were also calculated. Twenty-four-hour samples of PM2.5, SO2, and NO2 were collected during spring in two sites in southern Poland (Silesia), representing urban and rural areas. Indoor samples were taken in naturally ventilated kindergartens. At the same time, in the vicinity of the kindergarten buildings, the collection of outdoor samples of PM2.5, SO2, and NO2 was carried out. The content of BaP and the sum of 15 studied PAHs was determined in each 24-h sample of PM2.5 (indoor and outdoor). In the urban site, statistically lower concentrations of SO2 and NO2 were detected indoors compared to outdoors, whereas in the rural site, such a relationship was observed only for NO2. No statistically significant differences in the concentrations of PM2.5, PM2.5-bound BaP, and Σ15 PAHs in kindergartens (indoor) versus atmospheric (outdoor) air in the two studied areas were identified. Mutagenic effect of indoor PM2.5 samples was twice as low as in outdoor samples. The I/O ratios indicated that all studied air pollutants in the urban kindergarten originated from the ambient air. In the rural site concentrations of SO2, PM2.5 and BaP in the kindergarten were influenced by internal sources (gas and coal stoves).",

    "abstract": "Health effect estimates depend on the methods of evaluating exposures. Due to non-linearities in the exposure-response relationships, both the predicted mean exposures as well as its spatial variability are significant. The aim of this work is to systematically quantify the impact of the spatial resolution on population-weighted mean concentration (PWC), its variance, and mortality attributable to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure in Finland in 2015. The atmospheric chemical transport model SILAM was used to estimate the ambient air PM2.5 concentrations at 0.02° longitudinal × 0.01° latitudinal resolution (ca. 1 km), including both the national PM2.5 emissions and the long-range transport. The decision-support model FRES source-receptor matrices applied at 250-m resolution was used to model the ambient air concentrations of primary fine particulate matter (PPM2.5) from local and regional sources up to 10 km and 20 km distances. Numerical averaging of population and concentrations was used to produce the results for coarser resolutions. Population-weighted PM2.5 concentration was 11% lower at a resolution of 50 km, compared with the corresponding computations at a resolution of 1 km. However, considering only the national emissions, the influences of spatial averaging were substantially larger. The average population-weighted local PPM2.5 concentration originated from Finnish sources was 70% lower at a resolution of 50 km, compared with the corresponding result obtained using a resolution of 250 m. The sensitivity to spatial averaging, between the finest 250-m and the coarsest 50-km resolution, was highest for the emissions of PPM2.5 originated from national vehicular traffic (about 80% decrease) and lowest for the national residential combustion (60% decrease). Exposure estimates in urban areas were more sensitive to the changes of model resolution (14% and 74% decrease for PM2.5 and local PPM2.5, respectively), compared with estimates in rural areas (2% decrease for PM2.5 and 36% decrease for PPM2.5). We conclude that for the evaluation of the health impacts of air pollution, the resolution of the model computations is an important factor, which can potentially influence the predicted health impacts by tens of percent or more, especially when assessing the impacts of national emissions.",

    "abstract": "Ambient nitrogen dioxide is a widely available measure of traffic-related air pollution and is inconsistently associated with the prevalence of asthma symptoms in children. The use of this relationship to evaluate the health impact of policies affecting traffic management and traffic emissions is limited by the lack of a concentration-response function based on systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies. Using systematic methods, we identified papers containing quantitative estimates for nitrogen dioxide and the 12 month period prevalence of asthma symptoms in children in which the exposure contrast was within-community and dominated by traffic pollution. One estimate was selected from each study according to an a priori algorithm. Odds ratios were standardised to 10 μg/m3 and summary estimates were obtained using random- and fixed-effects estimates. Eighteen studies were identified. Concentrations of nitrogen dioxide were estimated for the home address (12) and/or school (8) using a range of methods; land use regression (6), study monitors (6), dispersion modelling (4) and interpolation (2). Fourteen studies showed positive associations but only two associations were statistically significant at the 5 % level. There was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 32.8 %) and the random-effects estimate for the odds ratio was 1.06 (95 % CI 1.00 to 1.11). There was no evidence of small study bias. Individual studies tended to have only weak positive associations between nitrogen dioxide and asthma prevalence but the summary estimate bordered on statistical significance at the 5 % level. Although small, the potential impact on asthma prevalence could be considerable because of the high level of baseline prevalence in many cities. Whether the association is causal or indicates the effects of a correlated pollutant or other confounders, the estimate obtained by the meta-analysis would be appropriate for estimating impacts of traffic pollution on asthma prevalence.",

    "abstract": "The nationwide lockdown in India to flatten the pandemic COVID-19 curve has resulted in the reduction of anthropogenic emission sources to a great extent. This study reports change in air quality and its impact on the environment during the unique lockdown scenario at Bhubaneswar, a coastal smart city in east India. The urban air shows a remarkable reduction in the mean pollutant levels influenced by traffic emission viz. NOx (~ 67 %) and BC (~ 47 %) during lockdown over the pre-lockdown. Comparatively, a lower reduction of CO (~ 14 %) is attributed to the dominance of natural atmospheric chemical regulation and biogenic sources in addition to anthropogenic contributions. In addition to the lockdown, frequent rain events due to depression in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) also had a significant role in the reduction of the primary pollutants over the study site. An enhancement of secondary pollutant viz. O3 (~ 3%) with a distinct diurnal pattern was observed during the first phase of lockdown over the pre-lockdown period. An anti-correlation between O3 and NOx during pre-lockdown points to a higher O3 production potential with decreasing NOx. While a reduction in the titration of O3 due to suppression of fresh NO emissions led to accumulation of O3 in the first phase of lockdown, inhibited photochemistry due to cloudy skies as well as reduction in precursors led to lower O3 values during the later phases of lockdown.",

Laboratory exposure to ultraviolet irradiance in the UVC range inactivates many viruses and bacteria in times less than 30 min. Estimated UVB inactivation doses from sunlight in J/m2 are obtained from UVC measurements and radiative transfer calculations, weighted by a virus inactivation action spectrum, using OMI satellite atmospheric data for ozone, clouds, and aerosols. For SARS CoV, using an assumed UVC dose near the mid-range of measured values, D90 = 40 J/m2, 90% inactivation times T90 are estimated for exposure to midday 10:00-14:00 direct plus diffuse sunlight and for nearby locations in the shade (diffuse UVB only). For the assumed D90 = 40 J/m2 model applicable to SARS CoV viruses, calculated estimates show that near noon 11:00-13:00 clear-sky direct sunlight gives values of T90 < 90 min for mid-latitude sites between March and September and less than 60 min for many equatorial sites for 12 months of the year. Recent direct measurements of UVB sunlight inactivation of the SARS CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19 show shorter T90 inactivation times less than 10 min depending on latitude, season, and hour. The equivalent UVC 254 nm D90 dose for SARS CoV-2 is estimated as 3.2 ± 0.7 J/m2 for viruses on a steel mesh surface and 6.5 ± 1.4 J/m2 for viruses in a growth medium. For SARS CoV-2 clear-sky T90 on a surface ranges from 4 min in the equatorial zone to less than 30 min in a geographic area forming a near circle with solar zenith angle < 60O centered on the subsolar point for local solar times from 09:00 to 15:00 h.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The work presents the results of short-term health effects assessment of particulate matter (PM) in Warsaw, the capital of Poland. The influence of three PM fractions, PM10 (particles of aerodynamic diameter &lt; 10 μm), PM2.5 (particles of aerodynamic diameter &lt; 2.5 μm), and PMc (coarse fraction of diameter between 2.5 and 10 μm), modeled by the CALMET/CALPUFF system, has been studied in the period of 2013–2014. Six population health endpoints; daily counts of all-cause (ALL), cardiovascular (CV), and respiratory (RS) death cases; and ALL, CV, and RS hospital admissions were investigated with the use of statistical time series analysis via nonparametric generalized additive model (GAM) approach. The results show that PM2.5 increases the relative risk (RR) of ALL premature deaths by 0.7% per 10 μg/m 3 , as well as of CV mortality by 0.9%. PM10 exposures reveal the largest influence on mortality in a 2-day lag: 0.3% for all causes and 0.4% for CV causes, while for RS causes only in the elderly group (above 65 years, 1.4%) and for males (2.1%). The risk of hospitalizations increases with elevated PMc levels by 2.5%, 2.1%, and 4.6% for ALL, CV, and RS hospital admissions, respectively. The results suggest that the research on PM impact on health should concentrate more on attempts to assign specific health outcomes to PM originating from different types of sources, characterized by different granulation, as well as physical and chemical properties of emitted particles.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a worldwide pandemic after its first outbreak in Wuhan, China. However, it remains unclear whether COVID-19 death is linked to ambient air pollutants or meteorological conditions. We collected the daily COVID-19 death number, air quality index (AQI), ambient air pollutant concentrations, and meteorological variables data of Wuhan between Jan 25 and April 7, 2020. The Pearson and Poisson regression models were used accordingly to understand the association between COVID-19 deaths and each risk factor. The daily COVID-19 deaths were positively correlated with AQI (slope = 0.4 ± 0.09, R2 = 0.24, p < 0.01). Detailedly, PM2.5 was the only pollutant exhibiting a positive association (relative risk (RR) = 1.079, 95%CI 1.071-1.086, p < 0.01) with COVID-19 deaths. The PM10, SO2, and CO were all also significantly associated with COVID-19 deaths, but in negative pattern (p < 0.01). Among them, PM10 and CO had the highest and lowest RR, which equaled to 0.952 (95%CI 0.945-0.959) and 0.177 (95%CI 0.131-0.24), respectively. Additionally, temperature was inversely associated with COVID-19 deaths (RR = 0.861, 95%CI 0.851-0.872, p < 0.01). Contrarily, diurnal temperature range was positively associated with COVID-19 deaths (RR = 1.014, 95%CI 1.003-1.025, p < 0.05). The data suggested that PM2.5 and diurnal temperature range are tightly associated with increased COVID-19 deaths.",

Furthermore, PM 2.5 is associated with cardiopulmonary diseases and premature mortality. Here, we use seven models to assess the response of PM 2.5 to end of the twenty-first century climate change under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5, and the corresponding impact on premature mortality. The majority of models yield an increase in both PM 2.5 and premature mortality associated with lung cancer and cardiopulmonary disease in all world regions except Africa. These results are robust across five different future population projections, although the magnitude of premature deaths can vary by up to a factor of two. Much larger uncertainty is related to uncertainty in model physics and the representation of aerosol processes. Although our analysis requires several assumptions related to future population estimates, as well as the concentration-response function, results suggest that future emission reductions are necessary to avoid the likely health risks associated with increasing PM 2.5 in a warmer world.",

To this end, the study employs an asymmetric Fourier causality test for the period of January 15, 2020 to May 4, 2020. The outcomes indicate that positive shocks in COVID-19 deaths cause negative shocks in PM2.5 emissions for New York, San Diego, and San Jose. Moreover, in terms of cases, positive shocks in COVID-19 cause negative shocks in PM2.5 emissions for Los Angeles, Chicago, Phoenix, Philadelphia, San Antonio, and San Jose. Overall, the findings of the study highlight that the pandemic reduces environmental pressure in the largest cities of the USA. This implies that one of the rare positive effects of the virus is to reduce air pollution. Therefore, for a better environment, US citizens should review the impact of current production and consumption activities on anthropogenic environmental problems.",

These include breathing conditions, variability of the geometry of the RT, chemical composition and size of deposits. Different dosimetry modelling approaches have been studied including empirical formulations, one-dimensional flow modelling and computational fluid dynamic methods (CFD). The importance of a realistic modelling of hygroscopicity has been also investigated. A better understanding of the relationship between health effects and inhaled particle dose may be elaborated using dosimetry and clearance modelling tools. A future required approach is to combine dosimetry models with physiologically based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) to simulate the transport and cumulative dose of particle-bound chemical species in different organs and tissues of the human body.",

Due to their adverse health effects, countries around the globe have introduced stringent emission standards to reduce the formation of PCDD/Fs. Using data in the literature over the past two decades (2001 to 2023), this review discussed the PCDD/F emissions from incineration facilities, E-waste recycling, iron sintering, secondary metal smelting plants, and crematories. But the review only focused on pollutants and remediation strategies from the incineration processes. There are two heterogeneous mechanism pathways that lead to the formation of PCDD/Fs, firstly, the De novo phase, using macromolecules of carbon or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons to begin the synthesis, and secondly, the condensation reaction beginning with the rearrangement of the molecular structure of the precursor compound. On the remediation strategies, adsorption injections were the most preferred method; however, recent studies reported other strategies such as catalytic filtration systems, an electron beam system, and good combustion practices. This review concluded that a lot has been done to manage and prevent PCDD/F formation efficiently to the level which no longer poses a hazard to human health and the environment. Graphical abstract",

Assessment of PM deposition in the human respiratory tract is critical to better understand the health risks from environmental exposure of vulnerable age groups. In this study, PM 2.5 and PM 10 day-night monitoring campaigns during the cold season were carried out in Bragança, Portugal. The multiple-path particle dosimetry (MPPD) model was used to quantify total and regional depositions in the human respiratory tract for four different age groups: infant (3 months), child (9 years), adult (21 years) and elderly (65 years). The results showed that concentrations for both PM fractions were higher during the night, a period marked by the burning of biomass for residential heating. Regional deposition fractions (DF) for PM 2.5 were in the ranges 17–38% (head), 4–14% (tracheobronchial) and 20–28% (pulmonary), while for PM 10 were 24–67% (head), 4–27% (tracheobronchial) and 12–22% (pulmonary). Children and the elderly were found to be the most vulnerable groups to PM deposition, especially for the TB and H regions, respectively. The lifetime cancer and non-cancer risks associated with exposure to PM 2.5 exceeded the recommended limits, especially for children &lt;10 years old. These findings provide useful information to alert authorities to the need to take action to reduce the pollution burden and protect the health, in particular of those most susceptible.

As these megacities are located downwind of China, their air quality is easily affected by local and long-range transport sources. PM 2.5 samples collected in Seoul ( n = 222), Incheon ( n = 221), and Gwangju ( n = 224) from September 2020 to March 2022, were chemically characterized. Dispersion normalized positive matrix factorization was applied to these PM 2.5 speciated data to provide source apportionments. Nine common sources (including secondary nitrate, secondary sulfate, biomass burning, mobile, and waste incinerator) were identified at all sites. The conditional bivariate probability function helped to identify each site’s local sources. Joint potential source contribution function analysis identified northeast China and Inner Mongolia as potential source areas of long-range transport pollutants affecting all sites. Forced lifestyle changes due to the pandemic such as limited gatherings while increased recreational activities may have caused different patterns on the biomass burning source. The constraints on old vehicles during the policy implementation periods likely reduced the mobile source contributions in cities that adopted the policy. Secondary nitrate accounted for 40% of the PM 2.5 mass at all sites, implying a significant impact from NO X sources. While the current policy focuses primarily on controlling primary emission sources, it should include secondary sources as well which may include precursor emissions control. Healthier air quality would be achieved if the policy effects are not limited to local, but also to foreign sources in regions upwind of Korea by intergovernmental collaboration.",

They are emitted by a wide range of sources and can penetrate and accumulate specifically in indoor environments. Concern is growing among the scientific community regarding the potential health impacts of exposure to a high concentration of VOCs in indoor spaces. Due to their still-developing respiratory and immune systems, children may be the most fragile subjects in this regard, and therefore, the study of indoor air quality in schools is of the utmost importance. In this work, the concentrations of total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) and of 20 specific compounds belonging to this class were determined in a school in Squinzano, a town in the province of Lecce (Apulia region, southern Italy). Sampling was carried out in indoor (classrooms and bathrooms) and outdoor (terrace) areas using passive diffusive samplers for VOCs and photoionization detectors for TVOCs. Average concentrations of both TVOC (303 ± 47 µg m −3 ) and individual VOCs (&lt; 0.5 µg m −3 ) were below levels of concern; however, specific indoor sources such as cleaning activities and student occupancy were responsible for peaks in TVOC concentrations above harmless levels for children and school staff. The data were then compared to the ones obtained in a similar study conducted in a school in Galatina, another town of the Apulia region, highlighting the impact of the surrounding outdoor environment on the indoor profile of VOCs.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Ambient air pollution remains the major environmental cause of disease. Accurate assessment of population exposure and small-scale spatial exposure variations over long time periods is essential for epidemiological studies. We estimated annual exposure to fine and coarse particulate matter (PM 2.5 , PM 10 ), and nitrogen oxides (NO x , NO 2 ) with high spatial resolution to examine time trends 2000‒2018, compliance with the WHO Air Quality Guidelines, and assess the health impact. The modelling area covered six metropolitan areas in Sweden with a combined population of 5.5 million. Long-range transported air pollutants were modelled using a chemical transport model with bias correction, and locally emitted air pollutants using source-specific Gaussian-type dispersion models at resolutions up to 50 × 50 m. The modelled concentrations were validated using quality-controlled monitoring data. Lastly, we estimated the reduction in mortality associated with the decrease in population exposure. The validity of modelled air pollutant concentrations was good (R 2 for PM 2.5 0.84, PM 10 0.61, and NO x 0.87). Air pollution exposure decreased substantially, from a population weighted mean exposure to PM 2.5 of 12.2 µg m −3 in 2000 to 5.4 µg m −3 in 2018. We estimated that the decreased exposure was associated with a reduction of 2719 (95% CI 2046–3055) premature deaths annually. However, in 2018, 65%, 8%, and 42% of residents in the modelled areas were still exposed to PM 2.5 , PM 10 , or NO 2 levels, respectively, that exceeded the current WHO Air Quality Guidelines for annual average exposure. This emphasises the potential public health benefits of reductions in air pollution emissions.",

    "abstract": "Aerosol particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) and trace gases (SO2, NO2, CO and O3) were sampled at five locations in greater Dhaka, Bangladesh, between January and April 2006. Particulate matter was collected on micro-fiber filters with a low-volume sampler, and trace gases (SO2, NO2, and O3) were collected with an impinger equipped with PM samplers. Carbon monoxide was determined using the Indicator Tube method. The total average concentrations of SO2, NO2, CO, and O3 were 48.3, 21.0, 166.0 and 28 μg m–3, respectively. The total average concentrations of SO2 and NO2 were much lower than the annual average guideline values of the World Health Organization (WHO). The total average O3 concentration was also much lower than the daily maximum values established by WHO (average of 100 μg m–3 for an 8-h sample). The total average concentrations of five sites were 263, 75.5 and 66.2 μg m–3 for SPM, PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. The mass of PM2.5 is approximately 88% of the PM10 mass, indicating that fossil fuel is the main source of PM in Dhaka. An atomic absorption spectrophotometer was used to determine the heavy metal concentrations in the PM2.5 size fraction. The total average concentrations of As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb, and Zn in PM2.5 were 6.3, 13, 94, 433, 204, and 381 ng m–3, respectively. The Pb concentration in Dhaka shows a decreasing tendency, presumably due to the ban on the use of leaded fuel. The overall trace metal concentrations in Dhaka are higher than those in European (e.g., Spain, Norway) and East Asian (e.g., Taiwan) locations, but lower than those measured in Southeast Asian (Kanpur, Delhi, Mumbai, India; Lahore, Pakistan) cities.",

The samples were studied by epifluorescent microscopy, revealing the presence of bacterial cells attached to mineral particles. The microorganisms in the bioaerosol samples were able to grow in media containing up to 20% NaCl, suggesting that bacteria tolerant to high salinities remain viable in the atmosphere. Phylogenetic analysis using 16S rDNA sequences revealed that halobacterial communities in the bioaerosol samples collected at both 10 and 800 m above the ground comprised a few bacterial species related to Bacillus pumilus and Staphylococcus spp. The active mixing processes of the boundary layer presumably transports viable halotolerant bacteria into the free atmosphere, where the long-range atmospheric transport of desert dust is frequently observed.",

    "abstract": "Atmospheric particulate matter may exert serious health hazards because of its chemical characteristics. The main objective of this study is to assess the concentrations of total suspended particles (TSP), particulate matter (PM) with an aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm (PM10), and air-transmitted particulate trace metals in Tehran University (a central location in Tehran, capital of Iran) ambient air, for the period of 5 months viz. February–June 2007. Furthermore, the present work examines the daily levels of fine particles in comparison with the proposed limiting values from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (65 μg m−3 for PM10). The sampling for TSP and PM10 was performed using a high-volume sampler. The TSP and PM10 levels were determined by gravimetry and the metals by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Arithmetic means of 151 ± 44 µg m−3 and 90 ± 38 µg m−3 were determined for TSP and PM10, respectively. Comparing with EPA primary and secondary air quality standards, only PM10 concentrations in 3 days were higher than the standard values. Heavy metal content of both TSP and PM10, such as chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb), were also analyzed separately during the same period using atomic absorption spectrometry. The average concentrations of heavy metal in TSP were Pb: 183.63 ± 147.81 ng m−3; Cr: 13.72 ± 2.40 ng m−3; and Cd: 6.80 ± 1.97 ng m−3 and for PM10 were: 150.36 ± 157.01 ng m−3; Cr: 9.12 ± 2.14 ng m−3 and Cd: 6.87 ± 2.22 ng m−3.",

Results obtained were correlated with the three meteorological parameters: humidity, wind speed, and temperature recorded during the same period of time using the paired t test, probability p values, and correlation coefficients. Humidity and wind speed showed insignificant effects on NO(2), SO(2), O(3), and NH(3) concentrations at 95% confidence level. Temperature showed insignificant effects on the concentrations of NO(2) and NH(3) while significant effects on SO(2) and O(3) were observed. Nonlinear correlations (R(2) </= 0.722) were obtained for the changes in measured concentrations with changes in the three meteorological parameters. Passive samplers were shown to be not only precise (RSD </= 13.57) but also of low cost, low technical demand, and expediency in monitoring different locations.",

    "abstract": "National-scale health impact assessments (HIAs) have been conducted for many years and have become reasonably systematized. Recently, there has been growing interest in utilizing HIA methods at local scales, in the context of Environmental Public Health Tracking and in other settings. This paper investigates the data and analytical challenges to estimating the incidence of health effects associated with changes in air pollution concentrations at the local scale, focusing on ozone and fine particulate matter. Although it could be argued that the local-scale HIA is simply a more geographically discrete version of the national-scale assessment and, therefore, has similar challenges, in practice, many key inputs in national-scale assessments are assumed to be spatially uniform or vary only at coarse geographic resolution. For a national-scale assessment, this assumption may not contribute appreciable bias, but the bias could be significant for any individual location. Thus, local-scale assessments require more geographically resolved air quality data, concentration–response (C-R) functions, and baseline incidence rates than are often used. However, comprehensive local data may not be available, may be incomplete, or may be time-intensive and resource-intensive to develop, especially for C-R functions for which small-scale epidemiological studies will often be underpowered. Given this context, this paper considers how best to develop credible local-scale HIAs, identifying factors that contribute to variability across geographic areas, study designs, and time periods. This paper also describes which key sources of analytical uncertainty change as the scope shifts from the national to the local scale. These challenges notwithstanding, the paper concludes that a well-designed local-scale HIA, following key principles and recommendations, can be both informative and defensible.",

Twenty-four hour AAQSs for particulate matter <10 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in 96 countries were identified through literature review, an international survey, and querying an international legal database. Eighty three percent, of the 96 countries with information on the presence or absence of AAQSs, have 24-h AAQSs for either PM10 or SO2. Slightly more countries have 24-h AAQSs for SO2 (76 countries) than PM10 (69 countries). The average 24-h AAQSs for PM10 and SO2 are 95 μg/m3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 82–108 μg/m3, n = 68) and 182 μg/m3 (95% CI, 158–205 μg/m3, n = 73). The population-weighted average AAQS for PM10 is 98 and 155 μg/m3 for SO2. The average AAQS for both PM10 and SO2 are substantially higher than the recommended World Health Organization Air Quality Guideline (WHO AQG) value. Several countries have promulgated AAQSs at the WHO AQG value for PM10, but none for SO2. Further examination in selected countries found that air quality monitoring data, existing AAQSs in other countries, environmental epidemiology studies, and the WHO AQGs are considered the most often in establishing or revising AAQSs.",

    "abstract": "Forest fires are a major contributor of atmospheric gaseous and particulate pollutants. With respect to forest fires, Greece faces one of Europe's most severe problems during summer. To create a forest fire emissions inventory, a database which holds data for forest fires in Greece during the period 1997–2003 was established in this study and a methodology for the quantification of both gaseous and particulate matter emissions from forest fires was developed. The contribution of forest fire pollutant emissions to the total anthropogenic and natural emissions in Greece has been estimated in detail for a specific period during July 2000 when widespread forest fires occurred in the Greek mainland. The mesoscale air quality modeling system UAM-AERO was used to quantify the contribution of forest fire emissions to the air pollution levels in Greece, and it was calculated that the forest fire emissions were the largest contributors to the air pollution problem in regions tens of kilometers away from the fire source during this period. The wildfire emissions were calculated to cause an increase in the average PM10 concentration, organic aerosol mass, and gaseous concentration of several pollutants, among them CO, NO x , and NH3. An average contribution of 50% to the PM10 concentration over the region around the burnt area and downwind of the fire source (approximately 500 km) is calculated with a maximum of 80%, whereas, for CO, the average contribution was 50% during this period. The theoretical calculations were compared with in situ observations of smoke aerosols captured by a backscatter lidar system over the Greater Athens Basin as well as with surface observations of NO2 and O3 and the calculated concentrations were in better agreement with observations when forest fire emissions were included in the model calculations.",

    "abstract": "Long-range transport of atmospheric microbiota with Asian dust (Kosa) particles is of great concern in Northeast Asia in view of the health effect of Kosa particles on human being, disturbance of ecosystems caused through invasion of new microbe, contribution of microorganisms to biogeochemical cycle on global/regional scales, and others. Information on atmospheric microbes over the desert areas has been desired for a long time. Detection of atmospheric microbiota on the desert regions, on the base of balloon-borne measurements, has been made at Dunhuang, China (40°00′ N, 94°30′ E; east end of Taklamakan desert) in the summer of 2007. The measurements showed that microbiota mixed internally with Kosa particles were frequently floating from the ground to about 2-km heights (above sea level), and possible long-range transport of atmospheric microbiota with dust particles taking local circulations is strongly suggested, causing active mixing of atmospheric dust over the Taklamakan desert from the ground to the free troposphere where westerly jet dominates (Iwasaka et al. in J Geophys Res 108:8652, 2003a, J Geophys Res 108:8644, b). The concentration of the mixed particles of Kosa and microbiota having a size larger than about 1 μm in diameter is estimated to be about 1 particle/cm3 at those heights on the basis of measurements of particle concentration with an optical particle counter and analysis of particles having fluorescence light due to dye of DAPI (4′6-diamidino-2 phenylindole) with an epifluorescence microscope. The mixing situation of microbiota and Kosa particles is the important factor controlling atmospheric lifetime of floating microbiota, since the mixing state certainly can protect microbiota from stressful environments [dryness, solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, low temperature] in the atmosphere, and therefore, it is useful to discuss the data of the first description of microbiota in the atmosphere on the Taklamakan desert.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to assess the long-term trend of fine particles (PM2.5; ≤2.5 μm) at two urban sites of Lahore during 2007-2011. These sites represent two distinct areas: commercial (Townhall) and residential cum industrial (Township). The highest daily mean concentrations of PM2.5 were noted as 389 and 354 μg m-3 at the Townhall and Township sites, respectively. As expected, the annual seasonal mean of PM2.5 was about 53 and 101% higher during winter compared with the summer and monsoon/post-monsoon seasons, respectively. On contrary to many observations seen in developing cities, the annual mean PM2.5 during the weekends was higher than weekdays at both monitoring sites. For example, these were 100 (142) and 142 μg m-3 (148) during the weekdays (weekends) at the Townhall and Township sites, respectively. The regression analysis showed a significant positive correlation of PM2.5 with SO2, NO2 and CO as opposed to a negative correlation with O3. The bivariate polar plots suggested a much higher influence of localized sources (e.g., road vehicles) at the Townhall site as opposed to industrial sources affecting the concentrations at the Township site. The imageries from the MODIS Aqua/Terra indicated long-range transport of PM2.5 from India to Pakistan during February to October whereas from Pakistan to India during November to January. This study provides important results in the form of multiscale relationship of PM2.5 with its sources and precursors, which are important to assess the effectiveness of pollution control mitigation strategies in Lahore and similar cities elsewhere.

    "abstract": "Air quality, like weather, can affect everyone, but responses differ depending on the sensitivity and health condition of a given individual. To help protect exposed populations, many countries have put in place real-time air quality nowcasting and forecasting capabilities. We present in this paper an optimal combination of air quality measurements and model outputs and show that it leads to significant improvements in the spatial representativeness of air quality. The product is referred to as multi-pollutant surface objective analyses (MPSOAs). Moreover, based on MPSOA, a geographical mapping of the Canadian Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) is also presented which provides users (policy makers, public, air quality forecasters, and epidemiologists) with a more accurate picture of the health risk anytime and anywhere in Canada and the USA. Since pollutants can also behave as passive atmospheric tracers, they provide information about transport and dispersion and, hence, reveal synoptic and regional meteorological phenomena. MPSOA could also be used to build air pollution climatology, compute local and national trends in air quality, and detect systematic biases in numerical air quality (AQ) models. Finally, initializing AQ models at regular time intervals with MPSOA can produce more accurate air quality forecasts. It is for these reasons that the Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) in collaboration with the Air Quality Research Division (AQRD) of Environment Canada has recently implemented MPSOA in their daily operations.",

    "abstract": "Asian dust events transport the airborne bacteria in Chinese desert regions as well as mineral particles and influence downwind area varying biological ecosystems and climate changes. However, the airborne bacterial dynamics were rarely investigated in the Gobi desert area, where dust events are highly frequent. In this study, air samplings were sequentially performed at a 2-m high above the ground at the sampling site located in desert area (Tsogt-Ovoo of Gobi desert; Mongolia 44.2304°N, 105.1700°E). During the dust event days, the bacterial cells and mineral particles increased to more than tenfold of concentrations. MiSeq sequencing targeting 16S ribosomal DNA revealed that the airborne bacteria in desert area mainly belonged to the classes Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Bacilli, Alpha-proteobacteria, Beta-proteobacteria, and Gamma-proteobacteria. The bacterial community structures were different between dust events and non-dust events. The air samples collected at the dust events indicated high abundance rates of Alpha-proteobacteria, which were reported to dominate on the leaf surfaces of plants or in the saline lake environments. After the dust events, the members of Firmicutes (Bacilli) and Bacteroidetes, which are known to form endospore and attach with coarse particles, respectively, increased their relative abundances in the air samples. Presumably, the bacterial compositions and diversities in atmosphere significantly vary during dust events, which carry some particles from grassland (phyllo-sphere), dry lake, and sand surfaces, as well as some bacterial populations such as Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes maintain in the atmosphere for longer time.",

The findings are as follows: (1) Industrial agglomeration can effectively reduce the degree of haze pollution. (2) Haze pollution has an inverted U-shaped relationship with economic development and population agglomeration. (3) The secondary industry has a positive correlation with haze pollution, while the tertiary industry can reduce haze pollution but not in an obvious manner. (4) The level of innovation and urbanization can help to reduce haze pollution, and the level of economic opening up and carbon dioxide emissions can exacerbate haze pollution. (5) Due to the insufficient commercialization of scientific and technological achievements, investment in science and technology is not obviously effective in preventing and controlling haze pollution. The relationship between environmental regulation and haze pollution is still unclear due to regional differences and the varied effectiveness of law enforcement. The study suggests that the government should guide industrial agglomeration in a reasonable manner, improve joint prevention and control across regions, and strengthen environmental regulation to prevent and control haze pollution.",

The correlations of COVID-19 variables-proportion of cases and deaths in each population, as well as case fatality rate with independent variables were determined by Pearson and Spearman correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. The results revealed that AQI-NO2, population density, longitude, gross domestic product per capita, median age, total death of disease, and pneumonia per population were significantly associated with the COVID-19 variables (P < 0.05).

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 global pandemic has necessitated some drastic measures to curb its spread. Several countries around the world instituted partial or total lockdown as part of the control measures for the pandemic. This presented a unique opportunity to study air pollution under reduced human activities. In this study, we investigated the impact of the lockdown on air pollution in three highly populated and industrious cities in Nigeria. Compared with historical mean values, NO2 levels increased marginally by 0.3% and 12% in Lagos and Kaduna respectively. However, the city of Port Harcourt saw a decrease of 1.1% and 215.5% in NO2 and SO2 levels respectively. Elevated levels of O3 were observed during the period of lockdown. Our result suggests that there are other sources of air pollution apart from transportation and industrial sources. Our findings showed that the COVID-19-induced lockdown was responsible for a decrease in NO2 levels in two of the locations studied. These results presents an opportunity for country wide policies to mitigate the impact of air pollution on the health of citizens.",

    "abstract": "The WHO announced coronavirus disease a Public Health Emergency on 30 January 2020, and it spreads across the whole planet. Aftermath of outbreak of this disease at the global level is more frightening and panicking than anyone's worst nightmare. With more than 23 mln positive coronavirus cases and more than 800,000 causalities all over the world, the potential of this virus cannot be undermined. This pandemic has victimized all human beings residing on 209 countries and territories of the world. It emerged as an unbeatable global challenge that the world has never witnessed before. Consequently, the affected countries have sealed their borders and made populations reside in their homes until the pandemic is over. Thus, the victims of coronavirus are not only the ones who are exposed to it but also the ones who are affected by the lockdown imposed by the governments. The paper aims to evaluate the effect of COVID-19 on air pollution of various countries. Papers indicating the relationship between air pollution levels and lockdown measures are analyzed. The dramatic U-turn from environmental degradation is definitely a silver lining in these black clouds. This paper reviews the repercussions of the pandemic in some nations, while war-like preparations continue to fight it. COVID-19 has dramatically improved the quality of air. Also, it has greatly affected the economy of various countries due to lockdown.",

    "abstract": "Mexico City is the second most populated city in Latin America, and it went through two partial lockdowns between April 1 and May 31, 2020, for reducing the COVID-19 propagation. The present study assessed air quality and its association with human mortality rates during the lockdown by estimating changes observed in air pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, SO2, PM10 and PM2.5) between the lockdown (April 1-May 31) and prelockdown (January 1-March 31) periods, as well as by comparing the air quality data of lockdown period with the same interval of previous 5 years (2015-2019). Concentrations of NO2 (- 29%), SO2 (- 55%) and PM10 (- 11%) declined and the contents of CO (+ 1.1%), PM2.5 (+ 19%) and O3 (+ 63%) increased during the lockdown compared to the prelockdown period. This study also estimated that NO2, SO2, CO, PM10 and PM2.5 reduced by 19-36%, and O3 enhanced by 14% compared to the average of 2015-2019. Reduction in traffic as well as less emission from vehicle exhausts led to remarkable decline in NO2, SO2 and PM10. The significant positive associations of PM2.5, CO and O3 with the numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths, however, underscored the necessity to enforce air pollution regulations to protect human health in one of the important cities of the northern hemisphere.

In contrast to the existing studies, this research examines the effects of economic and social isolation as dimensions of globalization. The present paper allows underpinning the impact on the Chinese economic development of the isolation phenomenon as a consequence of coronavirus (COVID-19). To this end, annual time–frequency data is used to achieve the hypothesized claims. The study resolutions include (1) the existence of a long-run association between the outlined variables; (2) the long-run estimates suggest that the Chinese economy, over the investigated period, is inelastic to pollutant-driven economic growth; and (3) the Chinese isolation is less responsive to its economic growth while the country political willpower is elastic as demonstrated by a government commitment to dampen the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. This confinement is marked by the aggressive response by the government officials resolute by flattening the exponential impact of the pandemic. Based on these robust results, some far-reaching policy implications are underlined in the concluding remarks section.",

    "abstract": "Under the rapid spread of coronavirus diseases (COVID-19) worldwide, a complete lockdown was imposed in France from March 17th to May 11th, 2020 to limit the virus spread. This lockdown affected significantly the atmospheric pollution levels due to the restrictions of human activities. In the present study, we investigate the evolution of air quality in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, focusing on nine atmospheric pollutants (NO2, NO, PM10, PM2.5, O3, VOC, CO, SO2, and isoprene). In Lyon, center of the region, the results indicated that NO2, NO, and CO levels were reduced by 67%, 78%, and 62%, respectively, resulting in a decrease in road traffic by 80%. However, O3, PM10, and PM2.5 were increased by 105%, 23%, and 53%, respectively, during the lockdown. The increase in ozone is explained by the dropping in NO and other gases linked to human activity, which consume ozone. Thus, the increase of solar radiation, sunshine, temperature, and humidity promoted the O3 formation during the lockdown. Besides, rising temperature enhances the BVOC emissions such as isoprene. In addition, volatile organic component (VOC) and SO2 remain almost stable and oxidation of these species leads to the formation of ozone and organic aerosol, which also explains the increase in PM during the lockdown. This study shows the contribution of atmospheric photochemistry to air pollution.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11869-020-00965-w.",

Although PM10 levels were similar during both periods, OP values (expressed in nmol min-1 m-3) showed a defined seasonal trend. The AA activity was higher in summer than in winter, whereas the DTT reactivity exhibited an opposite seasonal pattern. Both assays were sensitive to different PM10 components, as shown by the results of the linear correlation analysis. Moreover, the relationship between OP values and PM10 chemical species was not the same during summer and winter, indicating that particle toxicity is associated with different sources during the warm and cold seasons. When OP values were expressed on a mass basis (nmol min-1 µg-1), lower correlation coefficients with PM10 chemical species were generally obtained compared to volume-normalized activities. These outcomes suggest that only some specific components have a significant intrinsic oxidative potential.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11869-023-01332-1.",

This study examined the patterns and trends of SO2, NO2, CO, O3, and particulate matter (PM) air pollutants over 91 monitoring stations in Egypt during 93 months in the August (2013)-April (2021) period. In situ data with their monthly, seasonal, and yearly spatial trends are defined and used to validate the counterpart satellite reanalysis MERRA-2 data. The Mann-Kendall test characterized the seasonal monotonic trends and their Sen's slope, and annual change rate for both data series. Regression analysis of MERRA-2 against in situ concentrations of SO2 and PM10 revealed underestimation with RMSE values of 13.38 g m-3 and 69.46 g m-3, respectively. Local plumes with variable magnitudes characterized distinct industrial places clarified by patterns of in situ pollutants. As a result of the COVID-19 lockdown, the in situ air pollutants showed a considerable regional decline in the yearly average in 2020 compared to the years before. The in situ air pollutants showed annual trends far more significant than those seen in the MERRA-2 data. The shortcomings of the few and spatiotemporal discontinuities of the in situ contaminants are addressed by MERRA-2 air quality products. The in situ data made trends and magnitudes clear that were hidden in their MERRA-2 counterparts. The results clarified air pollution patterns, trends, and spatial variability over Egypt that are essential for climate risk management and for reducing environmental/health concerns.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11869-023-01357-6.",

Although the potential of green infrastructures, such as green walls and green roofs, to mitigate air pollution has been documented, evidence at a local scale is still limited. This work aims to increase knowledge about the potentialities of green infrastructures in improving local air quality, focusing on particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide and ozone pollutants, and by using a local-scale computational fluid dynamics model. The ENVI-met model was applied to a particular hour of a summer day over a built-up environment centred on a main avenue in the city of Lisbon (Portugal). The dimensions of the computational domain are 618 m × 594 m × 143 m, and it contains 184 buildings, with the tallest building being 56 m. In addition to the baseline simulation, modelling was also done considering the application of green walls and green roofs to specific buildings located near the main avenue, together with a green corridor. The overall results show no disturbances exerted by green walls on the turbulent flow dynamics and on the air quality levels when compared to the baseline scenario (without green walls). The integrated scenario, which includes green walls, green roofs and a green corridor, will lead to potential local benefits of green infrastructures on O 3 concentrations, followed by variable impacts on NO 2 and particulate matter concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Micro and nanoplastics (MNPs) may enter the human body through food, drink, and air. Scientists have mainly focused on the first two routes, but little is known about the third. A cascade impactor having a size range of (&gt; 2.5, 1.0–2.5, 0.50–1.0, 0.25–0.50, and &lt; 0.25 μm) was used to study the size segregation of MNPs in different indoor commercial markets. The morphological characterization showed the presence of fibers, fragments, films, lines, foam, and pellets with different colors. Three hundred-seven particles were scanned for chemical description under Micro-Raman analysis, and 247 were identified and categorized into 52 MNPs . The standard MNPs found in the samples were PTFE, PE, PP, HDPE, PA, LDPE, and PAM. The SEM-EDX analysis showed that C, O, and F had the highest weight% among all elements seen, while C, O, F, Mg, and Al were the common elements. These MNPs are small enough to get inhaled easily. MNPs in these indoor environments showed vast sources that emit these polymeric particles and have harmful human health impacts, particularly on the employees working there. So, there is a need to take the necessary measures to minimize the release of these MNPs in these indoor environments and their impacts on human health.",

    "abstract": "The main goal of this study was to improve the knowledge of ultrafine particle number distributions in large urban areas and also to call the attention to the importance of these particles on assessing health risks. Measurements of aerosol size distributions were performed during 2 weeks, with distinct pollutant concentrations (polluted and clean periods), on the rooftop of a building located in downtown of the megacity of São Paulo, Brazil. CO, NO(2), PM(10), SO(2), and O(3) concentrations and meteorological variables were also used. Aerosol size distribution measurements showed that geometric mean diameters of the size spectra in the polluted period are on average considerably larger than those in the clean one. Besides the fact that total number of ultrafine particles did not show significant differences, during the polluted period, geometric mean diameter was larger than during the clean one. The results of a mathematical model of particle deposition on human respiratory tract indicated a more significant effect of smaller particles fraction of the spectra, which predominate under clean atmospheric conditions. The results also indicated that urban environmental conditions usually considered good for air quality, under the criteria of low mass concentration, do not properly serve as air quality standard to very small particles. In the size range of ultrafine particles, this traditional clean atmospheric condition can offer a strong risk to pulmonary hazards, since the cleansing of the atmosphere creates good conditions to increase the concentration of nucleation mode particles.",

    "abstract": "Fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) is majorly formed by precursor gases, such as sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) and nitrogen oxides (NO(x)), which are emitted largely from intense industrial operations and transportation activities. PM(2.5) has been shown to affect respiratory health in humans. Evaluation of source regions and assessment of emission source contributions in the Gulf Coast region of the USA will be useful for the development of PM(2.5) regulatory and mitigation strategies. In the present study, the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model driven by the Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model is used to identify the emission source locations and transportation trends. Meteorological observations as well as PM(2.5) sulfate and nitric acid concentrations were collected at two sites during the Mississippi Coastal Atmospheric Dispersion Study, a summer 2009 field experiment along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Meteorological fields during the campaign were simulated using WRF with three nested domains of 36, 12, and 4 km horizontal resolutions and 43 vertical levels and validated with North American Mesoscale Analysis. The HYSPLIT model was integrated with meteorological fields derived from the WRF model to identify the source locations using backward trajectory analysis. The backward trajectories for a 24-h period were plotted at 1-h intervals starting from two observation locations to identify probable sources. The back trajectories distinctly indicated the sources to be in the direction between south and west, thus to have origin from local Mississippi, neighboring Louisiana state, and Gulf of Mexico. Out of the eight power plants located within the radius of 300 km of the two monitoring sites examined as sources, only Watson, Cajun, and Morrow power plants fall in the path of the derived back trajectories. Forward dispersions patterns computed using HYSPLIT were plotted from each of these source locations using the hourly mean emission concentrations as computed from past annual emission strength data to assess extent of their contribution. An assessment of the relative contributions from the eight sources reveal that only Cajun and Morrow power plants contribute to the observations at the Wiggins Airport to a certain extent while none of the eight power plants contribute to the observations at Harrison Central High School. As these observations represent a moderate event with daily average values of 5-8 μg m(-3) for sulfate and 1-3 μg m(-3) for HNO(3) with differences between the two spatially varied sites, the local sources may also be significant contributors for the observed values of PM(2.5).",

    "abstract": "Emissions and exposures from fragranced consumer products, such as air fresheners and cleaning supplies, have been associated with health problems and societal impacts. This study investigates effects of fragranced consumer products on the general population in four countries: United States, Australia, United Kingdom, and Sweden. Nationally representative population surveys (n = 1137; 1098; 1100; 1100) found that, across the four countries, 32.2% of adults (34.7%, 33.0%, 27.8%, 33.1% respectively) report fragrance sensitivity; that is, adverse health effects from fragranced consumer products. For instance, 17.4% report health problems from air fresheners or deodorizers, and 15.7% from being in a room cleaned with scented products. Commonly reported health problems include respiratory difficulties (16.7%), mucosal symptoms (13.2%), migraine headaches (12.6%), skin rashes (9.1%), and asthma attacks (7.0%). For 9.5% of the population, the severity of health effects can be considered disabling. Further, 9.0% of the population have lost workdays or lost a job, in the past year, due to illness from fragranced product exposure in the workplace. Personal estimated costs due to these lost workdays and lost jobs, across the four countries in one year, exceed $146 billion (USD). A majority of people across the countries would prefer that workplaces, health care facilities and professionals, hotels, and airplanes were fragrance-free rather than fragranced. The study highlights a concern for public health and societal well-being, as well as an approach to reduce risks and costs: reduce exposure to fragranced products.",

    "abstract": "The sanitary measures implemented to control and prevent an increase in infections due to the COVID-19 pandemic have produced an improvement in the air quality of many urban areas around the world. We assessed air quality during the COVID-19 pandemic for particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), NO2 and O3 in in metropolitan area of Lima, Peru between pre-lockdown period (February 1 and March 15 of 2020), historical period (March 16 to April 30 2017-2019) and lockdown period (March 16 to April 30, 2020). The complete national lockdown that was implemented in Peru produced statistically significant reductions in the in-air pollutant (PM10 (-40% and -58%), PM2.5 (-31% and -43%) and NO2 (-46% and -48%)), as recorded by the by the ground-based air quality monitoring network throughout the metropolitan area, compared with the corresponding concentrations for the previous weeks and over the same period for 2017-2019. Analysis of the spatial Distribution of satellite data also show decreases in the concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 as a result of the containment measures and suspension of activities implemented by the Peruvian government. The concentrations of O3 significantly increased (11% and 170%) as a result of the decrease in the concentration of NO2, confirming that the study area is a hydrocarbon-limited system, as previously reported. The results obtained contribute to the assessment by the regulatory agencies of the possible strategies of control and monitoring of air pollution in the study area.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11869-021-00990-3.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The preventive and cautionary measures taken by the UAE and Abu Dhabi governments to reduce the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and promote social distancing have led to a reduction of mobility and a modification of economic and social activities. This paper provides statistical analysis of the air quality data monitored by the Environment Agency – Abu Dhabi (EAD) during the first 10 months of 2020, comparing the different stages of the preventive measures. Ground monitoring data is compared with satellite images and mobility indicators. The study shows a drastic decrease during lockdown in the concentration of the gaseous pollutants analysed (NO 2 , SO 2 , CO, and C 6 H 6 ) that aligns with the results reported in other international cities and metropolitan areas. However, particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ) averaged concentrations followed a markedly different trend from the gaseous pollutants, indicating a larger influence from natural events (sand and dust storms) and other anthropogenic sources. The ozone (O 3 ) levels increased during the lockdown, showing the complexity of O 3 formation. The end of lockdown led to an increase of the mobility and the air pollution; however, air pollutant concentrations remained in lower levels than during the same period of 2019. The results in this study show the large impact of human activities on the quality of air and present an opportunity for policymakers and decision-makers to design stimulus packages to overcome the economic slow-down, with strategies to accelerate the transition to resilient, low-emission economies and societies more connected to the nature that protect human health and the environment.",

    "abstract": "We have investigated the impact of reduced emissions due to COVID-19 lockdown measures in spring 2020 on air quality in Canada's four largest cities: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, and Calgary. Observed daily concentrations of NO2, PM2.5, and O3 during a \"pre-lockdown\" period (15 February-14 March 2020) and a \"lockdown\" period (22 March-2 May 2020), when lockdown measures were in full force everywhere in Canada, were compared to the same periods in the previous decade (2010-2019). Higher-than-usual seasonal declines in mean daily NO2 were observed for the pre-lockdown to lockdown periods in 2020. For PM2.5, Montreal was the only city with a higher-than-usual seasonal decline, whereas for O3 all four cities remained within the previous decadal range. In order to isolate the impact of lockdown-related emission changes from other factors such as seasonal changes in meteorology and emissions and meteorological variability, two emission scenarios were performed with the GEM-MACH air quality model. The first was a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario with baseline emissions and the second was a more realistic simulation with estimated COVID-19 lockdown emissions. NO2 surface concentrations for the COVID-19 emission scenario decreased by 31 to 34% on average relative to the BAU scenario in the four metropolitan areas. Lower decreases ranging from 6 to 17% were predicted for PM2.5. O3 surface concentrations, on the other hand, showed increases up to a maximum of 21% close to city centers versus slight decreases over the suburbs, but Ox (odd oxygen), like NO2 and PM2.5, decreased as expected over these cities.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11869-021-01039-1.",

Day-care centres (DCCs) are important indoor microenvironments for children apart from their homes. Therefore, monitoring IAQ in this microenvironment is vital because of the vulnerability of the occupants. This review gives a global overview of the predominant indoor chemical pollutant levels monitored in DCCs, compares their concentration with available regulations for IAQ, evaluates the sources and health risk effects of chemical pollutants and proposes strategies for enhancing IAQ in DCCs. Thirty-seven (37) articles were used based on specific stated inclusion and exclusion criteria. Continents like Europe and Asia have the most published studies in indoor DCCs. The decreasing trend of pollutants examined in most studies include particulate matter > carbon dioxide > formaldehyde > carbon monoxide > total volatile organic compounds > volatile organic compounds > nitrogen dioxide > ozone > benzene > sulphur dioxide = radon. Particulate matter in the size and mass concentration range of PM10 (0.116–1920.71 μg/m3) > PM2.5 (0.279.2–260.74 μg/m3) was the most investigated pollutant. While nitrogen dioxide, radon and carbon monoxide were consistent with the existing national and international reference values for IAQ across the continents, exceedances occurred in other pollutants. The limited number of indoor chemical pollutant studies suggests the need for more comprehensive studies on IAQ in DCC globally. Further studies should highlight the availability of low-cost sensors and mobile analytical equipment that will promote affordable ground-level data accessibility.",

In this study, the dustborne microorganisms in the atmosphere over the Taklimakan Desert, Asian dust source, were identified by culture-independent method. Dusts were collected using a balloon at about 800 m above the ground in an Asian dust source region, Dunhuang. After DNA were directly extracted from the dusts collected filters, 16S and 18S rRNA genes of microorganisms were amplified, cloned, and sequenced. The rDNA sequence data indicated that dust particles include fungi closely related to Rickenella fibula, Ceriporiopsis gilvescens, and bacteria belonging to the genus Brevibacillus, Staphylococcus, Rhodococcus, Delftia, Pseudomonas, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. These results suggest that dust particles in the atmosphere over Dunhuang could carry these many fungi and bacteria and might play a significant role in leeward ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "This paper forms the second part of an introduction to a synoptic weather typing approach to assess differential and combined impacts of extreme temperatures and air pollution on human mortality, focusing on future estimates. A statistical downscaling approach was used to downscale daily five general circulation model (GCM) outputs (three Canadian and two US GCMs) and to derive six-hourly future climate information for the selected cities (Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, and Windsor) in south–central Canada. Discriminant function analysis was then used to project the future weather types, based on historical analysis defined in a companion paper (Part I). Future air pollution concentrations were estimated using the within-weather-type historical simulation models applied to the downscaled future GCM climate data. Two independent approaches, based on (1) comparing future and historical frequencies of the weather groups and (2) applying within-weather-group elevated mortality prediction models, were used to assess climate change impacts on elevated mortality for two time windows (2040–2059 and 2070–2089). Averaging the five GCM scenarios, across the study area, heat-related mortality is projected to be more than double by the 2050s and triple by the 2080s from the current condition. Cold-related mortality could decrease by about 45–60% and 60–70% by the 2050s and the 2080s, respectively. Air pollution-related mortality could increase about 20–30% by the 2050s and 30–45% by the 2080s, due to increased air pollution levels projected with climate change. The increase in air pollution-related mortality would be largely driven by increases in ozone effects. The population acclimatization to increased heat was also assessed in this paper, which could reduce future heat-related mortality by 40%. It is most likely that the estimate of future extreme temperature- and air pollution-related mortality from this study could represent a bottom-line figure since many of the factors (e.g., population growth, age structure changes, and adaptation measures) were not directly taken into account in the analyses.",

    "abstract": "The present air quality has been studied at two air quality monitoring stations in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. One site at the Farm Gate area is a particulate matter (PM) hot spot (HSD) with very high pollutant concentrations because of its proximity to major roadways. The other site is in a semi-residential area (SR) located at the Atomic Energy Centre, Dhaka Campus with relatively less traffic. The samples were collected using a 'Gent' stacked filter unit in two fractions of 0–2.2 and 10–2.2 μm sizes. Samples of fine (PM2.2) and coarse (PM10–2.2) airborne particulate matter collected between 2000 and 2005 were studied. It has been observed that fine particulate matter concentrations at the HSD have decreased from over this period to less than half of the initial value even with an increasing number of vehicles. This decrease is likely the result of governmental policy interventions such as the requirement of vehicle maintenance, training of repair workers, and phase-wise removal of two-stroke three wheelers from the roads in Dhaka with a complete ban of their commercial use beginning on January 1, 2003. Other policy interventions were banning of old buses and trucks from operating in Dhaka, promotion of the compressed natural gas, introduction of pollution control devices on vehicles, control of emissions from industries, etc. It was found that both local (mostly from vehicular emissions and seasonal brick kilns) are responsible for the high PM2.2 and black carbon concentrations in Dhaka. PM2.2, PM10–2.2, and black carbon concentration levels depend on the season, wind direction, and wind speed. PM10–2.2 has not been the focus of policy decisions, and the decrease in concentrations has been much smaller than were observed for the PM2.2. There is also some indication of the role of transport of PM2.2 from regional sources.",

    "abstract": "Air quality in ambient outdoor air has seldom been evaluated in Iran. Accordingly, we evaluated airborne asbestos fiber concentrations in the urban environment of Tehran, Iran between January 2006 and March 2007. The airborne fiber concentrations of 80 air samples collected from 40 different sites in five areas of Tehran were analyzed by energy-dispersive X-ray analysis in combination with phase-contrast optical microscopy (PCM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The geometric means of the airborne asbestos fiber concentrations were 3.4 × 10−3 PCM f/ml (0.1 SEM f/ml) and 3.3 × 10−3 PCM f/ml (0.20 SEM f/ml) according to areas and seasons, respectively. There were significant differences in the asbestos fiber concentrations between the areas and seasons (p = 0.02; p = 0.04), respectively. In the areas, the average concentration was 3.4 × 10 −3 PCM f/ml (0.1 SEM f/ml), which is considerably higher than those reported for the levels of asbestos in outdoor air in the USA and the urban environment of the Europe. The SEM analyses revealed that the fibrous particles consisted, approximately, of chrysotile (60%), tremolite (10%), anthophyllite (10%), and non-asbestos fibers (20%). We conclude that the high volume of traffic, industrial consumption of asbestos, and geographical and climate conditions are responsible for the high airborne asbestos levels in non-occupational environments in Tehran. Thus, it is to be expected that inhabitants of Tehran will suffer negative health effects due to exposure to asbestos airborne fibers.",

    "abstract": "During July 2002, forest fires in Quebec, Canada, blanketed the US East Coast with a plume of wood smoke. This “natural experiment” exposed large populations in northeastern US cities to significantly elevated concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), providing a unique opportunity to test the association between daily mortality and ambient PM2.5 levels that are uncorrelated with societal activity rhythms. We obtained PM2.5 measurement data and mortality data for a 4-week period in July 2002 for the Greater Boston metropolitan area (which has a population of over 1.7 million people) and New York City (which has a population of over 8 million people). Daily average PM2.5 concentrations were markedly increased for 3 days over this period, reaching as high as 63 μg/m3 for Greater Boston and 86 μg/m3 for New York City from background ambient levels of 4–48 μg/m3 in the non-smoke days. We examined temporal patterns of natural-cause deaths and 24-h ambient PM2.5 concentrations in July 2002 and did not observe any discernible increase in daily mortality subsequent to the dramatic elevation in ambient PM2.5 levels. Comparison to mortality rates over the same time periods in 2001 and 2003 showed no evidence of impact. Results from Poisson regression analyses suggest that 24-h ambient PM2.5 concentrations were not associated with daily mortality. In conclusion, substantial short-term elevation in PM2.5 concentrations from forest fire smoke were not followed by increased daily mortality in Greater Boston or New York City.",

    "abstract": "Daily exposures to ambient oxides of nitrogen were estimated here for residents of Hillsborough County, FL. The 2009 National Household Travel Survey provided geocoded data on fixed activity locations during each person-day sampled. Routes between activity locations were calculated from transportation network data, assuming the quickest travel path. To estimate daily exposure concentrations for each person-day, the exposure locations were matched with diurnally and spatially varying ambient pollutant concentrations derived from CALPUFF dispersion model results. The social distribution of exposures was analyzed by comparing frequency distributions of grouped daily exposure concentrations and by regression modeling. To investigate exposure error, the activity-based exposure estimates were also compared with estimates derived using residence location alone. The mean daily activity-based exposure concentration for the study sample was 17 μg/m3, with values for individual person-day records ranging from 7.0 to 43 μg/m3. The highest mean exposure concentrations were found for the following groups: black (20 μg/m3), below poverty (18 μg/m3), and urban residence location (22 μg/m3). Urban versus rural residence was associated with the largest increase in exposure concentration in the regression (8.3 μg/m3). Time in nonresidential activities, including travel, was associated with an increase of 0.2 μg/m3 per hour. Time spent travelling and at nonresidential locations contributed an average of 6 and 24 %, respectively, to the daily estimate. A mean error of 3.6 %, with range from -64 to 58 %, was found to result from using residence location alone. Exposure error was highest for those who travel most, but lowest for the sociodemographic subgroups with higher mean exposure concentrations (including blacks and those from below poverty households). This work indicates the importance of urbanicity to social disparities in activity-based air pollution exposures. It also suggests that exposure error due to using residence location may be smaller for more exposed groups.",

    "abstract": "An automobile air-conditioning (AC) system can be a source of microbiological contamination in a driver's car. The aim of this study was to assess the level of microbial contamination before and after servicing of the automobile AC system, based on qualitative and quantitative analyses of bacteria and fungi isolated from the air, and to check the efficiency of different AC system cleaning methods in the removal of microbial contaminants. The study was carried out in 35 randomly selected cars, equipped with AC systems. In each car tested, viable bioaerosol samples were taken using a single-stage MAS impactor before and after servicing the AC systems. Four methods were used to disinfect the air-conditioning installations in the vehicles examined: ozonisation, application of chemical disinfectant using ultrasounds, manual application of chemical disinfectant foam and simultaneous ozonisation and application of chemical disinfectant foam. The bacterial and fungal concentrations in air samples before AC servicing in cars were between 7.5 × 101 cfu/m3 and 2.0 × 103 cfu/m3 and 4.0 × 101 cfu/m3 and 5.0 × 102 cfu/m3, respectively. Regardless of the disinfection method, after the AC service, a decrease in microbial concentrations was observed. The highest disinfection efficiency was observed for two methods: ozonisation combined with manual application of the chemical disinfectant into the air-conditioning system and spraying of the chemical disinfectant using ultrasounds. On the basis of the results obtained, it can be concluded that air-conditioning systems in cars should be regularly disinfected to eliminate microbiological contaminants, which may be the cause of adverse health effects on humans.",

    "abstract": "Fragranced consumer products have been associated with adverse effects on human health. Babies are exposed to a variety of fragranced consumer products, which can emit numerous volatile organic compounds (VOCs), some considered potentially hazardous. However, fragranced baby products are exempt from disclosure of all ingredients. Consequently, parents and the public have little information on product emissions. This study investigates VOCs emitted from a range of fragranced baby products, including baby hair shampoos, body washes, lotions, creams, ointments, oils, hair sprays, and fragrance. The products were analysed using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) headspace analysis. Of the 42 baby products tested, 21 products made claims of green, organic, or all-natural. Results of the analysis found 684 VOCs emitted collectively from the 42 products, representing 228 different VOCs. Of these 684 VOCs, 207 are classified as potentially hazardous under federal regulations, representing 43 different VOCs. The most common VOCs emitted were limonene, acetaldehyde, ethanol, alpha-pinene, linalool, beta-myrcene, acetone, and beta-pinene. A comparison between ingredients emitted and ingredients listed reveals that only 5% of the 684 VOCs, including 12% of 207 potentially hazardous VOCs, were listed on the product label, safety data sheet, or website. More than 95% of both green and regular products emitted one or more potentially hazardous VOCs. Further, emissions of the most prevalent VOCs from green, organic, or all-natural products were not significantly different from regular products. Results from this study can help improve public awareness about emissions from baby products, with the aim to reduce pollutant exposure and potential adverse effects on babies.",

The strengths and weaknesses of the methodology are presented and discussed based on an example. The approach results in a \"diamond\" diagram useful to flag out anomalous behaviors in the emission inventories and to get insight in possible explanations. In particular, the \"diamond\" diagram is shown to provide meaningful information in terms of: discrepancies between the total emissions reported by macro-sector and pollutant, contribution of each macro-sector to the total amount of emissions released by pollutant, and the identification and quantification of the different factors causing the discrepancies between total emissions. A practical example in Barcelona is used for testing and to provide relevant information for the analyzed emission datasets. The tests show the capability of the proposed methodology to flag inconsistencies in the existing inventories. The proposed methodology system may be useful for regional and urban inventory developers as an initial evaluation of the consistency of their inventories.",

More than 4 million people globally are infected by the virus and about 300,000 dead cases until this moment. The ventilation and airborne filters are also investigated aiming to develop an efficient antiviral filtration technology. Human secretion of the infected person as nasal or saliva droplets goes as airborne and distributes the virus everywhere around the person. N95 and N98 filters are the must use filters for capturing particles of sizes around 300 nm. The average size of the novel corona virus (COVID-19) is 100 nm and there is no standard or special filter suitable for this virus. The nanoparticle-coated airborne filter is a suitable technique in this regard. While the efficiency of this type of filters still needs to be enhanced, new developed nanofiber filters are proposed. Most recently, the charged nanofiber filters of sizes below 100 nm are developed and provide an efficient viral filtration and inactivation. The efficiency of filter must be kept at accepted level without increasing the pressure drop. The present review outlines the most efficient antiviral nanoparticles including the recent functional nanoparticles. The filtration theory, filtration modeling, filter testing, and different types of filter with special concentration on the charged nanofiber filter were discussed. The charged nanofiber filter able to capture novel corona virus (COVID-19) with 94% efficiency and a pressure drop less than 20 MPa.",

Here, we investigate whether potted plants can contribute as a simple and cost-effective indoor air pollution mitigation technique. Our study investigates the ability of the combination of the three plant species Spathiphyllum wallisii ‘Verdi’, Dracaena fragrans ‘Golden Coast’ and Zamioculcas zamiifolia with two different growing media to remove in situ concentrations (100 ppb) of NO 2 in real-time at two typical indoor light levels (0 and 500 lx) and in ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ growing media conditions. All studied ‘growing medium–plant systems’ were able to reduce NO 2 concentrations representative of a polluted urban environment, but to varying degrees. The greatest NO 2 removal measured inside a 150 L chamber over 1-h period in ‘wet’ growing media at ~ 500 lx was achieved by D. fragrans . When accounting for dilution, this would correspond to a removal of up to 3 ppb NO 2 per m 2 of leaf area over the 1-h test period and 0.62 ppb per potted plant over the same period when modelled for a small office (15 m 3 ) in a highly polluted environment. Depending on building ventilation rates and NO 2 concentration gradients at the indoor-outdoor interface that will vary massively between polluted urban and rural locations, potted plants offer clear potential to improve indoor air quality—in particular in confined indoor spaces that are poorly ventilated and/or located in highly polluted areas.",

The mosses in bags were exposed for 2 months during the winter season (2019/2020) at five sites in each of the selected urban areas next to air quality (AQ) monitoring stations. The sites were selected concerning different land use classes (typical urban, residential, urban background, and rural sites). The concentrations of 35 elements were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. A comparison with elemental analysis performed by total reflection X-ray fluorescence is also presented. Concentrations of the potentially toxic element in moss bags exposed in urban areas were significantly higher, while those exposed in rural areas did not differ significantly from the initial content of unexposed moss. Linear regression analysis revealed no significant differences between the average concentrations of elements in H. cupressiforme and S. girgensohnii moss bags (linearity R 2 = 0.94). It shows similar trends in elements in both moss species. The median values of contamination factors in both moss species ranged mostly from 1.2 to 2.17, indicating the exposure sites show no contamination to slight contamination status (C1 to C2 scales). High values of relative accumulation factors were found for Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Sb, and V in moss bags, indicating these elements are the most abundant in most sampling sites, which may increase human exposure through inhalation and could lead to harmful health problems.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Heterogeneity between ambient and personal exposure to heavy metals has been documented. However, few studies have investigated potential health risks posed by inhalational exposure to airborne heavy metal(loid)s at the individual level. A total of 404 personal fine particles (PM 2.5 ) samples were collected from 61 adult residents (aged 18–63 years) in Hong Kong during 2014–2015. Heavy metal(loid)s were analyzed using energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence. Among the analyzed heavy metal(loid)s, zinc (Zn) was the most abundant component in personal PM 2.5 , followed by lead (Pb), copper (Cu), and vanadium (V); cobalt (Co) and cadmium (Cd) were not detectable. Health risks of personal exposure to heavy metal(loid)s via inhalation were assessed for adults, including non-cancer risks that were characterized by hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI). The results indicated that non-cancer risks of heavy metal(loid)s were attributable to Cu, with a 95 th HQ value &gt; 1. Arsenic (As) and hexavalent chromium [Cr (VI)] were also significant contributors to inhalation cancer risks (&gt; 1 × 10 −6 ) for the adult participants. Finally, we employed a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the uncertainty associated with health risk assessment. The mean and median upper-bound lifetime cancer risk associated with inhalation exposure to carcinogenic heavy metal(loid)s exceeded the acceptable level (1 × 10 −6 ) for adults. Traffic emission (including non-tailpipe exhaust), shipping emission, and regional pollution were significant sources of heavy metals. These findings suggest that emission controls targeting local vehicles and vessels should be given priority in Hong Kong.",

To assess the residual impacts of the 2021 Marshall Fire (Colorado), a wildfire that predominantly burned homes and other human-made materials, on homes within the fire perimeter that escaped the fire, we performed a combination of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) filter sampling and chemical analysis, indoor dust collection and chemical analysis, community scale PurpleAir PM 2.5 analysis, and indoor particle number concentration measurements. Following the fire, the chemical speciation of dust collected in smoke-affected homes in the burned zone showed elevated concentrations of the biomass burning marker levoglucosan (median levo = 4147 ng g −1 ), EPA priority toxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (median Σ 16 PAH = 1859.3 ng g −1 ), and metals (median Σ 20 Metals = 34.6 mg g −1 ) when compared to samples collected in homes outside of the burn zone 6 months after the fire. As indoor dust particles are often resuspended and can become airborne, the enhanced concentration of hazardous metals and organics within dust samples may pose a threat to human health. Indoor airborne particulate organic carbon (median = 1.91 μg m −3 ), particulate elemental carbon (median = .02 μg m −3 ), and quantified semi-volatile organic species in PM 2.5 were found in concentrations comparable to ambient air in urban areas across the USA. Particle number and size distribution analysis at a heavily instrumented supersite home located immediately next to the burned area showed indoor particulates in low concentrations (below 10 μg m −3 ) across various sizes of PM (12 nm–20 μm), but were elevated by resuspension from human activity, including cleaning.

Therefore, this study explores the spatiotemporal distribution of ultraviolet aerosol index (UVAI), future trends, potential sources of absorbing aerosols and their relationship with temperature, wind speed, precipitation and total ozone column using Ozone Monitoring Instrument retrieved UVAI and HYSPLIT model over South Asia during October 2004 to March 2022. The mean UVAI within the ranges of 0.56–1.62 are observed over Eastern and Southern Pakistan and Northern India associated with dust and biomass burning aerosols. The interannual variations in UVAI show that the values of UVAI increases from 1.73 to 3.11 during 2018–2021 over the Indo-Gangetic Plain. Contrary to this, UVAI &lt; 0 is observed along the Karakorum and Himalaya range during 2005–2021 indicating presence of non-absorbing aerosols. The interaannual variations in U VAI reveal highest UVAI of 0.64 in December followed by 0.51 in July over South Asia. Seasonally, UVAI shows increasing trend at the rate of 0.9064 DJF −1 , 0.3810 JJA −1 , 0.2707 SON −1 and 0.0774 MAM −1 over South Asia. A positive correlation of 0.56 is observed between UVAI and wind speed followed by over Southern Pakistan followed 0.43 between UVAI and total ozone column Southern Pakistan and India. The UVAI shows increasing trend at the rate of 0.1409, 0.1124, 0.1224, 0.1015, 0.1242 and 0.2054 per year over Lahore, Karachi, Kanpur, New-Delhi, Varanasi, and Dhaka with maximum UVAI of 5.55, 4.47, 4.51, 4.99, 4.61 and 4.65 respectively during the study period. The anthropogenic productivity analysis reveals that primary industry and secondary industry contributes in lowering UVAI values whereas tertiary industry, energy consumption and gross domestic products increase aerosols loading in South Asia. Moreover, HYSPLIT cluster analysis further reveals the localized and trans-boundary sources of absorbing aerosols over the selected cities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Notwithstanding the improvements already achieved in recent decades through regional and urban scale actions implemented across Europe, air pollution is still a major environment and health concern for Europeans. The quantitative assessment of the different sources of air pollution in regional/urban areas is crucial to support the design of accurate air quality plans. Source apportionment techniques are capable to relate air pollutant concentrations to existing emission sources activities and regions. The selection of the appropriate source apportionment technique to apply to a given area should take into account the ultimate goal of the study. Despite the growing number of studies that include source apportionment techniques, there is still a lack of works that summarise information on this topic in a systematic way. In this work, a literature review of studies applying SA techniques, published between 2010 and 2021, was performed. Additionally, this review summarizes the differences among the different source apportionment techniques, with focus on source-oriented models, highlighting their purpose and their advantages and disadvantages. Results shows that the number of studies using source apportionment source-oriented models has been increasing across the years, with 59% using tagged species methods, 28% brute force methods, and 13% other methods. This source-oriented models have been mostly applied for PM2.5, to assess the causes of air pollution levels.",

The level of total airborne bacteria in the facilities was positively correlated with user density and CO 2 levels. Notably, subway compartments demonstrated particularly high levels of airborne bacteria. Subway compartments and daycare centers contained opportunistic pathogenic bacteria associated with antibiotic resistance. The relative abundance of genera associated with these species showed minor differences by season and facility; the genera Klebsiella and Staphylococcus showed high relative abundance in subway compartments and daycare centers, respectively. Based on our findings, we recommend enhancing management strategies targeting opportunistic pathogenic bacteria related to antibiotic resistance in the air of subway compartments and daycare centers.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The introduction of Tier 3 light-duty vehicles with reduced emissions began in New York State (NYS) in 2017, with required compliance by 2025. We hypothesized that improved air quality during the early implementation of Tier 3 (2017–2019) would result in reduced rates of hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits for respiratory infection associated with increased PM 2.5 compared to 2014–2016 (pre-Tier 3). Using data on adult patients hospitalized or having an ED visit for influenza, upper respiratory infection, culture-negative pneumonia, or respiratory bacterial infection, living within 15 miles of six air quality monitoring sites in NY, and a case-crossover design and conditional logistic regression, we estimated the rates of respiratory infection hospitalizations and ED visits associated with increased ambient PM 2.5 concentrations in the previous 0–6 days and each week thereafter up to 1 month. Interquartile range (IQR) increases in PM 2.5 in the previous 6 days were associated with 4.6% (95% CI: − 0.5, 10.1) and 11.9% (95% CI = 6.1, 18.0) increased rates of influenza hospitalizations in 2014–2016 and 2017–2019, respectively. This pattern of larger relative rates in 2017–2019 observed at all lag times was only present in males hospitalized for influenza but not other infections or in females. The rates of respiratory infection visits associated with increased PM 2.5 were generally not reduced in this early Tier 3 implementation period compared to 2014–2016. Limited fleet penetration of Tier 3 vehicles and differences in particle deposition, infection type, and sex by period may all have contributed to this lack of improvement.",

In this context, this study examines the impacts of tourism diversification, income, energy consumption, research and development expenditures, and population density on carbon emissions in New Zealand for the period 1981–2020 using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag approach. The results illustrate that income, lower tourism diversification, and energy consumption increase carbon emissions, while an upsurge in population density and research and development expenditures minimizes environmental degradation. According to the findings, New Zealand’s intensification of tourism in certain areas increases the environmental damage. It is therefore recommended that the New Zealand government promote tourism diversification and research and development expenditures to achieve environmental sustainability goals.",

    "abstract": "Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increases all-cause mortality risk. Few studies have examined PM2.5-associated mortality in Washington State communities experiencing health, social, and environmental inequities and highly impacted by criteria air pollution (overburdened communities). We used the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program, Community Edition, to estimate PM2.5-associated mortality in 16 overburdened communities in Washington. The model included baseline and natural background PM2.5 concentrations, census tract population data, baseline mortality rates from state death records, and published PM2.5 and all-cause mortality effect estimates. We calculated age-adjusted mortality rates by standardizing crude rates to the statewide age distribution. The annual mean PM2.5 concentration in overburdened communities was 7.2 µg/m3 during 2014–2017 compared to the state average, 6.4 µg/m3. We estimated 46 annual PM2.5-associated deaths (95% confidence interval: 33–59) per 100,000 people in overburdened communities after age adjustment compared with 25 (12–37) deaths per 100,000 people statewide. Age-adjusted annual PM2.5-associated mortality rates were highest among Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black people (78 [44–110] and 56 [17–92] deaths per 100,000 people, respectively). Similar disparities were observed when using 2020 air quality data that included more extensive wildfire-related PM2.5. Despite meeting the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, we identified racial and ethnic disparities in PM2.5-associated mortality in Washington overburdened communities. In addition to enhanced air quality monitoring, engagement with local governments, Tribal nations, air agencies, and community-based organizations will be crucial for understanding and addressing disproportionate PM2.5 impacts in these communities.",

    "abstract": "Particulate matter (PM) is a major air pollutant with significant health impacts. Studies show that PM induces various cellular effects, including cytotoxicity, mutagenicity, and genotoxicity, and its epigenetic alterations are linked to increased disease susceptibility and progression. As epigenotoxic effects of xenobiotics are increasingly recognised, it is crucial to adopt approaches beyond genotoxicological analysis to assess PM impact on the epigenome. This study evaluated the genotoxicity of PM extracts from five monitoring sites (urban, traffic, incinerator, and two rural sites) using the comet assay on BEAS-2B cells. The highest pollutant concentrations were observed in autumn-winter and, in the same months, the Ames test showed maximum mutagenic activity. The comet assay confirmed this trend, revealing greater DNA damage at the traffic site in winter and autumn, and significant damage at the incinerator and urban sites during the cold months, aligning with Ames test results. Additionally, a methylation-sensitive comet assay was applied to assess DNA methylation changes induced by PM. The strongest epigenetic effects were observed in PM samples from winter and autumn, suggesting that higher concentrations of PAHs or other pollutants during these seasons contribute to these effects. The varying epigenetic outcomes highlight how PM composition—both type and quantity—can influence biological effects. This modified in vitro version of comet assay demonstrated its utility in monitoring both genotoxic and epigenetic effects of PM, providing a comprehensive tool for assessing its biological impacts.",

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-recommended standard methods were adopted not only for sample collection but also for subsequent analysis of respirable particulate pollutants. The observed PM10 concentrations varied from 88.1 to 226.9 μg/m3, and lead concentrations ranged between 0.21 to 1.18 μg/m3. The annual averages of the concentrations of the pollutants of current concern manifested that they were mostly below the Indian air quality standards and were generally comparable with those concentrations observed in most other Indian urban areas. The AERMOD model was validated simultaneously by comparing the predicted levels with the estimated levels of PM10. The generated database of the present investigation on the degree of pollution may be used for further research investigation and pollution abatement in the city.",

To characterize the ambient particulate pollution, samples of particulates with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 microm (PM(10)) were collected during a 6-day campaign. Individual particles were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscope with Energy-Dispersive Spectrometer (SEM-EDS) to determine their chemical composition. Meanwhile, photomicrographs were obtained from SEM to aid in particles' source identification. The lumped data from SEM-EDS were subjected to hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) to sort out particle types chemically. HCA combined with SEM photomicrographs allowed us to identify 20 different particle types, namely (in order of particle frequency), soil/fly ash particles, coal-burning, sulfur-rich, and iron-rich particles, gypsum, syngenite, quartz, cement, silicon sulfide, siliconferro alloy, calcium-rich particles, ferrochromium alloy, ammonium sulfate and chloride, iron-zinc, ammonium chloride, molybdenum-rich, potassium sulfate, dolomite, lead sulfate, and copper-rich particles. Their possible origins and pathways are suggested. The majority of the particles seem to originate from coal combustion, which conforms to Taiyuan's industrial structure.",

    "abstract": "The objectives of this study were (1) to evaluate how acute mortality responds to changes in particulate and ozone (O(3)) pollution levels, (2) to identify vulnerable population groups by age and cause of death, and (3) to address the problem of interaction between the effects of O(3) and particulate pollution. Time-series of daily mortality counts, air pollution, and air temperature were obtained for the city of Moscow during a 3-year period (2003-2005). To estimate the pollution-mortality relationships, we used a log-linear model that controlled for potential confounding by daily air temperature and longer term trends. The effects of 10 mug/m(3) increases in daily average measures of particulate matter </=10 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM(10)) and O(3) were, respectively, (1) a 0.33% [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.09-0.57] and 1.09% (95% CI 0.71-1.47) increase in all-cause non-accidental mortality in Moscow; (2) a 0.66% (0.30-1.02) and 1.61% (1.01-2.21) increase in mortality from ischemic heart disease; (3) a 0.48% (0.02-0.94) and 1.28% (0.54-2.02) increase in mortality from cerebrovascular diseases. In the age group >75 years, mortality increments were consistently higher, typically by factor of 1.2 - 1.5, depending upon the cause of death. PM(10)-mortality relationships were significantly modified by O(3) levels. On the days with O(3) concentrations above the 90th percentile, PM(10) risk for all-cause mortality was threefold greater and PM(10) risk for cerebrovascular disease mortality was fourfold greater than the unadjusted risk estimate.",

An instrumental variable approach that combines geographically weighted regression and spatial autoregression methods (GWR-SEM) is adopted to simultaneously account for spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation. SEM mitigates spatial dependency while GWR addresses spatial heterogeneity by allowing response coefficients to vary across observations. Positive amenity values of improved air quality are found in four major clusters: (1) in East Kentucky and most of Georgia around the Southern Appalachian area; (2) in a few counties in Illinois; (3) on the border of Oklahoma and Kansas, on the border of Kansas and Nebraska, and in east Texas; and (4) in a few counties in Montana. Clusters of significant positive amenity values may exist because of a combination of intense air pollution and consumer awareness of diminishing air quality.",

Results from a program of measuring ground-level concentration of NO2 at 20 urban sites within the city of Beirut are presented. In addition, two curbside sites were implemented at different heights. Two-week sampling period measurements were performed over 41 periods for all sites. A study of the sites’ behaviors was conducted using principal component analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering. Firstly, results indicate that urban sites are equivalent, and one global class is identified. Any further monitoring of the nitrogen dioxide concentration can be conducted by decreasing the number of urban sites. Secondly, nitrogen dioxide concentration levels present a seasonal variation, as expected. Maximum average concentration of 178 μg m − 3 was observed during winter (December 2005) and a minimum concentration of 17 μg m − 3 was observed during summer (May 2006). The annual average concentration measured in 2005 is 67 μg m − 3, while the recommended value from the World Health Organization is 40 μg m − 3.",

Strict sampling and measurement procedure, together with analysis of air mass backward trajectories and pollutant markers, indicated that the most important sources of carbon in the aerosols over Diabla Gora were vegetation, agricultural activity, and biomass burning. The highest contribution of secondary organic carbon (SOC) in aerosol mass (70 %) was detected during summer as a result of increased vegetation. In spring and autumn, raised concentrations of primary OC, calcium, and potassium and the presence of ammonium nitrate were observed in aerosols due to emission from surrounding fields and forests, as well as from fires in Lithuania. Anthropogenic influence on the increase in concentration of all carbon species was observed only in winter, when air masses drifted in from habitations situated within a radius of 50 km from the Diabla Gora station. Transport was of sporadic significance to the measured concentrations, and only in PM2.5 when wind speed was close to 1 m s-1. In this case, the concentration of EC rose several fold. Such a tendency was particularly noticeable with the influx of air masses from nearby cities and the Polish-Russian border, which is located 29 km away from the station.",

    "abstract": "Fragranced consumer products, such as cleaning supplies, air fresheners, and personal care products, can emit a range of air pollutants and trigger adverse health effects. This study investigates the prevalence and types of effects of fragranced products on asthmatics in the American population. Using a nationally representative sample (n = 1137), data were collected with an on-line survey of adults in the USA, of which 26.8% responded as being medically diagnosed with asthma or an asthma-like condition. Results indicate that 64.3% of asthmatics report one or more types of adverse health effects from fragranced products, including respiratory problems (43.3%), migraine headaches (28.2%), and asthma attacks (27.9%). Overall, asthmatics were more likely to experience adverse health effects from fragranced products than non-asthmatics (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 5.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.34–7.64). In particular, 41.0% of asthmatics report health problems from air fresheners or deodorizers, 28.9% from scented laundry products coming from a dryer vent, 42.3% from being in a room cleaned with scented products, and 46.2% from being near someone wearing a fragranced product. Of these effects, 62.8% would be considered disabling under the definition of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Yet 99.3% of asthmatics are exposed to fragranced products at least once a week. Also, 36.7% cannot use a public restroom if it has an air freshener or deodorizer, and 39.7% would enter a business but then leave as quickly as possible due to air fresheners or some fragranced product. Further, 35.4% of asthmatics have lost workdays or a job, in the past year, due to fragranced product exposure in the workplace. More than twice as many asthmatics would prefer that workplaces, health care facilities and health care professionals, hotels, and airplanes were fragrance-free rather than fragranced. Results from this study point to relatively simple and cost-effective ways to reduce exposure to air pollutants and health risks for asthmatics by reducing their exposure to fragranced products.",

    "abstract": "Many social celebrations in urban areas are followed by fireworks show. The organic and inorganic pollutants emitted during detonations are expected to affect the ambient air quality of these celebration sites. The environmental aspects of fireworks events are usually investigated by analyzing the concentration and composition of airborne particulate matter, while there is limited information regarding the effect of fireworks on the elemental concentration of deposited dust. In this study, foliage dust samples were collected in the city of Debrecen (Hungary) before and after the fireworks show, organized on the 20th of August for the celebration of a historical event. Leaf samples (Tilia tomentosa) were collected around the location of the area of festivities. The sampling sites were further divided into five areas: city center (center), Southeast (SE), Southwest (SW), Northeast (NE), and Northwest (NW). We found that the amount of deposited dust particles increased significantly after the fireworks show compared to the background; we also found significant differences in the amount of dust deposition between the different locations of the city. A statistically higher level of Ca, Mg, and Sr was detected in samples collected after the display compared to those collected during the previous days, while the concentration of other studied elements were not statistically different from the background level. Our study confirmed previous findings that the relatively high altitude of detonations allows chemicals to disperse in the fine and ultrafine aerosol fractions; thus, the emitted pollutants by fireworks shows do not increase the level of elements as markedly in deposited dust as in the inhalable fraction.",

Time spent in a vehicle, in active transportation, along roadsides, and in close proximity to traffic can substantially contribute to daily exposure to air pollutants. For this study, we evaluated daily time spent in transportation and traffic-influenced microenvironments by urban Canadians using the Canadian Human Activity Pattern Survey (CHAPS) 2 results. Approximately 4-7% of daily time was spent in on- or near-road locations, mainly associated with being in a vehicle and smaller contributions from active transportation. Indoor microenvironments can be impacted by traffic emissions, especially when located near major roadways. Over 60% of the target population reported living within one block of a roadway with moderate to heavy traffic, which was variable with income level and city, and confirmed based on elevated NO2 exposure estimated using land use regression. Furthermore, over 55% of the target population ≤ 18 years reported attending a school or daycare in close proximity to moderate to heavy traffic, and little variation was observed based on income or city. The results underline the importance of traffic emissions as a major source of exposure in Canadian urban centers, given the time spent in traffic-influenced microenvironments.",

    "abstract": "We evaluate air quality modeling over the East Mediterranean using the benchmarking methodology developed in the framework of the Forum for Air Quality Modelling in Europe (FAIRMODE). FAIRMODE aims to provide a harmonized approach of model evaluation for regulatory purposes. We test the methodology by assessing the performance of the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) against ground-based air quality observations over Cyprus, a member state of the European Union. Two nested domains are used (at 50- and 10-km horizontal grid spacing) with the comparison performed over the innermost domain. We consider performance indicators reflecting regulations for air quality standards (maximum daily 8-hourly mean ozone, hourly nitrogen dioxide, and daily fine particulate matter concentrations). The WRF-Chem model is found to satisfy the proposed performance objectives regarding ozone and NO2, though it underestimates the latter in urban areas possibly due to uncertainties in emission inventories. Fine particulate matter is well represented by the model, except on days with strong influence from natural sources, highlighting the necessity for fine-tuning dust mobilization and transport in the region. The objectives are fulfilled even though discrepancies exist between model and observations. Our results indicate the need for more stringent performance criteria at relatively low concentrations. Overall, we find that the methodology provides in-depth information and relevant statistical metrics to guide air quality and model assessments for monitoring compliance with the EU Air Quality Directives and other guidelines to limit the impact of air pollution on human health and ecosystems.",

Air pollution is still a serious health hazard for the inhabitants as Kraków is located in a concave landform and smog episodes occur often in the city during the heating periods, due to poor natural ventilation and frequent air temperature inversions. The PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations were studied for very good and very poor weather conditions concerning air pollution. Each subgroup was further divided into cases when the apartments’ windows were kept open or closed. Daily courses of PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations were very dynamic. Weather pattern, in particular wind speed and atmospheric stability, largely determined the concentrations of PM 10 in ambient air. The share of PM 2.5 in PM 10 indoor concentrations reached around 70% for both types of weather conditions. The share of indoor PM 10 and PM 2.5 mean concentrations in the outdoor values was higher during good than during poor weather conditions by about 10%.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Air pollution is currently becoming a significant global environmental issue. The sources of air pollution in Malaysia are mobile or stationary. Motor vehicles are one of the mobile sources. Stationary sources originated from emissions caused by urban development, quarrying and power plants and petrochemical. The most noticeable contaminant in the Peninsular of Malaysia is the particulate matter (PM 10 ), the highest contributor of Air Pollution Index (API) compared to other pollution parameters. The aim of this study is to determine the best loss function between quantile regression (QR) and ordinary least squares (OLS) using boosted regression tree (BRT) for the prediction of PM 10 concentration in Alor Setar, Klang and Kota Bharu, Malaysia. Model comparison statistics using coefficient of determination (R 2 ), prediction accuracy (PA), index of agreement (IA), normalized absolute error (NAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) show that QR is slightly better than OLS with the performance of R 2 (0.60–0.73), PA (0.78–0.85), IA (0.86–0.92), NAE (0.15–0.17) and RMSE (9.52–22.15) for next-day predictions in BRT model.",

The aim was to evaluate the morphology and the elemental chemical composition of particulate matter and establish possible emission sources during the rainy season. Functional groups were identified by FTIR spectroscopic analysis, and morphology and elemental composition were obtained by SEM–EDX analysis. The sampling period coincided with a Sahara dust storm. The SEM–EDX and FTIR analyses found evidence of mineral elements related to soil and crustal origins. The presence of C-rich or C-containing aerosols is related to biological sources or mineral carbon. SEM–EDX analysis of PM revealed the following particle groups: geogenic, metallic, C-rich, and secondary aerosols. Quantitative source appointments through principal component analysis (PCA) corroborated PM sources, including soil dust, sea salts, and reacted aerosols. According to the authors’ knowledge, this study represents the first report to indicate that an episode of African dust could influence the particles collected in an intertropical continental sector in Venezuela, South America.",

Here, we investigate how breathing pattern alterations at increasing physical activity affect DF in different regions of the respiratory tract and compare DF between adults and children (5 and 10 years old). We performed a literature review on the alteration of tidal volume with minute ventilation at increasing physical activity and used the results to model the size resolved (0.001–10 µm) DF, primarily using the deposition models from NCRP and Yeh and Schum (1980), but also MPPD. We found a shift in the deposited size distribution with increasing physical activity—DF of ultrafine particles increased in the alveolar region and decreased in the other regions, while DF of coarser particles decreased in the alveolar region and increased in the extra-thoracic region. Children had a 10–20% higher DF of ultrafine particles in the alveolar region compared to adults. We also present parametrizations of the daily average size resolved (0.005–5 µm) DF, accounting for varying physical activity throughout the day and oral/nasal breathing. These can be applied to any size distribution to estimate deposited doses. We found that deposited mass and number doses were more than twice as high for 5-year-olds compared to adults when normalized for body weight, primarily caused by their higher weight normalized minute ventilation. This demonstrates the importance of studying children’s exposure to air pollution and not only rely on data from adults.",

    "abstract": "While sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions have been dramatically restricted in the past few decades, some cities in developing countries still encounter high pollution levels. This makes it essential to implement an air quality monitoring network in these sensitive regions. Results from a program of measuring ground-level concentration of SO2 (from December 2004 till July 2006) at 22 curbside and background sites within the city of Beirut (Lebanon) are presented for the first time. Four-week sampling period measurements were made over 20 periods for all sites by passive sampling. Low SO2 concentrations were observed (3.1 parts per billion on average for the whole period). This value is among the lowest observed in urban areas worldwide. Thus, Beirut is not polluted by SO2 on an annual basis. Highest concentrations were measured in winter time, resulting from low height of the boundary layer and higher emissions of SO2 (e.g., heating). Cluster analysis revealed two different SO2 variation patterns over the city (high- and low-level patterns), highlighting the effects of local sources location and wind direction variability on SO2 distribution. Analysis of seasonal variations pointed out a springtime SO2 maximum in 2005. Beside local sources, long-range transport can account for an important source of SO2 in Beirut, explaining around 50% of SO2 levels within the city.",

    "abstract": "It is now widely recognized that background ozone may form a significant part of the concentration and, thus, of the health and ecosystem impacts, experienced at many locations. This can be extremely important, as the background concentration is the level below which concentrations cannot be reduced by local efforts alone. In discussing background ozone, it is important to be clear what is meant by the term. Slightly different interpretations of the exact understanding of what constitutes background widen the uncertainty in reported values. Nevertheless, the central tendency to reported background ozone concentrations may be estimated as 25 to 40 ppb for measurements made worldwide. The large majority of recently reported work indicates that these background concentrations are increasing at a rate ranging up to about 0.3 to 0.5 ppb per year. Ozone lifted to levels above the boundary layer can be transported very long (intercontinental) distances. As a result, Asia, North America, and Europe can all contribute to each other's background ozone concentrations. In this context, the rapid industrial growth in Asia and the expected accompanying increased precursor emissions, could prove to be significant.",

The monitoring of aerosol concentrations becomes a high environmental priority particularly in urban areas. The proposed algorithm has been developed to allow the quantification of the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) over land. The algorithm compares multitemporal satellite data sets and evaluates radiometric alterations due to the optical atmospheric effects of aerosols. Novel features of this algorithm which is based on the application of radiative transfer calculations are the inclusion of applying iteration procedures for selecting the suitable object for determining the aerosol optical thickness and the automatic division into working grid cells. AOT retrieval from Landsat TM band 1 images of Cyprus has been cross-validated satisfactorily by comparing AOT values found from handheld MICROTOPS II sun photometer.",

Pure and typical polluted atmospheric concentrations of ammonia, sulfur dioxide, and ozone gases were used to age montmorillonite mineral dust aerosol particles at room temperature and atmospheric pressure in a stainless steel chamber. Ammonia-, sulfur dioxide-, and ozone-exposed montmorillonite mineral dust aerosols act as ice nuclei in heterogeneous deposition freezing at warmer temperatures than required for homogeneous freezing. The ice nucleation efficiency of montmorillonite mineral dust aerosols increased about two times due to exposure to ammonia at a typical atmospheric concentration of about 100 ppt. This is the first experimental evidence for the enhancement of the ice nucleation efficiency of montmorillonite mineral dust aerosols by ammonia gas at typical atmospheric concentrations. Montmorillonite exposure to either pure (100%) or 45 ppm sulfur dioxide or to ozone at 200 ppb shows no clear evidence for changing the ice nucleation efficiency of montmorillonite mineral dust particles. Thus, we conclude that enhancements atmospheric trace gases (e.g., sulfur dioxide and ozone) due to anthropogenic activities have no significant impact on the heterogeneous ice nucleation of montmorillonite mineral dust particles.",

    "abstract": "The monitored level of pollution remains high in Krakow, Poland. Alerts regarding increased levels of pollution, which advise asthmatics, the elderly, and children to limit their exposure to open air, continue to be issued on numerous days. In this work, seasonal variations in PM2.5 (particulate matter containing particles with aerodynamic diameter no higher than 2.5 μm) concentrations are shown. An increasing trend is reported, which is enhanced during the colder seasons. The mean PM2.5 concentrations in Krakow exceeded the target value of 25 μg/m3 specified for 2015 in the spring, autumn, and winter seasons. For this reason, particulate matter pollution is of special concern. Elemental concentrations as well as the presence of black carbon (BC) and black smoke (BS) in PM2.5 samples were determined. Seasonal variations of Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Br, Rb, Sr, and Pb concentrations were observed whereas V, Cr, Ni, BC, and BS concentrations did not significantly change with the time of year. Seven factors were identified by the positive matrix factorization (PMF) technique, and one was non-identified. They were attributed to the following sources of pollution: steel industry, traffic (diesel exhaust), traffic (gasoline exhaust, brake wear), road dust, construction dust, combustion (biomass, coal), and non-ferrous metallurgical industry. The last, non-identified source, could be attributed to secondary aerosols. It is worth to mention that combustion shows significant seasonal variations with a high impact in winter. The reported results of the completed studies may significantly aid in solving air quality issues in the city by highlighting major sources of air pollution.",

    "abstract": "Chemical sensitivity is a medical condition characterized by adverse health effects from exposure to common chemical pollutants and products. This study investigated the prevalence of chemical sensitivity in four countries—the United States (US), Australia (AU), Sweden (SE), and the United Kingdom (UK). In addition, it investigated the co-prevalence of chemical sensitivity with medically diagnosed multiple chemical sensitivities (MCS), fragrance sensitivity (health problems from fragranced products), asthma/asthma-like conditions, and autism/autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Using nationally representative population samples in each country, data were collected in June 2016 and June 2017 through on-line cross-sectional surveys of adults (n = 4435). Results found that, across the four countries, 19.9% of the population report chemical sensitivity, 7.4% report medically diagnosed MCS, 21.2% report either or both, and 32.2% report fragrance sensitivity. In addition, 26.0% of the population report asthma/asthma-like conditions, of which 42.6% report chemical sensitivity and 57.8% fragrance sensitivity. Also, 4.5% of the population report autism/ASDs, of which 60.6% report chemical sensitivity and 75.8% fragrance sensitivity. Among individuals with chemical sensitivity, 55.4% also report asthma/asthma-like conditions, 13.5% autism/ASDs, and 82.0% fragrance sensitivity. Although the prevalence of chemical sensitivity across the countries is statistically different, its co-prevalences with other conditions are statistically similar. Results also found that, for 44.1% of individuals with chemical sensitivity, the severity of health effects from fragranced products can be potentially disabling. Further, 28.6% of those with chemical sensitivity have lost workdays or a job, in the past year, due to exposure to fragranced products in the workplace. Results indicate that chemical sensitivity is widespread across the four countries, affecting over 61 million people, that vulnerable individuals such as those with asthma and autism are especially affected, and that fragranced consumer products can contribute to the adverse health, economic, and societal effects.",

    "abstract": "Urban air quality is composed of a complex interaction of factors associated with anthropogenic emissions, atmospheric circulation, and geographic factors; also, most of the urban pollution presents aerosols and trace gases toxic to human health and responsible for damaged flora, fauna, and materials. The air quality system based on the state-of-the-art Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) has been configured and designed for Macedonia. An extensive set of experiments have been performed with different model settings to forecast simultaneously the weather and air pollution over Macedonia. For the present work, a numerical simulation of extreme pollution episode over the urban area in Skopje has been simulated using 1-km WRF-Chem model and a newly developed set of urban mobile emissions. The modeled results implied that the model is very sensitive to the initial meteorological conditions, grid spacing, and mobile emissions. The results are validated against available observations for meteorological fields and pollutant concentrations. While the model forecasts with coarser horizontal grid resolution well fit with the hourly values of some air quality monitoring stations, these experiments tend to underpredict the peak level of about 1250 μg/m3 evidenced at the air quality station \"Karpos.\" A WRF-Chem 5-km simulation shows increased PM10 concentrations with a peak value of about 1325 μg/m3 a few hours before the evidenced extreme concentration while 2.5-km grid run indicates the initial accumulation of air pollution with relatively high concentration with peak PM10 on 5 February 2017 at 0100 UTC. The 1-km model configuration well captures the PM10 distribution over Skopje valley and the location and timing of the maximum measured air pollution. The verification analysis indicates that the best performance in the sense of the correlation coefficient is achieved with the 5-km WRF-Chem v.3.91 forecast. Numerical simulations with coarser grid resolution show less confidence and lower CC. The results suggest that model initialization and initial data using a mobile source emission provide a better quantitative assessment of extreme air pollution in urban areas. Overall, the present case study shows that the WRF-Chem model has an acceptable performance for meteorological variables as well as PM10 concentration over Skopje. This study provides a general overview of WRF-Chem simulations and can serve as a reference for future air quality modeling studies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Data on airborne fine particle (PM 2.5 ) emissions and concentrations in cities are valuable for traffic and air quality managers, urban planners, health practitioners, researchers, and ultimately for legislators and decision makers. Emissions and ambient concentrations of PM 2.5 and black carbon (BC) were assessed in the city of Curitiba, southern Brazil. The methodology combined a month-long monitoring campaign with both fixed and mobile instruments, development of emission inventories, and dispersion model simulations on different scales. The mean urban background PM 2.5 concentrations during the campaign were 7.3 μg m −3 in Curitiba city center, but three- to fourfold higher (25.3 μg m -3 ) in a residential area on the city’s outskirts, indicating the presence of local sources, possibly linked to biomass combustion. BC concentrations seemed to be more uniformly distributed over the city, with mean urban background concentrations around 2 μg m −3 , half of which due to local traffic emissions. Higher mean BC concentrations (3–5 μg m -3 ) were found along busy roads. The dispersion modeling also showed high PM 2.5 and BC concentrations along the heavily transited ring road. However, the lack of in situ data over these peripheral areas prevented the verification of the model output. The vehicular emission factors for PM 2.5 and BC from the literature were found not to be suitable for Curitiba’s fleet and needed to be adjusted. The integrated approach of this study can be implemented in other cities, as long as an open data policy and a close cooperation among regional, municipal authorities and academia can be achieved.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We conducted ambient monitoring of various hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) for 2 years (2013-2015) in two adjacent Korean cities in a megacity area: Seoul and Incheon. Measured HAPs included volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and heavy metals (HMs). The objectives of this study were to evaluate the spatiotemporal variations of HAPs, to prioritize HAPs based on health risks, to identify sources using a receptor-based model, and to estimate source-specific risks. Overall, the HAP levels in Incheon were higher than those in Seoul. The concentrations of combustion-origin HAPs, such as PAHs and some HMs, were significantly higher during the heating period than during the non-heating period. However, most VOCs exhibited an opposite trend. Benzo[a]pyrene showed the highest cancer risk in both cities, followed by formaldehyde, arsenic, and benzene; trichloroethylene was the only species that exceeded the hazard quotient of 1. Cumulative cancer risks were 2.0 × 10 -4 in Seoul and 2.7 × 10 -4 in Incheon. Major sources and their contributions to each HAP concentration were estimated by positive matrix factorization modeling. Based on source-specific risk assessments, we suggest that both cities should give high priority to the control of traffic pollution and the supply of cleaner fuels in non-residential sectors. Reducing carbonyl concentrations in Seoul and industrial emissions in Incheon is also necessary. Establishing new ambient standards for benzo[a]pyrene and formaldehyde is worth considering as a long-term measure. This study provides scientific information on the occurrence, health risks, and sources of various HAPs in large urban areas.",

Countries around the world have enforced lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the virus, introducing a temporal change of air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) that are strongly related to transportation, industry, and energy. In this study, NO 2 variations over regions with strong responses to COVID-19 are analysed using datasets from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) sensor aboard the EUMETSAT Metop satellites and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) aboard the EU/ESA Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. The global GOME-2 and TROPOMI NO 2 datasets are generated at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) using harmonized retrieval algorithms; potential influences of the long-term trend and seasonal cycle, as well as the short-term meteorological variation, are taken into account statistically. We present the application of the GOME-2 data to analyze the lockdown-related NO 2 variations for morning conditions. Consistent NO 2 variations are observed for the GOME-2 measurements and the early afternoon TROPOMI data: regions with strong social responses to COVID-19 in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America show strong NO 2 reductions of $\\sim $ <mml:math xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"> <mml:mo>∼</mml:mo> </mml:math> 30–50% on average due to restriction of social and economic activities, followed by a gradual rebound with lifted restriction measures.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper is devoted to the investigation of the relationship between concentrations of traffic-related pollutants at pedestrian level in the street and indoor pollutant concentrations inside different rooms of different floors of a standard building. CFD modelling covering the whole urban environment, including the interior of a target building, is used to explicitly simulate wind flow and pollutant dispersion outdoors and indoors. A wide range of scenarios considering different percentage and location of open windows and different wind directions is investigated. A large variability of indoor pollutant concentrations is found depending on the floor and configuration of the open/closed windows, as well as the wind direction and its incidence angle. In general, indoor pollutant concentrations decrease with floor, but this decrease is different depending on the scenario and the room investigated. For some conditions, indoor concentrations higher than the spatially averaged values in the street (up to a ratio of 1.4) are found in some rooms due to the high pollutant concentrations close to open windows. This behavior may lead, on average, to higher exposure inside the room than outside although, in general, indoor pollutant concentrations are lower than that found in the street at pedestrian level. Results are averaged for all scenarios and rooms being the average ratio between indoor and oudoor concentrations 0.56 ± 0.24, which is in accordance with previous studies in real buildings. This paper opens to a unified approach for the assessment of air quality of the total indoor and outdoor environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Many of the population centres in southeast Australia were swathed in bushfire smoke during the 2019–2020 austral summer. Bushfires burning during what is now known as the Black Summer was historically large and severe, and the fire season historically long. The chemical composition in the gas and aerosol phase of aged plumes measured near Wollongong, NSW in early 2020 is reported in this work. Enhancement ratios to carbon monoxide are presented for thirteen species (acetaldehyde, acetone, acetonitrile, black carbon aerosol, benzene, methane, methacrolein + methyl vinyl ketone, methyl ethyl ketone, methanol, ammonium ion PM 1 fraction, nitrate ion PM 1 fraction, organic PM 1 fraction and PM 2.5 ). Observed plume composition is comparable to that measured in fresh smoke from Australian fires reported in the literature. Enhancements of biogenic volatile organic compounds such as isoprene (smoke-effected period mean 1 ppb, maximum 6 ppb) were observed along with elevated concentrations of particulate variables. Enhancement ratios reported here can be used in plume modelling of landscape-scale fires and assist in concentration estimates of infrequently measured atmospheric pollutants. The relative toxicological contribution of species present in the plumes was determined for plume exposure at the measurement site and for concentrated plumes at a population centre case study. Similar results were apparent at both locations. Contributions to the toxicological loading were dominated by respirable particles (~ 52–63% total contribution), formaldehyde (~ 30–39% total contribution) and acrolein. This is a reminder to consider the toxicological contributions in the gas phase when considering health impacts of population exposure to bushfire smoke.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD) are important neurodegenerative disorders, especially in an aging population context that prevails in high-developed countries and Europe in particular. It is known that exposure to particulate matter (PM) leads to the production and deposition of aggregate clusters of proteins, which are linked to neurological disorders and impediments. Nonetheless, only a few works study the short-term exposure to PM and its association with hospital admissions or mortality due to AD or PD. This study assesses the association between exposure to PM and emergency hospital admissions for AD and PD in an aging metropole, serving as a case study for most European big cities. Daily emergency hospital admissions due to AD and PD data were obtained for the 2012 to 2015 period and multivariate Poisson regression models were used to evaluate the association between PM and admissions while controlling for the day of the week, seasonality, and environmental factors. Furthermore, lagged observations were assessed. Results show that an increase in exposure to PM 2.5 resulted in a percentage increase in emergency hospital admissions due to AD and PD. Also, age was an effect modifier for PD admissions. Additionally, greater effects were felt at shorter lags for AD and delayed/longer lags for PD. This study found a relationship between short-term exposure to PM and AD and PD hospital admissions in an urban context, drawing attention to the importance of air pollution for urban health, especially in areas with an aged population structure.",

    "abstract": "A field study was carried out in the Metropolitan Area of Monterrey (MAM), the second most populated city in Mexico, characterized by increasing urbanization, high traffic density, and intense industrial activity. These characteristics commonly present high concentrations of air pollutants leading to the degradation of air quality. PM2.5 was analyzed for heavy metals at two urban sites located within the MAM (Juarez and San Bernabe) in order to determine sources, health risk, morphology, and elemental content during the COVID-19 pandemic (autumn 2020 and spring 2021). Twenty-four-hour samples of PM2.5 were collected at each site during 30-day periods using high-volume equipment. Gravimetric concentrations and 11 metals were measured (Ca, Cd, Co, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni, Cr, and Pb) by different analytical techniques (flame atomic absorption spectroscopy, graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy). Selected samples were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy-energy-disperse spectroscopy in order to characterize their morphology and elemental content. PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the Mexican standard and WHO guidelines in Juarez during spring 2021. Cu, Cd, and Co were highly enriched by anthropogenic sources, and Ni, K, Cr, and Pb had a moderate enrichment. Mg, Mn, and Ca were of crustal origin. Bivariate statistics and PCA confirmed that alkaline metals originated from crustal sources and that the main sources of trace metals included traffic emissions, resuspension from soil/road dust, steel industry, smelting, and non-exhaust emissions at both sites. Lifetime cancer risk coefficients did not exceed the permissible levels established by EPA and WHO, implying that local residents are not at risk of developing cancer. Non-carcinogenic risk coefficients revealed that there is a possible risk of suffering cardiovascular and respiratory diseases due to inhalation of cobalt at the study sites.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11869-023-01372-7.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The oxidative potential (OP) is defined as the ability of inhaled PM components to catalytically/non-catalytically generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and deplete lung antioxidants. Although several studies have measured the OP of particulate matter (PM OP) soluble components using different antioxidants under neutral pH conditions, few studies have measured PM OP with acidic lung fluids. This study provides new insights into the use of acidic rather than neutral fluids in OP assays. Thus, the first aim of this study was to clarify the effect of using an acidic lung fluid on ascorbic acid (AA) depletion. This was achieved by measuring the oxidative potential (OP-AA) of individual compounds known to catalyze the AA oxidation (CuSO 4 , CuCl 2 , and 1,4-NQ) in artificial lysosomal fluid (ALF, pH 4.5), a commonly used acidic simulated lung fluid, and in a neutral fluid (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS1x), pH 7.4). Our results from these individual compounds showed a significant decrease of OP-AA in the acidic fluid (ALF) with respect to the neutral fluid (PBS). Then, the second aim of this work was to investigate whether the OP-AA assay could be applied to PM 2.5 samples extracted in acidic conditions. For this purpose, OP-AA and bioaccessible concentrations of metal(loid)s (V, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Mo, Cd, Sb, and Pb) of PM 2.5 samples collected in an urban-industrial area that were extracted in ALF were analyzed. The mean volume-normalized OP (OP-AAv) value was 0.10 ± 0.07 nmol min −1 m −3 , clearly lower than the values found in the literature at neutral pH. OP-AAv values were highly correlated with the ALF-bioaccessible concentration of most of the studied metal(loid)s, mainly with Cu and Fe.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The sustainability of maritime activities is increasingly gaining interest, with the shipping sector actively focusing on decarbonization efforts. Throughout the years, researchers have considered slow steaming for improving the environmental footprint of maritime networks. In order to assess such strategies’ effectiveness on existing emissions, research also focuses on the accurate estimation of emission inventories. However, there is a significant gap concerning both fields when considering short-sea shipping, especially passenger shipping. Furthermore, while emissions are characterized by spatial aspects in several studies, there is an apparent gap in considering such aspects for detailed analysis purposes rather than only for visualization purposes. In this study, the Greek Coastal Shipping Network (GCSN) is considered, with its emissions estimated using a top-down method, creating a spatial emission inventory used for further spatial analysis for accurate identification of highly polluted areas. Results indicate that ship emissions do not spread homogeneously throughout the GCSN and that targeted interventions are necessary in several areas of the network. The effectiveness of spatially related slow steaming implementations is evaluated and compared with their implementation on the whole network. The study highlights the need for additional future emission mitigation strategies, such as service optimization, network restructuring, continuous emission monitoring, and fleet renewal with more environmentally efficient ships. The study’s aim is to fill the research gap regarding the environmental assessment of passenger shipping and the effects of slow steaming on such networks while presenting an adaptable GIS-based decision support system for enhanced decision-making regarding the environmental efficiency of maritime networks.",

For this purpose, thirty samples were selected from a set of 128 samples collected over one year (Dec 2019-Nov 2020), based on the highest load for each source (both mass and %) previously assessed by source apportionment studies (using Positive Matrix Factorisation, a total of 7 different sources were identified: soil, secondary sulphate, fuel-oil combustion, sea, vehicle non-exhaust, vehicle exhaust and industry). The OP associated with the water-soluble components of PM 2.5 was assessed using the dithiothreitol (DTT) method. The samples had a mean DTT activity (normalised to the mass) of 12.9 ± 6.6 pmol min − 1 µg − 1 , ranging from 3.5 to 31.8 pmol min − 1 µg − 1 . The DTT activity (normalised to the volume, $${\\text{O}\\text{P}}_{\\text{V}}^{\\text{D}\\text{T}\\text{T}}$$ ) showed to have a significant positive association with PM 2.5 levels (R 2 = 0.714). Considering that the mass contributions of the different sources to the PM 2.5 levels were known, Spearman correlations were assessed and significant correlations were found between $${\\text{O}\\text{P}}_{\\text{V}}^{\\text{D}\\text{T}\\text{T}}$$ and three different sources: vehicle exhaust (ρ = 0.647, p -value = 0.001), fuel-oil combustion (ρ = 0.523, p -value = 0.012) and industry (ρ = 0.463, p -value = 0.018).

    "abstract": "Accurate site-specific forecasting of hourly ground-level ozone concentrations is a key issue in air quality research nowadays due to increase of smog pollution problem. This paper investigates three emergent data-driven methods to address the complex nonlinear relationships between ozone and meteorological variables in Hamilton (Ontario, Canada). Three dynamic neural networks with different structures: a time-lagged feed-forward network, a recurrent neural network neural network, and a Bayesian neural network models are investigated. The results suggest that the three models are effective forecasting tools and outperform the commonly used multilayer perceptron and hence can be applicable for short-term forecasting of ozone level. Overall, the Bayesian neural network model's capability of providing prediction with uncertainty estimate in the form of confidence intervals and its inherent ability to prevent under-fitting and over-fitting problems have established it as a good alternative to the other data-driven methods.",

    "abstract": "The atmospheric size distributions of particulate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) up to 10 μm in diameter were measured at Seoul in the summer and winter of 2003. The concentrations of total PAHs were from 4.32 to 5.48 ng m−3 in summer and from 25.6 to 35.9 ng m−3 in winter, respectively. Majority of the PAHs concentrations were found on fine particles (D p < 2.1 μm). The size distributions of individual PAH compounds were bimodal with the peaks in the 0.43–0.65- and 4.7–5.8-μm range in summer. In winter, those were unimodal or weakly bimodal with the peaks in the 0.65–1.1- and 4.7–5.8-μm range. The seasonal variation of the peak size range in the fine mode might be caused by longer residence time in the air in winter. Based on the previously reported source diagnostic ratios of PAHs for the major emission sources, it was suggested that vehicles were the major source of PAH in summer, while coal-related emissions and firewood fire were the major sources in winter for fine particles. The seasonal variation of the peak size ranges in the fine particles had not shown noticeable effect on the dry deposition fluxes. However, it might affect the optical properties of the atmosphere.",

Statistical analyses on so-generated database were performed to infer frequency distributions and to identify dominant meteorological factor affecting the pollution levels. Both the RPM and TSP levels were well below the permissible limits set by the US Environmental Protection Agency. As expected, lognormal distribution always fit the data during the study period. However, fit with the normal was also acceptable except for very few seasons. The RPM concentrations ranged between 20.9 and 198.2 mug/m(3), while the TSP concentrations varied from 51.5 to 333.3 mug/m(3) during the study period. There was a better correlation between PM(10-100) and TSP concentrations than that of PM(10) (RPM) and TSP concentrations, but the correlation of RPM fraction was also acceptable. It was found that wind speed was the most important meteorological factor affecting the concentrations of the pollutants of present interest. Significant seasonal variations in the pollutant concentrations of present interest were found at 5% significance level except for TSP concentrations in the year 2006.",

    "abstract": "The Clean Air Act (CAA) requires listing as criteria air pollutants those pollutants that arise from multiple sources and are found across the United States. The original list included carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, particulate matter, photochemical oxidants (later regulated as ozone), and hydrocarbons. Later, the listing of hydrocarbons was revoked and lead was listed. The CAA requires the EPA Administrator to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for these pollutants using the \"latest scientific knowledge\" at levels that, in the judgment of the Administrator, are \"requisite to protect public health\" while \"allowing an adequate margin of safety\" without considering the cost of implementing the NAAQS. The NAAQS are set using scientific knowledge to inform the Administrator's policy judgments on each NAAQS. Recently, there has been increasing tension and debate over the role of scientific knowledge versus policy judgment in the setting of NAAQS. This paper reviews key elements of this debate drawing on the opinion of Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, in Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, to resolve the conundrum posed by the CAA language. I conclude that scientists should carefully distinguish between their interpretations of scientific knowledge on specific pollutants and their personal preferences as to a given policy outcome (i.e., specific level and form of the NAAQS), recognizing that these are policy judgments as to acceptable levels of risk if the science does not identify a threshold level below which there are no identifiable health risks. These policy judgments are exclusively delegated by the CAA to the EPA Administrator who needs to articulate the basis for their policy judgments on the level and form of the NAAQS and associated level of acceptable risk.",

    "abstract": "Prior work has reported acute associations between ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and short-term increases in airborne particulate matter. Subsequently, the association between STEMI and hourly measures of Delta-C (marker of woodsmoke) and black carbon (marker of traffic pollution) measured at a central site in Rochester, NY, were examined, but no association was found. Therefore, land use regression estimates of Delta-C and black carbon concentrations at each patient's residence were developed for 246 STEMI patients treated at the University of Rochester Medical Center during the winters of 2008–2012. Using case-crossover methods, the rate of STEMI associated with increased Delta-C and BC concentration on the same and previous 3 days was estimated after adjusting for 3-day mean temperature and relative humidity. Non-statistically significant increased rates of STEMI associated with interquartile range increases in concentrations of BC in the previous 2 days (1.10 μg/m3; OR = 1.12; 95% CI 0.93, 1.35) and Delta-C in the previous 3 days (0.43 μg/m3; OR = 1.16; 95% CI 0.96, 1.40) were found. Significantly increased rates of STEMI associated with interquartile range increases in concentrations of BC (1.23 μg/m3; OR = 1.04; 95% CI = 0.87, 1.24) or Delta-C (0.40 μg/m3; OR = 0.94; 95% CI = 0.85, 1.09) on the same day were not observed likely due, in part, to temporal misalignment. Therefore, sophisticated spatial-temporal models will be needed to minimize exposure error and bias by better predicting concentrations at individual locations for individual hours, especially for outcomes with short-term responses to air pollution (< 24 h).",

    "abstract": "Estimates of lung dose of submicron particles in the human respiratory system play an essential role in assessing health outcomes of aerosol exposure. The objectives of this study are to calculate the regional lung dose of traffic-generated particles by different metrics from exposure in outdoor and indoor environments and to identify main factors determining the lung dose. Particle number size distributions were collected in both indoor and outdoor environments in two unoccupied apartments from 22nd February to 30th April 2012 in Bologna, Italy. The whole lung doses of outdoor aerosols by number, surface area and mass at a traffic site were 1.0 × 1010 particles/h, 130 mm2/h and 1.9 μg/h, respectively. A majority of particles by number and surface area were found to deposit in the alveolar region (65%). The physical properties of particles such as shape, hygroscopicity and density play an important role in the calculation of surface area and mass dose due to shifting of the lung deposition curve. Particle number can predict well the regional dose by number, while PM2.5 and PM10 are good metrics for the prediction of surface area and mass dose. Good correlations between NOx and the surface areas and mass dose (r2 ~ 0.8) and number dose (r2 ~ 0.7) of submicron aerosols suggest that NOx may be a good indicator for predicting the health outcomes of traffic-generated aerosols. The doses of indoor sub-micrometre aerosols are less than those of outdoor aerosols by factors of 4.1 (for number), 2.7 (for surface area) and 2.1 (for mass). Due to traffic emissions, the lung dose of outdoor aerosols in the traffic area was much higher than that in the residential area by 5 times for number and surface area and 2 times for mass. A different exercise level (standing, walking, running and cycling) has only a slight influence on the whole lung deposition fraction of submicron aerosols but has a large effect on the dose due to differences in ventilation rate.",

Evidence for significant differences in NO2 between heights was observed up to at least 1.2 m from kerbside of busy roads, with tubes at 0.8 m measuring concentrations 5-15 % (a few μg m-3) greater than at 2.0 m. The vertical NO2 concentration difference was not observable at distances 2.5 m or greater from the kerbside. Fitting of horizontal transects of NO2 concentrations away from main roads demonstrated the strong influence of wind speed in yielding faster fall-off in NO2 concentration from the roadside, and in near-ground vertical gradient in NO2, and lower background NO2 concentrations. These observations have potential public health implications for differential NO2 exposures between children walking, or in buggies, close to heavily trafficked urban roads compared with adults.",

    "abstract": "Fragranced consumer products, such as cleaning supplies, air fresheners, and personal care products, can have adverse effects on both air quality and health. This study investigates the effects of fragranced products on autistic individuals ages 18-65 in the United States, Australia, and United Kingdom. Nationally representative population surveys (n = 1137; 1098; 1100) found that, across the three countries, 4.3% of adults (n = 142) report medically diagnosed autism (2.3%), an autism spectrum disorder (2.4%), or both. Of these autistic adults, 83.7% report adverse health effects from fragranced products, including migraine headaches (42.9%), neurological problems (34.3%), respiratory problems (44.7%), and asthma attacks (35.9%). In particular, 62.9% of autistic adults report health problems from air fresheners or deodorizers, 57.5% from the scent of laundry products coming from a dryer vent, 65.9% from being in a room cleaned with scented products, and 60.5% from being near someone wearing a fragranced product. Health problems can be severe, with 74.1% of these effects considered potentially disabling under legislation in each country. Further, 59.4% of autistic adults have lost workdays or lost a job, in the past year, due to fragranced product exposure in the workplace. More than twice as many autistic as well as non-autistic individuals would prefer that workplaces, health care facilities, and health care professionals were fragrance-free rather than fragranced. Results show that vulnerable individuals, such as those with autism or autism spectrum disorders, can be profoundly, adversely, and disproportionately affected by exposure to fragranced consumer products.",

    "abstract": "Fine particulate matter is considered to be the most significant ambient air pollutant in terms of potential health impacts. Therefore, it is important that regulators are able to accurately assess the exposure of populations to PM10 and PM2.5 across municipal areas. We report on the practicalities of using a laser light scattering portable particulate monitor (Turnkey Instruments DustMate), in combination with a GPS, to map PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations on city-wide scales in Newcastle upon Tyne/Gateshead (UK), during a series of walking surveys. A heated inlet is necessary to remove moisture droplets from the sampled air prior to analysis by the instrument, though this also results in the loss of volatile particulate components, particularly from the PM2.5 fraction. A co-location calibration study was carried out with a reference urban background Tapered Element Oscillating Micro-Balance/Filter Dynamics Measuring System (TEOM-FDMS) system in Newcastle that is part of the UK's Automatic Urban and Rural Network (AURN) of air quality monitoring stations. For PM10, orthogonal regression of the DustMate against TEOM-FDMS data gave a slope and intercept of 1.02 ± 0.06 and −3.7 ± 1.2, respectively (R 2 = 0.73), whereas for PM2.5, the respective values were 0.78 ± 0.06 and −0.63 ± 0.55 (R 2 = 0.79). These parameters are comparable to literature calibration studies using this technology. There was good agreement between simultaneous samples taken using two DustMate instruments: for PM10, a slope and intercept of 1.05 ± 0.03 and 0.36 ± 0.5, respectively (R 2 = 0.73), were obtained, whereas for the PM2.5, the respective values were 0.79 ± 0.01 and 0.19 ± 0.06 (R 2 = 0.86). Correction factors based on the slope and intercepts obtained from the calibration exercise were applied to raw data collected from the DustMate. An annually-normalised correction procedure was then used to account for different background particulate concentrations on different sampling days. These corrected PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations and corresponding GPS coordinates were displayed on a base map using Google Fusion Tables and Google Earth Professional. Almost all areas surveyed in Newcastle/Gateshead were well below the EU Air Quality Standards for PM10 and PM2.5.",

The study of the magnetic properties was supplemented by the analysis of chemical elements and electron microscopic observation. The metallic iron in the mixture affects the values of hysteresis parameters, decreasing coercivity (Bc) and increasing saturation magnetization (Ms), and it is responsible for the magnetic enhancement of magnetic susceptibility. The thermomagnetic curves show several distinct features: the first Curie temperature of magnetite, the second one (∼764 °C) of iron, and the rapid decrease on the heating curves (between 600 and 750 °C) caused by the oxidation of iron to magnetite. Two magnetochemical processes appear during the thermal treatment of indoor dust: the oxidation of iron to magnetite and the neo-formation of magnetite as a result of chemical transformation of non-magnetic minerals. The shift of the hysteresis parameter ratios from the multi-domain (MD) region towards the single-domain (SD) region on the Day-Dunlop plot is controlled by the oxidation of iron in the thermally induced process and the grain size of the new formed magnetite. The magnetic properties of indoor dust are a potential indicator of indoor air pollution. Elemental iron plays an important role in the development of inflammation in humans via oxidative stress, so that the presence of metallic Fe in indoor dust can affect human health.",

    "abstract": "This work uses passive samplers to identify PAHs and OPAHs not previously associated with artificial turf, and to provide the first quantitative measure of in situ flux of semi-volatile contaminants on artificial turf fields. Both air (1.5-m height) and turf air (immediately above turf surface) were sampled using two sampling materials: low-density polyethylene and silicone. Utilizing a broad targeted screen, we assess both artificial turf and samples of crumb rubber for over 1530 chemicals including pesticides, phthalates, and personal care products. We report the presence of 25 chemicals that have not yet been reported in artificial turf literature, including some with known human effects. The samplers were also quantitatively analyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons yielding gas-phase concentrations at breathing height and surface level—the first such report on an artificial turf outdoor field. Turf pore-air and air chemicals were highly correlated at all sites, and particularly at the recently installed indoor site. Flux of chemicals between air and turf surface appear to follow field age although more research is needed to confirm this trend. The thermal extraction process and silicone passive samplers used are suitable for larger-scale environmental sampling campaigns that aim for less solvent and sample processing. By co-deploying silicone passive samplers and conventional low-density polyethylene, partitioning coefficients are derived that can be used for future silicone passive air sampling environmental assessment. This study provides an initial demonstration that passive samplers can be used to quantify volatile and semi-volatile organic chemicals from artificial turf.",

    "abstract": "Despite the growing popularity of new alternatives to traditional tobacco products, there is still limited evidence on their indoor effect in particular in residential spaces as specific environments where enforcement of air quality standards is difficult. Hence, the impact of the Tobacco Heating System 2.2 (THS, marketed as IQOS®) on indoor air quality was assessed under controlled experimental conditions using ventilation representative of residential buildings with natural ventilation. Smoking of cigarettes (Marlboro Gold®) at the same ventilation conditions and consumption rates was used as positive control. Before each THS 2.2 or Marlboro Gold session, a background session with the same volunteers as for the product-use session was held. In the high-load simulated residential environment, out of the 24 measured airborne constituents, only the increase of the indoor concentrations of nicotine, acetaldehyde, and glycerin above the background was attributable to the use of THS 2.2. The quantified concentrations of these three airborne compounds were significantly below the harmful levels defined in the air quality guidelines. Smoking Marlboro Gold resulted in much greater increases in the concentrations of all measured indoor air constituents, except for glycerin, and the indoor concentrations of several constituents exceeded the exposure levels set forth by cognizant authorities. Based on these data, it is reasonable to conclude that the use of THS 2.2 in environments where norms for indoor exposure in terms of adequate ventilation are respected does not adversely affect the overall indoor air quality.",

    "abstract": "The study was conducted to establish whether an extremely high concentration of aerosols occurred in the region of the Gulf of Gdansk at the very end of 2016, and if so which factors determined it. This period was notable in terms of intensity of smog episodes across the rest of Poland. The main goal was to consider pollution sources affecting two nearby stations in the area, which is usually characterised by better air quality than other parts of the country. To achieve this, concentrations of PM1 and PM2.5 were studied in Gdynia and PM10 concentration was measured in Rumia from 22 December 2016 to 22 January 2017. Concentrations of OC, EC, PAHs and major ions were also examined in order to indicate the origin of pollutants. The average daily concentration ranged 6.0–50.0 μg·m−3 for PM1 and 8.3–61.9 μg·m−3 for PM2.5 in Gdynia, and 8.6–71.9 μg·m−3 for PM10 in Rumia. High concentrations of PM1 and PM2.5, classified as values higher than 25 μg·m−3, were noted 4 times. The 24-h limit value of PM10 was exceeded 3 times. Even though the highest aerosol concentration obtained in our results exceeded the limit value by 150%, it was nevertheless lower than in other Polish regions at the same time. This was due to dissimilar meteorological conditions, heavy snowfall and the landfall of Hurricane Barbara. However, high PAH concentrations in aerosols measured in Gdynia and Rumia indicate poor air conditions despite there being a relatively low average concentration of PM at the same time.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is an international concern, with risks linked to air pollutants. Fragranced consumer products, such as air fresheners and cleaning supplies, have been associated with health problems such as asthma attacks and breathing difficulties. This study investigates the health and societal effects of fragranced products on asthmatics in four countries: United States, Australia, United Kingdom, and Sweden. Nationally representative population surveys (n = 1137; 1098; 1100; 1100) found that, across the four countries, 26.0% of adults (n = 1151) are asthmatic, reporting medically diagnosed asthma (15.8%), an asthma-like condition (11.1%), or both. Among these asthmatics, 57.8% report adverse health effects, including asthma attacks (25.0%), respiratory problems (37.7%), and migraine headaches (22.6%), from exposure to fragranced products. In particular, 36.7% of asthmatics report health problems from air fresheners or deodorizers, 18.1% from the scent of laundry products coming from a dryer vent, 32.9% from being in a room cleaned with scented products, 38.7% from being near someone wearing a fragranced product, and 37.5% from other types of fragranced products. For 24.1% of asthmatics, health problems from fragranced products are potentially disabling. Further, 20.6% of asthmatics have lost workdays or lost a job, in the past year, due to fragranced product exposure in the workplace. Fragrance-free environments received widespread support. More than twice as many individuals, both asthmatics as well as non-asthmatics, would prefer that workplaces, health care facilities and professionals, airplanes, and hotels were fragrance-free rather than fragranced. This study provides evidence that asthmatics can be profoundly, adversely, and disproportionately affected by exposure to fragranced consumer products. Moreover, the study points to a relatively straightforward and cost-effective approach to reduce risks; namely, to reduce exposure to fragranced products.",

O 3max and T max as well as threshold exceedances of these variables were assessed under the constraints of ongoing climate change until the end of the twenty-first century. Under RCP8.5 scenario conditions, a substantial increase of T max in the months from April to September arose, with a mean value of 5 K in the period 2081–2100 compared with the historical period 1986–2005. Statistical downscaling projections pointed to a mean O 3max rise of 17 μg/m 3 . The frequency of threshold exceedances showed also large changes. Hot days may occur in the future at about 30% of all days. Exceedances of O 3max &gt; 100 μg/m 3 were projected to increase to about 40% of all days at urban traffic sites and up to about 70% in the rural regional background. Days with O 3max &gt; 120 μg/m 3 occurred still at about 20% of all days at urban traffic sites and at about 45% in rural regional background locations. With respect to combined T max &gt; 30 °C and O 3max &gt; 100 μg/m 3 events in the future, an occurrence of such events at about 27–29% of all days in the summer months from April to September was assessed. The increases were mainly associated with the strong temperature rise until the end of the century. In summary, the projected T max and O 3max changes point to a considerable increased health burden in Bavaria until the end of the century, resulting from strong changes of both variables and their associated individual and combined impact on human health.",

IAQ evaluation included analysis of physical (temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH)), chemical (CO 2 , CO, O 3 , total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), and particulate matter (PM)) and microbiological (fungi and bacteria) pollutants. Monitoring was carried out in labs used for teaching different academic disciplines (biology, chemical, ecology, and computers) during two periods of the academic year. Ventilation rates (VR), air change per hour (ACH) in every lab, and the hazard quotients for each of the chemical pollutants and the accumulated (HQ and HI) were calculated. Environmental comfort was not fully satisfactory considering the RH and CO 2 values, especially during hours with higher occupancy. Coarse particles and bacteria were generated indoor related to human activity. At chemical and biological laboratories, TVOC concentrations were sometimes above the recommended value, and all the labs presented VR below the European guideline’s recommendations. Results from this study show natural ventilation is not enough to get an adequate IAQ, although no significant non-carcinogenic risk was estimated. However, installation of complementary ventilation systems would be advisable to avoid health risk by acute short-term exposure. Graphical abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background Reducing the mortality burden associated with urban air pollution constitutes a public health priority, and evidence of unequal exposure and susceptibility across population subgroups is growing. Many European countries have implemented low emission zones (LEZs) in densely populated city centers. Although LEZs decrease air pollution exposure and health impacts, evidence is lacking on their impact across neighborhoods and socio-economic groups. Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the most equitable approach to implementing the second phase of the LEZ in Paris, France. We also present a literature review of the studies evaluating the benefits associated with LEZs in Europe. Methods A health impact assessment (HIA) was conducted to quantify changes in air pollution exposure and expected health benefits by socioeconomic group and neighborhood related to four hypothetical scenarios for the second phase of the LEZ based on French Deprivation Index scores. The study focused on NO 2 and PM 2.5 as air pollutants and evaluated the impact of the LEZ on the inequitable burden of childhood asthma and all-cause premature adult mortality. We also conducted an economic evaluation associated with the LEZ benefits on prevented deaths and asthma cases. Results The scenario with the largest LEZ perimeter and the most stringent vehicle standards prevented the highest number of cases and produced the most equitable distribution of health benefits, especially childhood asthma. It is expected that 810 deaths and 3200 cases of asthma could be prevented from the LEZ extension in this scenario. These results were distributed heterogeneously across three socioeconomic (SES) groups, most noticeably with asthma cases as 230, 180, and 210 cases were avoided per 100,000 inhabitants in high, medium, and low SES groups, respectively. We found substantial economic benefits associated with LEZ, with estimates ranging from €0.76 billion to €2.36 billion for prevented deaths. The benefits associated with asthma reduction ranged from €2.3 million to €8.3 million. Discussion Conducting HIAs with a focus on equity will further inform policy makers of the impact of LEZ models on air pollution, health, and environmental justice. Developing these systematic methods and applying them to future LEZs and other air pollution policies will increase their effectiveness to reduce the burden of ambient air pollution on society and the environment.",

    "abstract": "The intensified indoor living during the spring 2020 lockdown, with enhanced user awareness of the prevailing conditions in their homes, constituted a natural stress test for the housing design in place today. Surveys conducted during this period have yielded lessons for designing better intervention strategies for the residential sector, taking into account the systematic morphological and economic limitations of the buildings concerned. These considerations should inform the development of policies and strategies for improving environmental quality compatible with lower residential energy consumption and higher quality of life. This study explores the effect of occupant behaviour on home ventilation and the perception of the impact of indoor air quality on user health before and during lockdown. The method deployed consisted in monitoring environmental variables and conducting user surveys before and after restrictions came into force. The findings showed that prior to lockdown, occupants were unaware of or paid little heed to changes in indoor air quality, failed to perceive stuffiness, and, as a rule, reported symptoms or discomfort only at night during the summer months. During lockdown, however, users came to attach greater importance to air quality, and a greater sensitivity to odours and a heightened awareness of CO2 concentration prompted them to ventilate their homes more frequently. In the spring of 2020, occupants also indicated a wider spectrum of indisposition, in particular in connection with sleep patterns.",

    "abstract": "A radon survey was carried out in 18 high schools located in Tenerife Island when anti-pandemic strategies were used to reduce COVID-19 dissemination during 2021. High schools were located in radon-prone areas previously identified by the Spanish Nuclear Safety Council. Our results showed that 12 high schools presented radon activities lower than 100 Bq/m3, 5 high schools presented values in the range 100-200 Bq/m3, and only 1 high school presented radon activity concentration higher than 200 Bq/m3. Such values are below the reference level (300 Bq/m3) recommended by the Spanish legislation in the Basics Document of Health Standards (section HS6) of the Technical Building Code and the European Union directive (2013/59/EURATOM). Assuming an indoor occupancy time of about 1620 h per year, the annual dose contribution due to indoor radon exposure ranged from 0.07 to 1.18 mSv/year. Comparing such result against previous values reported in the literature on the island of Tenerife, we conclude that during the pandemic situation the indoor radon concentration (median valued) was reduced from 130.9 (2007) to 73.5 (2021) Bq/m3. Finally, continuous indoor radon concentration measurements were obtained to study short-time fluctuations (intra-day changes) under different ventilation conditions.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Cyprus is a typical eastern Mediterranean country that suffers from local emissions, transported anthropogenic pollution, and dust storms all year round. Therefore, exposures to PM in ambient and residential micro-environments are of great public health concern. Our study collected indoor and outdoor PM 2.5 and PM 10 samples simultaneously in 22 houses in Nicosia, Cyprus, during warm seasons and cold seasons from February 2019 to May 2021. Samples were analyzed for mass and constituents’ concentrations. To determine indoor and outdoor sources of PM in residential environments, we used the EPA positive matrix factorization (PMF) model to conduct source apportionment analyses for both indoor and outdoor PM 2.5 and PM 10 particles. Generally, six types of residential-level PM sources were resolved: biomass burning, traffic, local or regional secondary sulfate pollution, Ca-rich particles, sea salt, and soil dust. In the source apportionment of PM 2.5 , the main contribution to outdoor levels (33.1%) was associated with sulfate-rich transported pollution. The predominant contribution to indoor levels (48.0%) was attributed to secondary sulfate pollution as a mixture of local- and regional-scale pollutants. Biomass burning and traffic sources constituted the main outdoor sources of indoor PM 2.5 , while the Ca-rich particles were identified to almost originate from indoors. By contrast, the largest fraction (29.3%) of the ambient PM 10 and a smaller proportion (10.2%) of indoor PM 10 were attributed to Ca-rich particles. Indoor PM 10 was associated mainly with outdoor sources, except for the soil dust which originated from indoor activities.",

The first section delves into a performance analysis centered around modeling PM 10 , NOx, and CO emissions from a cement factory. It examines the effectiveness of various factors, including meteorological data, physics models, and air quality dispersion models, in producing accurate results for atmospheric simulations. The second section covers the dispersion direction and concentrations obtained by visualizing the dispersion maps. The third section covers an analysis of heavy metals emitted from the facility, taking into account potential risks in the region such as cancer, acute and chronic effects, and long-term respiratory risks. This study made use of meteorological models (WRF, AERMET, and CALMET), air quality dispersion models (AERMOD and CALPUFF), a health risk analysis model (HARP), and various sub-models (MMIF and CALWRF). Satellite meteorological data were obtained from NCEP and ERA, with the majority of meteorological data based on the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS)/Final Operational Global Analysis (FNL) from Global Tropospheric Analyses and Forecast Grids used for the WRF model. In the daily results, AERMOD showed the highest concentration values, but CALPUFF had greater concentrations throughout the annual period. The winter season had the highest concentrations of pollutants. Although there are differences among the physics models used in this research, the conclusions produced are consistent. Analysis of the data from the HARP model suggested that cancer risk levels exceeded the threshold of one person per million. However, the proportion of exceedance instances is rather small in comparison to the receptor points.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Climate change has become the centre of discussion among scholars and practitioners globally. This is believed to have severe consequences for the environment and human health, leading to significant implications for health financing. However, empirical investigations examining the climate change-health nexus remain scarce and underexplored. Hence, this study contributes to knowledge by exploring the direct and synergistic influence of renewable energy and climate change on health expenditure (i.e., national, public, private and external) in Africa. The study employs annual data from a panel of 47 African countries between 2006 and 2019, which are estimated using the generalised method of moments. Robustness checks are performed using alternative proxies for climate change and the Driscoll-Kraay estimation technique. The empirical outcomes reveal that high CO 2 emissions increase the various indices of health expenditure, implying environmental degradation triggers higher costs in health spending. The empirical results further show that renewable energy presents a negative and significant influence on health expenditure, showing that health expenditure decreases due to the adoption of renewable energy. Additionally, the study finds that renewable energy weakens the effect of carbon emissions on health spending, including public, private and external health expenditures. This implies that the severe impact of climate change on health expenditure is reduced through the intervening role of renewable energy sources. The study recommends that policymakers implement targeted policies towards reducing carbon emissions and increasing renewable energy consumption to improve health outcomes. Governments must also promote universal health coverage to ensure inclusive coverage as climate change becomes increasingly apparent.",

Despite its significance, individuals frequently struggle to assess the risks associated with polluted environments. This paper delves into the psychological mechanisms that contribute to the discrepancy between public perception of air quality and objective measurements. Through an extensive literature review spanning several decades, six fundamental heuristics that underpin misperceptions of air quality are identified and examined. The article further explores the theoretical and practical implications of acknowledging these biases in the development of urban environmental policies. By addressing judgmental biases, urban planners can improve the communication of risk information among lay people and ensure that environmental improvements are acknowledged and valued by all members of the community.",

    "abstract": "This paper forms the first part of an introduction to a synoptic weather typing approach to assess differential and combined impacts of extreme temperatures and air pollution on human mortality in south–central Canada, focusing on historical analysis (a companion paper—Part II focusing on future estimates). In this study, an automated synoptic weather typing procedure was used to identify weather types that have a marked association with high air pollution levels and temperature extremes, and facilitates assessments of the differential and combined health impacts of extreme temperatures and air pollution. Annual mean elevated mortality (when daily mortality exceeds the baseline) associated with extreme temperatures and acute exposures to air pollution, based on 1954–2000, was 1,082 [95% confidence interval (CI) of 1,017–1,147] for Montreal, 1,047 (CI 994–1,100) for Toronto, 462 (CI 438–486) for Ottawa, and 327 (CI 311–343) for Windsor. Of this annual mean elevated mortality, extreme temperatures are usually associated with roughly 20%, while air pollution is associated with the remaining 80%. Three pollutants (ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide) are associated with approximately 75% of total air pollution-related mortality across the study area. The remaining 25% is almost evenly associated with suspended particles and carbon monoxide, the other two pollutants addressed in this study. Of the five pollutants, ozone is most significantly associated with elevated mortality, making up one-third of the total air pollution-related mortality. PM2.5 and PM10 were not used as a measure of particulate in the study due to brief data records. The study results also suggest that, on the basis of daily mortality risks, extreme temperature-related weather presents a much greater risk to human health during heat waves and cold spells than air pollution. For example, in Montreal and Toronto, daily mean elevated mortality counts within the hottest weather type were twice as high as those within air pollution-related weather types.",

The objective of this study is to define the air quality during the Olympic Games; we conducted the observation of SO2, NO, CO, NO2, O3, and PM10 from August 7 to September 30 in 2007 in Beijing. The results showed that the average daily concentrations of SO2, NO2, CO, and PM10 during observation were 0.024, 0.072, 2.25, and 0.19 mg m−3, respectively. Compared with the National Ambient Air Quality Standard II, the concentrations of SO2 and CO in the observation were low, the concentration of NO2 basically satisfied the National Ambient Air Quality Standard II, and the concentrations of O3 and PM10 were much higher than the values of the standard. The characteristics of diurnal variation of NO, NO2, CO, and PM10 were similar, and the lower concentrations of these pollutants were observed by day and the higher concentrations at night. The concentration of SO2 in the daytime was a little higher than that at night. The highest 1-h concentration of O3 occurred at 14:00 local time.",

Personal exposure was evaluated using personal samplers during working shifts. DNA adducts were analyzed in lymphocytes by the (32)P-postlabeling assay and chromosomal aberrations were analyzed by conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The impact of environmental pollution on DNA adducts and chromosomal aberrations was studied in a total of 950 subjects. Our results suggest that the environmental exposure of nonsmokers to concentrations higher than 1 ng benzo[a]pyrene/m(3) represents a risk of DNA damage, as indicated by an increase in DNA adducts and the genomic frequency of translocations determined by FISH.",

Exposure to fragranced emissions from laundry products has been associated with adverse health effects such as asthma attacks and migraine headaches. Little is known about volatile emissions from clothes dryer vents and the effectiveness of strategies to reduce concentrations and risks. This study investigates volatile emissions from six residential dryer vents, with a focus on d-limonene. It analyses and compares concentrations of d-limonene during use of fragranced and fragrance-free laundry products, as well as changes in switching from fragranced to fragrance-free products. In households using fragranced laundry detergent, the highest concentration of d-limonene from a dryer vent was 118 μg/m3 (mean 33.34 μg/m3). By contrast, in households using only fragrance-free detergent, the highest concentration of d-limonene from a dryer vent was 0.26 μg/m3 (mean 0.25 μg/m3). After households using fragranced detergent switched to using fragrance-free detergent, the concentrations of d-limonene in dryer vent emissions were reduced by up to 99.7% (mean 79.1%). This simple strategy of switching to fragrance-free products significantly and almost completely eliminated d-limonene emissions. Results from this study demonstrate that changing from fragranced to fragrance-free products can be a straightforward and effective approach to reduce ambient air pollution and potential health risks.",

    "abstract": "Regional and local authorities have the obligation to design air quality plans and assess their impacts when concentration levels exceed the limit values. Because these limit values cover both short- (day) and long-term (year) effects, air quality plans also follow these two formats. In this work, we propose a methodology to analyze modeled air quality forecast results, looking at emission reduction for different sectors (residential, transport, agriculture, etc.) with the aim of supporting policy makers in assessing the impact of short-term action plans. Regarding PM10, results highlight the diversity of responses across European cities, in terms of magnitude and type that raises the necessity of designing area-specific air quality plans. Action plans extended from 1 to 3 days (i.e., emissions reductions applied for 24 and 72 h, respectively) point to the added value of trans-city coordinated actions. The largest benefits are seen in central Europe (Vienna, Prague) while major cities (e.g., Paris) already solve a large part of the problem on their own. Eastern Europe would particularly benefit from plans based on emission reduction in the residential sectors; while in northern cities, agriculture seems to be the key sector on which to focus attention. Transport is playing a key role in most cities whereas the impact of industry is limited to a few cities in south-eastern Europe. For NO2, short-term action plans focusing on traffic emission reductions are efficient in all cities. This is due to the local character of this type of pollution. It is important, however, to stress that these results remain dependent on the selected months available for this study.",

The models were developed using historical data from the period 1992–2016, for a set of 20 European countries. The subject of the analysis included the input variables of the following air pollutants: sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, particulate matters, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and non-methane volatile organic compounds. Our main findings indicate that all the variables significantly affect life expectancy. Sensitivity of constructed neural networks to pollutants proved to be particularly important in the case of changes in the value of particulate matters, sulphur oxides and non-methane volatile organic compounds. The most frequent association was found for fine particle. Modelled courses of changes in the variable under study coincide with the actual data, which confirms that the proposed models generalize acquired knowledge well.",

Based on the data obtained from the air quality monitoring station for the year 2019 and the first quarter of the year 2020, it was possible to develop an ANN model to simulate and predict the concentrations of three air pollutants, namely nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter with diameter less than 10 μm (PM10). Several ANN model configurations were tested to select the best model that could predict the concentration of the three air pollutants with meteorological parameters being used as input to the model. The results showed that the concentration of the pollutants during the coronavirus lockdown was declined by various percentages (from 29% for PM10 to 72% for NO2) as compared to their concentration before the pandemic period. Furthermore, the developed ANN model could simulate and predict the concentration of the pollutants during the pandemic period with sufficient accuracy as judged by the values of the coefficient of determination and the mean square error. The study results indicate that properly trained and structured ANN can be a useful tool to predict air quality parameters with adequate accuracy.",

Mass and number concentrations of aerosols were measured before, during, and after the 2016/2017 New Year event in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Our findings highlight the negative impact of fireworks on the environment. First, both the mass concentration of black carbon and the number of concentrations of nanoparticles between 80 and 150 nm increased shortly after midnight. Second, on Jan 1, 2017, there was an increase in the average daily mass concentrations of PM 10 and PM 2.5 . Third, on this day, our devices also detected increased air pollution by Al, Ba, Sr, and Cu, that is, heavy metals usually associated with fireworks. Their Jan 1 mass concentrations were more than 10 times (and Sr more than 140 times) higher than their average daily mass concentrations from Jan 3 (when their mass concentrations returned to more normal levels) to Jan 31. We also found that pairwise correlations between nanoparticles, PM 10 , and black carbon are positive, strong, and statistically significant.

    "abstract": "Abstract Mercury is a toxic pollutant that exists in the atmosphere in several forms, operationally identified according to their chemical and physical characteristics. The problem of atmospheric mercury pollution has recently received increasing attention, as evidenced by the numerous European regulations issued in the last years. The normative question is closely related to the methodological one, as the quantification of the mercury species is strictly linked to the sampling and analysis methods. Due to their different bioavailability, airborne mercury forms detection is fundamental both in outdoor and indoor (i.e., workplace) environments. This paper presents an overview of European legislation on atmospheric mercury pollution, with particular attention to the Italian legislation. Starting from the regulatory protocols, the methodological framework for mercury quantification was reviewed, underlining the limits and the problems of the different methodologies and providing new guidance for the analysis. Regulatory and methodological updates have led to great specificity in mercury quantification, which is distinguished for the outdoor and indoor environments. For workplace environments, all mercury species (i.e., gaseous and particulate mercury) are required to be quantified by the Italian legislation; on the contrary, only gaseous compounds are monitored in outdoor conditions. It hence appears of primary importance that the monitoring operator chooses the sampling and analytical method for mercury sampling and analysis that correctly adheres to the normative regulations. Detailed norms describe how to carry on the monitoring in both outdoor and indoor conditions, preventing the operator’s arbitrariness, which otherwise can lead to airborne mercury underestimation/overestimation.",

The particulate matter data (PM 2.5 ) was obtained using a low-cost air quality sensor. During the wet season of 2020 (Jan–May), PM 2.5 average concentrations were 6 ± 2 μg m −3 while during the dry season of 2020 (July–Nov), PM 2.5 average concentrations were 16 ± 3 μg m −3 in Guayaquil. The most prominent plumes occurred on September 20th of 2020, a month with no rain but high wind speeds created by the Andes Mountain topography to the coast. During this event, PM 2.5 concentrations started at 12:00 UTC-5 in a volcanic plume event that lasted 4 h with a maximum peak of 133 + 40 μg m −3 . Electron microscopy of selected samples showed that the ashes of the three eruptions may differ in size and morphology. EDX analysis reveals that the ash contains certain elements—C, Si, Na, Mg, Al, Ca, S, and Fe—in similar proportions. In summary, this study remarks on the meteorological role and the long-range transport of Sangay volcanic ashes.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies document increased health risks from exposure to traffic and traffic-related particulate matter (PM). However, many studies use simple exposure metrics to represent traffic-related PM, and/or are limited to small geographic areas over relatively short (e.g., 1 year) time periods. We developed a modeling approach for the conterminous US from 1999 to 2011 that applies a line-source Gaussian plume dispersion model using several spatially and/or temporally varying inputs (including daily meteorology) to produce high spatial resolution estimates of primary near-road traffic-related PM levels. We compared two methods of spatially averaging traffic counts: spatial smoothing generalized additive models and kernel density. Also, we evaluated and validated the output from the line-source dispersion modeling approach in a spatio-temporal model of 24-h average PM < 2.5 μm (PM2.5) elemental carbon (EC) levels. We found that spatial smoothing of traffic count point data performed better than a kernel density approach. Predictive accuracy of the spatio-temporal model of PM2.5 EC levels was moderate for 24-h averages (cross-validation (CV) R2 = 0.532) and higher for longer averaging times (CV R2 = 0.707 and 0.795 for monthly and annual averages, respectively). PM2.5 EC levels increased monotonically with line-source dispersion model output. Predictive accuracy was higher when the spatio-temporal model of PM2.5 EC included line-source dispersion model output compared to distance to road terms. Our approach provides estimates of primary traffic-related PM levels with high spatial resolution across the conterminous US from 1999 to 2011. Spatio-temporal model predictions describe 24-h average PM2.5 EC levels at unmeasured locations well, especially over longer averaging times.",

    "abstract": "To overcome limitations of existing air-cleaning filters in capturing and deactivating aerosolized microorganisms, this study was embarked to evaluate novel Ag, Zn, and Fe nanoparticle-doped cotton filters (AgCt, ZnCt, FeCt), as biocidal filters for bioaerosol attenuation. To evaluate the biocidal activity of the nanocomposite filters, the survival of lab-generated E. coli after collection on each filter material was compared to collection on an undoped cotton control filter and in a BioSampler. Relative humidity (RH) affected the survival of bacteria on the filters, and the optimal RH was found to be 50 ± 5%. The physical removal efficiency (PRE) determined by an optical particle counter was 99.9 ± 0.7% for ZnCt, 97.4 ± 1.2% for AgCt, and 97.3 ± 0.6% for FeCt, where the control showed only 77.4 ± 6.3% for particles > 500 nm. The doped filters showed 100% viable removal efficiency (VRE). Importantly, the VRE of the nanocomposite filters after four cycles remained nearly 99% and was greater than the cotton control filter at 76.6 ± 3.2%. Adding to its benefits, the AgCt filters had a lower pressure drop than the FeCt and ZnCt filters and the cotton control. The permeability for the cotton control filter was 3.38 × 10-11 m2 while that for the AgCt filter was slightly higher (3.64 × 10-11 m2) than the other filters as well. Overall, these results suggest that nanocomposite-doped filter media, particularly AgCt, can provide effective protection against airborne pathogens with a lower pressure drop, elevated collection efficiency, and better disinfection capability as compared to untreated cotton filters, which are all important features for practical biocidal applications.

    "abstract": "Abstract Indoor air pollution is increasingly recognized as a significant risk for respiratory illness, particularly in vulnerable populations. Thirty-six children aged 6–14 years with moderate/severe asthma from inner city areas in New York City were studied for 2-week periods (summer and winter) using diaries and spirometry. Seven-day integrated indoor samples of PM 10 , PM 2.5 , trace elements, elemental/organic carbon, black carbon, and criteria gases (NO 2 , SO 2 , and O 3 ) were collected in the subjects’ residences. Asthma outcomes included cough and wheeze severity, albuterol use, and pulmonary function. Mixed effects regression models for longitudinal data were used to relate weekly indoor pollutant concentrations to asthma outcomes. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for ordinal outcomes. During winter, significant positive associations for average weekly symptom severity scores were seen for NO 2 (OR = 2.83; p = 0.02), calcium (OR = 3.29; p = 0.02), and silicon (OR = 3.64; p = 0.04). In summer, chlorine was associated with average weekly symptom scores (OR = 1.85; p = 0.004). Average albuterol puff use per day in winter was associated with NO 2 (OR = 5.89; p = 0.009), nickel (OR = 2.27; p = 0.05), and silicon (OR = 5.59; p = 0.05). Albuterol use was not associated with indoor pollutants in summer. Asthma severity was associated with specific indoor pollutants. Seasonal differences were observed by pollutant and by clinical index studied.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) including black carbon (BC), methane (CH 4 ), and tropospheric ozone (O 3 ) are major climate forcers after carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). These SLCPs also have detrimental impacts on human health and agriculture. Studies show that the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region, which includes Nepal, has been experiencing the impacts of these pollutants in addition to greenhouse gases. In this study, we derive a national-level emission inventory for SLCPs, CO 2 , and air pollutants for Nepal and project their impacts under reference (REF) and mitigation policy (POL) scenarios. The impacts on human health, agriculture, and climate were then estimated by applying the following: (1) adjoint coefficients from the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS)-chemical transport model that quantify the sensitivity of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) and surface O 3 concentrations in Nepal, and radiative forcing in four latitudinal bands, to emissions in 2 × 2.5° grids, and (2) concentration–response functions to estimate health and crop loss impacts in Nepal. With the mitigating measures undertaken, emission reductions of about 78% each of BC and CH 4 and 87% of PM 2.5 could be achieved in 2050 compared with the REF scenario. This would lead to an estimated avoidance of 29,000 lives lost and 1.7 million tonnes of crop loss while bringing an economic benefit in present value of 2.7 times more than the total cost incurred in its implementation during the whole period 2010–2050. The results provide useful policy insights and pathways for evidence-based decision-making in the design and effective implementation of SLCP mitigation measures in Nepal.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Sex differences in the impact of exposure to air pollution have been reported previously and epidemiological studies indicate that fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) effects on nonaccidental death are modified by sex; however, the results are not conclusive. To introduce a new method incorporating the monotone nonlinear relationship between PM 2.5 and deaths to reveal the sex difference in the relationship, we illustrated the use of the constrained generalized additive model (CGAM) to investigate the sex difference in the effects of PM 2.5 on nonaccidental deaths in Shanghai, China. Information on daily non-accidental deaths, air pollution, meteorological data, and smoking prevalence between 1 January 2012 and 31 December 2014 was obtained in Shanghai. The CGAM was used to assess the association of interaction between sex and daily PM 2.5 concentrations with daily nonaccidental deaths, adjusting for weather type and smoking rate. A 2-week lag analysis was conducted as a sensitivity analysis. During the study period, the total number of non-accidental deaths in Shanghai was 336,379, with a daily mean of 163 deaths and 144 deaths for men and women, respectively. The average daily concentration of PM 2.5 in Shanghai was 55.0 μg/m 3 during the same time period. Women showed a lower risk for non-accidental death (risk ratio (RR) = 0.892, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.802–0.993). Compared with men, the risk for nonaccidental death in relation to increasing PM 2.5 concentration was smaller in women (RR = 0.998, 95% CI: 0.996–1.000, per 10 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 concentration. The difference is consistent during the two lag weeks and more obvious when adjusting for the interaction between PM 2.5 concentration and smoking prevalence. The effects of PM 2.5 on daily nonaccidental death are different between men and women in Shanghai, China, and women tend to have a lower risk. The underlying mechanisms of the sex difference of PM 2.5 effects on death need further investigation. The method displayed in the manuscript can be used for other environmental stressors as well.",

Furthermore, there has been no research in Northern Europe on cold-associated morbidity. Therefore, this study investigated the associations of daily wintertime temperature and cold spells with cardiorespiratory hospital admissions in the Helsinki metropolitan area, Finland. Daily number of non-elective hospital admissions for 2001–2017 was obtained from the national hospital discharge register and meteorological data from the Finnish Meteorological Institute. Quasi-Poisson regression models were fitted, controlling for potential confounders such as time trend, weekday, holidays, air pollution, barometric pressure, and influenza. The associations of cold season daily mean ambient temperature and cold spells with hospital admissions were estimated using a penalized distributed lag linear models with 21 lag days. Decreased wintertime ambient temperature was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for myocardial infarction in the whole population (relative risk [RR] per 1 °C decrease in temperature: 1.017, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.002–1.032). An increased risk of hospital admission for respiratory diseases (RR: 1.012, 95% CI: 1.002, 1.022) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR: 1.031, 95% CI: 1.006, 1.056) was observed only in the ≥ 75 years age group. There was an independent effect of cold spell days only for asthma admissions (RR: 2.348, 95% CI: 1.026, 5.372) in the all-ages group. Cold temperature increases the need for acute hospital care due to myocardial infarction and respiratory causes during winter in a northern climate.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In a general framework characterized by ever-increasing evidence of impacts attributable to climate change, the quantitative estimation of wildfire emissions (e.g., black carbon, carbon monoxide, particulate matter) and the evaluation of its uncertainty are crucial for mitigation and adaptation purposes. Global atmospheric emission models use mainly remote sensing fire datasets, which are affected by significant uncertainties. To assess the errors of remote sensing-based inventories, we compared the temporal and spatial behavior of the last version of the satellite-based Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED4s) with a more accurate ground-based wildfire emissions inventory, for the 2008–2016 period. The study area was Calabria (southern Italy), among the Italian regions with the highest contribution to national wildfire emissions. This study highlights a reliable agreement of time evolution of Burned Areas ( R 2 = 0.87), but an overestimation of their extent by satellite compared to ground observations (approximately + 18%). Nevertheless, satellite data systematically underestimated Dry Matter and emissions by forest and grassland wildfires (ranging between -66% and -97%). Furthermore, detailed information on land cover allowed assessing the vegetation parameters uncertainties on ground-based emission inventory. The Mass Available Fuel values, which are constantly modified by wildfires, and land use changes, and not frequently updated, showed not to affect the emission estimations. Finally, the relationship between ground-based and remote sensing-based inventories for the analyzed period highlighted that the preliminary satellite emissions related to 2017–2019 require careful validation before any applications.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Air pollution is a significant health threat around the world. Young children are a more vulnerable population. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and World Health Organizations (WHO) guidelines may not adequately protect them. Given children’s rapid growth, it is important to review studies, consider the weight of evidence, and identify knowledge gaps. Our purpose was to conduct a systematic literature review of epidemiological studies of adverse health outcomes not previously considered; specifically, we reviewed evidence for traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) CO, NO 2 , SO 2 , O 3 , PM 10 , and PM 2.5 in children ≤ 5 years in age, with special attention to adverse effects occurring within current air pollutant guidelines. Data sources are electronic search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar. Articles on air pollutants and additional health outcomes in children (0–5 years), between Jan. 1997 and Dec. 2018. Search included terms such as “air pollution, children, and adverse effects”. Fifty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Seven (7) health outcome categories were identified: respiratory diseases; developmental disorders; allergies, eczema, and allergic rhinitis; ear infections; cancer; obesity; and others, with greatest associations for respiratory and developmental disorders. Strongest findings were for NO 2 , O 3 , PM 10 , and PM 2.5, and most health effects reviewed occurred within WHO limits. Our findings are pertinent for health professionals, researchers, government officials, and others to collaboratively support policy efforts toward exposure reductions for pregnant women and children to prevent acute and chronic diseases. This is critical for building a culture of health and ensuring health equity for vulnerable populations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Although it is a growing area of investigation in the Global Dust Belt, only a few population-level studies have evaluated the human health associations of windblown dust in North America. We investigated whether acute, short-term dust exposures (DE), in Lubbock, Texas (a medium-sized, dust-prone city in the southern Great Plains, USA) were associated with significant increases in hospitalizations on the day of the exposure and up to 7 days afterward. We used the distributed lag non-linear models in time series analysis to describe non-linear relationship between response outcomes and the delayed effects of exposure over time. We found that increased relative risks of hospitalizations for multiple conditions were associated with the two DE approaches that occurred between 2010 and 2014. Consistent with prior studies of dust health effects in other cities in North America, we identified increased hospitalization risks in Lubbock due to neurodegenerative, atherosclerosis, renal, respiratory, asthma, mental, stroke, neoplasms, ischemia, hematologic, musculoskeletal, and associated diseases (aggregation of all causes each associated with at least 5% of hospitalizations) at various dust exposure days. Associations were modified by age, gender, day of the week, and holiday effects. As climate change increases water stresses on dryland agriculture and long periods of drought, dust exposures are likely to increase for residents of dryland cities and with it the likelihood of adverse health effects on people with preexisting conditions. Additional investigations are needed for other dust-prone population centers worldwide to document the health effects of dust exposures and investigate their causes.",

    "abstract": "Accountability of air quality management is often measured by tracking ambient pollution concentrations over time. These changes in ambient air quality are rarely linked to changes in public health, a major driver for such programs. We propose a method to assess the accountability of air quality management programs with respect to improvements in public health by estimating national temporal trends in health risk attributable to air pollution. The air health indicator (AHI) is a function of two temporal functions, annual air pollutant concentrations and annual estimates of health risk obtained by time series statistical methods, to indicate the trend in annual percent attributable risk (the product of concentration and risk times 100). Random effects models are used to obtain a distribution of risk over space. The model is illustrated by examining the association between daily nonaccidental deaths in 24 of Canada's largest cities and daily concentrations of ozone and nitrogen dioxide over the 17-year period 1984–2000. Our analysis demonstrates that examining trends in exposure alone, which has typically been the approach to air quality indicators, provides an incomplete picture of trends in the impact of air pollution. The AHI appears to provide a more informative measure of the population burden of illness associated with air pollution over time.",

The observed atmospheric effects of the eclipse are presented. It was found that from the onset of the eclipse, solar radiation was reduced by as much as 88.1 ∼ 89.9% at the present research centre. Also, during the eclipse, air temperature decreased slightly or remained almost unchanged. After the eclipse, however, it rose by 2.5 to 4.5°C at observed stations. Meanwhile, relative humidity increased and wind speeds were lowered by the eclipse. Ground-level ozone was observed to decrease during the event.",

    "abstract": "In recent years urban photochemical episodes accompanied by unusually high ozone concentrations have been observed in the urban area of Hong Kong every autumn season except 2003. These episodes always occurred in summer time since 1990, but starting in 2000 additional autumn episodes could be observed. During those episodes the ozone concentrations exceeded the Hong Kong Air Quality Objective and reached an hourly maximum of 332 µg m−3 in September 2005. The maximum ozone concentrations of both summer and autumn episodes seem to be on an upward trend. It is the objective of this paper to examine a possible role of the air temperature factor in the emergence of ozone episodes in autumn. Significant correlations could be found between the maximum hourly ozone concentrations and the maximum and mean air temperatures during autumn months whereas the association between ozone and particulates is weaker. Autumn air temperature data from the Hong Kong Observatory headquarters and two ozone monitoring sites had been compared for the period from 1989 to 2007. This analysis takes into account the ozone trend and the unfavorable conditions posed by decreasing solar radiation and increasing cloud cover. Mean temperatures for October and November at the Hong Kong Observatory headquarters as well as two ozone monitoring sites (Sha Tin and Tai Po) show a slightly upward trend for the period under investigation. The September values, however, show a slight negative slope. The overall upward trend for air temperatures in autumn occurs at a time when the mean air temperatures in Hong Kong have been on the rise for over 120 years from 1885 to 2007, amidst the global warming trend. It is believed that the air temperature increase may have contributed to the emergence of urban ozone episodes in autumn in Hong Kong in 2000. Related to this influence of air temperature on ozone are high background pollutant concentrations in Hong Kong, as indicated by the minimum PM10 concentrations and the serious NO2 pollution dominating the Pearl River Delta region.",

Different epidemiological models may lead to very different conclusions for the same set of data. Thus, evaluation of the assumptions made and sensitivity analysis are necessary. Short-term health impact indicators may be calculated using concentration–response (C-R) functions. We discuss different methods to combine C-R function estimates from a given locale and time period with the larger body of evidence from other locales and periods and with the literature. A shrunken method is recommended to combine C-R function estimates from multiple locales. This shrunken estimate includes information from the overall and the local estimates, and thus, it characterizes the estimated excess of risk due to heterogeneity between the different locations.",

    "abstract": "Continuous and simultaneous observational particulate matter (measured as PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) data were captured at a kerbside site alongside a major highway in Auckland, New Zealand, and at a pair of setback sites within 250 m of the highway, day and night over 8 weeks. The three measurement sites were intended to allow emissions from the highway to be largely isolated from other sources. By filtering the data and subtracting upwind concentrations, the average roadside increment was calculated to be 1.8, 7.2 and 101.4 μg m-3 for PM10, NO2 and NOx, respectively, relative to a predominantly upwind setback site, and -0.1, 9.4 and 98.5 μg m-3 for PM10, NO2 and NOx, respectively, relative to a downwind setback site. The negative value for PM10 was attributed to local evening heating sources impacting the setback site. On days when peak 24 h PM10 concentrations were observed, the absolute kerbside increment was 2.1 μg m-3. The absolute roadside 24 h average PM10 increment varied diurnally, peaking (on average) at 2.4 μg m-3 during peak traffic hours. The largest observed 24-h average PM10 roadside increment was 6.9 μg m-3 and exceeded 5 μg m-3 on nine occasions. On each of these occasions, the daily mean wind speed was less than 2 m s-1. The diurnally averaged difference in NOx concentrations between the kerbside site and the setback sites clearly resembled the diurnal cycle in traffic volume, and peaked during the morning traffic peak at around 180 μg m-3. Background NOx concentrations were slightly higher in our study compared to a similar study in Las Vegas but absolute roadside concentrations were higher. This may be consistent with higher NOx emission factors in Auckland, but differences in the precise distance of the monitor from the road lanes and differences in meteorology need to be considered.",

    "abstract": "Here, we report the first results of model sensitivity simulations to assess the potential impacts of emissions related to future activities linked to unconventional hydrocarbon extraction (fracking) in the UK on air pollution and human health. These simulations were performed with the Met Office Air Quality in the Unified Model, a new air quality-forecasting model, and included a wide range of extra emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) to reflect emissions from the full life cycle of fracking-related activities and simulate the impacts of these compounds on levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3). These model simulations highlight that increases in NOx and VOC emissions associated with unconventional hydrocarbon extraction could lead to large local increases in the monthly means of daily 1-h maximum NO2 of up to + 30 ppb and decreases in the maximum daily 8-h mean O3 up to − 6 ppb in the summertime. Broadly speaking, our simulations indicate increases in both of these compounds across the UK air shed throughout the year. Changes in the 1-h maximum of NO2 and 8-h mean of O3 are particularly important for their human health impacts. These respective changes in NO2 and O3 would contribute to approximately 110 (range 50–530) extra premature-deaths a year across the UK based on the use of recently reported concentration response functions for changes in annual average NO2 and O3 exposure. As such, we conclude that the release of emissions of VOCs and NOx be highly controlled to prevent deleterious health impacts.",

    "abstract": "To curb the spread of the coronavirus, China implemented lockdown policies on January 23, 2020. The resulting extreme changes in human behavior may have influenced the air pollutants concentration. However, despite these changes, hazy weather persisted in Shanghai and became a public issue. This study aims to investigate air pollutant mass concentration changes during the lockdown in Shanghai. Air pollutant mass concentration data and meteorological data during the pre-lockdown period and the level I response lockdown period were analyzed by statistical analysis and a Lagrangian particle diffusion model. The data was classified in three periods: P1 (pre-lockdown: 10 days before the Spring Festival), P2 (the first 10 days after lockdown: during the Spring Festival celebration), and P3 (the second 10 days after lockdown: after the Spring Festival). Data for the same period in 2019 were used as a reference. The results indicate that the Spring Festival holiday in 2019 resulted in a reduction in energy consumption, which led to a decrease in PM2.5 (26.4%) and NO2 (43.41%) mass concentration, but an increase in ozone mass concentration (31.39%) in P2 compared with P1. The integrated effect of the Spring Festival holiday and lockdown in 2020 resulted in a decrease in PM2.5 (36.5%) and NO2 (51.9%) mass concentrations, but an increase in ozone mass concentration (43.8%) in P2 compared with P1. After the Spring Festival, the mass concentrations of PM2.5, SO2, and NO2 increased by 74.41%, 5.52%, and 53.28%, respectively in P3 compared with P2 in 2019. However, PM2.5 and SO2 concentrations in 2020 continued to decrease, by 14.74% and 4.61%, respectively, while NO2 mass concentration increased by 7.82% in P3 compared with P2. We also found that PM2.5 mass concentration is susceptible to regional transmission from the surrounding cities. PM2.5 and other gaseous pollutants show different correlations in different periods, while NO2 and O3 always show a strong negative correlation. The principal components before the Spring Festival in 2019 were O3 and NO2, and after the Spring Festival, they were PM2.5 and CO, while the principal components before the lockdown in 2020 were PM2.5 and CO, and during lockdown they were O3 and NO2.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Statistical models to evaluate the relationships between large-scale meteorological conditions, prevailing air pollution levels and combined ozone and temperature events, were developed during the 1993–2012 period with Central Europe as regional focus. Combined ozone and temperature events were defined based on the high frequency of coinciding, health-relevant elevated levels of daily maximum tropospheric ozone concentrations (based on running 8-h means) and daily maximum temperature values in the peak ozone and temperature season from April to September. By applying two different modeling approaches based on lasso, logistic regression, and multiple linear regression mean air temperatures at 850 hPa, ozone persistence, surface thermal radiation, geopotential heights at 850 hPa, meridional winds at 500 hPa, and relative humidity at 500 hPa were identified as main drivers of combined ozone and temperature events. Statistical downscaling projections until the end of the twenty-first century were assessed by using the output of seven models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Potential frequency shifts were evaluated by comparing the mid- (2031–2050) and late-century (2081–2100) time windows to the base period (1993–2012). A sharp increase of ozone-temperature events was projected under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario assumptions with respective multi-model mean changes of 8.94% and 16.84% as well as 13.33% and 37.52% for mid- and late-century European climate.",

The smog episodes were characterized by the high concentration of PM 10 , and were linked to a thermal inversion period in November 2011 in Hungary, when an anticyclone occurred across Europe. The sources of PM 2.5 and PM coarse were identified by positive matrix factorization (PMF). Additionally, the source locations were explored by using the conditional probability function (CPF). A numerical weather prediction model (WRF) was also applied to evaluate the air pollution situation. In order to meet the goals of the study, the elemental composition with high (2-h) time resolution, the elemental size distribution, and the planetary boundary layer were examined in an urban background site of downtown Debrecen, Hungary. Our results highlight the importance of biomass burning (39%) and traffic (31%) as the major contributors to PM 2.5 . The main tracers of these sources (K, Cl, Pb, Zn) appeared mainly in droplet mode (0.5–1 μm). The major sources of PM coarse fraction were soil (32%), and dust attributed to tramline construction (30%). The combination of PMF and CPF results revealed that the PM 10 concentrations were affected by sources within the urban agglomeration of Debrecen (city centre and suburban areas) under the given meteorological conditions. This conclusion is further validated by the fact that the diurnal variation of the identified source contributions presented a distinct pattern that depended strongly on the daily activities of the city’s residents (compared to the usually unstructured diurnals of transported sources).",

This study aims to assess air quality during this partial lockdown through O3, CO, and PM10 concentrations and meteorological data collected in five air quality monitoring stations spread over the whole city, considering the substantial changes in city routine. The period evaluated starts in March 2020, when the partial lockdown was decreed, and ends in September 2020, when economic opening ended. Compared with 2019 data, CO concentration reduced significantly, as expected since the main source of these pollutants is vehicular traffic. O3 concentration increased, most probably as a consequence of the reduction in primary pollutants. On the other hand, PM10 concentration did not vary significantly. From June to September, pollutant concentrations increased responding to the economic opening. Thereby, the partial lockdown contributed to improving air quality in Rio de Janeiro City, which means that changes in work format may be an alternative to reduce atmospheric pollution in big cities, since home office contributes to mobility reductions, and consequently to vehicular emissions.• Lockdown contributed to CO reduction and O3 increase.• Differences on rain profile explain low variation on PM10 concentrations.• Lockdown has been like a very long weekend concerning atmospheric pollution.• Home office and distance learning improve air quality.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11869-021-01127-2.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Adverse impacts of air pollution on human health have been well documented in Spain; however, very few have been conducted in the Spanish region of Castilla-La Mancha (CLM). CLM is an extensive region with a low population density, little industrial production, and moderate air pollution level. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between the risk of hospital admission for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and exposure to PM 2.5 , PM 10 , and NO 2 in CLM during 2006–2015. Daily air pollution concentration, temperature, and relative humidity were monitored from the air quality monitoring stations in CLM. A time-series analysis with generalized linear model was used to examine the effects of air pollution on hospital admissions by controlling for long-term trend and other potential confounders. The effect modifications by sex and age (15–64; ≥ 65 years) were examined. Lagging exposure concept was used to analyze a possible latency period in cumulative exposure-pollution analyses. Relative risks (RR) of CVD admissions at the same day (lag 0) and to 7 days after exposure (lag 7) were calculated. Relative risks of CVD admissions (for an increase of 10 µg m −3 in concentration of air pollutant) were calculated. The elderly group (≥ 65 years) were the most susceptible group to the effect of air pollution, whereas the estimated effect by sex was significantly different depending on the age group. The potential utility of these results may help for syndromic surveillance during future similar air pollutant concentrations, where an increase in the use of health services among the vulnerable groups could be unexpected by the emergency department.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The health impacts associated with exposure to elevated concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) are well recognised. There is a substantial number of studies characterising PM 2.5 concentrations outdoors, as well as in homes within low- and middle-income countries. In high-income countries (HICs), there is a sizeable literature on indoor PM 2.5 relating to smoking, but the evidence on exposure to PM 2.5 generated from non-tobacco sources in homes is sparse. This is especially relevant as people living in HICs spend the majority of their time at home, and in the northern hemisphere households often have low air exchange rates for energy efficiency. This review identified 49 studies that described indoor PM 2.5 concentrations generated from a variety of common household sources in real-life home settings in HICs. These included wood/solid fuel burning appliances, cooking, candles, incense, cleaning and humidifiers. The reported concentrations varied widely, both between sources and within groups of the same source. The burning of solid fuels was found to generate the highest indoor PM 2.5 concentrations. On occasion, other sources were also reported to be responsible for high PM 2.5 concentrations; however, this was only in a few select examples. This review also highlights the many inconsistencies in the ways data are collected and reported. The variable methods of measurement and reporting make comparison and interpretation of data difficult. There is a need for standardisation of methods and agreed contextual data to make household PM 2.5 data more useful in epidemiological studies and aid comparison of the impact of different interventions and policies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) is associated with adverse health effects, including mortality, even at low concentrations. Rail conveyance of coal, accounting for one-third of American rail freight tonnage, is a source of PM 2.5 . However, there are limited studies of its contribution to PM 2.5 , especially in urban settings where residents experience higher exposure and vulnerability to air pollution. We developed a novel artificial intelligence-driven monitoring system to quantify average and maximum PM 2.5 concentrations of full and empty (unloaded) coal trains compared to freight and passenger trains. The monitor was close to the train tracks in Richmond, California, a city with a racially diverse population of 115,000 and high rates of asthma and heart disease. We used multiple linear regression models controlling for diurnal patterns and meteorology. The results indicate coal trains add on average 8.32 µg/m 3 (95% CI = 6.37, 10.28; p &lt; 0.01) to ambient PM 2.5 , while sensitivity analysis produced midpoints ranging from 5 to 12 µg/m 3 . Coal trains contributed 2 to 3 µg/m 3 more of PM 2.5 than freight trains, and 7 µg/m 3 more under calm wind conditions, suggesting our study underestimates emissions and subsequent concentrations of coal train dust. Empty coal cars tended to add 2 µg/m 3 . Regarding peak concentrations of PM 2.5 , our models suggest an increase of 17.4 µg/m 3 (95% CI = 6.2, 28.5; p &lt; 0.01) from coal trains, about 3 µg/m 3 more than freight trains. Given rail shipment of coal occurs globally, including in populous areas, it is likely to have adverse effects on health and environmental justice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Air pollution from fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been associated with various health implications that can lead to increased morbidity and excess mortality. Epidemiological and toxicological studies have shown that carbonaceous particles (black carbon and organic aerosols) may be more hazardous to human health than inorganic ones. Health impact studies and emission reduction policies are based on total PM2.5 concentration without differentiating the more harmful components. In such assessments, PM2.5 and their sub-component concentrations are usually modeled with air quality models. Organic aerosols have been shown to be consistently underestimated, which may affect excess mortality estimates. Here, we use the WRF-Chem model to simulate PM2.5 (including carbonaceous particles) over the wider European domain and assess some of the main factors that contribute to uncertainty. In particular, we explore the impact of anthropogenic emissions and meteorological modeling on carbonaceous aerosol concentrations. We further assess their effects on excess mortality estimates by using the Global Exposure Mortality Model (GEMM). We find that meteorological grid nudging is essential for accurately representing both PM2.5 and carbonaceous aerosols and that, for this application, results improve more significantly compared to spectral nudging. Our results indicate that the explicit account of organic precursors (semi-volatile and intermediate-volatile organic carbons—SVOCs/IVOCs) in emission inventories would improve the accuracy of organic aerosols modeling. We conclude that uncertainties related to PM2.5 modeling in Europe lead to a ∼15% deviation in excess mortality, which is comparable to the risk model uncertainty. This estimate is relevant when all PM2.5 sub-components are assumed to be equally toxic but can be higher by considering their specific toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Abstract A benchmark was performed, comparing the results of three different methodologies proposed by three institutions to calibrate a network of low-cost PM2.5 sensors, on an hourly basis, using synthetically generated real concentrations and sensor measurements. The objective of the network calibrations was to correct the 2000+ sensor measurements in the Netherlands for the sensitivity to (local) environmental conditions. The option to use real measurements was dropped because the number of low-cost sensors sufficiently close to the 40 reference measurement locations was assessed to be spatially insufficient to benchmark the proposed approaches. Instead, synthetic real concentrations were generated to enable validation at all sensor locations. Hourly actual sensor and actual fixed concentrations, as well as interpolated concentration maps, were used as underlying data to generate the synthetic data sets for the period of 1 month. The synthetic sensor measurement errors were constructed by sampling from a collection of differences between actual sensor values and actual measurements. Of the three tested calibration methods, two follow a similar approach, although having differences in, e.g., outlier analyses and method of grouping sensors, leading also to comparable corrections to the raw sensor measurements. A third method uses significantly stricter rules in outlier selection, discarding considerably more sensors because of insufficient quality. Differences between the methods become most apparent when analyzing data at a smaller time scale. It is shown that two network calibration methods are better at correcting the hourly/daily bias.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Exposure to air pollutants negatively affects human health as well as the ecosystem. The target study area, Salda Lake, which is a special environmental protection area with Turkey's and the world's geoheritage and unique natural values, has become one of the tourist attraction areas in recent years. However, quantitative data on airborne trace metals in the region remain poorly described. This study focuses on the spatial distribution of atmospheric heavy metals through lichen monitoring for the first time around Salda Lake. The concentration of airborne metals accumulated in Xanthoria parietina lichen thalli samples collected from 14 sites were evaluated by multi-element analysis with Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The spatial distribution of toxic metals in the region was presented as separate pollution maps. Analysis data showed that Ni, Fe, Al, Cu and Zn accumulation levels in lichen thalli were significantly higher than reference. Visitor entrance, camping areas and the road line in the west and south of the lake were among the sample areas where metal contamination was evident. Due to the prevalence of chromium mineral deposits in the region, the high level of Cr content is also quite remarkable. It was concluded that Al, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Zn in the air are high enough to threaten human health and their levels vary depending on wind direction, human activities and traffic density. This study is important in terms of determining the level of air quality in this natural area and future perspectives. Graphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract Microbiological pollutants of cabin filters may affect the air quality inside vehicles. The main aim of the study was to evaluate cabin filters in terms of their effectiveness in retaining mycological contaminants. The research material consisted of 100 cabin filters obtained during periodic replacement of filters in passenger cars. Mycological contamination of filters was examined using microbiological, biochemical, immunoenzymatic and molecular methods. The average concentration of fungi in cabin filters was 7.2 × 10 7 CFU/m 2 , and Cladosporium , Alternaria , Penicillium , and Aspergillu s genera were most often isolated. For Aspergillus species, the highest concentration reached 3.3 × 10 7 CFU/m 2 , with dominance of A. fumigatus . Among the Aspergillus strains tested, the presence of the aflO gene related to aflatoxin biosynthesis and the polyketide synthase gene related to ochratoxin A biosynthesis was detected. The presence of total aflatoxin (B 1 , B 2 , G 1 , G 2 ) and aflatoxin B 1 was detected at levels of 5.37 µg/kg and 1.71 µg/kg for standard filters and 2.43 µg/kg and 0.65 µg/kg for carbon filters. The level of ochratoxin A contamination was 0.96 µg/kg and 0.55 µg/kg for standard and carbon filters, respectively. Aspergillus species showed high enzymatic activity of acid phosphatase, β-glucosidase, naphthol phosphohydrolase and N-acetyl-β-glucosamidase. Based on the test results regarding the concentration of mycotoxins and the effectiveness of capturing fungal conidia, it was found that carbon filters are more effective than standard filters. Recommendations for filter manufacturers and car service policies should include the use of cabin filters with a layer of activated carbon, and their regular replacement after a year of use.",

Composite color images were made on the basis of data received directly from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite advanced very high resolution radiometer, and the distribution and transport of dust clouds were analyzed. The ground concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 and visibility during dustfall episodes (where the PM10 concentration exceeds 190 mug m(-3) for at least 2 h) were also analyzed at Cheongwon, in central South Korea, which lies in the leeward direction from the origin of sandstorms. Fewer strong sandstorms occurred in the places of origin in 2005, mainly because of the snow cover with moderate high and low pressure systems in the place of dust origin. The weather patterns explain why there were fewer dustfall episodes in Korea in 2005 than in the period between 1997 and 2004. A total of seven dustfall episodes were monitored in Korea in 2005 and they covered a period of 11 days. In the summer of 2005, sandstorms occurred less frequently in the source region due to high humidity and weaker winds; as a result, there were no dustfall episodes in Korea. When the sandstorms at the source headed directly to Korea without passing through any large cities or industrial areas of China, the PM2.5 concentrations were up to 20% of the PM10 concentrations. However, when the sandstorms headed to Korea via the industrial areas of eastern China, where they pick up anthropogenic air pollutants, the PM2.5 concentrations were at least 25% of the PM10 concentrations. In five of the cases that were observed and analyzed in 2005, the PM10 concentrations of the sand dust that originated in the deserts were 190 mug m(-3) or less, which is below the level of a dustfall episode.",

Pilot projects have demonstrated the feasibility of pooling state hospitalization data and linking these data to The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) statistically based ambient air estimates for ozone and fine particulates. Tools were developed to perform case-crossover analyses to estimate concentration–response (C-R) functions. A weakness of analyzing one state at a time is that the effects are relatively small compared to their confidence intervals. The EPHT program will explore ways to statistically combine the results of peer-reviewed analyses from across the country to provide more robust C-R functions and health impact estimates at the local level. One challenge will be to routinely share data for these types of analyses at fine geographic and temporal scales without disclosing confidential information. Another challenge will be to develop C-R estimates which take into account time, space, or other relevant effect modifiers.",

    "abstract": "Air quality trends and patterns in the coastal city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) for the period 2011–2015 were analyzed. The orographic and meteorological characteristics, the proximity to the African continent, and the influence of the Azores anticyclone in combination with the anthropogenic (oil refinery, road/maritime traffic) and natural emissions create specific dispersion conditions. SO2, NO2, PM10, PM2.5, and O3 pollutants were assessed. The refinery was the primary source of SO2; EU hourly and daily average limit values were exceeded during 2011 and alert thresholds were reached in 2011 and 2012. WHO daily mean guideline was occasionally exceeded. Annual averages in the three stations that registered the highest concentrations in 2011 and 2012 were between 9.3 and 20.4 μg/m3. The spatial analysis of SO2 concentrations with respect to prevailing winds corroborates a clear influence of the refinery to the SO2 levels. In 2014 and 2015, the refinery did not operate and the concentrations fell abruptly to background levels of 2.5–7.1 μg/m3 far below from WHO AQG. NO2 EU limit values, as well as WHO AQG for the period 2011–2015, were not exceeded. The progressive dieselization of the vehicle fleet caused an increment on NO2 annual mean concentrations (from 2011 to 2015) measured at two stations close to busy roads 25 to 31 μg/m3 (+21%) and 27 to 35 μg/m3 (+29%). NO x daily and weekly cycles (working days and weekends) were characterized. An anti-correlation was found between NO x and O3, showing that O3 is titrated by locally emitted NO. Higher O3 concentrations were reported because less NO x emitted during the weekends showing a clear weekend effect. Saharan dust intrusions have a significant impact on PM levels. After subtracting natural sources contribution, none of the stations reached the EU maximum 35 yearly exceedances of daily means despite seldom exceedances at some stations. None of the stations exceeded the annual mean EU limit values; however, many stations exceeded the annual mean WHO AQG. Observed PM10 annual average concentrations in all the stations fluctuated between 10.1 and 35.3 μg/m3, where background concentrations were 6.5–24.4 μg/m3 and natural contributions: 4.2–9.1 μg/m3. No PM10 temporal trends were identified during the period except for an effect of washout due to the rain: concentrations were lower in 2013 and 2014 (the most rainy years of the period). None of the stations reached the PM2.5 annual mean EU 2015 limit value. However, almost all the stations registered daily mean WHO AQG exceedances. During 2015, PM2.5 concentrations were higher than the previous years (2015, 8.8–12.3 μg/m3; 2011–2014, 3.7–9.6 μg/m3). O3 complied with EU target values; stricter WHO AQG were sometimes exceeded in all the stations for the whole time period.",

    "abstract": "There is large epidemiological evidence on the short-term health effects of O3 and NO2. These gaseous pollutants induce oxidative stress through their oxidative potential. Therefore, the evaluation of their combined oxidative capacity (Ox) has been proposed rather than studying the effect of either gas individually. To study the short-term effects of daily concentrations of O3, NO2, and Ox on mortality in Rome, in 2002–2015, daily deaths from the city mortality registry were analyzed along with O3 and NO2 levels observed in Rome and with estimated Ox and Owt (Ox, weighted by the redox potential of O3 and NO2). A Poisson regression model was used considering trends, and meteorological and population changes. The effects on mortality were estimated at lag 0–1 and 0–5 for 10 μg/m3. O3 and NO2 were associated with mortality, with the highest effects at lag 0–5, 0.81% (0.45–1.17) and 2.72% (2.07–3.37), respectively. Ox had an intermediate effect between the two gases. After adjusting for PM10, Owt had a stronger effect (1.72%; 1.14–2.30) than either gas, 0.86% (0.50–1.22) for O3 and 1.61% (1.15–2.06) for NO2. Both Ox and Owt were associated with cerebrovascular, respiratory and, to a lesser extent, cardiac mortality more than either gas. These results suggest that the use of Ox (or Owt) can provide a better assessment of the combined role of O3 and NO2 on mortality and can avoid the uncertainty of the threshold level for ozone. The brain and lungs seem to be the main targets of O3 and NO2.",

The data is stratified into weather types and the study restricted to spring season to limit the impact of multiple confounders. Results shows that the daily count of asthma hospitalization (spring 2006–2008) in situation of warm fronts or trowals (daily average of 3.78 counts, CI 95% 2.95–4.61) was much higher ( p &lt; 0.001) than in other situations (2.49 counts, CI 95% 2.37–2.71). Moreover, the explained variance of asthma hospitalization due to air pollution rises from about less than 7% (in the case of no stratification) to about 28% ( R = 0.53, p &lt; 0.05 with stratification). Statistical tests for interaction and overall results point towards a synergy between environmental factors which exacerbates asthma. A new concept named frontal asthma is proposed to explain several results found here and in the open literature.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Adverse effects of non-optimal temperatures on mortality have been reported in different climates. However, only a low number of studies have been conducted in tropical locations where these effects might differ. Here, we estimate the association between ambient air temperature and all-cause mortality and assess the impact of non-optimal temperatures on attributable mortality at national and subnational levels in Colombia during 2010–2019. We obtained daily temperature and mortality data for 32 departments and conducted a two-stage analysis. In stage-1 we fitted a time-series Poisson model for each department and estimated the mortality-temperature association using distributed-lag-nonlinear models with 7–28 days of lag. In stage-2, we pooled these estimates using a multivariate meta-analytic model including mean temperature, relative humidity, and a multidimensional poverty index. We calculated attributable deaths and fractions due to non-optimal temperatures and due to overall heat and cold. We analyzed 2,561,561 deaths and found marked differences in exposure–response curves of mortality-temperature, where most departments showed acute heat effects but no cold effects for the 7-days lag. This lag-response curve for heat showed that the risk of death is higher during the same day (lag 0) of extreme temperatures and decreases after the third day. The country attributable fraction due to non-optimal temperature was higher for heat (1.77, 95% CI 1.16 – 2.31) during the 0–7 days lag, but higher for cold temperatures (4.68, 95% CI 2.34 – 6.72) during the 0–28 days lag. There was high heterogeneity in the estimated risks between departments. These results should inform planning adaptation strategies for climate change differentiated at subnational level.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Megalopolis of the Mexico Valley Metropolitan Area (MZMVM) is one of the most polluted regions in the country. With its high population density and industrial activity, the MZMVM has recurrent ozone pollution episodes due to meteorological conditions and emissions of precursors such as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds. The study of ozone is crucial due to its severe effects on human health, vegetation degradation, and air quality. The methodology used included the analysis of the air quality index and the occurrence of environmental contingencies from 2001 to 2022. Data from 80 monitoring stations distributed in the seven states constituting the MZMVM were used. The data were validated and processed according to Mexican and international standards. The results show an improvement in air quality in Mexico City and the State of Mexico, while a deterioration was observed in Hidalgo and Morelos during the study period. Although environmental emergencies due to ozone are now less frequent, they still represent a significant risk to public health and should be analyzed. This analysis highlights the importance of implementing stricter and more sustainable policies to reduce emissions of ozone precursors and protect both human health and the environment.",

    "abstract": "The carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations observed in Mt. Waliguan in China (WLG), Ulaan Uul in Mongolia (UUM), Tae-ahn Peninsula in Korea (TAP) and Ryori in Japan (RYO) were analysed between 1991 and 2004. The average annual concentration of CO, a toxic air pollutant, was the highest at TAP (233 ± 41 ppb), followed by RYO (171 ± 36 ppb), UUM (155 ± 26 ppb) and WLG (135 ± 22 ppb). CO tends to be highest in spring and lowest in summer in East Asia, with the exception of WLG. TAP had the highest CO concentrations in all seasons compared with WLG, UUM and RYO and displays a wide short-term variability in concentration. This is caused by large-scale air pollution owing to its downwind location, close to continental East Asia. CO concentrations observed at TAP were analysed as follows: according to the origin of the isentropic backward trajectory and its transport passage, as continental background airflows (CBG) measuring 216 ± 47 ppb, regionally polluted continental airflows (RPC) measuring 316 ± 56 ppb, oceanic background airflows (OBG) measuring 108 ± 41 ppb and partly perturbed oceanic airflows measuring 161 ± 6 ppb. The high concentrations of CO at TAP are because of the airflow originating from the East Asian continent, rather than the North Pacific. RPCs, which pass through eastern China, appear to have high CO concentrations in spring, autumn and winter. OBGs, however, are affected by North Pacific air masses with low CO concentrations in summer. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite images and the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS)-Chem simulation model confirmed that a large-scale air pollution event originated in eastern China and reached the Korean Peninsula and the Korea East Sea by way of the Yellow Sea. It is noteworthy that the overall trend at TAP does not show an increase despite the fact that energy use in China approximately doubled from 1991 to 2004.",

It requires careful consideration of the audience one wants to reach, the messages one is trying to present, the venue through which the message will be delivered. The audience, context, technique, and content factors may affect how well it is heard and how appropriately it is interpreted. In this short paper, I describe many of these concerns and provide some suggestions for how best to address them. However, since every audience differs in goals, characteristics, and nature, what is most important is implementing an effective communications program. This program should include frequent two-way communication, repeated and on-going evaluation of how well the audience understands the messages, and consideration of how to improve the delivery.",

To characterize the ambient falling dust pollution, two typical sampling sites: urban (Wushan) and suburban (University Town) areas in Guangzhou city were chosen for falling dust collection over 1 year at time intervals of 1 or 2 months. The flux of dry deposition was calculated. In addition, mineral composition and morphology of atmospheric falling dust were studied by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and microscopic observation. The results revealed that the dust flux in Guangzhou city was 3.34-3.78 g/(m(2) month) during the study period. The main minerals in the dust were quartz, illite, calcite, kaolinite, gypsum, plagioclase, dolomite, and amorphous matter. The morphological types included grained and flaky individual minerals, chain-like aggregates, spherical flying beads, and irregular aggregates, with the chain-like and spherical aggregates indicators of industrial ash. The major dusts were derived from industrial and construction activities. The gypsum present in the dust collected in winter season was not only derived from cement dust but may also have originated from the reaction of calcic material with sulfuric acids resulting from photooxidation of SO(x) and NO(x), which confirmed serious air pollution due to SO(x) and NO(x) in Guangzhou. The abatement of fossil fuel combustion emissions and construction dust will have a significant beneficial effect on dust reduction.",

    "abstract": "Formaldehyde is of particular health concern since it is carcinogenic for human and ubiquitous in indoor air where people spend most of their time. Therefore, it is important to have suitable methods and techniques to measure its content in indoor air. In the present work, four different techniques have been tested in the INERIS exposure chamber and in indoor environments in comparison to a standard active method: passive sampling method based on the reaction of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine with formaldehyde, two on-line continuous monitoring systems based on fluorescence and UV measurements and a portable commercialised analyser based on electrochemical titration. Two formaldehyde concentrations, about 10 and 25 μg m(-3) were generated in an exposure chamber under controlled conditions of temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed to simulate real conditions and assess potential influence on passive sampling and continuous systems response. Influence of sampling periods on passive sampling has also been evaluated. The real atmosphere experiments have been performed in four different indoor environments: an office, a furniture shop, a shopping mall, and residential dwellings in which several potential formaldehyde sources linked to household activities have been tested. The analytical and sampling problems associated with each measurement method have been identified and discussed. An overall agreement between each technique has been observed and continuous analyzers allowed for formaldehyde concentrations change monitoring and secondary formation of that pollutant observation.",

Model sensitivity was assessed against three spatial representations of population: population at the dissemination area level, population at the dissemination block level and a dasymetrically derived population representation. A spatial database with land use, roads, population, zoning, greenspaces and elevation was created. Polycategorical zoning data were used in dasymetric mapping to spatially focus population data derived from the dissemination blocks to a sub-block level for comparison purposes. Dasymetric population mapping provided no significant LUR model improvement in explained variance when compared to block level population; however, both the former were significantly better than the dissemination area level population representations. However, where block level population is not available or too costly to acquire, our method using polycategorical zoning data provides a viable alternative in LUR modelling endeavours.",

This study investigated the prevalence and types of health problems associated with exposure to fragranced products among asthmatic Australians. Nationally representative cross-sectional data were obtained in June 2016 with an online survey of adult Australians (n = 1098), of which 28.5% were medically diagnosed with asthma or an asthma-like condition. Nationally, 55.6% of asthmatics, and 23.9% of non-asthmatics, report adverse health effects after exposure to fragranced products. Specifically, 24.0% of asthmatics report an asthma attack. Moreover, 18.2% of asthmatics lost workdays or a job in the past year due to fragranced products in the workplace. Over 20% of asthmatics are unable to access public places and restrooms that use air fresheners. Exposure to fragranced products is associated with health problems, some potentially serious, in an estimated 2.2 million asthmatic adult Australians. Asthmatics were proportionately more affected than non-asthmatics (prevalence odds ratio 3.98; 95% confidence interval 3.01–5.24). Most asthmatics would prefer workplaces, healthcare facilities, and environments that are fragrance-free, which could help reduce adverse effects.",

A series of 48-h air quality forecasts were launched for July 2012 (summer case) and January 2014 (winter case) for ozone, NO2, and PM2.5. In this setup, the GEM-MACH model (version 1.3.8.2) was initialized with surface analysis increments (from MPSOA) which were projected in the vertical by applying an appropriate fractional weighting in order to obtain 3D analyses in the lower troposphere. Here, we have used a methodology based on sensitivity tests to obtain the optimum vertical correlation length (VCL). Overall, results showed that for PM2.5, more specifically for sulfate and crustal materials, AQ forecasts initialized with MPSOA showed a very significant improvement compared to forecasts without data assimilation, which extended beyond 48 h in all seasons. Initializing the model with ozone analyses also had a significant impact but on a shorter time scale than that of PM2.5. Finally, assimilation of NO2 was found to have much less impact than longer-lived species. The impact of simultaneous assimilation of the three pollutants (PM2.5, ozone, and NO2) was also examined and found very significant in reducing the total error of the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) over 48 h and beyond. We suggest that the period over which there is a significant improvement due to assimilation could be an adequate measure of the pollutant atmospheric lifetime.",

Obtained results showed that coal combustion (pyrogenic source) contributed to the highest emission of PAHs during the heating season. However, similar concentrations of highly carcinogenic PAHs were detected in the non-heating period. The analysis of prevailing wind directions, air mass trajectories and diagnostic PAH ratios revealed that in addition to land transport emission (mainly from diesel vehicles), the increase in sea shipping traffic during the non-heating season contributed to the high concentrations of detected carcinogenic PAHs. We conclude that the increasing maritime activity in the southern Baltic Sea region might have an adverse effect on both environmental and human health. Therefore, it should receive more attention by the Polish government as a pollutant source.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Biomass burning is one source of air pollution that emits soot, smoke, particulate matter, free radicals and other substances, affecting human health, air quality, cloud formation processes and climate change. During biomass burning, organic biomass burning tracers are emitted, such as levoglucosan and its isomers mannosan and galactosan, which are formed at temperatures above 300 °C during cellulose and hemicellulose pyrolysis. The objective of this research is the measurement of biomass burning tracer concentrations in PM 10 samples in Krynica during two winter seasons from 01.12.2017 to 31.03.2018 and from 01.12.2018 to 26.03.2019. The average concentrations of organic carbon were 9.48 μg/m 3 in the 2017/2018 season and 8.79 μg/m 3 in the 2018/2019 season. The average concentration of levoglucosan in the PM 10 samples in 2017/2018 was 137 ng/m 3 , while in 2018/2019, the average concentration reached 245 ng/m 3 . Levoglucosan was the dominant compound among the determined biomass burning tracers, accounting for 88.6% in 2017/2018 and 72.4% in 2018/2019. The conducted measurements show that the levoglucosan to mannosan ratio was equal to 10.5 and 3.9 in 2017/2018 and 2018/2019, respectively. The biomass smoke organic carbon was approximately 10.6% in 2017/2018 and 20.5% in 2018/2019. These results correspond to the contribution of biomass smoke to organic carbon, which was equal to 14.4% and 28.4% in the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 seasons, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents the extent to which kitchen structures influence household exposure to firewood-induced volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The sample consisted of 69 firewood users who were conveniently sampled from Senwabarwana Villages. An Integrated Environmental Health Risk Assessment framework (IEHRA) was adopted as the research methods of the current study. The VOC samples were collected from selected priority firewood species used in the study area, namely mushu (Umbrella thorn), mohwelere (red bushwillow), moretshe (Sickle bush), motswiri (Leadwood) and mokgwa (Black monkey thorn). Four VOCs, namely benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene were analysed from each of the selected plant species. Available literature shows that these VOCs are associated with the kind of common firewood used in the study area. The outcomes of this study reveal that mushu emits the highest concentration of the four selected VOCs, followed by moretshe , mohwelere , mokgwa and motswiri , respectively. The influence of kitchen structural factors such as number and positioning of windows, fireplace or stove type, roofing material and designs, among others on the concentration and indoor dispersion of VOCs was also investigated. Behavioural practices of households during fire making such as opening or closing of doors and windows during cooking, water heating and space heating were also found to influence exposure levels. Consequently, low VOCs emitting firewood species and kitchen structural designs have been confirmed as the key drivers of firewood-induced VOC exposure.",

However, research about VOCs as an important precursor of secondary aerosols in ambient air is still limited. In this study, VOCs at sites from three typical functional areas in Hefei, China, were monitored using GC–MS/FID. The VOCs in ambient air from different functional areas showed significantly different characteristics. The highest concentrations and the biggest diurnal difference of VOCs were found in the High-tech Zone (industrial area) with serried emission sources. Additionally, lower VOC concentration was observed in Changjiang West Road, the center area of studied city. The VOC concentration in this area is strongly related to other pollutants. The composition of VOCs at all sampling sites showed certain common characteristics, i.e., alkanes, OVOCs, and halogenated hydrocarbons account for more than 75% of the total VOCs’ quality. The High-tech Zone with the highest concentration of VOCs also has the highest proportion of alkanes. Besides, the positive matrix factorization analysis results revealed that vehicle exhaust, LPG volatilization sources, and chemical solvents were the most important VOC emission sources in Hefei. In terms of the contribution of VOC components to the OFP at the three sites, the olefins and alkynes at the Changjiang West Road site and the Science Island site contribute the most significant proportion. In contrast, the OVOCs at the High-tech Zone site contribute the largest proportion.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study numerically investigates the influence of trees on air quality in Madrid urban area (Spain). Simulations are performed using the mesoscale model WRF/Chem (EPA, US) and the microclimate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model PALM4U (IMUK, DE) configured as LES (Large Eddy Simulation). PALM4U is running over one of the 1 km × 1 km grid cells with 5 m very high spatial resolution using three different scenarios. In the simulation domain, there is a zone (approximately 25% of the domain) of vegetation where the dominant species are broadleaf trees included in the BAU (Business as Usual) scenario. The second scenario is focused on changing the type of the tree from broad leaf at BAU scenario to needle leaf the so-called ND scenario and the third scenario called NOTREE which comprise the replacement of the trees located in the green zone. The base simulations (BAU) are compared with data from the Madrid air quality monitoring network for the evaluation of the simulation results. The effects of the trees are calculated comparing scenarios (BAU-NOTREE and BAU-ND), so a brute force methodology has been used. This paper shows that the effects of the trees and type of trees are not uniform across the urban area because there are variations in the energy fluxes and the aerodynamic effect and there are important interactions of trees with wind flow dynamics. The mitigation potential effect of trees on gaseous air pollutants concentrations is showed and also may enhance substantially air pollution in other areas.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The impact on human health from environmental pollution is receiving increasing attention. In the case of respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the relationship is now well documented. However, few studies have been carried out in areas with low population density and low industrial production, such as the province of Belluno (North-Eastern Italy). The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of exposure to certain pollutants on the temporal dynamics of hospital admissions for COPD in the province of Belluno. Daily air pollution concentration, humidity, precipitations, and temperature were collected from the air monitoring stations in Belluno. Generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) and visibility graphs were used to determine the effects of the short-term exposure to environmental agents on hospital admissions associated to COPD. In the case of the city of Belluno, the GAMM showed that hospital admissions were associated with NO 2 , PM 10 , date, and temperature, while for the city of Feltre, GAMM produced no associated variables. Several visibility graph indices (average edge overlap and interlayer mutual information) showed a significant overlap between environmental agents and hospital admission for both cities. Our study has shown that visibility graphs can be useful in establishing associations between environmental agents and COPD hospitalization in sparsely populated areas.",

    "abstract": "In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, containment measures were applied inducing potential changes in air pollutant concentrations and thus in air toxicity. This study evaluates the role of restrictions on biological effects of particulate matter (PM) in different Northwest Italy sites: urban background, urban traffic, rural, and incinerator. Daily PM samples collected in 2020 were pooled according to restrictions: January/February (no restrictions), March and April (first lockdown), May/June and July/August/September (low restrictions), October/November/December (second lockdown). The 2019 samples (pre-pandemic period) were pooled as 2020 for comparison. Pools were extracted with organic solvents and extracts were tested to assess cytotoxicity (WST-1 assay) and genotoxicity (comet assay) on BEAS-2B cells, mutagenicity (Ames test) on TA98 and TA100 Salmonella typhimurium strains, and estrogenic activity (gene reporter assay) on MELN cells. Pollutant concentrations were also analyzed (PM10, PM2.5, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons). No difference was observed for PM and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations between 2020 and 2019. During lockdown months (2020), PM cytotoxicity/genotoxicity was significantly lower in some sites than during 2019, while considering PM mutagenicity/estrogenic activity some differences were detected but without statistical significance. PM extract effects decreased in some sites during 2020; this may be due to lockdowns that reduced/modified pollutant emissions and may be related also to complex PM origin/formation and to meteorological conditions. In conclusion, the study confirms that PM biological effects cannot be assessed considering only the PM concentration and suggests to include a battery of bioassay for air quality monitoring in order to protect human health from air pollution effects.

    "abstract": "Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic caused a decrease in outdoor activities but an increase in indoor ones. Does this situation cause changes in pollution patterns? The objective of this study was to compare heavy metal contamination in indoor and outdoor dust in homes in the city of Mérida, Yucatán. Dust was collected in 51 homes on the weekends of May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic when there was a lockdown. Three hundred ninety-six samples were obtained (203 indoors and 193 outdoors on the sidewalk). Heavy metal concentrations were measured in triplicate with a portable XRF Genius 7000 spectrometer from Skyray Instruments. The contamination factor was calculated using a local (decile 1) and a global background value. To identify whether there were differences in indoor and outdoor heavy metal concentrations, mixed linear models were used, and the statistical inference was made using hypothesis tests. The risk to human health was evaluated using the USEPA methodology. Using decile one as background, the contamination factor's median showed moderate contamination for Lead (Pb), Manganese (Mn), Iron (Fe), Calcium (Ca), Strontium (Sr), and Yttrium (Y) indoors and outdoors. Using world concentrations as background, higher Ca, Sr, and Y concentrations were found outdoors, while Copper (Cu), Pb, Titanium (Ti), and Zinc (Zn) concentrations were higher indoors. Pb represented a risk of developing health problems for children inside homes. These studies help design public policies to reduce urban emissions and pollution, implement dust and risk management programs, and conduct citizen cleaning campaigns.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Metal constituents in indoor particulate matter (PM) emitted by household materials and indoor activities present an environmental challenge globally. This study investigated the variation of metal constituent concentrations in indoor PM collected from different communities and the association of metals with household characteristics and indoor occupant activities. PM 2.5 and PM 10 samples collected on Teflon filters during the field studies in the south and north Durban and Highveld region of South Africa were analysed for metal constituents by digesting in nitric acid and hydrochloric acid solution (aqua regia). These samples were analysed for metals using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Standardised interviews and structured household walkthrough assessments that were conducted provided additional covariates. Multivariate linear regression models were developed using factors from the factor analysis, and variables identified in the bivariate analysis. The decreasing order of metal content in PM 2.5 was as follows: Fe &gt; Cr &gt; Cu &gt; Mn &gt; Al &gt; Hg &gt; Zn &gt; As &gt; Cd &gt; Pb, whereas in PM 10 the metal content had the following decreasing order: Fe &gt; Al &gt; As &gt; Cu &gt; Cr &gt; Hg &gt; Zn &gt; Cd &gt; Mn &gt; Pb. Metal concentrations (Cd, Fe, Mn, and Pb) in PM 2.5 varied significantly in different geographical locations. Household characteristics including higher household age, presence of a ceiling, and cemented floor type were significantly associated with increased Cr, Fe, and Hg in indoor PM 2.5 , respectively ( p &lt; 0.05). The association of metallic components in indoor PM with household characteristics provides an opportunity to raise issues of deteriorated old households to local authorities and policymakers who need to implement strategies to replace old building materials releasing metal-rich particles.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the number of studies on in vitro lung bioaccessibility of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) has increased; however, physiological parameters for these tests have yet to be optimized. This study aims to (1) evaluate the effect of adding cholesterol to synthetic lung fluid on PTEs bioaccessibility, and to (2) assess the effect of other selected test parameters on bioaccessibility. The bioaccessibility of Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, V, and Zn have been investigated using seven formulations of Gamble's solution (GS, with/without cholesterol/DPPC) and one artificial lysosomal fluid (ALF) on two reference materials (SRM 2691, BGS 102). The bioaccessibility of certain PTEs increased in GS modified with 5% DPPC (e.g., V in BGS 102 from 2.87 to 8.35%), 0.25% cholesterol (e.g., Cr in SRM 2691 from 27.3 to 31.5%), and 2% DPPC + 0.25% cholesterol (e.g., Cu in BGS 102 from 43.9 to 46.2%). Using DPPC + cholesterol may be recommended for bioaccessibility testing. The effect of the tested solid-to-liquid ratio (S/L) was sample/element-specific. Overall, lower S/L led to higher bioaccessibility in ALF (e.g., for Pb: 94.8% at 1/500 vs. 36.5% at 1/100). The peak bioaccessibility was reached at a 4-week extraction, suggesting a longer testing duration when feasible. Higher agitation (100 vs. 20 rpm) increased the bioaccessibility of some PTEs (e.g., 91.0% vs. 79.7% for Cd in BGS 102). Method modifications would prove valuable when used together with highly needed in vivo validation studies for in vitro lung bioaccessibility.",

    "abstract": "Quantification of the size distributions of organic molecular markers can provide information about the origin of the carbonaceous particulate matter (PM). Organic molecular marker spatial variability studies provide data that are vital to an accurate determination of a population's exposure to PM from various sources. We have investigated the intra-community spatial variation of size-segregated PM [0–0.25 μm (ultrafine), 0.25-2.5 μm (accumulation), and 2.5-10 μm (coarse)) ] in a southern California community. The highest concentrations of individual organic compounds were found in the ultrafine fraction, followed by the accumulation and coarse size fractions. Correlations between the three size fractions were weak between compounds in the coarse and corresponding ultrafine and accumulation particles, implying that the coarse PM organic compounds were emitted by different sources than those that emit ultrafine and accumulation mode PM. Evidence of the incomplete combustion of gasoline was found in the ultrafine and accumulation size fractions, while possible diesel emissions were traced to ultrafine particles. Coefficients of divergence and coefficients of variation were investigated to determine the spatial and temporal variability of individual organic compounds. Spatial divergence in organic compounds was comparatively high, but it did not differ appreciably between size fractions or between compound classes. Elemental carbon and tracer compounds, which originate from a few sources, showed higher spatial divergence than organic carbon whose numerous sources can be local and regional. Spatial and temporal variability were not different from each other for this data set and, therefore, it is not possible to determine whether variability in concentrations between sampling sites or the length of the sampling campaign is more important for health effects studies.",

    "abstract": "Many countries have implemented exposure limits for the concentration of ambient particular matter and do therefore have to monitor their concentration. This could be performed with TEOM monitors (Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance-monitors) that contain a filter on which particles are collected. These filters are regularly exchanged for new ones. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of collecting used filters from monitors at different locations and establishing a method to extract particles and then study them with respect to their ability to generate oxidants, their endotoxin content, and ability to activate inflammatory cells. Filters from nine geographically spread locations in Sweden were collected during a 21-month period by local technicians who then sent them to the laboratory where they were extracted and analyzed. The procedure to let local technicians perform the filter exchange and send used TEOM filters to the laboratory worked well. A method was established in which pyrogen-free water was used to extract particles that then were aliquoted and stored for later analysis. Particulate matter (PM10) from different locations showed both a considerable seasonal and spatial-dependent difference with respect to oxidative potential (oxidize glutathione), endotoxin content, and ability to activate blood monocytes to release interleukin-1β. This study shows that, instead of discarding TEOM filters, they can be collected and extracted so that particles that have been sampled in a standardized way could be analyzed with respect to variables that reflect their toxicity. This could be done at a low cost. In combination with information about the ambient particle concentration, such information could be helpful in the evaluation of differences in the risk of breathing air at various locations.",

    "abstract": "Abstract In this work, a new technique is proposed to study short-term exposure and adverse health effects. The presented approach uses hierarchical clusters with the following structure: each pair of two sequential days in 1 year is embedded in the year. We have 183 clusters per year with the embedded structure &lt;year:2 days&gt;. Time-series analysis is conducted using a conditional Poisson regression with the constructed clusters as a stratum. Unmeasured confounders such as seasonal and long-term trends are not modelled but are controlled by the structure of the clusters. The proposed technique is illustrated using four freely accessible databases, which contain complex simulated data. These data are available as the compressed R workspace files. Results based on the simulated data were very close to the truth based on the presented methodology. In addition, the case-crossover method with 1-month and 2-week window, and a conditional Poisson regression on 3-day clusters as a stratum, was also applied to the simulated data. Difficulties (high type I error rate) were observed for the case-crossover method in the presence of high concurvity in the simulated data. The proposed methods using various forms of a stratum were further applied to the Chicago mortality data. The considered methods have often different qualitative and quantitative estimations.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted governments around the world to impose mitigation strategies of unprecedented scales, typically involving some form of restrictions on social activities and transportation. The South Korean government has been recommending a collection of guidelines now known as social distancing, leading to reduced human activities. This study analyzes changes in the concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) during the 30-day periods before and since the start of social distancing on 29 February 2020 using measurement data from air quality monitoring stations at various locations of the seven major cities of South Korea, namely, Seoul, Busan, Incheon, Daegu, Daejeon, Gwangju, and Ulsan. All seven cities experienced decreased levels of PM2.5 concentration by up to 25% and smaller fluctuations during the period of social distancing. Inter-city comparisons show that the PM2.5 concentration changes are positively correlated with the city-wide PM2.5 emission fractions for mobile sources and negatively correlated with the city-wide PM2.5 emission fractions for combustion and industrial process sources. In addition, the meteorological influences favorable for transboundary pollutant transport have weakened during the period under COVID-19 social distancing. Intra-city comparisons show that decreases in the intra-city variability of PM2.5 concentration were larger in coastal cities than in inland cities. Comparisons between the inter- and intra-city variabilities in the PM2.5 concentration changes under social distancing highlight the importance of taking into account intra-city variabilities in addition to inter-city variabilities.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The magnitude and shape of the association between outdoor air pollution concentrations and health need to be characterized in order to estimate public health benefits from proposed mitigation strategies. Specialized parametric functions have been proposed for this characterization. However, non-parametric spline models offer more flexibility, less bias, and predictive power, in describing these associations and are thus preferred over relatively simple parametric formulations. Unrestricted spline representations are often reported but many are not suitable for benefits analysis due to their erratic concentration-response behavior and are usually not presented in a format consistent with the requirements necessary to conduct a benefits analysis. We propose a method to adapt non-parametric spline representations of concentration-response associations that are suitable for public health benefits analysis by transforming spline predictions and its uncertainty over the study exposure range to a new spline formulation that is both monotonically increasing and restricted to concentration-response patterns suitable for use in health benefits assessment. We selected two examples of the association between long-term exposure to fine particulate matter and mortality in Canada and the USA that displayed spline fits that were neither monotonically increasing nor suitable, we suggest, for benefits analysis. We suggest our model is suitable for benefits analysis and conduct such analyses for both Canada and the USA, comparing benefits estimates to traditional models. Finally, we provide guidance on how to report spline fitting results such they can be used either in benefits analysis directly, or to fit our new model.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Modeling dispersion of aircraft emissions is challenging because aircraft are mobile sources with varying emissions rates at different elevations depending on the operating mode. Aircraft emissions during landing and take-off cycle (LTO) influence air quality in and around the airport, and depending on the number of aircraft operations and location of the airport, this influence may be significant. AERMOD (v22112) incorporates a variety of conventional source types to characterize the intended emissions source, leaving the question of which conventional source type(s) best characterizes aircraft activities across the four modes of LTO cycle, unanswered. Currently, the publicly released version of FAA’s Aviation Environmental Design Tool (version 3e) models aircraft emissions as a set of AREA sources for all flight segments. A research version of AEDT allows users to model aircraft sources—both fixed wing and rotorcraft—as a series of VOLUME sources in AERMOD. However, both source treatments do not account for plume rise of aircraft jet exhaust. This paper compares AERMOD’s performance in describing SO 2 concentrations associated with airport sources by comparing model results from the two source options during the summer campaign of the Air Quality Source Apportionment study conducted at the Los Angeles International Airport. We conclude that both VOLUME source and AREA treatments overestimate the highest observed SO 2 concentrations despite not accounting for background sources. The VOLUME source option reduces this overestimation by using a higher initial plume spread than the AREA option does, and through the inclusion of meander. Our results suggest the need to include the plume rise of jet exhaust when using AERMOD for airport air quality studies.",

    "abstract": "Since long-term exposure to PM2.5 is a growing concern in Taiwan, therefore, our study aimed to investigate the association between different PM2.5 concentrations and cause-specific mortalities, as well as explore the influence of demographic, socio-economic, and geographic determinants on mortality. Utilizing a Distributed Lag Non-Linear Model (DLNM), we estimated the PM2.5-attributable mortality burden among the elderly population (above 65 years) in Taiwan from 2005 to 2018. Our analysis considered various thresholds defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) to assess the impact of PM2.5 concentrations, ranging from standard Air Quality Guidelines (AQG) levels (0–15 μg/m3) to higher interim targets (up to 80 μg/m3). Our study reveals that achieving AQG levels (< 15 μg/m3) in Taiwan could potentially prevent 5571 elderly deaths, including 889 deaths from CVDs, 934 deaths from RTIs, and 680 deaths from chronic diseases. We observed a rapid increase in attributable deaths at lower PM2.5 concentrations, with a subsequent marginal increase at higher levels of exposure. We also identified several factors that modify the effects of PM2.5 exposures among elderly. For example, we found that higher elderly population ratios and high-income households were associated with an elevated risk of PM2.5-related deaths. In contrast, higher social welfare expenditure, better availability of medical practitioners per square kilometer, and higher forest-to-land ratios were associated with positive effects, indicating their potential in reducing mortality risk. This study fills a knowledge gap by examining the health consequences of varying PM2.5 levels and explored the complex interplay between demographic, socio-economic, and geographic factors in relation to PM2.5-related mortality.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The Maptaphut industrial area, one of the largest petrochemical complexes in Thailand, is the major cause of the various air pollutants. The larger concern is that a significant volume of air pollution is emitted and that air quality management needs to be improved. This is in part due to a lack of deeper understanding of how anthropogenic emissions are emitted from different sources in this area— especially volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Moreover, it has complicated relationship results of air pollution, disease mechanisms, and health effects. As a result, its available data can only give a rough indication of them. These factors are often assumed to be associated with economic consequences, but assessing the health-related economic losses caused by air pollution remains limited in many ways. Four targeted VOCs were analyzed, including benzene, 1,3-butadiene, 1,2-dichloroethane, and vinyl chloride from industrial and non-industrial sources, namely stacks, flares, storage tanks, wastewater treatment plants, transportation and marketing, fugitive losses, slurry/open equipment/vessel, and on-road mobile emissions. Source apportionment can be conducted using emissions inventory (EI) to establish pollution source databases, the dispersion model, and then imported on the risk model by determining receptors. The AERMOD dispersion model coupled with the IRAP-h view model was used to predict the spatial distribution of the ground-level concentration and analyze the inhalation health risk covering cancer and non-cancer risks— as well as the prioritization of pollutants. The risk assessment results indicated that the highest risk occurred most from 1,3-butadiene for cancer and chronic non-cancer risks contributed to fugitive sources, about 83% and 94%, and most benzenes for acute non-cancer risk contributed to on-road mobile sources, at about 56%. Consequently, the benzene classified as the most important priority depending on its risk results, comprehensive epidemiological studies, and discharge volumes. With the economic benefits assessment, BenMAP-CE was further utilized to estimate the health impacts and economic value of multiple scenarios to facilitate decision-making for benzene reduction. Overall, the 10% rollback policy for benzene concentration, monetized value of about 13.13 billion US dollars for all mortalities, gave the best practical scenario for the most economically viable option based on the B/C (benefit/cost) ratio results in Maptaphut. Ultimately, policymakers need to take additional measures to improve air quality and reduce health impacts while also considering economic benefits, especially benzene reduction.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The port and industrial zone of Saldanha Bay in South Africa accommodates activities related to the transport, processing, and production of commodities such as iron ore, manganese ore, and steel. The visible emission of dust from this area raised concerns for public health and to address this, the municipality has monitored the fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) concentration and dust deposition since 2015. Here, this monitoring data served to assess spatial and temporal changes and to evaluate the potential contribution of industrial and meteorological processes to these changes. We observed high temporal variability in both PM 2.5 concentration and dust deposition, and high spatial variation in dust depositions. Dust originated from local sources such as industry and traffic, but industrial activities could not explain the observed spatial variability, and concentration and deposition fluxes did not significantly increase over the years despite the extension of industrial activities. Meteorological factors such as rain, wind speed, wind direction, as well as topography exerted an important influence, but could also only partially explain the observed variability in both dust concentration and deposition. Furthermore, the PM 2.5 concentration and dust deposition are not significantly correlated, which highlights the challenges in appropriate dust monitoring. It follows that such monitoring efforts, though meeting national standards, require improvement to assess risks accurately. Our study illustrates that in areas with such high complexity of industrial activities, the high variability of dust load and deposition must be considered to evaluate implications for public and environmental health, adherence to guidelines, and mitigation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Passive smoking poses a major hazard to the health of non-smokers. Cigarette combustion emits environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) that contains various pollutants, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and particulate matter with particles &lt; 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM 2.5 ). Therefore, to assess the risk of passive smoking, it is necessary to determine the exposure levels to ETS compounds caused by passive smoking. However, it is difficult to assess exposure to ETS compounds by excluding the effects of other sources of pollution. In this study, we assessed the individual exposure levels to ETS compounds using a nicotine passive sampler and PM 2.5 sensor in 258 non-smokers. Median nicotine and PM 2.5 concentrations were 0.065 and 7.5 µg m − 3 , respectively. The median nicotine concentration was nearly identical to that found in non-smoking areas (0.05 µg m − 3 ). The median PM 2.5 concentrations were below the standard value for indoor PM 2.5 concentrations (12 µg m − 3 ). These results indicated that the effect of passive smoking was rather modest. Nicotine concentrations in individuals exposed to passive smoking indoors were significantly higher than in those not exposed to passive smoking. Nicotine exposure from domestic passive smoking was twice that from non-domestic passive smoking. There was no significant difference in PM 2.5 exposure between passive smoking in domestic and non-domestic settings. Moreover, it was suggested that passive smoking was equivalent to the act of smoking 2.4 × 10 − 3 cigarettes per day.",

    "abstract": "This study evaluates the concentration levels of PM2.5 and PM10 associated with a series of dust storm events in the Middle East during May 2022 (1–6 May, 15–17 May, and 24–27 May). A comprehensive dataset, including ERA5 reanalysis, ground air quality datasets, HYSPLIT trajectory model, and weather station observations, was utilized to identify the dynamic processes driving these dust storms. The findings reveal that the dust storms were triggered by a blocking ridge over Saudi Arabia separated by two deep troughs between north Africa and western Iran associated with a cut off low from the mid-latitudes fueled by tropical atmospheric rivers flow from Africa which enhanced unstable weather conditions over northern Arabian Peninsula. Particulate Matter (PM) concentration levels were evaluated at three Omani cities: Muscat in the north, Sur at the eastern tip, and Salalah in the south. The results indicated that dust storms affected PM10 levels in all three cities, with a significant increase in PM2.5 levels (25–80 µg m-3) in Salalah. By using the HYSPLIT trajectory model, the study identified dust emission pathways originating from Iraq and the eastern Arabian Peninsula, propagating southward. Additionally, global satellite-gridded PM2.5 estimates were used to analyze PM2.5 concentration trends in Muscat, Sur, Duqm, and Salalah from 1998 to 2021, showing an upward trend. Annual PM2.5 satellite concentrations of the year 2019 compared with and without dust and salt inclusions, indicating that mineral dusts are the primary source air pollution. Based on the satellite trend datasets of PM2.5, the results indicate a significant upward increase trend in the Middle East. According to the satellite trend datasets of PM2.5, and by using Mann-Kendall test and Thiel-Sen Salalah and Duqm have a significant upward trend compared to Muscat and Sur. Furthermore, Salalah and Duqm are found to have higher asthma rates than Muscat, due to the natural dust shield created by mountain ranges in northern Sultanate. The study concludes that PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations are significantly influenced by atmospheric conditions, topography of the area, and transport routes.",

    "abstract": "Radiological impact due to hypothetical air-borne effluent releases for an upcoming fast reactor (PFBR), at a tropical coastal site in Kalpakkam is studied using the HYSPLIT dispersion model. Short range air dispersion simulations are conducted with HYSPLIT for a weakly forced synoptic condition on 3rd March, 2008 with three turbulent diffusion methods, i.e., standard velocity deformation (A), short range isotropic similarity (B) and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) (C) schemes to assess their performance in predicting the dose distribution at a local scale. The time varying 3-d meteorological parameters for the case study are predicted using a nested grid meso-scale dynamical atmospheric model MM5. Results indicate that the velocity deformation method gives spatially more complex dose pattern while the short-range similarity and TKE methods provide smoother horizontal dose profiles. The downwind dose in different pathways due to elevated releases is found to be the highest for the method A followed by B and C. For the ground releases, the TKE method produced higher doses than the other two. The difference in the dose values from the three methods is due to the variation in the horizontal and vertical mixing calculation and the assumptions involved in the respective methods. The total dose at the site boundary from different pathways is highest from the TKE method. Values from all the methods are about one to two orders less than the values given by a Gaussian Plume model for similar atmospheric conditions. The total dose estimated from the TKE method is 20.62 mSv at the release location and 1.25 mSv at the site boundary.",

Forest fire data and satellite images obtained from 2004 to 2007 were examined. It was observed that at least three forest-fire episodes were caused by atmospheric lightning, while all other cases were recorded as anthropogenic causes, according to data gathered from the Korean meteorological and forestry services. For two episodes, there were 60~120 forest fires in North and South Korea, observations based on hotspots analysis. Smoke plumes transported over 1,200 km were observed. There was discussion of the role played by the emission of heated air and greenhouse gases in general warming and climate change in regional and global atmospheres, e.g., Arctic ice melting. With global warming, ice over the Arctic Ocean is melting significantly in summer (Chung and Le, Int J Remote Sens 25(2):front cover and 291–296, 2004). The suppression of forest fires caused by human activities is suggested to improve the atmospheric environment and to prevent climate change in the near future.",

Airborne particulate levels were found to be higher inside of buildings even when minimal activity is taking place.

Long-range transport (LRT) aerosol, coal fly ash from major coal-fired plants in RRD, and marine aerosols are regional sources, which explain the minor variability of the mass concentrations of fine particles across the region. Local sources include soil/resuspended road dust, local coal fly ash, and biomass burning. Soil/resuspended road dust is the largest source component of coarse particles at the two sites. It is more abundant in Hanoi than in Lucnam reflecting the urban-rural contrast in traffic and construction works. Receptor models reveal the incorporation of secondary sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium into the various primary particles, i.e., soot, minerals, soil organic matter, and sea salt. Soot particles from LRT carry the largest amounts of sulfate and ammonium mass concentrations measured at the two sites. Based on receptor models, the yields and possible chemical forms of secondary sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium in different types of primary particles can be inferred.",

The projects involve compiling, linking, analyzing, and disseminating environmental and health surveillance information, thereby engaging stakeholders and guiding actions to improve public health. One of the EPHT objectives is to track the public health impact of ambient air pollution with analyses that are timely and relevant to state and local stakeholders. To address methodological issues relevant to this objective, in January 2008, government officials and researchers from the USA, Canada, and Europe gathered in Baltimore, Maryland for a 2-day workshop. Using commissioned papers and presentations on key methodological issues as well as examples of previous air pollution impact assessments, work group discussions produced a set of consensus recommendations for the EPHT program. These recommendations noted the need for data that will encourage local stakeholders to support continued progress in air pollution control. The limitations of using only local data for analyses were also noted. To improve local estimates of air pollution health impacts, methods were recommended that \"borrow strength\" from other evidence. An incremental approach to implementing such methods was recommended. The importance and difficulty of communicating uncertainties in local health impact assessments was emphasized, as was the need for coordination among different agencies conducting health impact assessments.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have linked acute respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes to measurements or estimates of traffic-related air pollutants at homes or schools. However, few studies have evaluated these outdoor measurements and estimates against personal exposure measurements. We compared measured and modeled home outdoor concentrations with personal measurements of traffic-related air pollutants in the Los Angeles air basin (Whittier and Riverside). Personal exposure of 63 children with asthma and 15 homes were assessed for particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM(2.5)), elemental carbon (EC), and organic carbon (OC) during sixteen 10-day monitoring runs. Regression models to predict daily home outdoor PM(2.5), EC, and OC were constructed using home outdoor measurements, geographical and meteorological parameters, as well as CALINE4 estimates at outdoor home sites, which represent the concentrations from local traffic sources. These home outdoor models showed the variance explained (R(2)) was 0.97 and 0.94 for PM(2.5), 0.91 and 0.83 for OC, and 0.76 and 0.87 for EC in Riverside and Whittier, respectively. The PM(2.5) outdoor estimates correlated well with the personal measurements (Riverside R(2) = 0.65 and Whittier R(2) = 0.69). However, excluding potentially inaccurate samples from Riverside, the correlation between personal exposure to carbonaceous species and home outdoor estimates in Whittier was moderate for EC (R(2) = 0.37) and poor for OC (R(2) = 0.08). The CALINE4 estimates alone were not correlated with personal measurements of EC or other pollutants. While home outdoor estimates provide good approximations for daily personal PM(2.5) exposure, they may not be adequate for estimating daily personal exposure to EC and OC.

    "abstract": "Abstract Many towns and cities use passive samplers (diffusion tubes) to monitor nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) concentration. However, literature studies have shown large horizontal and vertical concentration gradients for diffusion tubes placed over short distances, raising concerns over the representativeness of monitoring locations. This study examines variations in NO 2 concentrations with height at two roadside locations along a busy urban road in Newcastle upon Tyne (UK) over an 8-month period. NO 2 concentrations were passively monitored at building facades (approximately 7.0 m from the roadside) at heights of 0.7 m, 1.7 m and 2.7 m to replicate child breathing height in prams and buggies, adult breathing height and the Newcastle City Council sampling height (for 2017), respectively. Paired t tests indicated that NO 2 concentrations were significantly lower at 2.7 m (4.7% lower, n = 16, p = 0.001) and 1.7 m (7.1% lower, n = 14, p = 0.007) compared with those at 0.7 m. There was no statistically significant difference between NO 2 concentrations measured at 2.7 m and 1.7 m, indicating that UK local authority practice of placing diffusion tubes at higher than adult breathing height does not result in underreporting of NO 2 concentrations for regulatory purposes. The results have clear public health implications as they provide evidence that young children, in an urban setting and close to busy roadways, may be exposed to higher NO 2 concentrations compared with adults in the same location. We have shown that such differences might not be adequately reflected in the monitoring data from municipal authorities.",

High-end MSAT values as ratios of the corresponding measurements at nearby air monitoring stations exceeded the microenvironmental proximity factors used in regulatory exposure models, especially for refueling operations and MEs under reduced ventilation. MSAT concentrations were apportioned between exhaust and evaporative vehicle emissions in Houston where methyl tertiary butyl ether could be used as a vehicle emission tracer. With the exception of vehicle refueling operations, the results indicate that evaporative emissions are a minor component of high-end MSAT exposure concentrations.",

This study assesses the associations between air pollution concentrations and emergency department (ED) visits for abuse of psychoactive substances. 28,745 such ED visits were identified and retrieved from a health database containing diagnosed visits from five hospitals in Edmonton (Canada) over 10 years. The ED visits were analyzed as daily counts. Conditional Poisson regression models were used to estimate the associations between the number of ED visits and concentration levels of gaseous air pollutants (carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), sulphur dioxide (SO 2 ), ozone (O 3 )) and particulate matters (PM 2.5 and PM 10 , fine and coarse, respectively). Air pollutants and weather factors in the realized statistical models were lagged by the same number of days, from 0 to 5 days. The associations were estimated in the form of concentration-response functions. The results show relative risks and their 95% confidence intervals. Positive and statistically significant associations were obtained for CO for all patients (lags from 0 to 5), males (lags 1 and 3–5), and females (lag 4). For NO 2 , exposure lagged by 1 and 2 days has a positive statistically significant association for all and male patients. PM 10 shows the same type of associations lagged by 2 and 3 days. PM 2.5 (lag 2) is associated only in females. The results indicate that urban air pollution may have an impact on the abuse of psychoactive substances.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The daily deposited dose of bioaerosols and particle mass or number in the human respiratory tract using an exposure dose model (ExDoM2) was quantified in the present study. The dose was calculated for the extrathoracic (ET), tracheobronchial (TB), and alveolar-interstitial (AI) regions of the human respiratory tract. The calculations were performed for viable, cultivable airborne heterotrophic bacteria, mesophilic fast-growing fungi, and total coliforms at a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) located at a suburban area at a Mediterranean site. The human dose was determined using data from two locations at the WWTP which correspond to two different wastewater treatment stages (aerated grit chamber (indoor) and primary settling tanks (outdoor)) and one outdoor location at the urban background site. In addition, the model simulations were performed for two exposure periods (March to April and May to June 2008). Higher daily deposited dose in the total human respiratory tract was observed for heterotrophic bacteria at the aerated grit chamber, whereas lower values of heterotrophic bacteria were observed at the primary settling tanks. These findings were associated with the corresponding stage of wastewater treatment activities and may be valuable information for determining future dose–response relationships. In addition, higher daily deposited dose was determined in the ET region for the three categories of bioaerosols. Regarding PM 10 and PN 1 , the higher daily deposited dose received by a worker at the aerated grit chamber. Finally, the hazard quotients were estimated and the results showed that the non-carcinogenic effects can be ignored for bioaerosols and PM 10 except for workers present at aerated grit chamber. Regarding PM 2.5 , the non-carcinogenic effects are of concern and cannot be ignored for all cases.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Unabated emissions of precursor gases from coal-fired power stations in South Africa greatly contribute to ambient PM 2.5 concentration in the region, but estimates of the number of associated premature mortalities vary vastly. The application of the exposure-response function is one of the reasons for the differences in estimates of premature mortalities; since the relationship between mortality and PM 2.5 exposure flattens out at higher PM 2.5 concentrations, a smaller number of premature mortalities is calculated if a reduction in PM 2.5 concentration occurs at the actual ambient concentration (“avoidable deaths”), while a greater number of mortalities is calculated if other sources are not considered (at low ambient concentrations) (“single-source deaths”). It is more appropriate to attribute deaths to a source in proportion to the contribution made by the source to ambient PM 2.5 levels (“attributable deaths”). Total ambient PM 2.5 concentrations are extrapolated from 38 ambient monitoring stations in the north-eastern region of South Africa using a regression model based on household socio-economic factors, and PM 2.5 concentrations derived from power station emissions are estimated using a reduced-form intake fraction model. It is estimated that there are around 800 attributable premature mortalities per year due to PM 2.5 from coal-fired power station emissions in South Africa. The number of premature mortalities is 44% higher when calculating single-source deaths and 53% lower when calculating avoidable deaths. Using the attributable death approach is particularly important in highly polluted areas such as low-income residential areas where households use solid and liquid fuels.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Air quality has been one of the main concerns among Tehran residents for at least two decades. In this study, we investigated air quality in the metropolitan area of Tehran utilizing TROPOMI and OMI data based on the Google Earth Engine platform. Long-term analysis indicated slight negative trends in NO 2 , SO 2 , and HCHO over the last two decades, which are due to the development of urban transportation systems. Air quality parameters were classified based on spatiotemporal similarities. Urban pollutants include CO 1 , NO 2 , and HCHO, which were concentrated over the eastern part of Tehran and decreased radially towards the city border. Among the pollutants, CO 1 showed a dependency with altitude. SO 2 was controlled by both urban vehicles and nonurban industrial activities. SO 2 was thus classified as an urban-industrial pollutant. The exterior parameters almost entirely controlled by external factors include O 3 , aerosols, and clouds. The spatial variations of the pollutants highly differed from a fraction to several times. All pollutants exhibited seasonality associated with fuel consumption and air conditions. However, the seasonality in the exterior parameters was associated with regional air masses. The Iranian New Year holiday significantly impacts air pollution. NO 2 , CO 1 , and SO 2 experienced their annual minimum levels during this holiday period. COVID-19–related closures also led to negative trends in NO 2 , CO 1 , and SO 2 after March 2020. However, the exterior parameters were not affected by these events. The results agreed with in situ measurements. As the final objective, we aimed to support urban management to reduce atmospheric pollution in Tehran.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Plants are especially useful as biological indicators to assess air pollution and the effects of urbanisation. The aim of this study was to investigate tree species’ sensitivity to air pollution using the Air Pollution Tolerance Index (APTI), the dust content (PM 10 ) of leaves, and the heavy metal concentration of leaves. Sampling sites were in a city park (urban area), a location on the edge of the city (suburban area), and a forested location (rural area) along an urbanisation gradient in the city of Vienna in Austria. Leaf samples were collected from Acer platanoides , Fraxinus excelsior , and Quercus robur tree species. The APTI was determined by measuring the content of relative water ascorbic acid and chlorophyll, and the pH of leaf extracts. We found significant difference among species in their relative water content, pH, and content of ascorbic acid and chlorophyll Additionally, we found significant differences in chlorophyll content and pH based on sampling site. The highest chlorophyll content was found in A. platanoides . There was a significant difference among species in Al, Ba, Cr, Ni, and Zn concentrations in each stage of urbanisation. Based on APTI values, the studied species were sensitive indicators of air pollution; thus, they are useful bioindicator species, and they are suitable for air pollution monitoring. We demonstrated the effects of urbanisation with these bioindicator species with elevated PM 10 , Al, Ba, Cu, Fe, Sr, and Zn concentrations in urban area samples. Graphical abstract",

    "abstract": "Previously, we found short-term increases in ambient particulate matter (PM) air pollutant concentrations were associated with increased serum fibrinogen levels in patients with cardiac disease. We now studied whether high blood levels of omega-3 (ω-3) fatty acids blunted this fibrinogen response to increased PM concentrations in these same patients. Plasma fibrinogen and ω-3 fatty acid levels (% of total identified fatty acids) were measured in blood samples collected from 135 patients treated at the University of Rochester Medical Center for myocardial infarction or stable ischemic heart disease requiring cardiac catheterization. Using ambient measurements of ultrafine, accumulation mode, and fine particles (PM2.5), Delta-C, and black carbon (BC), we regressed serum fibrinogen levels against pollutant concentrations over the previous 1-96 h, using interaction terms to estimate these associations separately for those with HIGH (> 5.12%) and LOWMED serum levels of ω-3 fatty acid (≤ 5.12%). Each 5.6 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 concentration in the previous hour was associated with a 3.1% increase in fibrinogen (95% CI = 1.5%, 4.7%) in those subjects with LOWMED total ω-3 fatty acid levels, but only a 0.9% increase (95% CI = - 1.5%, 3.2%) in patients with HIGH total ω-3 fatty acid levels. This same pattern was observed with fish oil-derived docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids but not alpha-linolenic (from plant oil or seeds). A similar finding was observed with BC in the prior 24 h, but not other PM. Thus, increased blood levels of fish-based ω-3 fatty acids attenuated increases in fibrinogen associated with short-term increases in ambient PM.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Tropospheric aerosols (total suspended particulate, TSP) were sampled at four sampling sites of various anthropogenic impact (industrial, commercial, heavy trafficked, and mixed urban influence), located in Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital of Tanzania. Air concentrations of minor and trace elements (Al, As, Br, Ca, Cd, Cl, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Pb, S, Si, Sb, and Zn) in TSP were determined by means of wavelength-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF) spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). From these data, the main ionic composition of particulate matter was inferred by means of a species correlation/ratio-derived approach, based on former studies of the region. Enrichment factors, bivariate correlations, diagnostic ratios, and chemical mass closures were calculated utilizing the concentration data of TSP constituents for each site in order to reveal the emission sources. A couple of diagnostic ratios (Ni/Cd, Zn/Cd, Br/Ni, Ni/Sb) were useful for source identification, e.g., motor vehicle exhaust and non-exhaust emissions. Significant increases in concentrations of As, Br, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn were observed, as compared to results for the city before 2010. Moreover, first-time air levels are reported for Cd and Sb, which are important markers of non-exhaust emissions. Air quality indices and calculations with the AIRQ + model have foreseen increases in the negative health effects of the sensitive groups of the local population at the study areas, especially those with heavy traffic, industrial, and/or mixed urban influence.",

All series are found to be characterised by long memory and fractional integration, with orders of integration in the range (0, 1), which implies that mean reversion occurs and shocks do not have permanent effects. Persistence is the highest in the case of Brussels, Amsterdam and London. The presence of negative trends in Brussels, Paris and Berlin indicates some degree of success in reducing pollution in these capitals.",

Much of the focus has been on diesel exhaust emissions due to a rapid increase in vehicle numbers and studies finding that this pollutant is carcinogenic. Unsurprisingly, the highest diesel exposures that the general population experiences are during urban daily commutes; however, few studies have considered professional drivers who are chronically exposed to the pollutant due to their work in transport microenvironments. In this narrative review, we address the literature on professional drivers’ exposure to diesel exhaust and advocate that a modern exposure science approach utilised in commuter personal exposure studies is needed. This type of evaluation will provide a more detailed understanding of the time-activity of professional drivers’ exposures which is required to identify specific interventions to reduce their risk to diesel exhaust emissions.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease knocked in Wuhan city of China in December 2019 which spread quickly across the world and infected millions of people within a short span of time. COVID-19 is a fast-spreading contagious disease which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2). Accurate time series forecasting modeling is the need of the hour to monitor and control the universality of COVID-19 effectively, which will help to take preventive measures to break the ongoing chain of infection. India is the second highly populated country in the world and in summer the temperature rises up to 50°, nowadays in many states have more than 40° temperatures. The present study deals with the development of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to predict the trend of the number of COVID-19 infected people in most affected states of India and the effect of a rise in temperature on COVID-19 cases. Cumulative data of COVID-19 confirmed cases are taken for study which consists of 77 sample points ranging from 1st March 2020 to 16th May 2020 from six states of India namely Delhi (Capital of India), Madya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. The developed ARIMA model is further used to make 1-month ahead out of sample predictions for COVID-19. The performance of ARIMA models is estimated by comparing measures of errors for these six states which will help in understanding future trends of COVID-19 outbreak. Temperature rise shows slightly negatively correlated with the rise in daily cases. This study is noble to analyse the variation of COVID-19 cases with respect to temperature and make aware of the state governments and take precautionary measures to flatten the growth curve of confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections in other states of India, nearby countries as well.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) started in late 2019 in Wuhan, China. Subsequently, the disease was disseminated in several cities around the world, where measures were taken to control the spread of the virus through the adoption of quarantine (social isolation and closure of commercial sectors). This article analyzed the environmental impact of the COVID-19 outbreak in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, regarding the variations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the atmosphere. NO2 data from the AURA satellite, in the period before the beginning of the epidemic (2005-2019) and during the adoption of the preventive and control measures of COVID-19 in 2020, were acquired and compared. The results obtained from the analysis showed that the blockade from COVID-19, beginning in March 2020, improved air quality in the short term, but as soon as coal consumption in power plants and refineries returned to normal levels (since June 2020), due to the resumption of works, the pollution levels returned to the level of the previous years of 2020. NO2 levels showed a significant decrease, since they were mainly associated with the decrease in economic growth and transport restrictions that led to a change in energy consumption and a reduction in emissions. This study can complement the scientific community and policy makers for environmental protection and public management, not only to assess the impact of the outbreak on air quality, but also for its effectiveness as a simple alternative program of action to improve air quality.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Aerosol chemical components such as black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) regulate aerosol optical properties, which in turn drive the atmospheric radiative forcing estimations due to aerosols. In this study, we used the long-term measurements from AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) to better understand the aerosol types and composition with respect to their seasonal and spatial variabilities in peninsular Southeast Asia (PSEA, here defined as Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Laos, and Myanmar). Two methods (i.e., aerosol type cluster and aerosol component retrieval) were applied to determine the aerosol type and chemical composition during the biomass-burning (BB) season. AERONET sites in northern PSEA showed a higher AOD (aerosol optical depth) compared to that of southern PSEA. Differences in land use pattern, geographic location, and weather regime caused much of the aerosol variability over PSEA. Lower single-scattering albedo (SSA) and higher fine-mode fraction (FMF) values were observed in February and March, suggesting the predominance of BB type aerosols with finer and stronger absorbing particles during the dry season. However, we also found that the peak BB month (i.e., March) in northern PSEA may not coincide with the lowest SSA once dust particles have mixed with the other aerosols. Furthermore, we investigated two severe BB events in March of 2014 and 2015, revealing a significant BrC fraction during BB event days. On high AOD days, although the BC fraction was high, the BrC fraction remained low due to lack of aerosol aging. This study highlights the dominance of carbonaceous aerosols in the PSEA atmosphere during the BB season, while also revealing that transported dust particles and BrC aerosol aging may introduce uncertainties into the aerosol radiative forcing calculation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Atmospheric dispersion models are applied to describe and predict the dispersion of emitted plumes. Here, we describe the Lagrangian Atmospheric Radionuclide Transport Model (ARTM) 2.8.0 which was developed to simulate the atmospheric dispersion of the emissions of nuclear facilities under routine operation for regulatory purposes over annual time scales. ARTM includes a diagnostic wind field model and a particle dispersion model. It simulates size-dependent wet and dry deposition, plume rise and γ -cloud shine of radioactive exhaust plumes in the simulation domain. This work presents an extensive overview of the different components of the model and of the physical and mathematical concepts of ARTM. We investigate the dependence of the plume dispersion in terms of plume volume, position of maximum concentration and dry deposition rates on key input parameters such as atmospheric stability, surface roughness, zero plane displacement height, source height and the particle size in the case of particulate matter tracers. The results indicate a strong dependence of plume volume and position of the maximum concentration on the stability as well as a minor influence on surface roughness. The source height above ground level has a low impact on the plume volume as the zero plane displacement only slightly affects the position of maximum concentration. Strong turbulence under unstable conditions tends to reduce the impact of sedimentation and decreases deposition in general. This computational model serves to advance the understanding of the dispersion of radioactive plumes in the boundary layer.",

    "abstract": "In this issue, Krzyzanowski and Cohen summarize the recent World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality Guidelines (AQG). Their article and the WHO reports remind us that despite well-documented progress in many developed nations, the effects of air pollution on public health remain a significant concern worldwide. WHO’s estimates of the annual burden of disease attributable to urban air pollution are on the order of a million premature deaths and more than three million life years lost, not counting hospital admissions, illness, and lost productivity. The rising global background of air pollutants also reaches those living in smaller urban and rural areas. Estimated risk and impacts are greatest in developing areas of Asia where pollutant exposures rival those experienced in the USA and Europe in the 1950s and 1960s. Yet, in the USA and Europe, the burden of ill health from air pollution still constitutes tens of thousands of premature deaths and millions of cases of illness that have an estimated monetary cost of many billions of dollars. These estimates make clear that air pollution persists as a national and global public health concern. As Krzyzanowski and Cohen note, the efforts of WHO and others to update, interpret, and produce impact assessments based on advances in scientific information for key air pollutants are also valuable by providing guidance and also an impetus for action for the many countries who do not have the infrastructure to develop their own. The history of air pollution over the twentieth century shows that newly industrialized areas sustained horrendous levels of smoke and sulfur pollution for decades until welldocumented pollutant episodes made an unequivocal linkage between air pollution and health in the minds of the public and of policy makers. Later, incorporation of health-based air quality goals and standards proved to be a major driver in the processes that have led to continuing improvements in air quality as well as in the scientific understanding of the health effects of air pollution. As the WHO report documents, the scientific evidence documents effects at ever lower concentrations, giving a basis for strengthening of air quality standards and guidelines. The WHO Working Group had to address the complex issue of translating scientific information into public health policy, with the additional complication that the guidelines were intended to be useful for nations with widely varying environmental, economic, social, and political conditions. Among the vexing issues is how to draw lines applicable to all nations for pollutants with no obvious threshold below which effects do not occur. The new Guidelines improved on the previous WHO approach by coupling a recommended guideline with a series of interim targets to promote continuing improvements in places with the most severe problems. Their rationale includes an assessment of the evidence and risk, with a precautionary or public health oriented perspective. Not surprisingly, the science-policy judgments of the authors of the WHO Guidelines differs from those made by a contemporary panel of independent scientists advising the US EPA. The latter group recommended somewhat higher levels of particles. For the future, we need to learn whether and where these new Guidelines help.

The direct effects of hydrocarbon contaminants in the air are particularly important such as their carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic effects which can be transported to other environments via dry and wet deposition. In the present study, rainwater samples were collected and analyzed for 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene (BTEX) as well as fuel fingerprints in two ranges of gasoline (C5-C11) and diesel fuel (C12-C20) using a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (GC/FID). Mean concentrations of summation operator16 PAHs varied between 372 and 527 microg/L and for BTEX was between 87 and 188 microg/L with maximum of 36 microg/L for toluene. Both gasoline range hydrocarbons (GRH) and diesel range hydrocarbons (DRH) were also present in the collected rainwater at concentrations of 190 and 950 microg/L, respectively. Hydrocarbon transports from air to soil were determined in this wet deposition. Average hydrocarbon transportation for summation operatorPAHs, BTEX, GRH, and DRH was 2,747, 627, 1,152, and 5,733 microg/m(2), respectively.",

We investigated this process, along with primary aerosol emissions, by briefly placing a citronella tealight candle in a smog chamber and then adding ozone to the chamber. In repeated experiments, we observed rapid and substantial SOA formation after ozone addition; this process must therefore be considered when assessing the risks and benefits of using citronella candle to repel insects.",

Information on rhinoconjunctivitis (defined as self-reported nose symptoms without a cold or flu accompanied by itchy watery eyes in the past 12 months) was available on 505,400 children aged 13-14 years, in 183 centres in 83 countries. Centre-level prevalence estimates were calculated and linked geographically with estimates of long-term average concentrations of NO2, ozone and PM2.5. Multi-level models were fitted adjusting for population density, climate, sex and gross national income. Information on parental smoking, truck traffic and cooking fuel was available for a restricted set of centres (77 in 36 countries). Between centres within countries, the estimated change in rhinoconjunctivitis prevalence per 100 children was 0.171 (95% confidence interval: - 0.013, 0.354) per 10% increase in PM2.5, 0.096 (- 0.003, 0.195) per 10% increase in NO2 and - 0.186 (- 0.390, 0.018) per 1 ppbV increase in ozone. Between countries, rhinoconjunctivitis prevalence was significantly negatively associated with both ozone and PM2.5. In the restricted dataset, the latter association became less negative following adjustment for parental smoking and open fires for cooking. In conclusion, there were no significant within-country associations of rhinoconjunctivitis prevalence with study pollutants. Negative between-country associations with PM2.5 and ozone require further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The reliability of air quality simulations has a strong dependence on the input emissions inventories, which are associated with various sources of uncertainties, particularly in regions undergoing rapid emission changes where inventories can be ‘out of date’ almost as soon as they are compiled. This work provides a new methodology for updating emissions inventories by source sector using air quality ensemble simulations and observations from a dense monitoring network. It is adopted to determine the short-term trends in carbon monoxide (CO) emissions, an important pollutant and precursor to tropospheric ozone, in a study area centred around Beijing following the implementation of clean air policies. We sample the uncertainties associated with using an a priori emissions inventory for the year 2013 in air quality simulations of 2016, using an atmospheric dispersion model combined with a perturbed emissions ensemble (PEE), which is constructed based on expert-elicited uncertainty ranges for individual source sectors in the inventory. By comparing the simulation outputs with observational constraints, we are able to constrain the emissions of key source sectors relative to those in the a priori emissions inventory. From 2013 to 2016, we find a 44–88% reduction in the transport sector emissions (0.92–4.4×10 5 Mg in 2016) and a minimum 61% decrease in residential sector emissions (&lt;3.5×10 5 Mg in 2016) within the study area. We also provide evidence that the night-time fraction of traffic sources in 2016 was higher than that in the 2013 emissions inventory. This study shows the applicability of PEEs and high-resolution observations in providing timely updates of emission estimates by source sector.",

Results indicate that O3 was 5.6% lower and 13.7% higher than previous years during the lockdown at rural and suburban sites, respectively. NO2 decreased by 50.7% in urban areas, but increased slightly in agricultural regions, consistent with satellite observations. PM concentrations did not change significantly compared to previous years; however, a reduction in the signal variability in the smaller size particle measurements may be the result of different emission sources. The reduction in NO2 likely increased the ratio of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to NOx (nitrogen oxides), creating a NOx limited environment, which resulted in an initial increase in O3 in suburban areas, and the lower than usual levels observed at rural sites. Meteorology showed higher than average wind speeds prior to lockdown, which likely acted to disperse PM and NO2.",

    "abstract": "The outbreak of the COVID-19 virus in 2020 has left many changes in the quality of life and environment, including air quality in different parts of the world. As a result of lockdown conditions, the level of air pollution has been changed considerably due to topographic, geographical, and cultural conditions as well as traffic restrictions. Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effect COVID-19 outbreak on improving air quality as a result of changes in traffic volume and traffic patterns in Queens, New York, using the moderation and mediation analysis model structure. In this model, COVID-19 outbreak periods were defined as a moderating variable, traffic volume (number of daily vehicles) as an independent variable and mediator, and air pollution concentration parameters (NOx, PM2.5, and O3) individually as dependent variables. Three-time periods were selected, each representing the duration and severity of traffic restrictions and prohibitions, and these three periods corresponded to 1 February–4 March, 5 March–21 March, and 22 March–15 May. They represented the normal, aware, and lockdown periods, respectively. The result of the study showed that in 2020 compared to the last five consecutive years, PM2.5 and NOx pollutants decreased by 39.2% and 35.8% as a result of the traffic ban due to the COVID-19, but an increase of 15.1% in O3 pollutant was observed in the mentioned period. Although traffic restrictions reduced total traffic volume compared to the same period last year, there has been no significant reduction in the air quality index (AQI). The reduction in NOx concentration leads to more O3 ground levels, and this caused the AQI not to decrease significantly. Finally, the moderation and mediation model results showed that the COVID-19 almost has no significant effect on the correlation between daily traffic and the concentration of NOx, PM2.5, and O3 pollutants as moderator. However, the COVID-19 has a significant correlation with O3 and PM2.5 concentration, and the traffic volume mediation effect is negligible. Therefore, the statistical analysis and models show that the COVID-19 pandemic is an effective traffic volume and air quality parameter.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Smart farming (SF) has emerged as a scientific approach exploiting technology advances for the management of agricultural practices, focusing on the control of resources and chemicals used. There is still limited evidence in the scientific literature in regard to the efficiency of SF, particularly for targeted environmental issues, such as air pollutant emissions from agricultural activities. The present paper expoits quantitative data collected from questionnaires to farmers of 6 pilot areas in Greece, participating in the LIFE GAIA Sense project. Emissions and pollutant levels were calculated for two consecutive years in these pilot areas, namely 2019 (baseline year) and 2020, which is the first SF application year. The methodology for calculating realistic emissions data, following a combined tier 1/tier2 approach is presented. To this purpose, detailed activity data of the specific SF application areas related to agricultural activities were acquired, based on the responses of participating farmers to targeted questionnaires. Calculated emissions were used as input data for air quality modeling simulations to examine the efficiency of SF in reducing local pollutant concentrations. The results show significant emissions and concentrations reductions in five out of the six pilot areas, for all pollutants and greenhouse gases studied, due to the decrease in fuel consumption and N fertilizer applied, as a result of the farmers following the SF advice. Particularly for NH 3 , which is an agricultural air pollutant of concern due to its health and environmental impacts, emission reductions of around 30% (and by up to almost 60%) were calculated.",

    "abstract": "The study of the different pollutants present in atmospheric aerosols such as trace elements and radionuclides is essential to assess the air quality. To analyze the particulate matter (PM), atmospheric filters with different dimensions and geometries (rectangular, circular, slotted, and square filters) are usually employed. Regarding the pollutants existing in atmospheric aerosols, radionuclides are usually analyzed due to their multiple applications such as either in the environmental radiological control or as tracers of atmospheric processes. Therefore, this study aims to develop a new and general methodology to calibrate in efficiency coaxial Ge detectors to properly determine radionuclides present in the PM by gamma-ray spectrometry for several filter types. For this, granular certified reference materials (CRM) containing only natural radionuclides (238U-series, 232Th-series, and 40 K) were selected. Several granular solid CRMs were chosen allowing us to reproduce the same PM deposition geometry and to assure the homogeneity of the added CRMs. These are the main advantages in relation to the typical methods that use liquid CRMs. Furthermore, for filters whose surfaces are relatively large, they were cut in several pieces and placed one on top of the other, achieving the same geometry than the PM deposited onto the filter. Then, the experimental full-energy peak efficiencies (FEPEs) were obtained for each energy of interest (Eγ) and they were fitted versus Eγ, finding a general FEPE function for each filter type. Finally, this methodology was validated for both natural and artificial radionuclides (from 46 to 1332 keV) by using different filter types employed in proficiency test exercises, obtaining |zscore|< 2 for all cases.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11869-023-01336-x.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Recent studies conducted in the USA have shown that adverse health effects of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) persist at levels below the national air quality standards. More recently, particle radioactivity has also been associated with adverse health effects. However, the importance of particle radioactivity at low PM 2.5 levels has not been thoroughly explored. The present paper investigates the temporal trends and the relationship of particle gross β-activity (PM-β) and PM 2.5 mass in the 48 states of the contiguous USA during the period of 2001–2017. With the implementation of stringent air pollution control policies, national ambient PM 2.5 concentrations decreased by 38.5% during this period. However, a smaller decrease of 9.4% was observed for PM-β, while the mean PM-β/PM 2.5 ratio increased by 49.1%. PM-β is mostly associated with radon emissions and its progeny, which do not change much with time. The largest PM 2.5 and PM-β reductions were observed in the Southeast, while the smallest were found in the West. When the aggregated PM-β to PM 2.5 ratio is stratified by PM 2.5 levels, the ratio was found to be highest when PM 2.5 is &lt;3 μg/m 3 , with a median PM-β to PM 2.5 ratio of 0.77 (0.64–0.88; 25th–75th percentiles). Overall, when not stratified by PM 2.5 levels, the greatest state-wide overall PM-β /PM 2.5 ratios were found in Wyoming (0.69) and South Dakota (0.51), areas with higher radon, while the lowest (0.17) were in Delaware followed by New Jersey (0.18). These results indicate that the ratio of ambient particle radioactivity to particle mass concentration typically is higher at low PM 2.5 levels, and consequently, the toxicity per unit mass is expected to be higher.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Among non-exhaust emissions, road dust resuspension represents a rather important contribution to particulate matter in urban areas. This study aimed to achieve a chemical characterisation of road dust particulate matter (PM 10 ) on two motorway sections, one rural and one urban, and to explore the related health and ecotoxicological risks. Measured PM 10 dust loadings reached very low levels (0.66–1.49 mg m -2 ) compared to equivalent studies in other road environments in Portugal and other countries. Emission factors ranged from 33 to 62 mg veh −1 km −1 . The carbonaceous content represented 14% of the total PM 10 mass, whereas the highest contribution to the mass was given by mineral matter. Elements such as Si, Al, Ca, Fe and K accounted for almost three quarters of the total element mass for all samples, whilst Cu and Zn, mostly associated with brake and tyre wear, were the most enriched elements in relation to the soil composition. Nonetheless, Ti and Zr presented the highest non-carcinogenic risks for human health. Despite the low amounts of particulate matter in the aqueous solution, the ecotoxicological screening with the Aliivibrio fisheri bioluminescence inhibition bioassay allowed to classify the samples as toxic.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This article puts a perspective to the health risks of smoke from lithium-ion battery (LIB) fires by retrospect simulations of the large-scale event in a warehouse in Morris, IL, USA where about 60 metric tonnes of LIB set on fire on of June 29, 2021. Possible scenarios are sketched where ground concentration maps of PM 2.5 reveal large areas of tens of square kilometres exceeding the action levels set up by the authorities for the event. Besides high concentration in the close vicinity, the plume touchdown is found to be located 5–10 km away from the source. In contrast, irritant gases including HF did not exceed the action levels. The reconstruction of the event was conducted using details from interviews with the owner and first-responders on site, which subsequently was used as input data to a Lagrangian atmospheric transport model. Plume rise due to buoyant flux in a Lagrangian dispersion model was accomplished by adding a vertical speed component derived from discretization of the well-known Briggs formulation. Emission factors were collected from the published scientific literature and implemented in combination with warehouse inventory and visual observations. The importance of this work becomes apparent in view of the rapid increase of LIB’s in, e.g., transportation and energy storage with accompanied fire accidents. These findings support precautions in infrastructure handling LIBs and particularly in large amounts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Formaldehyde is a toxic and carcinogenic compound, still used in several occupational settings due to its properties. Thus, in these working scenarios, it is necessary to provide effective measures to reduce workers’ exposure to formaldehyde. The aim of this systematic review is to provide a picture of the worldwide mitigation strategies implemented in occupational environments for minimizing the exposure to formaldehyde and which ones are the most effective for this purpose. The systematic review was performed according to PRISMA statement; the protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022302207). The search was performed on three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science). Studies were considered eligible if they describe strategies for mitigating formaldehyde occupational exposure and their efficacy. We included articles reporting observational studies, semi-experimental, and experimental studies and published in the English language, from the inception to March 26th, 2023. The quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. In total, 28 articles were included in the review. The employment scenarios/activities studied were human and veterinary anatomy, autopsy, histopathology or pathology laboratories, embalming procedures, hospital, operating theaters, aquaculture, textile or foundry industries, industry using 3-D printers, offices, and firefighters’ activities. Different methods have proven useful in mitigating formaldehyde exposure, such as the use of personal protective equipment, engineering control methods, organization methods, and technical strategies, with a reduction of airborne formaldehyde until to 99.6%. The highest reduction was obtained in an anatomy laboratory through locally exhausted dissection tables equipped with activated carbon filters. The specific suitable procedures should be standardized and applied in all work settings for an appropriate risk management, in order to protect the health of exposed workers.",

The presence of particles improved the particulate-laden SO(2) removal efficiency to about 15% that was elucidated by the facilitated adsorptive mass transport. Experimentation revealed that nearly 100% removal efficiency of particulate-laden SO(2) was achievable without any additives or pretreatment under certain operating condition of the scrubber. An empirical correlation was developed to predict the performance of the modified tapered scrubber. Experimental values fitted excellently well with the predicted values through the correlation (within +/-5% deviation). The performance of the modified tapered bubble scrubber with column internals has been found to be better than a tapered bubble column without any internals.",

    "abstract": "Poor air quality and related health impacts are still an issue in many cities and regions worldwide. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) can support the design of measures to reduce the emissions of precursors affecting air pollution. In this study, we apply the SHERPA (screening for high emission reduction potentials for air quality) model to compare spatial and sectoral emission reductions, given country-scale emission targets. Different approaches are tested: (a) country \"uniform\" emission reductions, (b) emission reductions targeting urban areas, (c) emission reductions targeting preferential sectors. As a case study, we apply the approaches to the implementation of the National Emission Ceiling Directive. Results are evaluated in terms of the reduction in average population exposure to PM2.5 overall in a country and in its main cities. Results indicate that the reduction of population exposure to PM2.5 highly depends on the way emission reductions are implemented. This work also shows the usefulness of the SHERPA model to support national authorities implementing national emission reduction targets while, at the same time, addressing their local air quality issues.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Urban air quality is determined by a complex interaction of factors associated with anthropogenic emissions, atmospheric circulation, and geographic factors. Most of the urban-present pollution aerosols and trace gases are toxic to human health and responsible for damage of flora, fauna, and materials. The air quality prediction system based on state-of-the-art Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) has been configured and designed for North Macedonia. An extensive set of experiments have been performed with different model settings to forecast simultaneously the weather and air quality over the country. The initial results and the finding from other similar studies suggest that chemical initialization plays a significant role in a more accurate, both qualitative and quantitative forecast and assessment of urban air pollution. The main objective of the present research is to develop and test for a novel chemical initialization input in the air quality forecast system in North Macedonia. It is performed using ensemble technique in respect to treatment of the mobile emissions data using scaling factors. The WRF-Chem prediction has shown a high sensitivity to different scaling methods. While scaling of the overall mobile annual emissions tends to produce some discrepancies regarding the PM 10 concentration level (overestimation during summer and underestimation during winter), an improved approach that utilizes scaling, in a wider range, only the mobile emissions originated from household heating offers the possibility of more detailed parameter fitting. The verification results indicate that the best accuracy across all scores for the winter months was achieved when scaling up the baseline pollutant input using a higher factor, while in the other seasons, the best results were achieved when scaling down the baseline pollutant emissions by a significant factor. Taking all into account, we can conclude that the seasonal variation in the pollutant input to the atmosphere is a significant factor in simulating the pollution in this region. Therefore, these seasonal variations must be taken into account when fitting the pollutant emission input to any model.",

Aerosols are a leading cause of death and well-known vector for infectious diseases. Yet, passenger exposure to aerosols during long-distance train travel is surprisingly underexplored. Two small, light-weight personal monitoring instruments were employed during a train journey across Europe, to measure the fine particle (PM 2.5 ) and equivalent black carbon (eBC) passenger exposure, respectively. The journey was divided into three legs, inside three different trains, and two layovers in city environments. Highest mean concentrations of PM 2.5 and eBC were found within the oldest train type, and revealed PM 2.5 concentrations of 58.4 ± 12.7 μg m −3 and eBC of 5.4 ± 2.9 μg m −3 . The more modern the train system was, the lower the measured concentrations were to be found. In the newest tested system, the air quality was considerably better inside the train than outdoor air measured by a monitoring network, or simulated by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) model ensemble analysis. The mean PM 2.5 concentration was roughly 20% lower inside the train than the outdoor air simulated by CAMS. Both the light-weight personal monitoring and the monitoring network indicate that the CAMS ensemble substantially underestimates PM 2.5 concentrations for the day of the journey. Effective ventilation and air filtration significantly decrease the passenger’s aerosol exposure, as compared to a stay in outdoor air, leading to a small statistical increase in life expectancy. If this could also reduce the risk of contagion with an infectious disease remains to be explored.",

    "abstract": "Abstract We quantified the foreign and domestic contributions to annual mean elemental carbon (EC) concentration over South Korea in 2016 using the Primary Carbon Appointment tool in the community multiscale air quality model. The individual domestic contributions were further examined by emission source category (area, mobile, and point) in each sub-region (i.e., Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA), Gangwon, Chungcheong, Youngnam, and Honam). EC contribution and population-weighted exposure contribution (PWEC) for each emission source were calculated. Two indicators were compared and adjusted considering uncertainties of emissions from sub-regions. Based on the results of this analysis, the primary EC emission sources that need to be managed to alleviate the concentrations and PWECs were classified, and the cost-effectiveness was compared with contribution rates for EC and PWEC. The modeled annual mean EC concentration in South Korea was 0.6 µg/m 3 , of which 54% was contributed by foreign sources (0.3 µg/m 3 ). However, the quarterly foreign contribution differed by up to five times depending on the monsoon, while the domestic contribution did not. Simultaneously, spatial variations of the annual mean EC contributions are smaller than those of the foreign contributions. Regardless of the uncertainty of emissions, domestic PWEC was 20% higher than the domestic concentration as domestic EC emissions were concentrated in densely populated areas. It implies that EC emission control has more significant meaning not only to improve concentration but also to improve population exposure. In addition, the contribution rate showed greater variation between sub-regions than the EC emission source categories within a region. Considering this, if the cost used to reduce a unit EC emission is the same, the cost effect can be expected when EC emissions are reduced in the sub-regions with a large contribution rate regardless of EC emission source category.",

    "abstract": "During spring 2020, unprecedented changes in local and regional emissions have occurred around the globe due to governmental restrictions associated with COVID-19. Many European countries including Austria issued partial curfews or stay-at-home order policies, which have impacted ambient air quality through reductions in non-essential transportation and energy consumption of industrial sites and work places. Here, we analyse the effect of these measures on ambient concentrations of nitrogen oxides (NOx), ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM10) during the first nationwide lockdown in Austria (16.03.2020 to 14.04.2020). To ensure a robust analysis, the Austrian domain is divided into four individual subsectors contingent on regional climate. For air quality analysis a novel method is applied for filtering days with comparable weather conditions during the 2020 lockdown and spring 2017 to 2019. In general, our analysis shows decreasing pollutant concentrations, although in magnitude dependent on pollutant and regional subdomain. Largest reductions are found for NOx reaching up to -68% at traffic sites reflecting the substantial decrease in non-essential transport. Changes in the O3 concentrations at background sites show a rather weak response to NOx declines varying between roughly -18 to +8% for both the median and the upper tail of the distribution. Occasional site level increases in O3 concentrations can be attributed to comparably weak titration during night-time. PM10 concentrations show the smallest response among air pollutants, attributable to manifold precursor sources not affected by the lockdown measures. However, our analysis indicates also a shift of PM10 distributions at traffic sites closer to distributions observed at background sites.

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite that large percentages of individual daily time is spent in the home, few studies have examined the relationship between indoor particulate matter (PM) exposure in residential settings with subclinical indicators of cardiovascular risk. This cross-sectional study investigated associations between exposure to fine (PM 2.5 ) and ultrafine (UFP) PM in domestic indoor environments, with central blood pressure (BP) and component BP measures (pulse pressure, augmented pressure [AP], augmentation index [AIx], mean arterial pressure, pulse wave velocity [PWV]) in 40 non-smoking, otherwise healthy adults (58% women) living in Perth, Western Australia. Overall, in adjusted models, an interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM 2.5 was associated with a 3.2 mmHg (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99, 5.45) higher diastolic BP, and a 1.8 mmHg lower AP (95%CI: − 3.63, − 0.01) and 0.4 m/s PWV (95%CI: − 0.80, − 0.08), respectively. For the UFP fraction, an IQR increase was associated with a 5.2% higher AIx (95%CI: 0.51, 9.97) and a 0.6 m/s lower PWV (95%CI: − 1.00, − 0.11). When stratified by sex, higher UFP concentrations were associated with higher DBP and lower PWV among women. Among men, higher UFP concentrations were associated with lower AP. Exposure to domestic indoor fine and ultrafine PM was associated with preclinical indicators of cardiovascular risk and some of these relationships were affected by sex. These findings contribute important evidence linking low-level residential indoor PM exposure with measurable impacts on cardiovascular physiology and may inform preventative recommendations as part of risk profiles for susceptible individuals.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The combustion of petroleum-based fossil fuels is associated with a high environmental burden. Several alternative fuels, including synthetic fuels (e.g., gas-to-liquid, GTL) and biofuels (e.g., rapeseed methyl ester, RME) have been studied in the last few years. While the advantages for the environment (sustainability of biofuels) are well known, research on the resulting health effects from combustion aerosols of these alternative fuels is still scarce. Consequently, we investigated the chemical combustion profile from three distinct fuel types, including a petroleum-based fossil fuel (B0) and two alternative fuels (GTL, RME) under real exposure conditions. We sampled particulate matter (PM 2.5 , PM 0.25 ) and the gas phase from heavy-duty machinery and evaluated the general pattern of volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds, elemental and organic carbon as well as a range of transition metals in the size segregated PM and/or gas phase. The use of comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry enabled us to classify distinct methylated PAHs in the PM samples and its high abundance, especially in the fine fraction of PM. We found that (methylated) PAHs were highly abundant in the PM of B0 compared to GTL and RME. Highest concentrations of targeted aromatic species in the gas phase were released from B0. In summary, we demonstrated that GTL and RME combustion released lower amounts of chemical compounds related to adverse health effects, thus, the substitution of petroleum-based fuels could improve air quality for human and the environment.",

For each dust sample collected, the 36 Environmental Relative Moldiness Index (ERMI) molds were quantified using qPCR assays, and then Shannon Diversity Index (SDI) values for the fungal populations were calculated. Homes were in five separate regions, regarding their proximity in the studied area. We found that for regions with reported least water damage, the SDI values were similar for both sampled years, but for regions that reported mid-to-high level of damage region, the SDI values were significantly higher. Households that reported remediation actions between the two sampled years showed similar values for the second year as those that did not report any major impact. Our preliminary data provides insights into the significant impacts of hurricanes into indoor fungal environment.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Background The majority of studies examining long-term exposure to ambient ozone have utilized averages as the exposure parameter. However, averaging ozone exposures may underestimate the impact of ozone peaks and seasonality. The current study aimed to examine the association between ozone exposure evaluated by different exposure metrics and lung function in healthy adolescents. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study among 665 healthy adolescent males living within a 2 km radius of an ozone monitoring station. Multiple ozone exposure metrics were evaluated, including two-year and peak-season averages, peaks, peak intensity, and the total excess of peak level. Lung function was measured using FEV 1 , FVC, and FEV 1 /FVC ratio. Results The peak intensity during the ozone peak-season was associated with the largest decrease in the FEV 1 /FVC ratio, -1.52% (95%CI: -2.55%, -0.49%) ( p &lt; 0.01). Concurrently, we did not observe a significant association between ozone exposure, assessed by different metrics, and either FEV 1 or FVC. Conclusions The study findings suggest that when evaluating ambient ozone exposures, ozone peak intensity during peak-season should be considered, as it may predict greater adverse health effects than averages alone.",

The aim of this work is to provide a simpler model, easily adaptable to other regions and capable of estimating nitrogen dioxide concentrations to a good approximation. To this end, we examine the relationship between daily and annual nitrogen dioxide values. We find that this relationship depends on the range of daily values. Then we provide a statistical model capable of estimating daily concentrations over large areas on a fine spatial scale. The model’s performance is compared with standard geostatistical method such as external drift kriging with cross-validation over one year. The reduced computation time means that daily maps can be produced for use by French air quality observatories.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global health, with millions of people affected by the disease. Recent studies have shown that environmental factors such as air quality, temperature, and humidity can impact the survival and transmission of the virus, leading to differences in the rate of spread and severity of the disease in different regions. In this global cross-sectional study, we analyzed the relationship between environmental factors and the transmission and survival of the virus in 167 cities distributed all over the world. We used a dataset containing daily COVID-19 data for 167 cities from 01/05/2020 to 01/01/2022, along with variables related to atmospheric and environmental conditions. We found an expected positive relationship between increases in atmospheric NO 2 concentration and increases in the infective rate of COVID-19. We also found an unexpected negative relationship between PM10 and COVID-19 spread, which was stronger in unpolluted cities, and indicating a likely stronger and faster deactivation of the viruses by the absorption to the larger than to the smaller particles, to PM10 more than to PM2.5. Although a complete analysis would require taking into account the restrictions in the city and the immunization status of the population, and the variance of COVID-19 spread explained by PM10 was small, only up to approx. 2%, these results contribute to a better understanding of the impact of particles on the spread of COVID-19 and other respiratory viral diseases thus informing public health policies and interventions aimed at mitigating the impact of these pandemics.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Due to developing aviation sector, number of aircraft in the world is increasing. Along with this development, problems such as the decrease in air quality in and around the airport also arise. In this study, it is tried to calculate pollutant emissions occurring in 2022 during the LTO cycles of Denizli Çardak Airport in Turkey. These calculations are based on the information obtained from ICAO Engine Emission Data Bank and flight information published by the General Directorate of State Airports Authority (GDSAA). As a result of the data obtained, 74.64 ton/year pollutants (NOx-37.148 t/y, CO-35.398 t/y and HC-2.094 t/y) were calculated for 2022 at Denizli Çardak Airport. Of all emissions, NOx accounted for 50%, CO 47% and HC 3%. In the LTO cycle, the most fuel is burned in taxi cycle and pollutant emissions produced in this cycle are greater. With a 2 min reduction in taxi time, there will be an approximate 6.8% reduction in the total emission rate in the LTO cycle. Similarly, with a 4 min reduction in taxi time, there will be a 13.72% reduction in the whole emission rate in the LTO cycle. Unlike other studies, in this study the emission rates of various engines were compared. It has been calculated that the amount of pollutant emissions produced by the new generation Boeing 737 MAX LEAP-1B powered aircraft in LTO cycle is 25% less than the amount of pollutant emissions produced by the Airbus A320 NEO LEAP-1 A powered aircraft. The biggest factor here is that the emission of CO pollutants is less. Considering the emission rates produced by these four different engines (B737-800 CFM56-7B, A320 V2500-A1, B737 MAX LEAP-1B, A320 NEO LEAP-1 A), the Airbus A320 V2500-A1 engine is a more environmentally friendly engine than the other engines.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Asthma exacerbations are a leading cause of emergency department (ED) visits in children. Outdoor exposures such as air pollutants and meteorological factors have been associated with risk of asthma exacerbations. We evaluated the association between ambient temperature, relative humidity, and air quality on pediatric asthma-related ED visits in Montréal, Canada. In this retrospective study, we included children ≤ 17 years presenting with asthma to two pediatric EDs between January 1, 2017 and December 31st, 2020. Temperature and relative humidity data were obtained daily for Montréal through Weather Source™ and the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) through Environment Canada. We evaluated the association between environmental exposures and the incidence of asthma-related ED visits using a quasi-Poisson regression analysis, adjusting for seasonality. We examined 21 201 asthma-related ED visits. Increased temperature was associated with an increased number of asthma-related ED visits. Compared to the reference decile (2.8 to 7.5⁰C), the strongest association with incident ED visits was for a temperature of 15.8 to 19.3⁰C, associated with a 37% increase in the number of asthma-related ED visits (IRR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.22, 1.54). Current day relative humidity, AQHI, and changes of the exposure levels over the previous 1 to 7 days did not have an effect on asthma-related ED visits. Adjusting for seasonality, higher temperatures were associated with an increased number of asthma-related ED visits among children while humidity and air quality were not. At a population level, this can inform hospitals of upcoming trends in ED visits.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Swimming pools and spas require a high hygiene level, and therefore constant cleaning. In this study, cleaning workers’ exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), trichloramine (TCA), and particulate matter (PM) in the swimming pools and spas were evaluated. Also, statistical methods were employed to determine what activities affect the exposure to disinfection byproducts (DBPs). The study was conducted in 32 swimming pools and spas. The measurement locations were pool areas, bathrooms, and locker rooms, both during cleaning and opening hours. During the cleaning, the total volatile organic compound (TVOC) concentrations were low, on average 96, 251, and 91 µg/m 3 for locker rooms, bathrooms, and pool areas, respectively. Similarly, during the opening hours, the TVOC concentrations were on average 78, 125, and 83 µg/m 3 , for locker rooms, bathrooms, and pool areas, respectively. This is in line with previous studies investigating cleaning work in other environments. The most prevalent compounds during the cleaning were 2-(2-butoxyethoxy)ethanol (DEGBE), 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethanol (DEGEE), 2-butyl-1-octanol, trichloromethane (chloroform), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5 ), and carbon tetrachloride. The most prevalent compounds during the opening hours were D 5 , D-limonene, carbon tetrachloride (bathrooms and pool areas), and trichloromethane (bathrooms and pool areas). The TCA concentrations during the cleaning in the bathrooms and pool areas were on average 60 and 67 µg/m 3 , respectively, and during the opening hours, 28 and 122 µg/m 3 , respectively. The use of disinfectants was found to increase the TCA concentration in the bathrooms, while the other cleaning products did not. Even though the TCA concentrations were below the WHO’s guideline and the Finnish occupational exposure limit value of 500 µg/m 3 , the measured TCA levels were occasionally high enough to pose a risk of irritative symptoms. The PM concentrations were low, both in the real-time monitoring (aerodynamic diameter, D ae ≤ 15 µm) and inhalable dust samples ( D ae ≤ 100 µm). Highest measured inhalable dust concentration was 350 µg/m 3 , well below the Finnish occupational limit value of 5,000 µg/m 3 for organic inhalable dust.",

These simulations represent one possible scenario of the event, utilizing the RETRO wildland fire emission database. Emissions from the fires dominate the atmospheric concentrations of O3, CO, NO2, and SO2 creating many possible exceedances of the Indonesian air quality standards. The scenario described here suggests that urban anthropogenic emissions contributed to the poor air quality due primarily to the fires. The urban air pollution may have increased the total number of people exposed to exceedances of the O3 1-h standard by 17%. Secondary O3 from anthropogenic emissions enhanced the conversion of SO2 released by the fires to $ {\\rm{SO}}_4^{2-}$ , demonstrating that the urban pollution actively altered the atmospheric behavior and lifetime of the fire emissions. Under the conditions present during the fires, volcanic SO2 emissions had a negligible influence on surface pollution.",

A health risk assessment was conducted to determine the probability of developing carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic effects for four age groups. The hazard quotient (HQ) for manganese was &gt;1 both indoors and outdoors for the four age groups in all residential areas, indicating a risk of developing non-carcinogenic health effects. The HQs of Cr (VI) displayed a similar trend for all age groups; it was &gt;1 in all residential areas except for outdoor environments at New Sicelo. The highest HQ (25.6) was found indoors at Old Sicelo for the 21–35 age group whereas the minimum (8.3) was found indoors at Noldick for the 36–65+ age group. When using the overall concentrations, the HQ was &gt;1 only for Mn and the highest values were recorded at Noldick. The cancer risks for chromium (VI), cobalt, and cadmium were above the upper limit of 1 × 10 −4 and the lower limit of 1 × 10 −6 when considering indoor and outdoor concentrations. When considering the overall concentrations, the cancer risk for cobalt was &gt;1 × 10 −6 and that of chromium (VI) was &gt;1 × 10 −4 . Urgent intervention is required, particularly given the negative health effects associated with Mn exposure. Graphical abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract This paper aims to assess the impact of individual measures for NOx emission reduction on NO 2 concentrations at very high spatial resolution in an urban district of Madrid City (Spain). A methodology based on a set of Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations for 16 meteorological scenarios combined with the CHIMERE model for background pollution is used to obtain annual NO 2 concentration maps. Two scenarios included in the Spanish National Air Pollution Control Programme are investigated: NOx emission reductions from the installation of more efficient boilers for domestic heating (ECOBOIL) and from the partly substitution of passenger cars with combustion engines by electric cars (EC). This analysis is extended to 9 additional scenarios of more ambitious implementation of electric vehicles in order to determine what the NOx emission reduction required for the annual mean NO 2 concentration EU limit value not being exceeded is. The ECOBOIL scenario has a very weak impact on the NO 2 concentrations. However, the EC scenario implies a more significant reduction of the NO 2 concentrations, but not enough to fully remove NO 2 limit value exceedances in the study area. A small additional (compared with the EC scenario) implementation of electric vehicles seems to fulfil that the spatially averaged NO 2 concentration be lower than the EU limit value, but the area with exceedances is still very large. However, stronger traffic emission reductions (80%) corresponding to the most ambitious scenarios are needed in order to reach that at least 95% of the domain is free of EU limit value exceedances.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The sensitivity of air quality model responses to modifications in input data (e.g. emissions, meteorology and boundary conditions) or model configurations is recognized as an important issue for air quality modelling applications in support of air quality plans. In the framework of FAIRMODE (Forum of Air Quality Modelling in Europe, https://fairmode.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ ) a dedicated air quality modelling exercise has been designed to address this issue. The main goal was to evaluate the magnitude and variability of air quality model responses when studying emission scenarios/projections by assessing the changes of model output in response to emission changes. This work is based on several air quality models that are used to support model users and developers, and, consequently, policy makers. We present the FAIRMODE exercise and the participating models, and provide an analysis of the variability of O 3 and PM concentrations due to emission reduction scenarios. The key novel feature, in comparison with other exercises, is that emission reduction strategies in the present work are applied and evaluated at urban scale over a large number of cities using new indicators such as the absolute potential, the relative potential and the absolute potency. The results show that there is a larger variability of concentration changes between models, when the emission reduction scenarios are applied, than for their respective baseline absolute concentrations. For ozone, the variability between models of absolute baseline concentrations is below 10%, while the variability of concentration changes (when emissions are similarly perturbed) exceeds, in some instances 100% or higher during episodes. Combined emission reductions are usually more efficient than the sum of single precursor emission reductions both for O 3 and PM. In particular for ozone, model responses, in terms of linearity and additivity, show a clear impact of non-linear chemistry processes. This analysis gives an insight into the impact of model’ sensitivity to emission reductions that may be considered when designing air quality plans and paves the way of more in-depth analysis to disentangle the role of emissions from model formulation for present and future air quality assessments.",

Wind tunnel and tracer studies show that noise barriers mitigate the impact of this pollution up to distances of 30 times the barrier height. Data from these studies have been used to formulate dispersion models that account for this mitigating effect. Before these models can be incorporated into Federal and State regulations, it is necessary to demonstrate their applicability under real-world conditions. This paper describes a comprehensive field study conducted in Riverside, CA, in 2019 to collect the data required to evaluate the performance of these models. Eight vehicles fitted with SF 6 tracer release systems were driven in a loop on a 2-km stretch of Interstate 215 that had a 5-m tall noise barrier on the downwind side. The tracer, SF 6 , was sampled at over 40 locations at distances ranging from 5 to 200 m from the barrier. Meteorological data were measured with several 3-D sonic anemometers located upwind and downwind of the highway. The data set, corresponding to 10 h collected over 4 days, consists of information on emissions, tracer concentrations, and micrometeorological variables that can be used to evaluate barrier effects in dispersion models. An analysis of the data using a dispersion model indicates that current models are likely to overestimate concentrations, or underestimate the mitigation from barriers, at low wind speeds. We suggest an approach to correct this problem.",

    "abstract": "We first examine characteristics of in-cloud sulfate chemistry of a mid-latitude convective cloud using a different model initialization. Specifically, we studied the relative importance of convection on sulfate aerosol transport and redistribution. The analysis is focused on 4 April 2000, when considerable dust transport is evidenced with high concentration and wet deposition of sulfate aerosol measured at the European Monitoring Environmental Program (EMEP) station located in the western mountain part of the Republic of Macedonia. The cloud-resolving model coupled with aqueous sulfate chemistry module has been employed to simulate the sulfate aerosol aqueous chemistry and wet deposition. The modeled results and sensitivities under various initializations are evaluated and compared with a ground-based measurements and laboratory analysis. The results indicate that the local environmental profiles derived from 2.5 km-scale WRF model provides a better cloud model initialization, capable of realistic representation of sub-grid-scale processes which are not adequately resolved by the WRF model with a coarser grid resolution. The method also shows a relatively good performance in simulation of cloud physical processes which take place in-cloud and the near cloud environment, cloud-chemistry interactions, relevant to sulfate acidification and sulfate deposition, which allows a more accurate quantitative assessment of sulfate concentration and pH values. Analysis also indicated that scavenging and oxidation are the principal processes affecting sulfate production, participating with 33 and 46%, respectively. Turning off the ice-phase processes leads to overprediction of sulfate aerosol production for about 8% relative to the base run. The verification analysis indicates that the numerical simulation initialized with a 2.5-km-scale WRF model shows a higher correlation coefficient with observations compared to other runs. This approach of initialization based on WRF conditions provides a scientific contribution by evaluating simulations of convective clouds in Macedonia against ground-based meteorological and chemical data, as well as by using the model to understand the driving processes affecting sulfate production and wet deposition.",

    "abstract": "The inactivation time for the SARS CoV-2 virus, mostly by a portion of UVB spectrum (290-315 nm) in sunlight, has been estimated using radiative transfer calculations and a relative wavelength sensitivity virus inactivation action spectrum ALS. The action spectrum is adjusted for the SARS CoV-2 virus using a derived UV dose D90 = 3.2 J/m2 for 90% inactivation to match laboratory results for the inactivation of SARS CoV-2 virus droplets on steel mesh. Estimation of the time for 90% inactivation T90 at a specific geographic location can be simplified using the commonly published or calculated UV index (UVI). The use of UVI has the advantage that information on the amount of ozone, the site altitude, and the degree of cloud cover are built into the published UVI calculation. Simple power-law T90(UVI) = a UVI b fitting equations are derived that provide estimates of T90(UVI) for 270 specific locations. Using the results from the 270 locations, a generalized latitude θ dependence is presented for the coefficients a(θ) and b(θ) that enables T90(θ, UVI) to be estimated for 60°S ≤ θ ≤ 60°N and for noon and 2 h around local solar noon.The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s11869-021-01099-3.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Despite recent achievements in reducing the contribution of road traffic to air pollution, agreed pollutant standards are exceeded frequently in large parts of Europe. Previous studies assessed the effectiveness of traffic interventions in improving local air quality. However, little research exists on the effect of closures of short road sections over longer periods. The multi-week maintenances on the Theodor Heuss Bridge, the main connection over the river Rhine between the German cities Mainz and Wiesbaden, offered the opportunity to investigate its effect on local air pollution. We measured ambient concentrations of major air pollutants and meteorological parameters at the Theodor Heuss Bridge before, during, and after its closure on 800 m in early 2020. We carried out time-series and closure-dependent evaluations of pollutant concentrations at the bridge accounting for wind direction. Furthermore, we performed regression analyses accounting for wind speed additionally. We compared the results with data from surrounding monitoring stations. We recorded higher concentrations at the Theodor Heuss Bridge compared to outside the closure, especially for particulate matter, nitric oxide, and black carbon. Only with wind from specific directions, we could detect reductions of concentrations during the closure for many pollutants as nitrogen dioxide (− 9.8%; 95% confidence interval: − 10.8– − 8.7%), but not for particulate matter. Since we found similar meteorology-dependent pollution reductions during the closure at both the bridge and the surrounding monitoring stations, we assume that regional meteorological factors overlaid a potential closure-related effect on local air quality. These factors must be accounted for in accountability studies on interventions focusing on short roads.",

They are both subject to (sometimes dangerous) chemical substances and fluctuations in environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, relative humidity). In this paper, we report on a measuring campaign which lasted more than a year collecting data about the air quality within a painting studio of a higher education institute. An existing algorithm assessed the indoor air quality for heritage objects using international air quality standards. This contribution presents a new algorithm to assess indoor air quality for human health relying on thresholds imposed by legislation and recommended by reference institutes. This algorithm has been applied to the same measuring campaign. The assessments illustrate that the same environmental conditions have a different impact on canvas paintings, panel paintings, students, and staff. Air quality is thus a relative concept that depends on the object/subject that is considered in the analysis. Graphical abstract",

    "abstract": "Abstract This study aimed to investigate the causes of contrasting ozone (O 3 ) trends in Spanish O 3 hotspots between 2008 and 2019, as documented in recent studies. The analysis involved data on key O 3 precursors, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), among other species, along with meteorological parameters associated with O 3 . The dataset comprised ground-level and satellite observations, emissions inventory estimates, and meteorological reanalysis. The results suggest that the increasing O 3 trends observed in the Madrid area were mostly due to major decreases in NOx emissions from the road transport sector in this urban VOC-limited environment, as well as variations in meteorological parameters conducive to O 3 production. Conversely, the decreasing O 3 trends in the Sevilla area likely resulted from a decrease in NOx emissions in a peculiar urban NOx-limited regime caused by substantial VOC contributions from a large upwind petrochemical area. Unchanged O 3 concentrations in other NOx-limited hotspots may be attributed to the stagnation of emissions from sectors other than road transport, coupled with increased emissions from certain sectors, likely due to the economic recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, and the absence of meteorological variations favorable to O 3 production. In this study, the parameters influencing O 3 varied distinctively across the different hotspots, emphasizing the significance of adopting an independent regional/local approach for O 3 mitigation planning. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the causes of contrasting O 3 trends in different regions of Spain, which can be used as a basis for guiding future measures to mitigate O 3 levels.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Common fragranced consumer products, such as cleaning supplies and personal care products, emit chiral compounds such as limonene that have been associated with adverse effects on human health. However, those same compounds abound in nature, and at similar concentrations as in products, but without the same apparent adverse human health effects. We investigated whether different types of limonene may elicit different biological effects. In this study, we investigated the mortality rate of mosquito larvae in response to changes in their environment. Specifically, we tested different sources of naturally occurring R-limonene and chemically synthetized limonene, containing one of its enantiomeric forms (R-, S-) in mortality bioassays with Aedes aegypti mosquito larvae. We found that a natural source of limonene extracted from oranges induced lower mortality of mosquito larvae compared to synthetic sources at the same concentration. However, enantiomeric forms did not differ in their effects on mortality. Our results provide novel evidence that natural sources of a chemical can cause lower rates of mortality than synthetic sources.",

The calculation algorithm was constructed using statistical parameters of particulate matter lognormal distribution, with the use of Hatch-Choate equations and the Maynard method, and extended by the accumulation stage physics of PM1 fraction, including Eggersdorfer's and Pratsinis's findings. Introduction of structure and dynamics of fractal-like agglomerates into the calculation algorithm significantly increased estimation accuracy of surface area concentrations, in relation to the standard Maynard method, which calculates surface area concentrations of only spherical particles.",

Furthermore, particle exposure has been shown to have a chronic inhibitory effect on lung development in young people and may result in increased respiratory problems in adults or children with respiratory-related diseases. In today’s urban environments, particle levels are mainly monitored gravimetrically; however, other factors such as particle size, shape and surface reactivity have recently been noted as highly important in relation to possible health outcomes. Here, particles from TEOM monitor filters placed in three different cities were studied. The purpose of the study was to investigate whether there are variations in particle masses, cadmium and lead contents, as well as endotoxin levels between locations and time points over the year and if this can be correlated to the particles ability to induce a pro-inflammatory response in vitro. Results showed that it is possible to detect variations at different locations and at different time points over the year and that cadmium, lead and endotoxin levels did not coincide with the increased total particle masses while endotoxin levels coincided with pro-inflammatory responses in vitro. The present study shows that filter analysis is a useful complement to gravimetric or particle-counting measurements in studies of particle-related health effects and will give useful information regarding future air quality measurements.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Air pollution poses a risk for people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). This study estimated the short-term effect of variations in air pollutant concentrations on exacerbations of COPD (COPD-E) in Bogotá, Colombia. Methods We performed an ecological time series study from 2014 to 2021 to evaluate the short-term effect of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), and ozone (O 3 ) levels on COPD-E treated in the emergency and hospitalization services. Daily counts of patients with COPD-E discharge diagnoses were obtained from the National Health Information System, and daily measurements of PM 2.5 , NO 2 , and O 3 concentrations and meteorological data were obtained from air monitoring stations. A Generalized Additive Model was used with Distributed Lag Non-Linear Models to control for confounders. Results An increase of 10 μg/m 3 in PM 2.5 and O 3 was associated with increased COPD-E admissions (lagged 0-3 days) with Relative Risk (RR) of 1.04 (95%CI: 1.02 -1.07) and RR:1.03 (95%CI:1.01 – 1.04), respectively. During the rainy season and minimum temperature of the series, for every 10 μg/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 concentration, COPD-E admissions (lagged 0-3 days) increased with RR 1.03 (95%CI: 1.01-1.06). A higher magnitude of association was observed in men (PM 2.5 , 1.04 95%CI:1.01 – 1.06 and O 3 , 1.04 95%CI:1.02 – 1.05, lag 0-7 days) than in women. Conclusions A higher air pollution was associated with more COPD-E. These results highlight the importance of actions aimed at improving air quality. Graphical Abstract",

The results of the model simulations carried out using the two parameterisations are compared, in terms of both mean concentration and concentration standard deviation, by evaluating some statistical indexes and trough scatter- and qq-plots.",

    "abstract": "Abstract The purposes of this study were to evaluate the bulk sample concentration and airborne concentrations of phthalate in different types of propellent and triggers in consumer spray products and estimate health risk assessment via inhalation. First, the phthalate concentrations were analyzed in the solutions of all products 174 from markets. Then, among 64 products containing phthalates, 10 propellant-type products were selected that contained high phthalate concentrations; airborne concentrations were measured at distances of 1, 3, and 5 m from the spray nozzle in a clean room. Four phthalates were detected in spray products: diisobutyl phthalate (DiBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBzP), and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Among propellant-type products, repellents contained the highest mean concentrations (3.90 ppm), whereas sterilized products contained the lowest mean concentrations (0.59 ppm). Among trigger-type products, cleaning products contained the highest mean concentrations (4.54 ppm), whereas coating products contained the lowest mean concentrations (0.73 ppm). In both propellant- and trigger-type products, DnBP and DEHP exceeded the standard set by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety of South Korea. No significant patterns were observed for the airborne DiBP, DnBP, and DEHP concentrations at 1, 3, and 5 m (p &gt; 0.05). Children were one of the population groups most susceptible to health risks. Overall, phthalates were detected in both product solutions and the air in consumer spray products; some even exceeded safe limits. Therefore, consumer spray products should be used in well-ventilated areas to avoid respiratory exposure.",

In this study, we recruited a total of 343 motorcycle taxi drivers in Bangkok and adjacent provinces in Thailand and their lung function parameters were analyzed using spirometry in May and June 2022. Of these, 153 participants were selected and their exposure to respirable dust during working was measured by personal air sampling. Respirable dust concentrations collected with personal air sampling suggested that motorcycle taxi drivers working at workstations where they were exposed to respirable dust at high concentrations tended to have a low percent predicted FEV 1 . Twelve% and 7.3% of motorcycle taxi drivers recruited in this study had the symptoms of chronic bronchitis and acute bronchitis, respectively. These results suggested that some motorcycle taxi drivers around Bangkok and adjacent provinces had a high risk of occupational exposure to ambient air pollution. The government needs to establish a medical check-up system for motorcycle taxi drivers to monitor their health status.",

This article reviews the impact on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), the most common degenerative motor neuron disease, of exposure to BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene), aromatic hydrocarbons capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, with documented neurotoxic effects. Results show that occupational exposure to BTEX has been linked to the incidence of ALS, while the relationship with the exposure in residential environments with high levels of these toxins in outdoor air is not conclusive; sources of BTEX emissions often lead to mixed toxic exposure, making it challenging to assess the specific impact of this group of pollutants. Under the commonly accepted hypothesis that ALS is a disease triggered by the accumulation of multiple steps, BTEX could be the step causing toxic insult, or alternatively, BTEX might play a role in the disease’s progression. However new studies are necessary to determine its involvement in the disease.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic of Coronavirus diseases occurred in the Republic of Korea from 19 January 2020. By March 2020, Korea had reported the second largest number of Coronavirus patients in the world. On the anniversary date (2021), however, with a 51.3 M population, Korea has had 73.115 K patients with 1.283 K deaths, and this stands at 86th in the world. On average, Korea has 14.3 patients per 10,000 people. Air-parcel trajectory analysis and airflows show that in the general westerly region, air parcels and pollutants could flow out and in all directions. This suggests initially that Coronaviruses from source areas in China could transmit to many sink regions and sectors including 228 subdivided counties in Korea. However, there were only relatively small numbers of Coronavirus patients in western sea sides of the Korean Peninsula in comparison with large numbers of Coronavirus disease patients in cities and in eastern sides. In particular, three counties in Korea, including Ong-jin, Mooju and Chang-heung, have zero patients of Coronavirus diseases. This suggests that a long-distance transmission of Coronavirus from Wuhan and other infected cities in China to western Korea likely did not occur. Moreover, there was no evidence on the potential transmission of Coronavirus from neighboring large cities to the above-mentioned isolated counties in Korea which are only 10 ~ 50 km away. In the biosphere, during the transmission stage, the inactivation of Coronavirus by UV rays appeared to occur effectively in 30 ~ 120 min, in agreement with the result of satellite and modeling studies. In turn, the air transmission of Coronaviruses and pollution from China and neighboring cities in Korea apparently had no impact to cause Coronavirus diseases at the 228 counties in Korea. The infection and spreading of Coronavirus diseases to other people in Korea mainly appeared to occur in confined indoor air environments. With the absence and lack of UV rays in indoor environments, Coronaviruses would be active there for hours or days longer than in the outdoor environments.",

    "abstract": "Abstract Poor indoor air quality (IAQ) can adversely affect children’s health; however, limited studies have quantified indoor air pollutants in day-care centres (DCCs) where infants and young children are increasingly spending more time from a younger age. The aim of this study was to investigate seasonal IAQ in Western Australian childcare facilities at both heavy traffic and low traffic locations. In 22 centres, total volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde, nitrogen dioxide, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide, particulate matter (PM) measured in six size fractions (total PM, PM 10 , PM 4 , PM 2.5 , PM 1 , ultrafine particles), and meteorological parameters (temperature and relative humidity), were continuously sampled over a 24-h period, in the cold season and repeated in the warm season. All contaminants (other than formaldehyde) in the summer and/or winter collections, or averaged over both seasons, were found to be above contemporary air quality standards, guidelines, best practice statements, or other available guidelines developed to protect human health. Furthermore, all contaminants were present at higher concentrations indoors where a DCC was located within 100 m of a heavy traffic roadway. The findings of this study suggest that children who attend these facilities on a regular basis may be chronically exposed to a range of health damaging contaminants during critical stages of their development. The findings support the need for measures to reduce concentrations of air pollutants in DCCs. Preventative actions such as attention to DCC siting, selection of appropriate building materials and furnishings, improvement in ventilation, and usage of ‘green’ cleaning products should be considered to reduce children’s exposures to harmful airborne contaminants.",
